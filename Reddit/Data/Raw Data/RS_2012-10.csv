I am currently a financial burden on my family who has very little. 

I was recently in an accident that totaled my car. I bought a $900 dollar car (that was all I could afford) only to have it break down needing a new engine. I have about $400 dollars right now and I can get rides to my internship from my dad. I hate wasting his money for gas and I live at home eating my parent's food. 

$250 a month in loans are coming and I have a better paying job lined up that can get me out of this situation and I convinced them to give me 12 days before I start.
To be able to work there I'll need a reliable car and reliable computer. My parents' work schedule won't allow them to get me there on time.


**Skills**

I am a college graduate with a PR and Graphic Design degree. I have experience working in IT (why I love reddit) and I can teach swimming since I swam in college. I have a DLSR 5100 camera and photo/video skills. Will do any manual labor if that's what's needed. 

**I will work day and night. I will shovel poop. Whatever I can.** 

I don't think this is an unreasonable number, and if this produces any results I will post with the progress at the end of the 10 days. 

*Additionally, I am sure I am not alone in the post college struggles and any advice will help us all.*


**TL;DR- I will do anything to make $5,000 in 10 days to make things better for me and my family. What should I do?**

**EDIT: also wanted to add this bit:

This can be through the means of working many-many hours a day (manual labor sounds like the surest bet, although I'm not sure which route), participating in contests, eating rice and chicken alone, and even by selling some stuff. **"

I dunno how many of you have run into this, but in a recent application for an internship one of the boxes to fill in their form was 'Minimum Pay' (per hour) (i.e what's the lowest you'll go). 

**How the hell are you supposed to answer that question?**

Based on some searches in GlassDoor and talking to a couple of people who've worked at the company, I know what they pay. Obviously, there's a bit of game theory here:

If I way lowball it, then they'll think I don't value myself or my work terribly highly.

If I give them the wage I know they pay interns, I run the risk of looking expectant.

If I give them a higher number, I think I'd come across as an arrogant fool.

I'd rather not disclose the company information, but for reference the wage they pay is *highly* competitive, more than triple minimum wage in the state they're based out of."

I've been doing NoFap on and off since June and started strictly doing it mid August.  Doesn't sound too peculiar but there are some interesting variables that I'd like to hear everyone's opinion on.
     This summer my girlfriend of nearly 4 years and I broke up(both 22).  It was rough.  She took an internship across country and we slowly faded from each other.  The first 3 years of the relationship were quite tumultuous and had extreme lows and even higher highs.  But this past year she began to fade from me and neglected me emotionally as I sank further and further into depression.
     I've always looked at a little porn here and there.  It was really nothing extreme and very infrequent.  But when all this began to happen with my girlfriend, I became hooked on ""tube"" sites and spent drastically more time watching porn and masturbating.  Before this period I would only masturbate a few times a month as we'd be having regular sex.  The sex began to dwindle and I noticed my performance going way down along with a little ED.  This further added to my depression and the strain between us.  
     Our relationship became shittier and shittier until she left for her summer internship.  We had a slight re-invigoration but it ultimately failed and she broke up with me one sad, lonely night in July.  At this point I had already discovered NoFap and had gotten it down to a few times a month.
     Then I stopped completely.  I met a girl in August who was really into me.  At first the sex was great because my balls were about to burst, but eventually I lost all sexual drive completely which I found very strange.  She left for a week or two, in which I thought I'd recover, but I didn't really.  So at the end of August I began to flat line like a mother fucker.  
     All September I didn't masturbate (and still haven't) and have been consistently flatlining.  It's fucking terrible.  I ended up seeing this new girl again about 2 weeks ago and I performed less than spectacularly and even so had to struggle to get it up.  I've never had any real feeling for her and have essentially been using her as a rebound (which I feel bad about).  This is important to where I'm going with this.
     Here's the strange part.  I saw my ex-girlfriend, whom I still love dearly and can not for the life of me get over, shortly after this.  We had a heart to heart and ended up hugging each other with a slight kiss.  I became rock hard almost instantly.  We're not getting back together so we didn't have sex, however (damn!).
     So there are a lot of confounding factors in this little NoFap experiment of mine.  I think it's a combination of rewiring my brain to respond to porn as well as a lack of real intimacy and feeling that have caused my ED/sex woes/whatever.  I don't have any particular question in mind for the NoFap community, but I thought it was interesting and wanted to share and hear opinions.  I'm still flatlining...badly... but it seems to be getting a bit better.  I'm thinking the random sex with this new girl has slowed down my recovery a bit.  I still my ex terribly too, but that's a post for a different subreddit.

I'm a MS level Mechanical Engineer currently doing product development in a large oilfield service company in Houston. I was in the Middle East in the field prior to this, but before that I had a more research based background in thermal engineering and microelectronics in grad school and internships. I did my undergrad at Berkeley, so I know how awesome the Bay Area is and really want to get back into that techie Silicon Valley environment and mindset.

I've cultivated an electromechanical skillset: not quite automation, not quite design, but some combination of designing parts and then developing and programming test fixtures to run experiments on them. Other than programming and design software, I also have a good amount of experience in CFD tools and some in FEA. I'm still early in my career, so I'm open to all avenues of advancement(manufacturing, design, reliability, even some customer engineering depending on product). I do like the sort of work I'm doing and would probably like to expand on my programming side, which I'm developing more through stuff like Udacity and Coursera. I just want to work at a place that builds things I'm more interested in. Oilfield just isn't cutting it as a motivator.  

I would love to work in some sort of alt energy related firm such as solar, battery, even nuclear. For example, Tesla would be a dream job, but a long shot with my current background. I'm also interested in electronics and high tech companies. In general, I'm just ready and rearing for a challenge and excited to learn if it's in the pursuit of something important or novel. It'd be great to work for a small startup, but the only interviews I've gotten so far are with larger industry names so I'm fine with breaking into the biz that way.

I'm a Junior majoring in Petroleum Engineering with a bad GPA, but otherwise good resume. Can anyone offer advice on how to secure an internship for the summer when I don't meet most of the GPA cutoffs?",[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/10ru2y/im_a_junior_majoring_in_petroleum_engineering/,"My major is actually Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering but that was a little long to put in the title. I go to one of the top engineering schools in the country (top 15).

I have a 2.3 cumulative GPA. I did poorly my freshman year and only a little better my sophomore year. I kind of got ripped off (even though I know it is all my fault) because all of my bad grades (about 4 D's) were in 3-4 credit courses and I missed a C by ~1% for each course.

I desperately need an internship this Summer and am worried because it seems that most companies will not even take a glance at your resume unless you meet a certain GPA. Besides my GPA I have relevant work experience and have many good leadership roles in various clubs. My school is one of the most recruited engineering schools in the country and has a career system where you upload your resume/transcripts and companies list what they are looking for. However, they won't even allow you to apply unless you meet their cutoff.

So, my questions:

1. Are there any other good websites/resources that list companies looking for petroleum engineers that let you apply on their website?

2. Now that I am a junior I am finally in the courses within my major. I am working very very hard this semester and hopefully will get ~3 GPA for this semester. Is it considered lying/bad to apply to companies using my GPA within my major as my GPA when I apply to companies in the Spring? I was thinking on my resume I'd put ""GPA Within Major: X"" and leaving out the cumulative GPA.

3. When I apply now, should I still include my 2.3 GPA on my resume or just wait until they ask for it? I read that if you have a bad GPA it is optional to put it on (as of now it is not on my resume), but I feel like it is different for engineers.

4. I know that most internships are given in the Fall, and I have also heard that once you apply to companies, if they do not accept you, you have to wait a year to apply again. Is this true? And if so, should I just wait until the Spring to apply to the companies I really want to work for (assuming I get a good GPA this semester)?

5. I talked to multiple engineering companies that seemed interested in me, however they were not petroleum related. I really want an internship in a petroleum company, but should I still apply to all of these general-engineering internships? Would it be better for my future career to have an internship at a respected company that is not focused on petroleum engineering, or to intern at a small, more unknown oil company?

6. Anyone need a hard-working petroleum engineer? (Joking, but not really)..

If anyone has any advice whatsoever I would love to hear it because I am really getting worried. Sorry for the long post!!"

 Yes classmates, I can participate in your extracurricular where we just all focus on academics again, but I need to have a social life and bond with others outside. Thats why I was ok with going out to town to hang out with my 'bros' all the time and pull all nighters, resulting in lack of sleep.  I realized early on that this school has a huge bubble of focus and high stress surrounding which is why I escape it every weekend. I also refuse to join your club because I cannot give it the time it deserves and I feel like you guys are better off without me. I will support you guys in the competition, but my priorities aren't the same as yours.

And please stop saying that I am dumb for taking on unpaid internships.  I view them as opportunities to learn and take risks in a safe environment. My bosses support me with this decision as I m not pressured to be risk adverse and not be able to grow.  And yes, I do understand the ramifications of me traveling this summer instead of working in an office like the rest of you all. 

I now realize why I left engineering in the first place and did a job in education. It's because I wanted to do my own thing, create and be in charge of my own life.  Yes, I came back, but that's because I now have a stronger heart and understanding of why I am here. 

While it is tempting to do the things you guys are doing, I just need to do my own things, in my way. I'm still getting stuff done, and yes I may not getting perfect marks on my homework and tests.  I believe as long as I'm learning from my mistakes, I am still growing. 

I am grateful I am here and learning the stuff I am doing. And I realized that while this stuff comes easy to you all, I am developing myself in my own ways.  I am not here to spit out equations after equations, but to understand how all of this works in industry. Yes I am jelouse that this stuff comes easy to you all, but in my travels this summer, I met this girl who made me think and realized that the fact that I'm putting the effort into this indicates my passion and love for this subject. 

 I had a great year and wouldn't trade it for the world, but seriously if you think I'm not taking my studies seriously because its not my only priority, I'm starting to not give a fuck anymore. The only damn I give is that you were in my groups and felt like I wasn't there enough, i would have that been said that to me at some point so that I could have fixed that. However, I do not think putting everyone in the same room so that we could write a paper together on a laptop screen is not an effective use of my time. "

I am currently a financial burden on my family who has very little. 

I was recently in an accident that totaled my car. I bought a $900 dollar car (that was all I could afford) only to have it break down needing a new engine. I have about $400 dollars right now and I can get rides to my internship from my dad. I hate wasting his money for gas and I live at home eating my parent's food. 

$250 a month in loans are coming and I have a better paying job lined up that can get me out of this situation and I convinced them to give me 12 days before I start.
To be able to work there I'll need a reliable car and reliable computer. My parents' work schedule won't allow them to get me there on time.


**Skills**

I am a college graduate with a PR and Graphic Design degree. I have experience working in IT (why I love reddit) and I can teach swimming since I swam in college. I have a DLSR 5100 camera and photo/video skills. Will do any manual labor if that's what's needed. 

**I will work day and night. I will shovel poop. Whatever I can.** 

I don't think this is an unreasonable number, and if this produces any results I will post with the progress at the end of the 10 days. 

*Additionally, I am sure I am not alone in the post college struggles and any advice will help us all.*


**TL;DR- I will do anything to make $8,000 in 10 days to make things better for me and my family. What should I do?**

**EDIT: added camera to exp. and also wanted to add this bit:

This can be through the means of working many-many hours a day (manual labor sounds like the surest bet, although I'm not sure which route), participating in contests, eating rice and chicken alone, and even by selling some stuff. **

10rt0x,1,2012-10-01,Stuck in a country that I don't like,clustergouda,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/10rt0x/stuck_in_a_country_that_i_dont_like/,"This is something that has been eating away at me every day for the past 2 months or so.

I'm currently living abroad in a country, where I went to college. It was never my intention to stay here after I graduated because of a couple of things: 1. I don't speak the damned language (which I don't even like. I took one semester of it and just hated it) 2. Majority of the people don't speak English  3. I don't like the people in this country 4. It's difficult to find employment and to get a working permit 5.Its even more difficult to find a place to live 6. Its really expensive.

Then during my second last semester of college I just had to fall in love with a girl (Lets call her Lauren) who went to the same school as me. Lauren was in her first semester so it would be a while until she would finish school. Things got really serious with her and I fell head over heels in love with her and she with me. Then of course I decided to stay and find work here until Lauren would finish school.

Things seemed to work out well, I found a job at a company that didn't care for me speaking the language and this September Lauren went back to school.

I started my job in July and since the first day it was a nightmare. My employer didn't take care of my work permit application which led to problems for me in finding an apartment. Finally I had to take care of my own application procedure and find an apartment which is now registered to the company, not me.

The company itself turned out to be a complete nightmare as well. I have no idea how it has survived thus far. We are 4 employees and all of us are planning on leaving (Well, one of them is an intern and will finish in less than a month anyway). The company is an empty shell with a run down owner/manager that is running it. He is completely full of himself and tries to micromanage everything when he is in the office. Thankfully, he travels a lot.

My work contract is for 6 months so it terminated this december, which I am super grateful for. Still, I need to find a new job ASAP to be able to stay in the country. Me and my girlfriend dont believe in long distance relationships so if something would happen and I would have to leave the country then the relationship will be over.

Every day that I go to work I feel like I die a little inside. I hate my boss and I hate my job. I hate this country and I hate the hordes of white wannabe gangster teenagers that I see every day hanging out on every street corner and area with a bench. I hate not having any buddies to hang out with any more like I used to. 

But I love my girlfriend and I will keep on trying to find a new job like I have been doing these past weeks. I will keep on enduring my stupid pompous asshole boss until I tell him that I will not be resigning my contract with his sorry excuse for a company.
I will keep doing this even though I only get to see my girlfriend on weekends, because it is still worth it. I truly believe that I will never find anybody like her if I should lose her.

This felt really good to get off my chest. Thanks to anybody that read this, I hope that it provided some sort of entertainment!
If anybody else is in the position where they find themselves stuck geographically because of relationships then know this: there is someone out there that knows EXACTLY how you feel

10rszd,0,2012-10-01,"I'm a Junior majoring in Petroleum Engineering with a bad GPA, but otherwise good resume. Can anyone offer advice on how to secure an internship for the summer when I don't meet most of the GPA cutoffs?",[deleted],AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/10rszd/im_a_junior_majoring_in_petroleum_engineering/,"My major is actually Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering but that was a little long to put in the title. I go to one of the top engineering schools in the country (top 15).

I have a 2.3 cumulative GPA. I did poorly my freshman year and only a little better my sophomore year. I kind of got ripped off (even though I know it is all my fault) because all of my bad grades (about 4 D's) were in 3-4 credit courses and I missed a C by ~1% for each course. 

I desperately need an internship this Summer and am worried because it seems that most companies will not even take a glance at your resume unless you meet a certain GPA. Besides my GPA I have relevant work experience and have many good leadership roles in various clubs. My school is one of the most recruited engineering schools in the country and has a career system where you upload your resume/transcripts and companies list what they are looking for. However, they won't even allow you to apply unless you meet their cutoff.

So, my questions:

1. Are there any other good websites/resources that list companies looking for petroleum engineers that let you apply on their website?

2. Now that I am a junior I am finally in the courses within my major. I am working very very hard this semester and hopefully will get ~3 GPA for this semester. Is it considered lying/bad to apply to companies using my GPA within my major as my GPA when I apply to companies in the Spring? I was thinking on my resume I'd put ""GPA Within Major: X"" and leaving out the cumulative GPA.

3. When I apply now, should I still include my 2.3 GPA on my resume or just wait until they ask for it? I read that if you have a bad GPA it is optional to put it on (as of now it is not on my resume), but I feel like it is different for engineers.

4. I know that most internships are given in the Fall, and I have also heard that once you apply to companies, if they do not accept you, you have to wait a year to apply again. Is this true? And if so, should I just wait until the Spring to apply to the companies I really want to work for (assuming I get a good GPA this semester)?

5. I talked to multiple engineering companies that seemed interested in me, however they were not petroleum related. I really want an internship in a petroleum company, but should I still apply to all of these general-engineering internships? Would it be better for my future career to have an internship at a respected company that is not focused on petroleum engineering, or to intern at a small, more unknown oil company?

6. Anyone need a hard-working petroleum engineer? (Joking, but not really)..

If anyone has any advice whatsoever I would love to hear it because I am really getting worried. Sorry for the long post!!"

I am unsure of whether I'd like to go to law school or pursue a ph.d in sociology. My professors have all encouraged me to pursue a ph.d as I'm pretty damn good at researching and theory and I have a great shot at getting into a top program (pending a decent GRE score). I've been researching in a law for over two years.

On the other side, my friends and family have also thought I'd end up going into law. This was my original thought upon entering college, and I'm still interested in the idea. But, alas, I'm interested in the ph.d too.

Basically, I plan to take the LSAT in February. I have some intern experience at a law firm already, with my GPA and super nice letters of rec, I figure if I get &gt;170 I have a shot at the Top 5 law schools. I'd only go to law school in today's economy if it was a super top school.

In sum, if my LSAT score is good enough, I'll go to law school, if not, I'll get a ph.d. Stupid? Probably.

Ps. I legitimately enjoy schooling and would probably prefer some type of graduate school over anything else."

For those 3 years we have lived together. For the 1st year it was because my parents kicked me out when I was 18 for being gay. The second year was because she needed a place to stay. Finally to this year because she had some mental issues and wanted to live with me. Okay, pre explaining almost over.

She went to Seattle for 3 weeks over the summer for a dance internship. She came back and explained to me she was questioning our relationship. I'm okay with that, I think thats healthy. So everything went on as normal. We didnt break up I was just more cautious to her needs and wants and such. Fast forward to this last week. She broke down and asked me if we can just be friends. I said ""I can be, but I would rather be your gf."" So she said she's confused but she loves me yada yada. I'm almost to the point here. Stick with me.

So I have a jealousy problems. I have had many problems in this relationship. Not with the relationship. I used to be very needy. After she got back from Seattle I had 3 weeks by myself and I worked a lot of stuff out. Got hobbies, friends, my own stuff going on. Obviously though, I still want to spend time with her. So im not perfect, obviously.

We eventually came to the agreement that I would leave for a few days or a few weeks or whatever. Whenever she decides to let me back in my apartment that I pay for because she has no where to go. Yet again, I have no animosity, I want her to figure this out. I was supposed to leave yesterday. She was supposed to be having dinner with her grandparents. We accidentally met up at the apartment and she instantly said how glad she was to see me. She started holding my hand. She kissed me. She wanted to spend time with me and she said she wanted me to spend the night.(we didnt have sex, that would have been way too confusing.)

Finally my questions! What the heck does this mean? Shouldnt she have been questioning things in like the 1st year of the relationship? If she just wants to be my friend why does she keep doing these things that speak otherwise? My last question, how long should I wait. It hurts to get pulled around like this. I was going to move across the country with her, I love her. I dont understand what she wants from me. I'm doing the best I can. 

Thanks for the help.  If you need more info I can try to explain better. I'm not great wit dem werdz."

My problem is that I am never happy with the code I write and it has started driving me crazy. I've been working on a side-project for the last 6 months. This past week I was fantasizing about introducing RequireJS to the project because of all the perceived order it would introduce. I went ahead and started doing so -- maybe 15 hours of work over the weekend, but at the end of it all I had found other 'code smells' in my project which were making the implementation of RequireJS not as 'pretty' as I had hoped.

Now I'm back in the same boat as before I had introduced RequireJS except, now, I am thinking of all the 'issues' with my code that don't fit nicely into the AMD Module pattern, ugh!

I really want my project to go somewhere. I am the only one working on the code and the code is good enough for me to understand without getting tied into knots, but I struggle with adding features because I am too obsessive over looking for the 'perfect' implementation of code.

Today was the end of month 1. We've lived together for 2 years now and I'm so depressed. Her work keeps her busy, she's happy, and she even met the VP. However, I'm suffering from insomnia, my grades show it and I don't socialize much to distract myself. Her work keeps her busy almost 24/7 so phones calls are very short and stressful. I even found out that she took up smoking. We both considered it a major dealbreaker. We very honest with each other so she told me that she's developing feelings for a coworker. I appreciate that she told me but I have no idea how to keep us remembering that we have a life together. Any support for a young LDR couple?"
10r5yf,18,2012-10-01,"I'm considering a career change.  Assuming I can dedicate 40hrs/wk to it, what do I need to be doing over the next 6 months to become a professional screenwriter?",BrianBoyko,Screenwriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/10r5yf/im_considering_a_career_change_assuming_i_can/,"I may be losing my job, but have stock-options and severance so finding a new job isn't an immediate concern. If I were to change careers it would be to be as a screenwriter.

I've been a marketing communications manager (re: copywriter) for 7 years, have an M.A in Journalism. I've written - and gotten paid for - short narrative scripts, but only in conjunction with my established position. (i.e., I'm on salary.) I'm an indie filmmaker as well, currently working on co-producing a Latino coming of age film, and though I've edited the script, I didn't write it. So I know about shots, compositing, etc.  

What do I need to do *now* to make screenwriting a full-time, viable career option in 6-12 months? I may be able to devote a full 40hrs/wk to it for at least 3 months.  I currently live in Austin, Texas, though I am willing to relocate to NYC or Southern California (Southern cali preferred).  I'm also willing to consider going to film school.  University of Texas at Austin has a screenwriting MFA, but it takes two years, and they only accept 7 people per year.  

One program that looks interesting is the UCLA Professional Program in Screenwriting (Online.)  It can be done in an academic year, costs only $4500, and I do not have to relocate.  I may even be able to start immediately.  

http://www.filmprograms.ucla.edu/index.cfm?action=os_pps&amp;side=os

$4500 is CHEAP compared to a 2-year Masters program.  So, I'm interested in that, surely. 

To be specific, my goals are:

A) To be able to make at least $3500/mo before taxes screenwriting.  That's what I need to keep the mortgage paid, the belly full, and the parents happy I can visit them for Thanksgiving.  
B) To be eligible for WGA membership

Keep in mind, this is a *career change* first and foremost.  I don't have a ""great story I need to tell.""  Hell, I find I do much better when someone else has the story and they just want me to make it nice and gussy it up.  I think I'd do well doing book adaptations.  

-------------------

**UPDATE**

Okay, this plan isn't feasible.  Which is what I came to find out.  

My new plan is to finish up some things here in Austin, then in January, head to LA for three months to take the UCLA film production classes.  While there, I'll try to get some sort of internship or PA job or something, and take the classes at night.  I'll return to Austin on April 1, 2013, and re-evaluate my plans. Next September, I'll take the online screenwriting class, but with no other pretentions other than becoming a better, well-rounded filmmaker.

Its really been depressing me that I can't find a job so I'm turning to reddit to help me find one. I'm not looking for money, I'm from a rich family, but I want to live my own life right now and having no job isn't helping, I'm prepared to move to any part of the world, flip burgers, whatever (honestly I got turned down from a burger flipping job for being over qualified)

I kind of know why I'm not finding a job though, its because I cut and run at my internship (Worked at Johnson and Johnson / DePuy). I was trying to get into med school, i had flunked the entry test, so I quit to retake the test but after a while I found out my grades just weren't good enough to get into medical school (off by about 5-6% overall), so I'm just looking for any ideas on what to do, its 6AM here and I havent slept all night, I'm 22 and living with my parents, which really sucks and has depressed me into even having suicidal thoughts at times, I only leave my house to go to the gym and then just come back, apply to jobs, or watch tv on my computer or go on reddit. 

I've already posted my qualifications I'll post a little ""about me""
I'm a cool guy, excellent liar (I guess might come in handy if CIA is recruiting), honest and open to the right people (bit of a contradiction but oh well..), multilingual, speak english, hindi/urdu and sindhi fluently and I'm okay at german. Interests include, bodybuilding, fashion, guns, science. I don't know any programming etc, but I'm okay at MRP/ERP software like alliance MFG and SAP.

I'll edit if people want more info, this just feels pathetic now :(, any other sub reddits I should post this to? I'm hoping someone on reddit works for a company looking for mechanical engineers or something, I dont have high expectations, I'll work any job as long as I have food on the table and roof over my head, preferably many miles away from here.

First, **the bad:** I am officially broke. I couldn't even get a 6 inch sandwich from subway today for lunch, that's not even $5, and that's how broke I am. I'm currently jobless and have never had a job...ever. It's also my first year at college and I'm a little overwhelmed by all the paper-writing I have to do. I suck at papers.

**The Good:** Luckily I live with my grandparents and they are willing to give me a little money if I really need it, as long as I get a job and pay them back. I've applied at a ton of places for a job, and my aunt knows the managers at a Panera Bread nearby. She says I'm almost guaranteed a position since they're hiring like crazy and shes been really talking me up to them. I had an interview with the assistant manager yesterday, and another with the ACTUAL manager tomorrow.[](/ppfear)I'm nervous as fuck. I'm so shy and bad at interviews. 

I also got an internship with a travel agent for Disney. My biggest dream right now is to become an animator or some sort of artist for disney, so I'm pretty excited, even if this internship is just cleaning up the website and stuff. The person I'm working for is an older woman and gets overwhelmed and confused trying to figure it out, and I'm a graphics major right now. 

and,  **the interesting!**
Some brony guy who I'm kind of friends with, and is quite a few years older than me has been flirting with me hardcore and it's getting to the [](/facehoof)point of being awkward and uncomfortable and I don't know what to say to him. He knows I have a boyfriend and I don't particularly want to be mean or ruse, I've tried to give him a hint that I'm not interested but he just keeps going at it. 

Anyway, thats all, guys. I'm just super stressed out and it's preventing me from drawing. Well, the stress and also a bad case of artblock.

I feel like I was always good in school, but somewhere along the line I got left behind, because I'm unemployed, and the more time that passes the more I feel like like my value diminishes, as graduate with no experience (not being a recent graduate, but just a graduate who never got a job). My student loan grace period is ending soon, and if I get some random retail job to make ends meet I feel like my engineering dreams will be over before starting. I just want to hear if anyone went through something similar, and how you responded. Or any tips, thanks in advance.

What am I doing wrong?,[deleted],marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/10u5cm/any_marketing_people_here_preferably_from_europe/,"I'm trying to secure a paid internship that could lead to a job, or even better, an entry position, limited contract or not, doesn't matter.

I've been sending out resumes, filling up application forms and answering a lot of questions, taking tests, everything, and I've never even been called to an interview. It's been over 400 resumes now, and only rejections.

I don't know what I'm doing wrong, and I'm wondering if anyone working in the marketing industry could take a look over my resume and maybe tell me what's wrong with it, or how should I go about applying for a job.

Background story:
Male, 23, B.Sc in Marketing and Communication Science with a minor in Business Economics from a not so reputable university. Also, a M.Sc in Management, Media and Communication Science from a top 100 University, one of the best in Scandinavia.

I've done 3 Internships and worked part-time since then until recently for an Austrian company in the recycling field. I've been handling their marketing plans, building of the communication strategy, implementing it. They have successfully penetrated the Eastern European market with my help.

I speak 3 European languages fluently and can understand Spanish.

I'm trying to get a job in the UK - but I've been applying everywhere, regardless of the country.

Please, take a look over my resume, and walk me through the normal procedure in applying for a Marketing Assistant/Officer/Executive position, or for a trainee/intern position.

This is my resume: http://i.imgur.com/UVcN4.jpg
Other than my resume, I'm presenting myself in a rather profesional and organized manner on all the social networks, and on about.me and re.vu, also on resumup.com. They are in perfect sync, presenting the same data, checked and double checked everything for spelling errors and for anything that could make me look bad.

My cover letter usually looks like this, with modifications depending on the company: http://i.imgur.com/Kuejd.jpg

I know this is a long shot, but who knows maybe the right person will see this. I have an account on Career Center, and I've been going to the job fairs, but a lot of the hiring work places are too far away from me. 
I'm looking for a place within 10 miles of USF, and I'm available to work anywhere from 15 - 30 hours a week.

I'm tired of working a mundane cashiering job and would love to work in a company where I'm gaining experience and using learning for the career I want. The ideal opportunity for me would be to intern for a while and once I graduate, get promoted to a full time position. But, I'm okay with a temporary internship as well. 

I have a good GPA (3.35) and I have a lot of drive to do well in my field, once I know what to learn I will go all out making sure I can do the best I can. So if you or anyone you know is looking for a quick-learning dependable intern, shoot me a message and we can discuss it further. Thanks!

Edit: I have experience with Java (It's been a while since I've used it), C# and C++, I've taken Data Structures and am learning Algorithms and Operating Systems. I've taken many more classes, but I find these are the most relevant and what I've learned the most in!"

I won't put any preferences or prices here, to gather a larger option pool.

I'm also checking on OCH and Craigslist.

I am a senior, 22 years old.  I intend on being a part-time student with a job and / or internship for next semester.  I do not smoke cigarettes, but I do enjoy drinking.  I cook for myself, have close friends, but generally stay in my room or the kitchen when not doing anything else.  I'm active on campus (Terrapin Trail Club, multiple service organizations), and in some off-campus organizations (ECO City Farms, local park service).  I can party well, but also appreciate quiet nights.  I've dumpstered in the past and will probably go with my friends who are still going.  I bike to school, and will most likely have a car.  I am a pretty active person all around; I backpack and hike, exercise daily (cross training, run, bike, walk), and practice yoga.

I am a fairly recent graduate (2008) from Western New England College with a BS in Electrical/Computer engineering. 

For the past three years I have been working as a Field Applications Engineer here in MA, employed by a leading edge enterprise class SSD design/manufacturing firm based out of California. My job responsibilities included providing our local customer with onsite analysis of any production or customer failures as well as maintaining and presenting weekly updates of root-cause failure analysis efforts. I was a primary point of contact between our design/production/manufacturing engineering teams and the customers' qualification/quality engineering teams, driving product and manufacturing improvements.

Prior to this position I held several internships, where my responsibilities included conducting FMEA tests, testing circuits to determine points of failure, calculating component deratings, and participating in ""first unit teardown"" analysis, inspection, and reporting.

Through my education and employment I've gained beginner/intermediate level skills including: 

* Matlab
* MathCAD
* C/C++
* VHDL
* RTL	
* Assembly Language 
* Solidworks
* MS Office

In addition to the aforementioned skills, I have always been a quick learner and would love to continue my education to improve upon any of these (or other) skills necessary in a future position.

Moving forward, I would like to enter a field which will allow me to incorporate my personal passions for mechanical and electrical systems into my career; possibly working with control systems in the aerospace, automotive, or biomedical/biomechanical industries. Depending on location, I may be willing to relocate for a position, however I am primarily interested in employment in any MA/NH/S.ME locations. 

Please feel free to contact me for a more comprehensive/detailed copy of my resume.

However, I do not come from a target school. I go to a regional campus of a well known university and I feel as if that may hold me back from being taken seriously. I also have an economics and management degree from another local regional campus.

My favorite math areas so far have been financial mathematics and probability/statistics, so my idea was to pursue a Msc in Quantitative Finance. I plan on taking some Actuarial exams while in grad school since some of the studies is relavent. And this way, I am marketable in other areas in case I can't find employment as an actuary.

Anyone have any opinions on this matter? Just looking for some advice as I'm feeling a little lost."

This went on for two months (12 people were almost fired including a guy who was 6 months shy of retirement). I eventually wrote a letter and she was sent to a another site. Let the stories flow!"
10tcw4,0,2012-10-02,"Imagine an election with no turnout.  Theoretically possible.  But is it possible to make a greater impact as an individual by not voting?  Plus, K-12 teachers and professors: what do you tell your students? ",Puppetfart,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10tcw4/imagine_an_election_with_no_turnout_theoretically/,"Yes, it is. But only if you tell someone that you didn't do it and why you didn't do it. Don't just don't do it.

I'm not voting, because we are living in a country that subtly condones oppression, internet censorship, and media and corporate-cloaked leadership. 

Let me put it this way.  Why did Arnold win in CA?  People like him.  Why did Ronald Reagan win the presidency? People liked him.  I think it is sad but true that a kid's best bet at making it into the oval office as a President and not an intern is by first becoming a movie star.  Seriously though, this is not that off base of an assertion.

Do you agree that the public school system in the U.S. has accidentally or inadvertently taught numerous generations of students that the right (or the privilege, as the case may be) to vote for the President is so important that ""not voting"" has developed into a frowned upon inaction?  Between students-peers?  Between teachers-students?  I know the School Board will not let you politicize discussion, but is that not what is really happening when our schools only talk about the most mainstream of ideas?  

Do you ever use arguments like, ""blood was spilled to protect freedoms like this get used to convince people to vote?

What do you cite as the most important reason to vote?  

What do you cite as the most important reason *not* to vote?

If you do not ever provide a reason to pupils to *not* vote, why not? 

Do you teach your kids the importance of voting (both equally for local elections and national?) 

Do elementary or high-school teachers ever explain what it takes to win an election?

Do you ever ask your kids whether they think ""Gerrymandering"" is something we should be proud of, when in the last TEN YEARS, 78% of the seats in the U.S. House did not change party hands even once.

Is it more important to vote locally?  

Can students decide on a career of leadership?  Have you ever thought about offering a political leadership reform class, or proposing one to your Dean or Board?  Why not? Why?

A while ago when I first started working at the pharmacy a woman came in and was getting a script for her dog, so I rung her up and everything was fine and dandy and she paid but before she left she had a problem.

""This was supposed to be $8"" It was $11 ""I was quoted $8""
She got super mad and I tried to find out who had told her that price or what and she started yelling and finally an intern comes out and fixes it because HE was the one who quoted her the price (and at the time I didn't even know how to do that!!) I got no apology."
10t8ea,16,2012-10-02,"Planning on taking the UCLA professional Production course (10 wks, $4500) in January - slew of questions.",BrianBoyko,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/10t8ea/planning_on_taking_the_ucla_professional/,"Howdy. 

I had some ill advised plans about moving to LA, but I've scrapped those.  I still want to give it a good try, though, so I'm planning on taking a 3-month sabbatical (i.e., I may not have a job, but I'll have enough money to do this and no kids/dogs to feed) to go to LA and take the [UCLA professional program in film production](http://www.filmprograms.ucla.edu/index_pr.cfm?action=pr_ppp&amp;side=pr).  It's a 10-wk program (intensive) for $4500.  (Beats the hell out of getting an MFA!)  

I'm already working on producing films with a co-op here in Austin, and we should wrap up by January, so the advice of ""skip film school, make movies"" - yes, I've done that, thank you, but I want to see if I can't make the leap to the next level with a little formal instruction.  Besides, the course will also include the finance side of the business, which is something I'm going to have to learn if I want to go pro. 

Anyway, I had a couple of questions:

* Has anyone taken this course, and if so, what do they have to say about it?
* The course is three nights a week, 7-10pm.  Is it possible to get a PA job or internship while I'm there for some extra hands-on experience?  
* Alternatively, would it be feasible to produce a small no-budget film in the LA area?  What sort of risks/rewards does this entail?  If they've got a compelling story, experienced people, and a good plan for renumeration, I don't mind being a (very) small investor - maybe $5k. (I wouldn't be the only, or primary investor, but that kind of money will at least feed a film crew &amp; talent, I think.) 
* This may be a question for /r/FilmIndustryLA but, how do I go about making friends and contacts in the industry.  I'm kind of a dork (think Sheldon from Big Bang theory, only I'm a freakishly smart liberal arts guy, not a physicist), and I've heard ""fitting in"" is really important in LA, as opposed to a town like Austin or San Francisco. 
* Finally, where are safe, (relatively) inexpensive neighborhoods (relatively) close to the UCLA film school? 

Thanks! "
10t6h1,11,2012-10-02,I'm trying to get a regular volunteer gig that could help get me relevant work experience. The two I like most require three references.

Due to mental health concerns and a privileged upbringing, work was not really on my mind until recently. It increasingly looks like it would be a healthy addition. 

My psychiatrist yesterday brought up the idea of work to help provide structure and make school easier. In the past couple months, I had already been on the lookout for stuff- the things that would be most helpful to my post-education path have obvious volunteer gigs. Gigs lead to internships, internships lead to you get my point.

I found two, but both had the same issue- three references needed. One gig has a deep character/trust component- so I can't fake an acquaintance.

My current references are a professor who rather liked me, and my parish minister. I can't for the life of me think of someone (family and friends are excluded).

I don't mean for this to be a pity party, rather I'd like to know if some other people have had reference issues. Being intelligent is a great quality, but without some networking it's hard to put to use."
10t27n,1,2012-10-02,Why can't I figure out the root of my failures?,the_guy_overthere,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10t27n/why_cant_i_figure_out_the_root_of_my_failures/,"Recent college grad here, currently going through the whole career-seeking/""holy crap I ruined my life going to college for nothing because I'm in debt and have no job to show for it"" phase. Companies don't seem to be too interested in engineers (which I'm not) and IT professionals (which I'm not). I have a degree in business administration, but my concentration is soft of a halfway house between computer science and IT (as in, I can do both, but nothing too in-depth with either). My skills are best suited to an analyst role and/or consulting role but nobody is looking for anyone in that field apparently. I've tried everything I can think of to break through- applying as a CS guy, an IT professional, an intern, an analyst... nothing. I've been networking as best as I can within my means, yet nothing has turned up. I've tried going through many recruiters. I've tried cold-calling but was rewarded with a cold trail. To date since graduation I've applied for nearly 150 positions and I've had a grand total of 6 interviews- none of which went anywhere. More often than not I'll get a dreaded ""we appreciate you applying but we picked someone we like better"" email (and during from one of the interviews I confirmed that the company had not in fact found anyone for the position and it is still open to this day), or I just never hear from someone again.

I didn't get any internships or things like that in college because I wanted to ""get in and out"" ASAP to hit the workforce and nobody told me that was a bad idea. My grades weren't stellar, but then again nobody ever even asks because apparently I don't even make it pass the screening phase most of the time (I've never even had someone bring up my GPA during an interview). My resume is fine. My interview skills are amazing, according to my university's career center, my peers, and the recruiters that I have worked with to get feedback about my appearance and whatnot. My peers, past supervisors, and professors all say that I am a good candidate. While being interviewed I don't notice any signs of dislike or anything like that from the interviewers. I follow up with everyone I talk to as soon as possible. When I'm turned down I ask for feedback (haven't gotten any yet). I honestly have no idea where I'm making mistakes and I am now severely regretting going to college, but I'm too proud/confident/arrogant to just give up and settle for a job I didn't even need to college for as I currently have.

Is the lack of relevant experience from college what's preventing me from getting even an entry-level job (which I was pretty sure the whole ""entry level"" bit meant that my schooling should have been enough)? Is it the college I went to? My degree choice? Am I ugly? Is it race/height/weight/financial or marital status/gender/place of origin? Is it because I don't have a 4.0 GPA to boast about? Was everyone I prepared for this day with just lying to me about how well I interview and sell myself? Am I unable to network efficiently? Was I simply born at the wrong place at the wrong time to the wrong family? How do I find out why I'm being pushed aside so I can fix it? I know it's not good to appear as desperate but I'm beginning to fear that my frustration and desperation may begin to effect my performance- this is the only thing that has managed to stress me out to this point in my life!

**Tl;dr- What am I doing wrong and how do I fix it? Am I just doomed?**

**UPDATE**
So what I'm seeing from the responses is that some didn't really read much (including the Tl;dr); the people I used to evaluate my resume building and interview skills probably lied to me; and that I'm just unlucky. Where do I go from here?"

One of my first customers of the day was a real peach :D But seriously, she came and got a script for her son and was PISSED about the $15 copay. Turns out there was something wrong with her secondary insurance and we couldn't call them to fix it because it was Sunday. We asked her if she wanted to just take the medicine and come back tomorrow and we'll refund her the money, no she wants a three day supply for free. We cant,do a three day supply for free she has refills, her stuff is not expired, and one insurance is already covering it. ""This is ridiculous every time I come here its a problem, last time I was here for 45 mins because you needed a prior authorization"" We dont need it the insurance company does, and guess who's causing the problem today? Thats right the insurance company. I guess she got away with us givimeg her the script for nothing and hoping the insurance would work out tomorrow. 


On Sundays the pharmacy closes at 5, at	4 when people drop of their new scripts we remind them that we close at 5 so be back by then. So at 5 in walks Ms Krabs, the needs 3 scripts refilled one if which is  something called ergocalcifier, but is really vitamin D. Ms Krabs, like most people takes her ergocalcifier once a week and gets four pills a month, sweet deal. I  set her refills up and she asks where she can find some over the counter merchandise and I show her and keep it behind the counter for her to get with her scripts because I'm just so nice. All if this was at about 4pm about 4:20 her scrips are processed and ready to go but lo and behold, the insurance won't let the ergocalcifier go through until 10/1 (tomorrow) cool we'll tell her when she gets back 4:45 she's not back, I page her. 4:55 we're swamped with last minute waiters and pick ups, 5:02 she's back and extremely lucky  we were so busy and didn't close, I get her stuff together ring her up and send her along because it was so hectic we're ask ready to go. ""where's my vitamin d?"" Oh I forgot to tell her insurance wing y let it go through until tomorrow ""Thats bullshit!"" That's the insurance company again! Those rascals! "" I took the last one today!"" Me forgetting the nature of the drug and how you take it "" I'll see if there's anything we can do but we're closed"" as the rest of the staff waits with,their coats on and keys out outside of the gate. ""that was the whole point if this trip out here to get this!"" One of the interns explains what we can do, nothing, and sends her away. I remember a we're walking out she took, the last one today but she only takes that once a, week, she put up a huge fight so she wouldn't have to come back later in the week, really? 

And that's why you should always pay attention to closing hours, pick up dates, and over head pages. True story"

10sp0k,4,2012-10-01,Career over Family?,unsupportivethrwaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/10sp0k/career_over_family/,"Hi r/relationships,
Sorry for the wall of text, but I appreciate any outside opinions that I can get. Basic information:
Him: 26 
Me: 25 
Together for 5 years, married for 3.


I'm a military wife. I met my husband the summer before my junior year of undergrad. Shortly after I finished up my degree (in CS), we got married. The decision came up which base to go to next. I really wanted to go to a base on the west coast, where there were a ton of entry level jobs. He wanted to go to a base on the east coast, where jobs were sparse in my field. In the end, we went to the base he wanted. 


Our new location was not ideal for my degree. Occasionally a senior position would pop up and I'd apply anyway but I would never get a call back (understandably). I've since applied to countless jobs like secretarial positions (where I get told I over-qualify) to CS jobs (where I don't have enough experience). This has gone on for almost 4 years now and I have not been able to snag a job in my field despite my best efforts.


Lately I've been feeling more and more frustrated with the situation. Before I met him, I felt very career driven and wanted to be financially independent. When we got married I thought I was going to be able to balance both, but I very much underestimated how hard it would be to find a job at the military bases we got stationed to. This brings me to the root of my problem: I do have one other option and that is moving home.


My family lives in an area where CS is one of the best degrees to have. I'd probably still have to search a while to find a job (because of my lack of experience), but there are hundreds more entry level and even internship opportunities compared to where we are. They've offered to let me live with them, free of charge for at least half a year so I could get my foot in the door and hopefully have an easier time finding a job at our next duty station.


The problem is, my husband feels that I am picking my career/family over him. I've fully supported him with every career decision he's made, and now I feel selfish for wanting that same support from him. I know living apart isn't easy, but it would help us in the long run and I would hate to have invested so much money into a degree and never put it to use. He thinks I should just suck it up and get a job at any place willing to hire me, but I feel a bit prideful in that I've worked very hard to be able to get something better than just minimum wage. He knew when we got married that I did not want to be a housewife, but doesn't realize just how much not finding a job my field is killing my confidence and self-worth. I'm worried by the time we do get to a base that has my field, I'll have not put my degree to use for over 5 years. What I think I'm asking is this: Has anyone been through something similar? Is there a compromise in this? :(


TL:DR; After several years of supporting husband's career choices, I want to focus on mine, but husband is unsupportive of me going where the jobs are."

I am looking for a place to stay for the Winter quarter, and thought it would be a good idea to get a head start. 
Ideally I would like to sublease a place for just the Winter quarter, as I am not 100% sure of what my plans are for Spring quarter (may be going on a paid internship, or moving in with a few friends at that time) but I am not ruling out options if they are for a longer term. 


I would ideally like it to be a place off campus, since that usually means less expensive, and I have car/am not 100% dependent on RIT transportation. I would however really like it if the place is off campus, is also rather close since I would love just being able to zip onto campus instead of having a more substantial drive.


So if you are looking for a person to sublease/fill a spot, please read on. Or if you know of someone who is, I would greatly appreciate it if you could pass their name/possibly contact information onto me. 


Since finding someone to sublease/fill a spot can be a little sketchy I'll give a little background of myself. I am a Criminal Justice major, and will honestly get along with pretty much everyone. I will be honest and say I might not become best friends with every person I meet, but I will always show respect and make an effort at being friends. I am a clean person, definitely not a neat freak, but I am more than happy to do my fair share of cleaning/upkeep of the place because I know how much having a room mate who slacks in the cleaning department can suck. I am typically on campus for most of the day, and will come back to maybe finish a little work before going to bed. Most weekends I will be out of town spending time with my girlfriend in Buffalo, but on the occasions that I do have friends over I'll be sure to check with you/any other room mates first. I'll also be sure that things don't get out of hand noise wise, especially when it gets a little later at night. I don't really know what else to say, I am just looking for a decently priced place to stay for the Winter quarter, will not be too picky about sharing a room if need be but I strongly prefer the idea of subleasing a room just for the one quarter. 


If you're interested/are looking for someone to sublease to, then feel free to contact me on here or give me an email that I could contact you through. Also feel free to contact me with any questions about anything that I might have left out!

The company only requires an unofficial one, so that is what I will provide.

Here is the kicker though, they also have file size limits of 250kb per file which is much too small for the pdf version of our official transcript which is 1.5mb for about 3 pages.

10wemr,6,2012-10-03,I [M--22] just broke up with my girlfriend of nine months [F--21] and want to know if I did the right thing.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/10wemr/i_m22_just_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_of_nine/,"**tl;dr** I [M-23] just broke up with my girlfriend of nine months [F-21] because I didn't feel cared about. She's very busy on an out-of-state internship and stressed, and part of it is my being too needy. I think she really does love me, but she seems like she isn't committed enough to the relationship. I'm not sure how much she cares or how much she wants me. I think she's confused on some things and I feel like I may have given up too easily, even though others said I put up with more than I should have. I'm wanting to know if I did the right thing.

I'll keep it as short as possible. It won't be very short.

We were together for nine months and broke up once before, for about five days. When we first started dating, we both knew she'd be going away this fall. I thought I'd give it a shot anyway, just in case we felt like keeping it going. She never led me on. I always understood it was a long-shot.

We had our issues. I had some issues with her. I didn't like the fact that she smoked now and then, because I thought it'd become more. I didn't feel comfortable with how close she was with guy friends. I felt like she was emotionally distant and often immature. She said shit while dating me that I feel like one shouldn't say in a committed relationship: ""I really want to date a girl some day."" Ugh.

But overall it was good. I dealt with it. I sucked it up and did my best to love her and be good to her. 

We broke up for the first time on June 30th, 2012. I asked if she wanted the relationship, and she said she didn't know. She decided she wanted to call it quits there, because she was focused on her career and didn't want us to blow up and deal with that while away.

Five days later we were back together because we wanted each other, and because she said she didn't realize how much she actually appreciated me. 

From then until she left, it was up and down for a while. It was good, then I was feeling bad about things and wanted to end it often. I felt that she wasn't giving me much of her time, even though she could have. She lived fifteen minutes away but I only saw her once or twice per week. I felt that she wasn't really trying. 

Then it got really good. I started hearing stuff from her that I never expected to. ""Hey, this is going to be difficult, this next semester. But if we can make it through, I really want to work on us."" One night she looked me in the eyes and I could see how genuinely important I was to her. I forgot what exactly she said, but it was probably the most serious, deep moment of my life. She was serious. She wanted me. She wanted us. She had progressed... evolved. She wasn't the purely career-driven, cold, uncaring businesswoman that I had first started being with. There was more developing. 

So she moves off. We almost never Skyped. I had to ask her to talk on the phone. She would mainly just do text messages. I felt like I had to beg for her attention. She was (and still is) really, really busy with a very serious internship. She's also under a lot of stress. I really don't even know how bad it is, but she says she almost never gets a moment alone.

I tried to be understanding, but I still felt like she wasn't taking what opportunities she had. 

I told her that I felt like I was the lowest priority for her. I told her I felt like she didn't care. I told her that I really wanted her and to be with her, and that I loved her. I told her I understood that I'm a bit more needy than average, and that she's a bit less. I was trying to get her to just fight me on that. I wanted her to convince me that she cared and to fight to keep the relationship. 

She didn't fight, though. She told me she wanted me and wanted to be with me, but that she's not surprised I felt this way. She just said, ""Yeah, maybe we should end it."" I didn't want to end it, and I told her this. We both thought about it for like a day. I felt so much better for getting it off of my chest. She told me she loved me. 

That evening I talked to my mother on the phone, and kind of just came to the realization with her help that I was more committed than she was, and that that's probably a good recipe for getting hurt. That basically, if she couldn't make me a priority when I was making her a priority, that it was a bad situation.

The next morning I told her this, and gave her some examples of things I'd do for her that she wouldn't do for me. She agreed. I said that if she can't make me a priority, that I wanted out. 

I can deal with the distance. I can deal with not feeling cared about, or not getting everything I want. But only if I know that it's temporary and situational, and that she's committed to me. That she wants a future and wants to work with me. I didn't need her to promise me that she would always be with me. I just needed to know that she wanted to legitimately try. I'm afraid that I may not have been clear enough on that last point.

I wish I could tell her these things now:

+ ""I love you. I feel connected to you in a way that I don't really feel like wanting to connect with anyone else.""

+ ""I wasn't asking you to promise me that you'd always be with me. I only ask that you'll make our relationship a serious priority, as important (but not more important, at least not now) as your career goals.""

+ ""I was honestly making an effort to be with you forever. I didn't think it would work. I was just *trying* for that. I wanted to know that you wanted to *try* for that too.""

Anyway, I told her that she can email me if she needs advice or someone to talk to. I also told her that I hope to try again with her in the future.

I learned recently that she may be accepting a job where I live. This was something that I had hoped might happen as a way to facilitate us being together. So I feel almost like the stuff that I'd wanted to happen was slowly happening with her in the way I'd hoped it would, except I fell off the train. 

In this relationship, so far, my patience has paid off. I felt like giving up many times. But when I didn't, things got better than they were before. She became so much more than I thought she ever would be in a relationship, even though she's not quite there yet. 

I generally feel like I did the right thing but I love this person and I'm worried about how she'll do without me. I think she does love me. I feel like despite our issues she makes a great match for me, and would only get better with time. I feel like I broke up with my best friend. She's seriously one of the best people I've ever met. She's brilliant and strong and beautiful. She's going to change the world. 

I just hope I'm completely over her before I start seeing her on the news for the great things she's doing.

I avoided posting this under my main account. I wanted to, because I wanted her to see it. I wanted to contact her. I wanted to reach out to her. I wanted to post something for her to see when she stalks my Reddit profile. But I'm not doing it. I'm trying to stay tough and move on. 

Did I do the right thing? My mother says I did. My friends say I did. Rationally, I think I probably did, but I'm not sure. Emotionally, even, I feel like I probably did. And I'm not just completely devastated over this, which to me indicates that maybe it wasn't really meant to be. But I don't feel so tough right now, and I don't trust myself. I'd rather have this issue between us fixed and be back with her than have a billion dollars.

10wclp,6,2012-10-03,"Sophomore in 4-year program on West coast, likely to graduate a year early. Looking for first internship and other experience.",rowtuh,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/10wclp/sophomore_in_4year_program_on_west_coast_likely/,"I'd come up with a more self-denigrating comment to start out, but it's not really that important: *Long time lurker, first time poster.* Moving quickly along.

I'll split this up into three parts, for current state, immediate goals, and long-term goals.

**Tl;dr at end of each** because I like posting my personal details online. (I'm even taking a security class. Clearly not picking up much from that.)

**So here's my story right now:**

I'm attending a fairly academically sound private university in Oregon, USA; I hear a lot of stories about how our CS graduates are really good at what they do (this is a pretty universal thing). There's only a couple dozen of us in the program in any particular year - Data Structures weeds out a lot of the pack.

However, the CS department generally lacks resources on getting internships. The only one is an alumni listserv, where I can send out emails looking for possibilities. I've sent one out and two responded; an alumn working at a major tech firm responded, as did another working in a biology-related company; I'm not sure how to present myself to these people.

I have never had employment. Not really. I've done work for people I know, and one time I worked at the state fair, but I don't have an official work history of any sort. I've never even been hired at McD's.

However, I am currently working under a senior software developer on a side project of his, doing smaller tasks for him such as ""set up an automated system for downloading the repository,"" and ""understand and write a short report on CORS.""

I have a 3.9 GPA (taken out to more digits, it's like 3.943 or something) over 41 credits. My professors generally like me, my classmates enjoy my help and conversation.

I'm currently enrolled in 3 upper level CS classes, including Data Structures and a 400-level Selected Topics. Also taking a lower-level CS class, an accounting class, and a low-level math class. Really enjoy it, to the extent that I'm entertained by academia. I really just want to start *doing* stuff.

Not sure how relevant it is, but I'm currently single (so, relatively speaking, I have a lot of time) and familiar with how my sleep clock works (I can bend the rules to get more time per day). And I've read a lot on time management. So, uh. Yeah.

tl;dr: Academically competent, no work experience except with my godfather on his off-work project. Would really, really like to start actually *doing* something with my life.

**Immediate goals:**

*I'm looking for an internship* (paid, of course; nobody gives unpaid internships). This is the crux of my question. I have no work experience, or ""official"" resources to get me in the door. I do know a couple of people who work at the previously mentioned major tech firm, though for different campuses. One is fairly friendly to me, to the point that I could probably sublet from him.

Also, I'd like a resource for getting started on Android app creation. I'm interested in creating something, and can probably get art assets from someone, I just need some depth-first list of things to do (""learn C# (and here's a link to the MS C# site), then learn ....""). I pick up ideas quickly, it's just hard to organise things into a simple sequential order when I'm not familiar with the topic.

This Summer and/or Spring I'll be studying for 3 CLEP exams. These usually take me about half a week of preparation plus 3 weeks of studying for a couple hours every evening, or if it works out better, 3 weekends of studying. These will give me 19 credits if I pass them. (They're general education.) With another exam the year after, I should be able to graduate after 3.5 years of school (where the final half-year is a single class, since I had to meet a pre-requisite, and I'm taking that this semester, and the courses in the CS school are on a 2-year plan).

tl;dr: Really want an internship, really want to work on Android (mostly for my own projects, not necessarily for others), going to more-or-less graduate next Summer (not this Summer).

**Long-term goals:**

Donate lots to charity. Starving African children, yo.

*(Sorry.)*

Run my own business - only as large as necessary, which for a good number of years, will probably be minimal, while training my team (myself) to be better engineer(s) and manager(s).

Do cool stuff with data interpretation, possibly artificial intelligence (due to high relevance to data interpretation, but also on its own merit) or robotics. The dream of game development on large teams is kinda meaningless to me, I'm more of an industrious type.

Be a robot. Beep boop mechanical arms.

tl;dr: Charitable, businessperson, transhumanism, data interpretation/artificial intelligence.

**Edit/s:**

My campus resume help is also extremely poor for the needs of CS students and engineers, and there's no resource on it for us. Anything out there?"
10walm,2,2012-10-03,"I want to be animator, but have no idea how to get there. Any suggestions?",Toast_zombie,animation,https://www.reddit.com/r/animation/comments/10walm/i_want_to_be_animator_but_have_no_idea_how_to_get/,"I'm graduating this summer with a Bachelor's in Fine Arts and I don't know what my next step should be. I've wanted to be animator or at least go into the animation industry since I was 15. After graduating high school I didn't have the money for out of state and the colleges around me didn't have any good animations programs at the time. (That's a lie, there was BYU, but I'm not mormon and this school itself does not appeal to me.) (I live in Utah, by the way)
Long story short, I wanted to first work on my artistic abilities before I went into animation. Now I have a problem. My fine art skills are pretty good, but I have basically nothing in terms of an animation portfolio. This means I have very little to show when applying for internships and I doubt I'd even be considered with what I have.  My plans are revolving around just trying for an internship any way, applying to a grad school for an animation degree, or taking a year off and building up my portfolio.
I understand Photoshop and digital painting, I have a teacher for 3D modeling, I'm trying to self teach myself in Flash, I will soon have a degree in Fine Arts. 
I have never met anyone who was in the animation business and could talk to me one on one about career options. Anyone out there know what I should do?

SUMMARY: I have a solid base in fine arts (anatomy, color, value). I have little to know skills in animation, but I know the basic concepts and learning how to do them. What should I do next for a career in animation?"

Undergrad Major: Anthropology, focus on cultural/societies. 
Overall GPA: 2.4
Major GPA: 2.6
No internships, co-ops, etc. I did not have the time nor finances to sacrifice for it. I worked two jobs while going to school full-time. I also lived in a location where such opportunities did not really exist. 
I had an independent study where I completed a 15 page research paper on a specific topic before graduation. 
I am doing nothing close to what I went to school for after graduating (but I'm sure most grads aren't). 
I graduated back in June of 2010. 

I'm considering going to grad school for an M.A. in Sociology with more of a focus on stratification and demographics. I also have a strong interest in an M.A. in TESOL. 

I actually emailed a department at a state university that I considered applying to, yet I'm starting to see no point in doing so. Here is their response to several questions of being considered if I were to do exceptionally well on the GRE in comparison to my GPA:

""We look at both GRE and GPA. We don’t use a sliding scale. If you have a GPA under 3.0 we can’t even admit you. The graduate school would have to approve it by petition, and our faculty rarely are willing to petition for that. The chances of someone with under a 3.0 being admitted are very slim. Our average GPA for admitted students is about a 3.65."" - Ohio State University Sociology Program Graduate Admissions. 

Keep in mind that this institution did not even have a M.A. program, only a Ph.D track program. I'm assuming their requirements are so high due to this. 

However, my concern is if I am going to run into this problem with most M.A. programs I apply to. I'd rather not apply out of state, as I really cannot afford the tuition and cost of moving. 

So, should I really even bother to apply?"

(without overstepping the mark),[deleted],marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/10w2eq/how_do_i_suggest_an_idea_to_the_business_im/,"So I'm currently on a short marketing internship at a local, but large and well established chain of high end hairdressers. Just a little background on the idea.

So far I've been given pretty basic jobs, which is totally fine by me and was expected because I'm really fresh faced. One task which has featured prominently for me is bombarding social networking pages, and seeking out student facebook pages to promote a large discount they run when students return to the city for new customers, and those who haven't been to the salon in a while. 

Students are a HUGE deal to them. Facebook likes, are omnipresent, looming over all those in the sitting in the office and are constantly counted, posted all over the place in huge font. 

However, today, I had to sit in on a meeting. I wasn't welcome, but they had nowhere else to put me to input sales figures. They asked my opinion a few times, and let me in the end, happy with my small input, sit and observe for a while. Turns out the salons aren't doing as well as in the past. 3 salons have closed, students don't particularly return as loyal customers after their first discount. 

The prices are a little out of the student budget, and the fact they only target students and young edgy types, with their styles, events and way they advertise (exclusively social networking sites). They are, in my opinion, missing out a big chunk of the market, and scaring them off, hell they scare me off for not being ""Young"" enough and I'm in my early 20s. They are missing out on those a little older, with careers and *disposable income*. A lot of students I know can barely buy beer, how the fuck are they going to be spending a weeks rent, regularly on their hair.

They totally ignore those probably 30-35+, I've heard from women in their 40s that they were given terrible old fashioned haircuts, and totally brushed aside, when they wanted to be modern and edgy themselves, just a little more age appropriate. They want to be in on the service they provide too, but they're being totally alienated. 

The salons edginess doesn't have to be compromised, being quirky doesn't have an age limit. But I think it would do well, in my normal work life I work in a retail sales in shop aimed at this age group, and I've seen the pitfalls, and got alot of feedback working on the front line, as to what they really want, usually feeling totally neglected by brands in the market. This is what got me interested in marketing.

So how do I suggest this to my employers without seeming like I'm a total ass who's at the bottom of the ladder, swaggering in like I own the place. I think it's a good idea, and I feel I can back it up. Even if it's just throwing the idea out there for them to consider way after I've left in some way. Or even if they shoot me down, that's cool too. Just, I think I've got a good idea dammit.

**TL;DR - I'm the office bitch, I'd like to suggest an idea based on an area I actually have personal experience in. Don't want to overstep the mark though**"

It all started a few years ago.  I was feeling pretty down about myself.  I decided that I needed to do something.  I was 360 lbs. and I hated looking in the mirror, having my picture taken, etc.  The first thing that I decided to do was to cut out soda from my diet.  That went pretty well I lost a good 10-15 lbs. in a short amount of time.  About eight to twelve months or so.

I realized that I need to do more because I was still very large.  So I joined a gym with my dad (who had the looks of a model by the way...not an easy thing to live with or up to at all)  and my brothers and I started going a little bit at a time a couple of days a week to get some excerise.  I would ride the recumbent bike for an hour and burn about 700 calories or so according to the machine.  I dropped about another 15 lbs. or so in about six months and hovered around 330 for about a year there.  In the summer of 2011 I had a full time job, plus an internship so I had about 5-10 days off total for the whole summer (which ended up being a convenient excuse to not go to the gym very much).

After the holidays in 2011 so about midway through January I decided I needed to up my days at the gym.  So I started to go four days a week with a break in the middle.  I would start to lift some weights on the machine and I would ride the bike for an hour.  I did that for a couple of months and lost about 10 lbs. or so but kind of plateaued. I decided to step it up.  I do have weak knees (big bone spurs that are a result of Osgood Schlatter's disease) so I was afraid to push myself, but I took the leap and stepped up to the elliptical for an hour.  I worked my way up so that I would be burning around 1100 calories in a hour (again according to the machine).  I did this and I was at about 290 and very happy with the way things were going.

At the beginning of the summer there was a weight loss competition at work that the ladies convinced me to join.  So I said well if I'm doing this I'm going to win the damn thing.  I upped my days to five days straight at the gym every day lifting weights on the machine and an hour of cardio on the elliptical.  Near the end of the competition (late July) the machine was reading a total burning of 1100-1200 calories every time.  I ended up losing about 15-20 pounds during the summer alone.

Now I needed more.  I didn't seem to be gaining any upper body strength, and the cardio was good - but it can only be so effective.  So I turned to the expert.  At the beginning of August I started to see the personal trainer at the gym. (I did my research and she checked out.  Also if you are thinking about doing personal training really make sure that the person you are training with has some sort of education -there are A LOT of unqualified trainers that get hired by gyms)  Since then I have been going to the gym six days a week, I have a wide variety of exercises that I do so it keeps things fresh and my body guessing.  I have been having a lot of great intense workouts and she haves my keep a journal of things that I eat using myfitnesspal.  This last week I officially passed the 100 lb. barrier and I weigh (depending of the scale) in the 255-260 range.  I am extremely pround of my accomplishment and the work that I put in.

My diet now doesn't really revolve around calories but I eat A LOT of protein, I try to minimize the ""bad"" carbs - grains, pastas etc.  I do eat those carbs but only whole wheat or whole grain and never at the end of the day.  Also I am told all of the time that I need to eat more fruit and vegetables (which I feel like thats all I eat aside from protein).  But I feel great now and I am working hard everyday.

That's all that I can think of so I'm going to stop rambling now.  Thanks for reading!"

improv-is-easy.tumblr.com/post/32733122163/advice-to-the-brand-new-comedy-person


I got a letter from a guy who is just starting out in the comedy world. And I don’t know much, but I know a few things. He wanted some advice, so I wrote him back. And then I figured I would just put this up for anybody who wants to read it.

So. You graduated from school with a degree in theatre/film with a focus in dramatic writing. Awesome. You’ve undoubtedly got a solid grounding in the classics, probably across genres. And I’m sure you have a ton of passion for your art. But you didn’t ask about passion or the classics — you asked for some advice about the comedy bidness.

I give you this advice with a few caveats:

1.) I’m 31 years old, almost 32. I only became financially solvent/independent as a result of my art/work very recently. And make no mistake —I’ve got me some credit card and student loan debt. In other words: comedy and writing haven’t made me rich beyond my wildest dreams. But they have given me a way to make a living.

2.) I don’t have health insurance. Personally, I think that’s important. And I tend to think that if people can afford health insurance, they are a Real Success (TM). So by that measure, I am not a Real Success (TM). But my therapist says I’m supposed to let go of that. Of course, she doesn’t accept health insurance anyway.

3.) I’m not the most successful person I know, not by a long shot. In other words, I’m not the be-all end-all of advice. I strongly encourage you to write to people who are way more famous and rich than me and ask for their advice, too. Sometimes they are actually willing to share it!

Alright, with that out of the way, here we go.

Be nice. This is the most important rule of all. Say hello. Make eye contact. Make an effort to remember names. These things matter. Yes, you should be nice for the sake of being a good person, but this is also a filthy craven ladder-climbing tip. That intern at UCB who is taking your credit card information down for your Improv 101 class? She’s gonna be the first pair of eyes on your “The Daily Show” packet one day. Or she’s going to be the assistant at the casting agency who determines where your headshot goes in the pile of hopefuls.

I try to be nice to most humans I meet. But right now I’m also remembering a time I was a meanie weenie to someone with whom I ended up working and interacting for years afterwards. I’ve always regretted how I behaved. Thankfully, I got to apologize, but we don’t always get that chance. It’s a small community. Be nice.

Being nice doesn’t mean rolling over and taking it in the butt (unless you’re into that, which is great!) from an “agent” who demands money upfront to look at your work. Speaking of which…

Never pay to play. If an “agent” or “manager” or “talent analyst” or whatever the fuck claims that you need to give them money before they look at your shit, tell them “No, thank you.” I’ve made this mistake in the past. It doesn’t get you shit, no matter how many people they claim they’ve gotten staff jobs on “SNL.” If connections could be bought by anything less than millions of dollars, we would all be super hooked-up. Also, I would be married to Joseph Gordon-Levitt and showrunning a program called “Kitten Time!” (Note: “Kitten Time!” would just be shots of me playing with kittens. It would run on HBO and win 18 Emmys.)

Move to Los Angeles, Chicago or New York if that’s at all possible and connect with a comedy community there. When I was hemming and hawing about moving to Los Angeles from New York in order to more actively pursue TV writing, my brother said, “Sara, coal miners go where the coal is. Move to Los Angeles.” I could tell you that your TV writing career could really take off in Detroit or Austin or Milwaukee, and if you’ve got the connections and the luck and the drive, I guess it’s possible. But that’s not where they make the coal, right? (Note: if you want to write for film or stage, there’s more flexibility. And you can be a book writer any damn place you please. But you want to write comedy, and I believe you’d still benefit from being in one of the three comedy capitals of the United States.)

I took classes at The PIT when I first moved to NYC. You can also try UCB or the Magnet. In Chicago, check out the Annoyance, Improv Olympic, or Second City. In Los Angeles, there’s UCB West, Improv Olympic West, the Groundlings, and much more. It’s how you can network, meet people with similar interests, and in some cases meet the folks who will one day hire you (this is a point my friend Rob Delaney made once, and he’s so right). These places don’t just offer performance classes — in many cases, they offer sketch writing classes or even TV writing classes. And you’ll make friends in a new city. Friends in a new city are a precious and wonderful thing.

Expect to put in years of work, much of it free, before you get a break. Now you may get a break faster than that, in which case, awesome! But be WILLING to put in the years of work. They don’t have to be super-painful years. For example, if you would dig having a well-paying corporate job and are willing to do the work that requires, go for it! It isn’t “selling out” to have health insurance and work in an office in a field unrelated to your dream. I know that may seem obvious to you, but sometimes I think artists get caught up in this idea that they need to have some kinda cool alterna-image to be a success. Not so. Most authors have day jobs. Even some folks with bestsellers still have “real” jobs. You haven’t “failed” if you’re not making a living off your art. You’ve only failed if you’ve given up on your art entirely because it’s not going to make you famous. If you love your art, you’ll do it no matter what. Even if you can only afford to devote an hour to it a week.

Know that your life may look different than your friends’ lives, and be okay with that. I struggle with this sometimes. You’re a lot younger than me, and you’re a dude, which changes things a bit (some of it’s biology and some of it’s society, and I accepted it a long time ago.) For example, you don’t have to worry about your biological clock running out while you throw yourself into your career. That is AWESOME and you should cherish it! Your friends may get married and have kids before you do, but that’s okay. Your kids, if you choose to have them, will be happier with a creatively-fulfilled dad than with a dad who is full of regrets that he never went for his dream. Even if you fall short of your goals, you can still say you went for it, right? Plus, if you are a successful comedy writer, you can probably hook your kids up with cool shit like tickets to the Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards, which will earn you endless points.

Write fan letters. This kinda goes back to my earlier point. I received endless affirmation and validation when, as a beginning stand-up comic, I wrote to a famous comedy icon and she posted my letter on her blog. Don’t be afraid to tell people you think they are awesome. Don’t be afraid to ask them for tips. Just don’t say to anyone, ever, “How’d you get that?” It’s the most annoying question in the world and it implies that “getting that” (a spot on a house team at UCBT, an Emmy, a book deal, a date with Christina Hendricks) was the easiest thing in the world and that it required zero work. Most great success comes as a result of a combination of things: hard work and luck. I heard someone say once, “The luck doesn’t show up unless the hard work does.” And the tale of the hard work is often really long and winding and sometimes super-boring.

You will meet everybody at least twice. Remember that letter I wrote to that famous comedy icon? Her manager’s assistant read it. A few years later, I wrote her another letter, and guess who read it? The same person — except now the assistant had moved up to be the manager. I included some links to my work, and she watched them and liked them. She was on tour with her client, and she emailed me to ask if I’d like to come see the show at Radio City Music Hall. Of course I said yes. We met up backstage, arranged a time to have brunch, and eventually I became her client, too. You just never know.

Study. One of my most successful friends in comedy also has a near-encyclopedic knowledge of his favorite TV shows and stand-up routines. When I first started doing comedy, I sat down with DVDs of Cosby and Carlin and Bruce and Cho and Silverman and Bamford and Oswalt and Murphy and watched for hours. It helped me figure out what I wanted to do and say.

Remember that sometimes dreams change, and that’s okay. I used to want to be a kickass successful professional stand-up comic. Over time, my dream changed to something I’d wanted to do since I was a little kid — write books. And then that dream expanded to writing and producing for television.

Alright, that’s about all I’ve got. I hope it helps. Congratulations on completing your degree! Now write write write and write some more, and don’t stop writing until you’ll said everything you want to say. Break all your legs!

Love,"
10vskx,5,2012-10-03,I could really use some advice...,[deleted],AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/10vskx/i_could_really_use_some_advice/,"So here's the deal. I met a girl back in August by complete chance. It was one of those rare coincidences that definitely don't happen everyday and when it does you have to seize the opportunity. When I first met her we found out that we have a few things in common and we should meet up for drinks somewhere. 

We meet up and things go insanely well. I know that we both like eachother and have a lot in common and can talk about nearly anything. There's only one problem with this whole situation. She lives about 14 hours driving distance away from me and she only was in my city due to an internship. We decided to keep hanging out and it was great. We didn't have a problem in the weeks that we hung out. She eventually leaves and we promise to talk and stay in touch, which we have. 

So I get the idea of flying out to visit her for a weekend. We get all the arrangements made and I go out to see her. Things went off without a hitch and it was one of the best weekends I've ever had and the same goes for her as well. 

I was texting her a little last night and out of no where( she stopped texting around 1130 or 12) at 1 in the morning(I'm half asleep) she texts me and asks me to be her boyfriend. In my sleepy state I say no because I'm terrible at long distance relationships and I'd rather we start our relationship in person rather than through a text. I feel like we deserve more than that.

She wants to move to my city after she gets done with school in December but has no immediate plans to. I honestly don't know if she ever will. I really hope she does because I wouldn't have to hop on a plane to see her which would be amazing. 

I feel like I made the right decision and I know she put herself out there to ask me that. But on the other hand, I feel like I've smashed her confidence and her trust in me by saying no. I talked with her briefly this morning and she said she's changed her mind about the whole thing. I asked her what she meant by that and I never got a reply and have been tearing my hair out trying to figure out what she meant. 

I feel really bad and she won't even talk to me now. I really like her a lot and feel like that I've ruined our entire relationship over the fact that I'd rather start our relationship in person. She knows how much I like her and all that but it wouldn't explain why she would stop talking to me completely. 

Am I too old fashioned by saying that? Should I give in and go against my personal dating rules for someone I'm crazy about? And most importantly, have I ruined everything?

tl;dr - long distance girl I'm dating who has no immediate plans to move to my area asks me to be her bf via text message. I say no because I'd rather start our relationship in person. Thoughts?

Edit: thank you all for your replies and advice. I just got a message from her and were going to talk about it tonight. Wish me luck"

You probably wouldn't know it if you met me, but I didn't develop solid critical thinking skills until I was 23, the result of dysfunctional family roles that didn't reinforce productive communication skills or individual respect, poor school support, and cultural reinforcement.  Every day for years was spent with some feeling of worthlessness and shame.  I chose friends who put me down, and I let them because that was normal. I guessed or pretended at confidence and fun.  I scored a 95 on a test once and forgot to put my name on it, and another person who did the same thing came along and claimed it as his own.  I took his 65 score...and said nothing. According to Schoolgirls, by Peggy Orenstein, the combination of these factors that resulted in my behavior are common.  When I got out of high school, I began my slow-climb out of the mud, which was faced with many challenges.  I realized many things: people, even people who are supposed to be in a position of respect in your life, like parents, teachers, educators, etc. do not always have your best interests at heart.  It is easier for people to shut you down than to encourage you.  I did lots of research and soul searching about my situation, and was able to place blame squarely where it belonged: off me and onto the situations mentioned above.  I persevered, and found my dream: working in creative aspects of entertainment television.  I landed two internships with Conan O'Brien!  I graduated two years ago, and now I am able to return to California to get back into the industry after saving enough in this crappy post-grad economy.  I'm thankful that at 27 I am finally free of everything that held me down before, and that I am now able to see through the people who tried to control or change me.  I go to music festivals like Bonnaroo and see happy, carefree and confident teens, and wish I could have experienced feelings like that at that age.  That feeling goes away when I think about how great it is I put it behind me while I'm still young and able to seize life, and that despite it all, I won in the end : )  And then I just go and smoke it up at the next show that afternoon - discovering weed and letting go of institutionalized religion were two huge things that helped me get to where I am today!

10vnt1,1,2012-10-03,"Simple, yet great idea (I think) to get firms hiring College Grads",[deleted],business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/10vnt1/simple_yet_great_idea_i_think_to_get_firms_hiring/,"One of the biggest obstacles after graduating from college and trying to find a job is the fact that you have little to no ""real world experience"".  I know, profound realization right?  I don't think this hurdle is as big of a problem on the part of the graduate though, I think the big issue is the fact that employers know they have to spend a lot of time training you before you provide them the ability to generate your own revenue. 

In short, the way to solve this issue can be summed up as: Get firms hiring college grads, but don't incentivize it so much that people with experience are being regularly beat out for jobs.  My proposal is simple.  First time employees (in real jobs, your previous internship or stint at Burger King doesn't hurt you) within 1 year of graduation are able to work and the employer gets an additional tax deduction (say, for example, up to 50% of their salary) for one year.  A firm hiring a new college grad for an entry level marketing position (for example) at $40,000 per year could actually deduct $60,000.  This can help curb the costs of training somebody new, additional costs associated with getting a new employee (computer, supplies, etc...), as well as help promote firms to look at the inexperienced, and just get some more opportunities going.

The main point is this shouldn't ""cost"" the government much in lost tax revenue as those jobs probably wouldn't even exist in the first place.

I can imagine issues arising with small firms in need of people with simple tasks just hiring and firing a college grad every year to take the extra deduction (since they know the ""training curve"" would be short), so there may need to be an allotment (say only 5% of your current employees per year) so that if you had a small 10 employee firm you could only do this once per year.  This could help keep openings available for current experienced workers.  

Anyways, just a thought.  I know within my own company (engineering firm) that right now when the economy is slower, firms are reluctant to take on a noobie only to have to spend a year training them before they are very productive.  Something like this may just help."
10vn6v,19,2012-10-03,[20 F] How to deal with boyfriend's [21 M] relationships with his ex?,throwhaaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/10vn6v/20_f_how_to_deal_with_boyfriends_21_m/,"I'm 20f, the boyfriend is 21m.  We've been dating a little over a year.  Sorry about the wall of text that's coming.


A little background first: I've only had one serious relationship before this with a guy back in high school that I dated for three years.  I do not have nor desire to have a relationship with said ex beyond the polite greeting when we pass each other in public, which doesn't happen often (and only when we're both back in our hometown during breaks from college).  My boyfriend has had five previous relationships, none of which have been as long as ours.  He is on good terms with most of them, and will still talk to them on the occasional basis, maybe attend a birthday party, etc.


My issue comes from one particular girlfriend from his hometown, we'll call her M.  My boyfriend's and my hometowns are about forty five minutes away from each other, so our summer break was not an LDR.  However, I was waitressing over the summer and worked five days a week (and always on Friday-Sunday), and he was working at a tutoring clinic, so we didn't get to see a lot of each other.  A lot of the boyfriend's friends were also out of town due to internships, so he hung out with what friends were still in town.  Unfortunately, one of these friends was M.


M and my boyfriend never hung out 1-on-1.  My boyfriend was always very open about when she was going to be in a group he was hanging out with, and showed no signs of trying to hide anything.  I trust him completely and do not even have the slightest notion that he cheated on me.


However, I was still uneasy every time I knew they were hanging out.  Since I don't have a relationship with my ex, and my ex didn't have any previous relationships before ours, I had never had to deal with a situation like this and thus didn't know how to handle it.  However, I didn't want my boyfriend to miss out on spending time with friends simply because she was there, and I trust him, so I let it be.


At the time, my understanding of their past was that they had dated for a few months their junior year of high school, she dumped him without reason, and they gave each other the silent treatment until making up their senior year.  However, about a week ago, my boyfriend and I were sharing amusing stories about our high schools, and he started a story with ""During the second time I was dating M...""


I froze.  ""Second time?"" I asked.  Apparently, they had dated twice.  Both for about the same amount of time, both with her ending it without giving a reason.  He found out this summer that she broke up with him ""because he wasn't moving the relationship fast enough"".  He ""thought that he had told me"", but I stated that I would have remembered something like that.


This made me feel incredibly uneasy and questions started flying through my head.  He obviously had enough feelings for her to date her a second time, so who's to say he wouldn't have tried for a third time if he was single this summer?  He had said before this summer that he didn't care why she had broken up with him because it was over, so did he find out by her offering the information, or was he lying and actually did care?  Her reasoning sounds rather bs to me (why couldn't she move things along if they weren't going fast enough/talk to him about moving things faster), so was that not the actual reason?


I shouldn't care about any of this because it has nothing to do with me.  He's with me now, and I know he'd never cheat on me.  However, I can't keep myself from thinking about it.  I know I have some insecurity issues from my ex, who wanted to break up with me for months but never had the balls to until I confronted him about his aloofness.  I know these insecurity issues have me asking myself 'how will I be able to tell if a guy looses interest in me?' in the back of my mind.


So the question is - how do I get myself to stop thinking about it?  How do I stop myself from dwelling on the subject, which does nothing but bring me down?


**TL;DR: I don't have/feel the need to have a relationship with my ex, so I'm having a hard time accepting my boyfriend's relationship with one particular ex.  Would appreciate advice on how to get over it.**"

They donated a building to the food pantry, signed a contract to provide maintenance and utilities at a cost of $1 per year, and pledged to have the entire thing be non-denominational. They removed all signs of religion from the building save a small stack of pamphlets on a corner table describing the church.

This same church also told people to get lost if they wouldn't accept a pastor in a same-sex relationship and is actively canvassing for first-year pastors in same-sex relationships to do their internship with them.

The church spent a third of their annual budget a few years ago to buy an old house around the corner from them. They fixed up the house and now leave it open as a place for teenagers to hang out. The place has televisions, DVD players, a stereo system, etc. There are very few rules - no drugs, no violence, no cruelty to others.  If there's damage to the house, the church foots the bill and just fixes it quietly.  The house has a 9-1-1 phone in case things become problematic, and there's usually an on-call adult in case there's a difficult situation. There's no religious promotion at all (other than, again, some pamphlets in the corner), just a safe place for teenagers to hang out in the evenings.

Theists aren't always the people you think they are.  They do these things in the community which make it a better place, they do it quietly, and they're still often painted with the broad brush of being hatemongers, etc.  

If you want to see change in the world, laud the people who are actually working for that change, even if you don't agree with them in other areas."
10ved1,196,2012-10-03,At 23 I dropped everything and moved to Europe with a 5 month plan. At 26 I'm still here. AMA,[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10ved1/at_23_i_dropped_everything_and_moved_to_europe/,"*TL;DR - I am 26 and have lived in 4 countries, worked in two, and studied in two. I've lived in Europe for almost 3 years now and started my trip here with a 5 month enrollment in a University in Sweden. During my stay I was officially given deportation papers but successfully contested it. Currently I am living in the Czech Republic with plans to return to the US in a few months with my fiance.*

**Proof at the bottom**

I've seen a few people comment in the past on how they want to just give up on what they are doing and travel the world or move to another country. Almost 3 years ago I sold or moved all of my stuff into storage and moved to Sweden with a 5 month plan. I am not the best in terms of story telling and I have a hard time when it comes to my memory, so please bear with me.

After a 2 year relationship I decided to do a few things different in my life. I didn't have a college degree and I had wanted to move to Europe for quite some time, specifically Sweden. I decided to push myself to do that. I found out that I could go to school there for free (the rules have now changed for non-EU citizens). Before I applied or set anything in stone, I went to Sweden. I wasted quite a bit of money on this trip, but felt comfortable with going back. So after that summer I applied for University in Sweden for the second semester of the 2009-2010 year.

I had a few issues getting the visa in time as I had applied late, which you should usually only do if you're an EU citizen as the visa takes time. But, the Swedish Embassy was very helpful and understanding and gave me the direct number of the person handling my visa. I called him and he found my application and ""put it at the top of the stack."" I ended up getting my visa at the last minute, after rescheduling my flight once. I got to Sweden in January of 2010 with about 5,000 USD, clothing, sheets, and a few other things. I had missed a week of class by this time, but my main concern was that I had actually done it, I was in Europe. Now what?

I didn't even have a place to live when I arrived at around 10pm in the middle of winter. Fortunately someone on the train helped me and the next day I was able to slip into a student dorm which I had contacted before via email. They hadn't guaranteed me anything for another week and a half, but were able to work me in when I arrived at the dorm. This, I come to later realize, was a life saver and a rare occurance.

So I lived a college life with a dorm full of international students. I dated a French girl the 5 months I was in school. I applied for a 3 year English program so I could stay after those 5 months ended. But by the end of the 5 months I had run out of money. That is when I stopped drinking alcohol (I didn't heavily drink before or even drink a lot, I would just have a couple beers when going out. But in Scandinavia, a couple beers is expensive if you're at a club or bar.). But this is when things started to get tricky.

The relationship with the French girl ended as she went back to France. I was hit really hard by this and basically locked myself in my room even though a bunch of my friends were leaving after her and I didn't quite say goodbye properly. (I did when they left, but I wasn't with them the days prior to them leaving.) It wasn't until I developed a crush on a Swedish girl that I actually moved on. That lead no where (except trying a new drug), but at least got my back on my feet emotionally. But I then hit another problem.

When getting a visa for education (I'm assuming in a lot of countries it is like this), you need to show a bank account with enough funds to cover your entire stay. I didn't have that money. As I didn't come from a wealthy family, they didn't have that money either. So I was not able to extend my visa or continue with college. So, I kinda of sat on what I was doing (not much) for a month until I decided I should return back to the US. By this time I was getting some money from my parents (and not spending very much of it unless I had to). I didn't like getting money from them (as I never had before), but I wasn't going to let my pride stop me from continuing. Very shortly after my decision to return home after my ""fun"" I met someone.

She was a Russian girl. She came quickly into my life and also left quickly, but she left her mark. Because of her I stayed long enough to have another bridge built. I extended my stay for 2 months and again considered going home. I was speaking to one of my friends whom I had met in one of my classes, a German friend. He convinced me to stay with him in Germany with his family over Christmas and then go with him to Austria where he was living to learn German and stay in the EU. I took him up on his offer.

He is what kept me in Europe. His family was a warm, welcoming, and wonderful family. He is one person whom I know will stay with me the rest of my life and I am extremely lucky to know him. He was part of an organization that does exchanges for internships. His then girlfriend (also a friend of mine), called me one afternoon and asked if I wanted to go to the Czech Republic to do an internship. This was in January of 2011, a year into my European trip. I, of course, said yes. It would pay for my food and my bed, which was all I cared about at that time.

Within a few days I was off to Prague and then to Ostrava in the Czech Republic. I was giving presentations and speaking to students in High Schools about the United States. I was with a group of international students, one from China, one from Brazil, one from Russia, one from Peru, and for the first two weeks we had someone from Macedonia and someone from Serbia with us. We would spent a week at each High School and then go to a different one. We traveled throughout the Czech Republic for 8 weeks in many different towns.

In one of the towns I received a FB message from a girl whom I had never seen before. I asked the people I was with if they knew her and they didn't recognize her either. She wanted to meet me, but I was confused a bit as to who she was. But, I looked through her FB and decided that I should meet her (I based it off her pictures...), and so I agreed to it. It turns out she was a friend of someone at the High School and was very interested in foreigners, especially Americans. It also turns out that she was very, very shy. Her mother had given her the final push to even send that first message.

The first date I was the cocky guy trying to ""get"" with her. But by the end of the night things changed and I actually wanted to be with her. I bailed on another date to be with her and haven't looked back since. That was in March of 2011. I would visit her every weekend throughout my stay in the Czech Republic and then ended up moving in with her after the internship was over.  She is now my fiance and we are in the visa process for her going to the US to meet my family and get married. But, that skips ahead a bit.

I found a job as a conversation English teacher in a town near to where she lives. I was very lucky to have found this because up to this point I have been living off what my parents gave me and cheap housing from friends. I got a full-time job that paid relatively well (relative to Czech wages) and moved out of her parent's into our own apartment together. If you remember, I had never gone through the visa process again after I didn't have enough money to extend my visa previously. While in the process of getting everything I needed I was down to only getting my visa. I had a work permit, I had the contract, I had everything I needed except the visa. But that was a ways off.

I was given deportation papers the first week of my work. I told the head of my department. I am not sure if she fully understood what I was saying, but either way. The foreign police here were helpful (not the ones at the main office who do paperwork, but the ones who actually deal with the cases and investigations). They didn't care that I was working, they just cared that I wasn't legally there. I contested the deportation and was able to continue working during the months that it was being appealed. Eventually, just before the end of the first semester, I received word from Prague that due to my relationship with my now fiance, I cannot be deported. There were a few more snags along the way, but I ended up getting a 5 year residence permit without having to leave the EU or take a day off from work (except I missed a few morning classes because I had to go in to the foreign police).

Now I am preparing to go back home. In these 3 years I've seen my brother once (October of 2010) and my mom once (August of 2012). Other than that, I've seen no one from the US. I will have culture shock when I go back and just thinking about seeing my friends and family almost brings me to tears. Eventually I will come back as neither myself nor my fiance are to keen on staying in the United States permanently.

I will add that without the support from my family, both monetarily and simply being supportive of my ""adventure"", I wouldn't have been able to do this. I have a hard time with motivation and only have bursts of energy to do things. So without them I don't know where I would be right now. I've had so much help along the way that I have never and will never say that I remotely ""did this on my own"". I don't like when people say they are proud of what I did, unless it is immediate family, as I don't feel like I did anything special.

So, if you have any questions after this shell of a story, please ask me anything. I'll be on for about 3 hours until I have to walk my bunny.

*Edit - During this time I have visited many countries to see friends or just to travel. Other than the ones I mentioned in the story I've been to Norway, Italy, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Luxembourg, and Poland while here. I forgot to mention those in the story.*

*It was also pointed out to me that the females seem to be a ""bulk"" of the story. I didn't mean it that way. I mentioned the ones that affected my stay, and I'll admit I can be affected by relationships a bit much at times (which is why they affected my stay in terms of how long). This was over a period of over a year before my fiance, so I did not date that much considering the time frame. But in clumping them all together in the story, it might have magnified them too much. Not my intention.*

So I'm a 23 year old student currently getting ready to transfer from my community college to a particular 4 year university by fall of next year. I'm currently going to school part time for Business Administration, and when I transfer, I'll be able to use these credits to enter the school's Information Systems program. I plan on taking classes at the university full time, so ideally, I should be able to recieve my bachelors in 2 years. At the CC, I've mostly taken the gen ed courses, along with some business/economics courses. I still have to take precalc/applied calculus, a couple sciences, and a literature and history course before I have my credit requirement for the Business Administration Associates. I'm currently in the precalc, Biology, and literature, and I think I'll take physics as my other science course.

My dilemma is that from a lot of recent research and reading that I've done, an Information Systems degree may not exactly be the best of options. Mixing business and technology courses is certainly an interesting path, and I can see how it could prove useful in the field, but I've seen many claim that such a degree really just takes a little bit of many different subjects, and doesn't delve deep enough into anything to really get much experience from it.

I'm considering changing degree paths to Computer Science. I'm aware that this degree is generally said to be more rigorous, and possibly more theoretical. I also know that most 4 year schools (including the one that I'm most interested in) treats Computer Science as a part of their engineering program, so this path would require a lot more for science and math along with going more in depth with languages. (In comparision, the IS degree at the school has you taking only 2-3 programming classes, along with other business classes, database management, etc.) But in exchange, it's generally seen as a more preferable degree for someone that's interested in programming, and would probably lead to a wider variety of oppertunities.

The big issue is that while this path seems to be the tougher, but more rewarding path, it would also require me to almost start from scratch. Being a part of a different school in the university, and just being a different degree in general, I wouldn't be able to transfer a good deal of my credits (only a couple maths, my english courses, my bio course and possibly another science if I choose one that both degrees qualify for, such as chem/phys 101). This means that I would have to stay in school an extra semester or so to catch up. I'm also somewhat worried about the different classes, and being able to stick with the new, harder, workload.

I find the development field to be fascinating, and I would like to learn more. I've done a lot of reading up on the field and different aspects of it, and I've also started doing some self studying/practicing to try to get a feel for the basics and see if this is something that's worth pursuing. Unfortunetly, it's been difficult to get some of this self study time in between my current classes and working, but I'd like to do a lot more before the year is out. I know that its far from impossible to get a job in this field with an IS degree, but it can be harder to get initial interviews and to prove ones competence to a potential employer. I would have to make significant strides in my self studies to be able to feel more confident in my skills and be able to compete against other applicants.

Considering the different pros and cons of each path, what do you guys think would be the decision to look at? Are there any aspects to the situation that I appear to be missing/misunderstanding? I know that no matter how I decide to approach things, getting experience is vital for this field, so that's another goal that I need to try to do. It would be excellent to eventually start putting my own little (naive?) ideas of programs to action, and possibly join up in an open source project. Getting an internship in my area would be even better!

Sorry for the late announce! This week, our distinguished speaker is
longtime member Paul Martin talking about penetration testing!

In his own words:
""Blurb:
This week I'll be presenting a lecture on penetration testing and
network security.  We will discuss everything from how to build a
threat model and enumerate attack vectors all the way to performing
network attacks and exploiting services.  In the end we will come up
with countermeasures to make our systems and networks more secure.

Info about me:
I'm a Ph.D. student in the Health and Medical Security Lab (formerly
the Security and Privacy Advanced Research Lab).  My research
interests focus on systems security and privacy.  Prior to starting my
Ph.D. I interned at Independent Security Evaluators, a security
consulting firm based in Baltimore, for three years while an undergrad
here at Hopkins.  In the past I have also worked as an independent
penetration tester and have performed systems security analysis and
architecture work as part of an internship at the MSE Digital Research
and Curation Center.""

Time: Thursday at 6pm
Location: Shaffer 101 unless  we get kicked out. Then we will be in Shaffer
303.

The job offer I received was on the other side of the country, and I feel that I should try to find employment close to home to support my family. 

The problem is that it's been hard for me to find employment, with my major. Most jobs I feel I am qualified for require a specific major or require a few years of experience which I don't have. I'm starting to think I should swallow my pride and take a job that I didn't need to go to college to get, such as an administrative assistant position or something similar just to earn some money while I still look for a job. 

If I did this, I would still look for jobs and quit if I found a more suitable one. Or, I was thinking it might be better to just tough it out and keep looking. I'm looking for some advice here...I feel really lost. I don't know how to proceed...

I worry that I'm getting so old that I'll never have my own family, and I have nightmares weekly about fighting with my family but I'm terrified of my father dying of a heart attack.

I worry that I live in a city where I will never meet anyone not shallow and an idiot that I could imagine living my life with. And that I'm getting more unattractive, fat, ugly.

I scream at myself for not applying to finish my degree because I'm scared they'll just tell me I took too long since my last internship.

I gain from talking to people here, hopefully helping them. But it's not enough, and I'm drowning in a life that I hate, and city that kills me, no social life outside of work, no chance of a raise soon...

All this is every day bullshit that is so first world it's stupid."
10v4i3,3,2012-10-03,AHHH THE COMMITMENT SCARYYY,zoecorn,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/10v4i3/ahhh_the_commitment_scaryyy/,"My SO and I are both in school full time, I have two more years of my Engineering degree (20F) and he has one year of Law (24). We've both been with other people but this is our first serious relationship (just over a year together, with numerous visits). I feel like you have to be serious and commit to some degree before you really 'commit' when you're on opposite sides of the country.

But I'm going to be honest and say it's terrifying to think that in 2 years, either I'll be moving to him, or we'll be meeting somewhere in the middle (where I can find a job). I know I can't just 'get over it' but... is it crazy to be committed to spend the rest of your life together after only knowing them for 3 years? I've been so on edge lately and I think it's because I'm applying for internships and thinking about the future and it's affecting us a lot. How do I bring my fears up without scaring him? Should I bring it up now or when I see him in person next month? Thanks guys."
10v3r9,7,2012-10-03,Can I forget about C++?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/10v3r9/can_i_forget_about_c/,"I've taken several C++ programming classes, and this will be my final semester using the language in Data Structures class. I've always hated C++ for being so damn complicated. In nearly all my assignments I've struggled with figuring out proper syntax instead of working on the problem at hand.

On the other hand, I'm breezing through a Java programming class. The language is incredibly easy to implement, so I can focus on the solving a problem and not worrying about some syntax. I truly enjoy working with Java.

I'm just concerned if having a mediocre C++ knowledge will hurt me in terms of getting internships, which I plan to look for next summer. I'd like to expand my knowledge in Java, Python, and whatever else I can get my hands on.

10v1gd,2,2012-10-03,Slowly getting tired of looking for a job. Companies waste my time. Need some words of advice. ,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/10v1gd/slowly_getting_tired_of_looking_for_a_job/,"I'll begin by saying that I got laid off at the most recent job due to company funds at the beginning of July.

I thought to myself -- I want to become a top notch SE, so I decided to take a month/two to work on my own projects/blogs and put em on github. 

I think due to these, I was contacted by Amazon for an interview. I spent about a whole month preparing/nailing phone interviews. They flew me out for the onsite interviews where I screwed up  and didn't get the offer. I banked on this job and I failed. 

The positive side is that due to this month, I am now on top of my algorithms/data structures. I am the best developer I've ever been. I continue working and coding every day on new projects, learning new languages and spending my time on freenode, as well as applying to companies. If I seriously had the money, I wouldn't even look for a company to work for but just go to starbucks and code for fun indefinitely.

I know I am a very competent developer (at least for being 1 year out of college), and am probably more competent than most of the people that have interviewed me. 

Companies literally waste my time. It's disrespectful and embarrassing, while also demeaning. I'll talk to companies that have ""recruiting coordinators"" that send me to talk to ""company recruiters"" that waste my time with mindless questions and then I don't even get a chance at a technical phone screen about 30% of the time because of the incompetency of these people. At one point, I solved a pretty tough puzzle given by this one company (""to get my resume to the top of the stack"") and was contacted by some recruiter (I HATE recruiters at this point). I spent an hour talking to him while he read off questions that he was supposed to ask me and I never heard back from them, meanwhile on the phone he was talking about all these ""company values."" At least have the decency to send me an email letting me know what's going on.

The actual technical phone screens are usually conducted by some people only a few years older than I am that have no clue on how to interview people. I've read countless articles by top notch programmers(i.e Yogge) about the way to interview people and nobody follows these guidelines. The only interview I've felt that wasn't a complete waste of my time was at Amazon where I could tell I was talking to smart people that knew how to engage me. 

My passion for CS has been amazing the past several months given how depressing this whole process is, but every time I send my resume out, I feel like I am just wasting precious Joules. I am seriously considering changing careers at this point just due to this string of bad luck I've been getting into. I think I do much better with the large competitive companies than with the shitty startups that I interview with. The problem with the competitive companies is that they receive thousands of resumes a day and my resume thrown into that pile is just another piece of paper.

The worst part is -- the longer I've been out of work the worse it looks on my resume. I am in NY and I am legitimately exhausted from these companies. 

Maybe I am just extremely stupid and severely suffering from the Dunning-Kruger effect. The only thing that keeps me from fully believing this, is that the two guys I usually paired up and worked on projects with at my University went on to work at awesome companies like Apple. I admit I slightly screwed up in school (in terms of not looking for an internship at a reputable company), but I know I am just as competent as those guys.

10v1fi,8,2012-10-03,I feel like I'm losing touch with friends because I'm introverted/busy? ,sailboatsairplanes,introvert,https://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/10v1fi/i_feel_like_im_losing_touch_with_friends_because/,"This semester I've been pretty busy with school and my internships, plus stuff for organizations I'm a part of at college. After all I'm in my junior year, and I'm starting to get more into my career. I leave my house daily at 8 a.m. and don't get back until 9 p.m., and that small chunk of time I have after I get home and before I go to sleep is devoted to eating, showering, studying and getting ready before the next day. In the past semesters, my schedule was always way more relaxed and I stayed up with friends until 3 or 4 a.m. just hanging out. I feel like this semester I'm just so busy that I don't have the time or energy to spend with them, and I'm starting to see the effects of me flaking out on them. 

Basically their expectations are different from what I am comfortable with. They're the kind of friends who spend every day together just sitting around, but this year I just don't have the energy after my long days to do that. I'll hang out with them for special events, for example if they were going out to eat somewhere or watching a movie at home, but I don't see the point in me driving over to their house just to sit around.

I'm also pretty family-oriented so some weekends I'm not available because I go home to see my family. I'm also not huge into partying. Sometimes I'll get in a certain mood where I actually want to, but that's rare. 

I just feel like my friends think I don't want to spend time with them. I always get comments asking where I've been lately. It's just that every day, I have a list of things that I need to accomplish, and I just do it more efficiently on my own. Like going to the gym for example, I don't ever go with anyone because I feel like I get the best workout on my own because I can just focus on myself and not get distracted. 

I have a friend who also constantly says I don't tell her anything, especially pertaining to my love life, but that's just because nothing especially noteworthy is happening to me at the moment. I also tend to be pretty private sometimes. 

Basically what it boils down to is me being afraid of losing touch with friends because I constantly tell them I'm busy, which I truly am, or I just don't see the pros of participating in an event they're doing (like partying; I'd much rather stay at home). 

I don't want my friends to perceive me as not wanting to hang out with them anymore or that I'm some party-pooper who hates parties, but I don't want to do stuff that I don't enjoy when I could be doing something else, just to make my friends happy. "

:--|:--
[Are there plans for an API?  I'd like to be able to download my heating data and perform my own analysis.  I would also like to remotely control my Nest programmatically (not using the iOS apps\).  Thanks for the awesome product!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gjm7o?context=5)|We've got a ton of requests for an API since we launched. Its something we have been thinking about, but we want to make sure the primary Nest app experience is stellar before we start branching out and adding developers. Most people forget that it took until iOS 2.0 for Apple to add 3rd party apps to the iPhone, and they have an enormous developer support team. Anything that we do at Nest has to be great, and I don't think we are ready as a company for a 3rd party program just yet.
[My question is related to NEST's energy savings... where can we see the numbers? I've looked on the web and a lot of people are drawn into the Nest for its aesthetic, and I'm one of them. However, I've yet to see HARD numbers for savings before and after in multiple homes. And if you don't have them, can you work on getting them for us? It's pointless to buy a pretty, expensive device, if it's not really saving money.  Also a followup -- what about the comments from HVAC pros who say that the way Nest cycles the HVAC units can cause damage? Does Nest 2.0 change anythign there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gjoka?context=5)|I'd recommend checking out our new white paper. Yoky Matsuoka (our head of technology and my old professor) has been analyzing all of our data and pushed this out today. I can say the savings are real if you teach Nest well. Much like a Prius, if you drive it like a sports car, you may not get good mileage, but if you teach it well and use all the features we built, you will save. [Link to downloads.nest.com](http://downloads.nest.com/summer_2012_savings_white_paper.pdf)
[Thanks! Do you ever do any sort of beta testing with new releases or anything of the sort? We love to have new technology in our hands, and even moreso we'd love to help work through problems and make suggestions. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gjus8?context=5)|We actually do extensive beta testing with outside folks. Obviously confidentiality is critical, but if anyone is interested email beta@nestlabs.com.
[What are the plans beyond the thermostat?  I see you can make it smaller, and a little more intuitive, but what next for your company?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gjr64?context=5)|The most I can say is that you don't build a team like this one for just one product :)
[Matt I'm curious what your biggest challenge was in bringing the original Nest to launch. You've got a beautiful product that seems to have found traction in the marketplace quickly and with few iterations. The marketing also looks really polished and tested. Like Apple, a lot of this was done behind closed doors and before launch. What were the biggest design decisions and challenges in creating the Nest, and what do you think have been the biggest factors in the success of the Nest so far?  Also: what are the most important things you've learned SINCE launch that you didn't know before launch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gjpr0?context=5)|We spent a ton of time actually just trying to keep it simple. There are so many things we could have done but at the core, its a thermostat. Its really hard to prevent feature creep or prevent the UI from getting cluttered. Since we've launched the biggest thing we've learned is that HVAC is the wild-west. Seriously. Every system and home can be different which is a huge challenge for our hardware and software teams.
[Hi Matt, What do you think about product tear downs or reverse engineering, from a student perspective vs. obviously reverse engineering from a potential competitive perspective? (As a young engineer, I wish there were better publicly available take-aparts and PCB-level examinations/explanations of the Nest and of the Nest 2.0 you just announced.\)  Also, what about managing contract manufacturers? What can a young startup do to ensure a contract manufacturer doesn't sell or steal some of your company's IP so that a one-hung-lo supplier from nowheresville, China copies it and introduces a competing rip-off product in a market you're not selling into now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gjoe6?context=5)|I've learned a ton over the years from teardowns, its always good to see how other engineers have thought about product design and see if there are other chips out there that you might not have known about. That said, its always important to be sensitive to others' IP, but generally things like what chips are used can't be patented. Managing CMs is a huge ball of wax, and one of the biggest challenges for any hardware company (and even Apple from my experiences). It takes a ton of time and usually a dedicated team to manage them (as well as the supply base). Generally we aren't worried about them stealing IP, their business is to help build products for companies like us. They would lose their entire business if there were IP issues.
[What did/do you like more? Working at Apple or having your own startup? And why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gji7z?context=5)|Honestly, very different, but there's nothing like having your own startup. Having complete design freedom and building your own team from scratch are amazing experiences. But we wouldn't have been able to start Nest if we hadn't learned all we did there.
[Do you use a real-time operating system?  What programming language(s\) are used?  How do you test your code?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gl2i9?context=5)|We use a combination of things actually. The base unit that the wires go into runs a bare metal style firmware environment that is as tight as we can possibly make it. The head unit runs Linux actually but a few versions back. Pretty much all of our code is either in bare metal C and our UI code is in C++ (without a lot of the actual C++ facilities like templates, etc).
[Do the Nest servers need to act as the intermediary between the thermostat and the mobile app?  How functional would the thermostat be if Nest (or specifically the Nest servers\) were no longer around?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gjm4q?context=5)|They do. We want for you to be able to control your Nest using the mobile apps over 3G, which wouldn't be possible without a server middleman. In order to use features like remote control or get software updates you need to be connected, but the product works great unconnected or if the servers offline (which very rarely happens).
[What kind of facilities do you use for testing? Mockups of rooms and houses, real houses or what? Also, can the Learning Thermostat be used in multiple numbers for large or connected spaces, in some networked way?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gjxrn?context=5)|All of the above actually. We dog food everything ourselves in our homes, we built about 50 desk mounted homes for basic testing, and we are aided but an extraordinary amount of beta test homes all around the country. We have about 17 of them in our office building here in Palo Alto controlling the building here.
[Is Nest looking for Android developers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gjo5v?context=5)|OMG yes! Please email Jose Cong (jose@nestlabs.com) we are hiring big time!!!
[I have a 2 story house but only one HVAC the upper level is always hotter than the lower level - any plans for adding remote sensors to add to the Nest to be able to sense the whole house vs just the area around the Nest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gjxyv?context=5)|In the end you only have 1 zone, adding a remote sensor could help keep your upstairs cooler but it would waste a ton of energy downstairs. We've put quite a bit of thought into this exact problem and its really tough, I don't know of a great solution yet.
[Congrats on the new Nest unit, will the first gen still be available for sale? maybe discounted? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gjn25?context=5)|We've stopped production of the 1st gen product, but there are still some left at Lowes, Amazon, and Apple.com reduced to $229.
[What's it like to work with kevin po?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gjhhi?context=5)|Kevin is a freaking star. there are few engineers who can drink as many slurpees per day while fixing crazy bugs.
[I tried to order the new Nest online, but it won't let me ship it to my work so I can sign for it.  It requires you to use your billing address.  Any way around this? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gjp1a?context=5)|Yea, I feel your pain. We got hit with a big fraud attack recently and this is what our e-commerce partner recommended in the short term. Ah, the joys of the internet...
[What were some of the real-life problems you encountered that you hadn't prepared for before the product was released? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gjr53?context=5)|One of the biggest problems we had to face was dealing with issues that werent even ours! Things like general heating issues get blamed on us and we have to do our best at helping customers figure it out. In many cases, we've sent engineers or techs out to our customers' homes in order to help troubleshoot (albeit cases like this have been pretty rare)
[Thank you for making a great product. With the announcement of the newest version of the Nest will this bring down the price of the previous version? I would love to put a Nest in all of my family's homes but can't afford $250 per family. Any possibility of an upgrade price for users on the first version (ala cell phone\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gjmml?context=5)|The 1st gen product price drops to $229 today (can grab them at Amazon, Apple.com and Lowes)
[You're stranded on a desert island. what are the 3 things you MUST have with you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gjzoh?context=5)|Water, food, and a satellite enabled phone.
[Hi Matt, No question here, I just wanted to thank you for making awesome products. I love my nest, especially when it does the awesome things it is supposed to.  If I ever decide to move west, Nest Labs is on the top of the list of companies I'd love to work for. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gk0hs?context=5)|Awesome, great to hear! We are hiring in pretty much every area. Just email Jose Cong (jose@nestlabs.com)
[Matt, I was also wondering about jobs. I checked your website's postings, but I didn't see any open internships. I was wondering if the thought had occurred to you guys to hire some this coming summer? Thank you. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gm894?context=5)|We had a solid internship program last summer (about 25 interns), we even hired some!

[Are there plans for an update to the iOS app to fill the iPhone 5 screen size?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gjuky?context=5)|Stay tuned... very very soon :)
[How do you manage product development? (what tools, what process serves you well\).  How did you ""start""?  What tools did you use for Product Design?  Thank you (ever so grateful - wonderful product!\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gjqpo?context=5)|We run a very similar process as we used to use at Apple, where we do few but relatively large releases per year (as opposed to iterating really rapidly). When you are doing hardware, you can't ship crap, so there isn't a good fit for an agile development model. For PD, we use the NX/unigraphics toolchain, its a little expensive but our engineers love it.
[2 more, if you'd be so kind!  What about managing the ""list of things to do"", the actual task management?  Initial sketches? (what CAD software\) - the very very first ideas.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gl7bq?context=5)|We use Jira for just about everything task/bug related. For early, early sketching we use solidworks, but move to UG as soon as engineering gets involved.
[What was your greatest moment at Apple? (Could be a particular day, experience, or achievement.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gl2x3?context=5)|I think the greatest moment at Apple was shipping the 3rd generation nano (the short, fatty one). We redid the entire application framework at the same time as a major hardware change at the same time as doing a new shuffle, classic, and the iphone. It nearly killed the team, we worked around the clock, 7 days a week to make sure there was a new nano for christmas, and we made it. It was a huge accomplishment for the entire ipod team, and fueled the growth of the entire company.
[I may be unpopular for asking, but off the top of your head, do you have any insights into Apple internal culture that you would be willing to share?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gl2x3?context=5)|Apple culture isn't something that can be explained easily, it isn't uniform around the company. Each division has its own unique feel (iOS SW, Mac Hardware, iPod/iPhone Hardware, etc), but all of them are hugely customer focused and in the details.
[Does the new unit have smoother wheel action?  My original nest feels a little.. scrapey.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gkmq5?context=5)|It does :) A ton went into making that solid stainless ring feel extra smooth.

[Have you ever been in a Turkish prison?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gkkk4?context=5)|Not yet.

[I'm curious about the technical side of Nest. I know it runs Linux, and the legal info mentions boost so I'm assuming there's a bunch of C++ code. Was there stuff you couldn't find in the open source universe that you had to write in-house? What about the UI?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gkvgc?context=5)|We use quite a bit of OSS but also had to write a ton of stuff on our own. On the networking stack side of the world we worked with the open source community and have actually given back (in particular look at connman an alternative to network manager better suited for embedded devices). The UI toolkit was totally written from scratch. We couldnt find anything that worked well for the round UI!
[Matt,  Will there be a trade up program offered by nest for the early adopters that bought the first gen of the nest thermostat?  Nick.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gk6n0?context=5)|We don't think there needs to be, all of our customers will be getting the new software over the air in the next day or so!
[Hello Matt,  Does the new 3.0 nest software fix the communication issue with the latest gen of the apple airport express base station?  Nick.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gk02x?context=5)|We actually fixed the Apple Airport issues with 2.1.3 about a month ago (3.0 has the fixes as well)

For instance, if right now its 80 degrees, but tonight it will drop to 50, why not automatically have nest kick in the heat based on the forecast information. This has always puzzled me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gl3yb?context=5)|It actually does for some systems where it makes the most sense.

Many of us use Macs, but we don't force any tools/computers on anyone, they very much get to pick.
[Hi Matt, are the current ( old \) units going to support whole house humidifiers as well or do you need the new unit for that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gjuab?context=5)|You'll need the 2nd gen product for those.
[Matt, I got the email today about the 2nd Gen Next and the upcoming 3.0 software. Other than cosmetic, is there any benefit to updating my current Nest? Also, I loved it when you guys added the ""range"" feature, so when will you guys had a ""hold"" feature where it holds a single temperature, say 72 ±1, so my house stays where I want it and not within a 3 degree range?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gk42n?context=5)|There's some great stuff in 3.0, check it out [here](http://www.nest.com/blog/2012/10/02/the-next-generation-nest-thermostat/#software)
[Matt, were you guys surprised at the lawsuit from Honeywell? I know you probably can't talk too much a bout it, but was just wondering if it caught you guys off guard a little. It's amazing that the IP wars extend to the lowly thermostat!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gl21i?context=5)|Totally sucks. Its really unfortunate when big companies see the only way to compete is to sue the new guy.
[What inspired you &amp; the team to design Nest and what were the core tenets your team aspired to create in the device?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gk68b?context=5)|The key inspiration is actually the frustration with products today. Thermostats control about 50% of home energy and up until Nest, none solved the core problem (horrible UX leading to only 11% of people actually programming their thermostat). Our core tenet: keep it simple! A lot of companies say it, but it requires enormous discipline to actually do it.
[Who am I taking to when I call support? Guys in your office?  How much went into to support for the company?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6glgvl?context=5)|For really hard issues, calls get sent over to support engineers at our office. For most issues, our call center handles things nicely (they are awesome btw, if you haven't spoken to them)
[I told my dad about Nest after I explained it's features and showed him how it has saved my wife and I money in our house.  He says ""it won't work for him because his thermostat is in a low-traffic room"".  I replied that the Nest website specifically says it works in low-traffic rooms but he doesn't believe it.  Can you explain briefly how Nest knows when you're Away?  My guess is motion sensors but is that all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gm0vl?context=5)|And here's the relavent section: Nest only knows what you and its sensors tell it. In its first week on your wall, Nest will figure out if it can turn on Auto-Away or not. If Nest is in an unused bedroom or tucked behind a bookshelf, it can’t know when you’re home and when you’re gone. If that’s the case, try setting Away yourself—on your thermostat itself or from your Nest Account. But the good news is, Auto-Away does work in 9 out of 10 homes, even when it’s in a place that doesn’t get much traffic, like your dining room. Even if you don’t walk directly in front of your thermostat for days at a time, the level of activity that Nest needs for Auto-Away to work is actually really low. It also helps that Nest has a 150° wide-angle view and can sense movement across the room.

Thanks, and I love my Nest!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gluz7?context=5)|They are very similar from a hardware perspective besides the industrial design and the increased compatibility 
[Matt,  my own pet theory is that you guys - Tony and yourself - got started on the whole thermostats idea because of the appallingly bad ones in MA1...  is there some truth to that? :-\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6glili?context=5)|Haha, those things never worked! But no the true inspiration were the crappy thermostats at Tony's house in Tahoe.
[Matt,  Love the Nest, we have three, and ordering one more for our radiant heat thermo.  My question is: other than aesthetics, why purchase Model 2.0 while 1.0 is still available? (i understand you are no longer making version 1.0\).  Is there anything model 2.0 does with the new 3.0 software that model 1.0 can't do with the same 3.0 software?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gnajb?context=5)|Nope, total feature parity with the exception of the increased compatibility.

[Follow-up AMA question: Since it's an ARM, it produces a fair bit of power; enough that you have to care about power dissipation, or does the whole thing just sort of act as a heatsink and you don't have to worry much?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10tpxx/i_am_matt_rogers_founder_of_nest_and_former_apple/c6gkb3p?context=5)|If managed well, ARMs can be very low power.

10us4p,37,2012-10-02,On job searching while employed,Mikeavelli,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/10us4p/on_job_searching_while_employed/,"Hello!  

I'm in my first job out of college as an Electrical Engineer.  It's currently an ""internship"" where I do the job of a full-time employee for around the low end of what a still-in-school intern should be expecting ($16/hr).

I signed up for this because the job market is tough, it's *exactly* what I want to be doing as an EE, and I was told this would be an ""introductory"" period, and to expect it to last 3-5 months.

At around the 4 month mark, I got an answer of ""the company isn't doing too well, we're strictly budgeting, and in a bit of a hiring freeze, we might be able to hire you on as a full time employee sometime early next year.  Keep up the good work.""  

In talking with fellow employees, I've found out the majority of fresh-out-of-school hires went through a similar 9-12 month internship period; and since I'm invited to quarterly economic review meetings, I'm aware of how this company is not in dire economic straits.  Rather, they seem to be taking advantage of the relatively poor job market in my area.

------------------------------

Suffice it to say, I've been passing my resume around, and have gotten a few bites, and I've come to a question I don't know a good answer for.

""Is it okay for us to contact your current employer?""

I've done good work, and have no doubt my co-workers would speak highly of me.  My supervisor is aware that I'm unhappy with his answer on the whole 'full time employee' conversation, but I haven't told him, or anyone at work, that I'm looking around.

- Does telling prospective employers ""no, don't contact them."" hurt my chances of landing a new job?

- How and when should I inform my current employers that I'm looking?  Right now?  After I already have an offer in hand?

- I'm financially stable, no student loans thanks to the G.I. Bill, no dependents, and have enough saved to live for several months in the event of a worst-case scenario.  As well, since it appears to be corporate policy to take advantage of employees, I've decided my current employer is not a good long-term decision.

- Any other advice on topics I haven't thought of yet?"

Every time I've slept with someone, it's great and then immediately after I just feel like a terrible person and regret what I just did. Fucking feelings."

I am kind of freaking out because I transferred from a community college and did not realize the importance of internships, so I have none (I know I'm stupid). I also have no real professional work but I have had a constant part time and even full time job since I legally could  (15 and a half). I have a decent GPA at around 3.4 with no extracurricular, had no time because of work. 

Anyways should I be freaking out? I'm very nervous about meet the firms and have no idea how they work. So exactly what goes on during it? Should I be researching companies? Should I bring resumes? Do I go for internships or full time jobs at this point? Should I get a little tipsy before to ease the nerves?Ahhhh!

There are resources on campus I'm sure that could answer this for me but I have no time because of work. All your answers are appreciated!  :)

I want to make money (who doesn't?) I'm very curious about investing and playing the stock market to accomplish my goals but it seems like there is just so so much information out there I am overwhelmed and don't know where to start. The amount of acronyms, field-specific terms, it's nuts.

I'm 20 years old, and I know you need money to make money. Right now I'm doing an internship with IBM and have 1 year left- in that time I'll make around $3.2k - $3.4k a month (that's after tax, and it's variable due to overtime), 750 of this goes to rent. Right now I'm really quite bad at managing the rest...for example my CC debt is at $1k, I can easily pay it down though (and I intend to over the month of October. this is my 'get shit together' month)

I have around $2k invested with this guy at Dundee wealth, my parents set it up for me (although all the money put in was my own), I'm not sure if I should continue to leverage his services or spend time doing more on my own.

As for goals, I don't really have anything concrete beyond financial security. Making millions would be nice, although I clearly don't know enough about things to do that.

Sorry if any of this seems woefully misguided or uninformed, I literally know nothing about generating money."

Advice?",plzletmeacct,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/10yrr0/accounting_career_fair_tomorrow_im_an_unskilled/,"edit: It's not tomorrow, it's Monday. I guess I bought myself a weekend. 

I apologize in advanced for making yet another student topic.

I'm a junior this year, but I'm hoping to get an internship in the summer. I'm (hopefully) going to be accepted into this accelerated program thing that'll let me take a few grad courses in my senior year so I'll have my MAcc one semester after graduating in spring (so, fall 2014) rather than the usual 2 semesters. 

Other than good grades, though, I have very little to show.  My ""resume"" (if you can call it that) reflects that. I'd like to put the accelerated thing on there, but there's a chance I won't be accepted and I don't want to give a resume with that info on there if it's not happening. Not involved in BAP, I have no excuse for why I'm not other than moderate-severe social anxiety. 

Not involved in any other kinds of clubs or organizations. I don't know what kind of ""skills"" I can put on a resume, I already feel like an idiot saying I'm good at excel, I mean come on. My only job has been a nothing part-time shelving job for one summer, I tried to make it sound fancy but I think it's pretty obvious it's not. 

[Here's my resume.](http://i.imgur.com/XXaJp.jpg)

Basically I'd just like any advice. Anything I could consider for the resume. How I could format it better if I did a shitty job. Fill up blank space (the bottom 25% of the page is empty, can't really tell from the picture). What I could say to the firms. Big 4 and lots of other firms will be there. I planned on letting things happen ""naturally"" but I was thinking just like ""hi my name's jack jackertson I'm a junior, accelerated program, what's the application/recruitment process like, what do interns do,"" those kinds of things, and trying to keep it brief. I'm not terribly nervous about actually talking, I'm not quite sure why...though I do want to have plenty of time to get out a few panic attacks in the bathroom between firms.



Thanks guys.

**edit** [Here's an updated one.](http://i.imgur.com/FizbL.png) Still not ecstatic about it, but I think the formatting change definitely made it look less terrible. Also, got the email that I'm in that accelerated program, so that's nice! Not sure how to incorporate it, think I did alright. I'm thinking I should just cut activities/interests, I just can't think of anything to put there besides what I got. I mean, reddit, music, videogames, cruising wikipedia doesn't seem resume appropriate...what else is there in life? ""Continued independent study outside of classroom on miscellaneous topics""? That's an interest, right? "

10yocw,3,2012-10-04,How do you weigh the value of experience vs salary?,deyur,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10yocw/how_do_you_weigh_the_value_of_experience_vs_salary/,"I'm due to finish my Masters degree (Comp Sci) early next year, and am in the process of looking for jobs. I received a pretty low offer today, lower than what I'm really willing to accept, but it got me thinking. The company offering is pretty well-established, and have a graduate program which would allow for rotating through a number of different teams, getting a range of experience before choosing where I would want to work for them.

That sort of experience seems really valuable to me, and may pay off long-term. So now I'm starting to wonder - is it worth it to accept a lower salary in order to improve your chances of getting more relevant experience, so that you can command better positions in the future? How do people weigh the importance of experience over the salary which they're asking for? I imagine internships help fulfill this role, but if you haven't interned throughout your degree, is it worth working for cheap just to buff up your resume a bit?

I'm trying to negotiate a salary with them right now, but am expecting that they'll tell me that the offer they gave me is their standard grad rate and to take it or leave it. At that point I'm not really sure whether I should just suck it up for a couple of years, in the interests of having a stronger career five years from now."

[What are ""poobies?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hi5wm?context=5)|Haha, its kind of an inside joke with the characters.  but since most of the pooh characters are female, if the performer is a little..big chested..  pooh can sometimes look like he has some boobs.  so they are called poobies!
[What? No he can't. The Pooh costume is much too big around to show the performer's breasts.  Timon, on the other hand... ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hpwha?context=5)|Well it was a joke around the time i worked there.  if you lift up poohs shirt you can tell.  poohs big around his stomach but not as much around the chest.
[What is your favorite part about being a character performer?  (Also, aren't the costumes supposed to be ridiculously hot?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hbmdc?context=5)|My favorite part of being a character performer was seeing the guests face when they finally get to see you.  Most kids had this sense of awe in their faces and it was absolutely priceless.  I also loved goofing around with elderly people and making them feel young again, even if it was just for a minute. Best of all, I loved seeing the Make a Wish Foundation kids.  Disney allowed us to spend extra time with these kids so that we could create ""magical moments"" for them.  It was very special being a part of these kid's wishes.
[My friend was at Disney World and he told a story of when he was there was his daughter an older, big ole biker came walked up to one of the characters, I can't recall which one, and took a picture with the character, then went into some story about how hard his life was and how he was only happiest during the moments in his childhood where he escaped the abuse and retreated into the imagination of Disney and what not. He didn't hear all of it, but needless to say he said he could hear the performer inside the costume crying but still playing it all off very professionally.  The biker guy did apologize and said ""I understand you're just doing your job, and I'm sorry for venting, but I just had to."" and he walked away, teary eyed.  I wonder, have you ever had a similar situation like that occur? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hkgvd?context=5)|I have not.  thats a tough situation for both the guest and the character.
[You are an awesome human being.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hqabz?context=5)|:)
[The make a wish kids? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hcw3u?context=5)|Haha, no...the costumes lol.
[I heard they were airconditioned is that true or is that just the high end ones like mickey and goofy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hk6yg?context=5)|NONE of the costumes are air conditioned.  its a rumor.
[Mind blown. Thought they were air conditioned or had a built in fan... How long were your shifts? And did you emerge from som hidden door in the park? What's backstage like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hynbl?context=5)|The shifts were anywhere from 5-10 hours.  mine were typically 6 or 8.  but the characters are not on set the whole time.  if it was extremely hot outside the amount of outdoor set time would get reduced.  yes we did come from the tunnel doors.  they are all over the park.  backstage is not very exciting.  they are basically just tunnels with break rooms, cafeteria, bathrooms etc.  sometimes you'll see a character roaming around.  people always think the tunnels are some crazy underground city.  they arent lol.
[Proof? And what was the weirdest thing a kid/parent did that you saw/ did to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hasfl?context=5)|The weirdest/creepiest thing that ever happened to me was coming in contact with a child molester.  I noticed he seemed out of place being in line to visit chip and dale all by himself, with no camera or autograph book.  When it was finally his turn he just came up to me and petted my head and nose and didn't say a word.  I had a bad feeling about him and so did my attendant.  After visiting the chipmunks he went to see Pluto.  According to the girl who was ""friends with"" Pluto, he picked up Pluto's ear and literally whispered ""I'm a child molester.""  Obviously Pluto got off stage and told the manager.  Disney security was on him in an instant and his background check came back saying he was recently charged with child molestation. 
[Why on Earth would you tell somebody?  Edit: That you're a child molester to Pluto, not the manager.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hc9zm?context=5)|I don't think that people that enjoy molesting children are in any way sane.  You can't logically explain their behavior.  
[I'm glad you said 'enjoy' molesting children. There are people who are sexually attracted to children, but know it is wrong, and do everything in their power to stay away.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hosc5?context=5)|I've gotten pretty sensitive with my wording since i started working in psychology :p.
[Were the women who played snow white and all those other female roles good looking without makeup etc.. did you ever hook up with any of them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hczj7?context=5)|The girls were very pretty but definitely looked a lot different without their hair and makeup done up.  I am female myself and don't bat for that team ;)
[What kind of training is there to get a job like that?  And what kind of career can it lead to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6havtn?context=5)|The auditioning process is the hardest part.  It involves a ton of people and resembles what you would see on american idol.  If you are lucky enough to make it training isn't that hard, in fact, I thought it was fun.  It was about a week long for me and involved getting comfortable in the costume and working on nonverbal communication skills.  Disney also spends a lot of time going over their character integrity, even down to having their performers master their character's handwriting (which is way more difficult with chipmunk hands)  I'm not 100% sure what kind of careers it could lead to.  I would imagine and performing career would look positively upon having Disney on your resume.  Personally, I am now in the field of clinical psychology so this job was just a fun experience for me.  
[This probably happened before you worked there, but I will say that I still have my autograph book from my first Disney trip in 1996, and Chip and Dale had by far the best signatures.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hs4su?context=5)|Kid handwriting with a backwards ""e"" in dale ;)
[Do you prefer smooth or crunchy peanut butter?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hdpc7?context=5)|Haha, chipmunks prefer acorns ;)
[So you're saying you like nuts.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hl9jr?context=5)|Yes.  yes, i am.
[As an employee do you stay in the same character each day or do you get to be a different one periodically? What's your favorite character to be? How long were you in the suit in one continuos stretch before a break? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hd8w6?context=5)|You get switched around to other characters that are within your height range.  The performers get trained in multiple characters.  My favorite characters are the chipmunks.  Chip and dale's character is supposed to mischievous and playful.  I always got away with doing funny little things that weren't always disney approved.  But since it was part of the chipmunk character they didn't mind and the guests always loved it.  The length of the set was determined based on how hot it was outside and what location you were working.  A typical set was about 30 minutes long but sets indoors and character dining shifts were usually longer.  
[Would you say the job was generally an enjoyable one? Or was it just cool for a week and then hot and tiring and a grind like a normal job? I guess the real question is did it ever get boring?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hdk6n?context=5)|In general, the job was very enjoyable.  like any job, sometimes it got tiring, especially in the heat.  but not one day went by where i didn't have one guest that made my whole day worthwhile.  when days started to get tiring i just reminded myself where i was and what i was doing and i always cheered up.  i would be lying if i said the job never got routine, but anything you do for 40 plus hours a week will get this way.  it was still the most fun job i have ever had.  
[Were you ever accused of inappropriately touching a kid?  If not, how do they tell you to handle it?  Have you ever accidentally talked while in the suit?  Have you ever gotten tips from parents?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hd5uc?context=5)|No, I was never accused of inappropriately touching a kid.  Disney does a great job in training the performers how to avoid putting yourself in a situation in which you could be accused, especially during pictures.  The character attendant does all the guest verbal interactions since we can't talk.  I accidentally talked once, but luckily no one heard me.  I said god bless you when a guest sneezed!  oops.  Parents don't typically give us tips besides warning us that their child is shy or scared.  
[How about tips as in cash?  Have you ever seen horrible parenting or overprotective parenting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hdlu8?context=5)|We were never allowed to receive tips, but people also didn't really offer.  parents that bring their kids to disney typically want them to have fun so i didn't really see too much over protection.  i did, however, see some kids on leashes.  as a chipmunk i always had fun with those.  ;)
[Child leashes are probably the stupidest thing ever invented. Its degrading.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hdo8a?context=5)|Agreed.  but if it saves your crazy child from getting lost in disney world it might be worth it.  emphasis on the word MIGHT.
[Imo if your child is crazy enough to run away in Disney World, they shouldn't be there in the first place.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hg1z7?context=5)|True.  unless they have a disorder that causes them to behave like that.  
[What was the auditioning process like? Can you explain what questions they asked or what they required you to do? Did they have any prerequisites? Thanks for the AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hc88q?context=5)|No problem!  The audition process was intense.  There were a lot of people auditioning.  Everyone gets there early to get their audition number and warm up.  The audition involved two parts: dance and animation.  The dance part was basically an instructor teaching the room a dance.  She went very fast so having experience picking up choreography is definitely helpful.  After being taught the dance we had to perform it in front of a panel in groups of 5.  Then we went to animation.  Here they basically gave us a scenario and we had to animate it (non verbally of course) to the panel.  After all of this they basically called numbers and either told you a yes, no or that you were in the pool of maybes.  Anyone can audition, however you will probably have a rough time with no prior dance experience.
[I have to ask - those suits must be hot. How often are you allowed breaks to cool off? What happens if you get sick in your suit? How long are you typically at a meet and greet before you're able to take a break?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hbjmo?context=5)|They are VERY hot and do not believe the rumors you may hear that the costumes have air conditioning because it is very untrue.  The length of the meet and greet depends on how hot it is outside. On extremely hot days I had meet and greets as short as 20 minutes long.  Typically, they run about 30-40 min per set.  It is frowned upon to get sick in costume.  If the performer feels they are getting sick they are allowed to run off set in the middle of a greet.  People have gotten sick in their costume and it involves extensive cleaning by other disney employees.
[Now I can't belt by feel bad when I see them...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hdwtq?context=5)|We get plenty of breaks and gatorade backstage so its bearable.  but if the attendant says that the character needs to go inside for a minute, by all means, don't try to hold the character back.  as happy as they are pretending to be, they really need that break.
[How do you guys deal with awkward questions from kids and gotcha questions from nerds?  Like asking Goofy or Max what happened to his wife, or asking Rapunzel why her hair is long and blonde again?  Or how a character that was killed off is still walking around the park, like Jafar or Gaston?  Or why the Beast is a monster again after Belle changed him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hjpxy?context=5)|Well, luckily the fur characters can't talk so i never had to deal with that.  the face characters are trained how to answer those questions.  
[How are the underground tunnels? Where's the most interesting place you've been while working there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hcmr4?context=5)|The underground tunnels are not as exciting as people imagine.  It is cool to walk around under the magic kingdom, but in all honestly, they are literally just tunnels.  There's dressing rooms, storage rooms, break rooms and a cafeteria down there.  The most interesting place has to be the costuming room.  Without going into too much detail, it is shocking to walk into a room full of your favorite disney characters just hanging on hangers.  You can spend a lot of time just walking around, looking at all the different characters.  Also, if you spend some time near costuming you will most likely see some half costumed characters roaming around, which is always a funny sight.  
[Goofy is hitting on sleeping beauty wtf!?!  I could totally see this happening :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hdwnn?context=5)|There was never a dull moment around costuming :p.
[Did you apply to get your job as the ""friends of Chip and Dale"" or did you just apply for the job and they stuck you wherever it was that they put you? Do you have to option to switch positions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hb3d0?context=5)|No, you just audition to be a character performer.  They place you as characters according to your height.  Chip and dale must be between about 5'1 and 5'4.  You can get scheduled and trained to be any character within your height range.  The face characters (princesses for example) are a little different.  You audition specifically for face characters.
[What characters are in the 5'5-5'6 range?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hnf47?context=5)|Mrs. incredible, mr. smee, pluto, rafiki, carl fredrickson.  i am sure there is more.
[What characters would a 5'9 person be able to ""be friends with""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hgb3y?context=5)|I believe 5'9 includes tigger, goofy, beast, genie, rafiki, woody and possibly buzz. i am sure there are others as well.
[What about taller folk, out of curiosity? Any work for someone 6'7?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hke09?context=5)|To be honest i am really not sure.  i think the tallest characters are goofy, woody, beast and jafar (im sure i am missing some)  i know they are all close to or over 6 foot.  if there are characters that tall you would probably be sure to get a spot!  during the star wars convention they have chewbacca out on set and he is really big!
[When I was there Chewie was in the book as 6'11""-7'1"" :-\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6i1vpd?context=5)|WOW haha.  i knew he looked big!
[I've spoken with a WDW employee, and they said that the job, while fun for a short time, wasn't something they'd like to do for any significant period of time.  What are the main differences in benefits, hours, and working conditions between character performers and regular employees? Do the two groups hang out, or what?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hdfnl?context=5)|This is true.  My internship was 7 months long and I think that it was a perfect amount of time to be there.  It does get draining being out in the heat every day and the pay isn't good enough to continue for a long period.  Every job at disney is different but most of them do involve being out in the heat.  As far as benefits and wages for college program employees, the jobs are pretty much equal.  I believe character performers, photopass, and life guards get paid the highest, but not by much.  Hours vary a lot within jobs.  I know merchandising cast members always had crazy hours.  The performers typically had good hours since they are only working when the park is open.  All college program cast members hung out all the time, and I believe the regular cast members did as well.  
[Are there any repercussions for taking off a piece of your costume while in the park? I mean, if the kids saw your face while you're wearing the rest of the costume, that would be pretty darn devastating.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hbxgx?context=5)|Yes.  The repercussion for taking off a piece of your costume would be immediate termination from the company.  There may even be some legal repercussions, but don't take my word on that.  Disney is extremely strict with their character integrity and if you did anything to tarnish it you will be fired without question.
[In 2007 I took the ""Keys To The Kingdom"" tour at the Magic Kingdom.  In one of the backstage areas we passed by a Jessie with her mask off, and the tour guide seemed to get a little flustered that we were seeing that :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hl0vb?context=5)|Yeah we were always warned when the tour came through.  they purposely dont take you past costuming.  and the characters are supposed to stay in that area if they arent fully dressed.  but they dont always listen.
[We tried to take a 007esque picture with Minnie mouse making her fingers into the shape of a gun. She made the peace sign instead. I figured it was against the rules.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hdxth?context=5)|Yep, making gun symbols is definitely not allowed.  you have to remember that other cultures interpret hand gestures differently than americans.  what may be a funny gesture to us may be rude and offensive to someone else.  also, many of the characters don't have all 5 fingers, including mickey, minnie and the chipmunks.  this makes hand gestures difficult :p.
[My first day at MK I was walking up the hill in the Utilidor and suddenly Chip's head goes rolling by me down the hill followed by a ""headless"" Chip -- quite the intro to the magic for me :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6i1wpm?context=5)|Yeah its always a shock to the new CPs to see headless characters wandering around like its no big deal.
[Is it true that Disney spoils the crap out of their character performers? Do they have like a snack bar, and HDTV in the break room, and lots of other fun stuff?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hhnea?context=5)|I don't think we got spoiled lol.  they provide us with free gatorade (for obvious reasons)  other cast members got jealous sometimes because the characters are constantly on break.  if my set was 30 minutes long i would do the set and then have a 30 minute break while the other set of chipmunks went on set.  we would switch off for the whole length of the shift.  this was so the characters wouldnt get overheated.  the other cast members would just see us on break a lot and get a little jealous, lol.  but yes, we did have tvs to entertain us on our off time.
[I seen a Disney commercial a few months ago for an app the you can use in the park.  They said something along the lines of it showing you where your favorite characters are.  Any idea how that works?  Are there chips in the suits or do you just have a certain area to be in at a certain time, and can only roam so far from that area?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hdgjf?context=5)|In the past the characters were free to roam around wherever they wanted.  If they roamed around this way now the character would get swamped and surrounded by guests in two seconds.  It was actually scary how people would run at us as soon as we walked on stage.  Because of this, the characters now how exact spots to be in at exact times.  Often, there are lines waiting for the character before they even get on set.  The app just tells you where the characters will be and at what time.  
[That's amazing!  I went to Disney World a good 10 years ago and I remember all the characters wondering around, even then they did get pretty bogged down by all the kids.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hdpo0?context=5)|In all honesty, the adults are worse than the kids.  but the tour groups are by far the worst.
[Brazilian Tour Groups...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hhaw8?context=5)|Precisely.

[Are there any creepy people who play the characters? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hcge7?context=5)|I never met any creepy people.  Disney is very particular and strict on who they hire.  Most of the characters are young (18-30).  Many of them are in the college program.  
[Do the costumes smell like BO or are they thouroughly washed after each use? Are there multiple people performing as the same character in different places or is there only 1 of each at any time? I assume there are multiple costumes of the same character though?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hjcrg?context=5)|They wash the costumes after every single use.  they don't smell at all.  they are a few sets of each character working on each shift, so that the characters can take a break.  but there is only one of that character in the park at a single moment.  part of the disney magic is the idea that there is only one of each character.  there are many costumes of each character tho.
[The last time I was at Disneyland, I ran into (I think\) Pilot Mickey in California Adventure... we then walked directly from there to Mickey's house, to find him hanging out there.  Are you certain that only one of each character exists at any particular time, and do they take it seriously enough to account for ""travel time"" when changing a character's location around the park?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hoz2k?context=5)|They really really try to to account for travel time but i dont think it always happens.  you may have just been in the right place at the right time.  but yes, there is only one character out at a time.  when a parade started up i always got to take a long break till it was over because the munks were in the parade. 
[What was your favorite part of that job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hcnmm?context=5)|Definitely people's reactions.  refer to previous posts.
[How long did you work as a performer and what made you quit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hbrjw?context=5)|I participated in the Disney College Program.  It was about 7 months long and I worked as a performer the whole time.  When my internship was over I moved back home to finish college.  
[I have been looking in to this program at my school and it looks amazing. Would you recommend doing it and taking time off school for it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hi1eq?context=5)|Absolutely, 100% yes.  if you can, try to take online classes through your school while your there.  or they have classes that you can take as part of your program.  just make sure the classes will count for your major BEFORE you take them.  i was in the middle of a change of major and the classes i took during the program didnt end up counting for anything for me..kind of a bummer.  if you do the program i would highly recommend going for a character audition!  if you make the audition you automatically have a job as a performer.  if not, they can pretty much give you any job they want, and some jobs are definitely more desired than others.. you will meet a ton of great people!  i did my program in 2009 and have seen my friends from the program for a reunion every year since then!
[Have you ever had a bratty kid? One that you really didn't want to take a picture with or something like that.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hhoev?context=5)|Yup, everyday.  if they were bratty enough i would just turn my back when they tried to get a picture.  i got away with it since i was a chipmunk ;)
[How much were you paid to hang out with kids and have fun.? Sounds ideal. :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hc90f?context=5)|Not much, especially since I was in the college program.  It was a little over minimum wage, but in complete honesty, I would have done this job for free.  I loved it. I basically got paid to hug kids and make their day.  And I would end my night shift with the fireworks going off above the castle.  Doesn't get much better.  
[Did you get discounts to the park or something like that, for yourself and family? What's the worst thing that ever happened to you while you were performing? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hg4ya?context=5)|We got into the parks for free whenever we want and got HUGE discounts on pretty much anything.  i got 40-50% off resorts which my family took advantage of all the time.  for a while they were giving us 40% off any merchandise too.  also they give you a certain amount of maingates, which as basically free passes for your friends and family to come into the park. two pretty crappy things happened to me.  once, i got surrounded by a huge tour group who literally saw me and ran at me.  i was completely surrounded and couldnt see anything (the costumes have pretty limited vision)  the kids in the group were just very aggressive and were hitting me.  my attendant finally found me in the crowd, took my hand and pulled me out.  it was kinda scary.  the other crappy thing that happened was a kid poked the eye of dale and it actually fell off, which meant that the kid could see straight into the costume head.  i just ran off set as fast as possible.
[In case you're still answering: How does the performers behave in the backstage? Do you all hang out together? Was this a common thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hj59s?context=5)|We all hung out and got along for the most part.  if there were no managers around we would misbehave a little bit.  ""characters gone wild"" happened once in a while.  i got a lap dance from tigger once.  theres a first for everything!
[Orlando, eh? I probably took a picture with you at some point :\). What character was regarded as being the most fun to play within your circle of colleagues? Which ones paid the most? I always figured the singing characters on the parades were more of an actual actor/singer role, no offense. Which costume was the most punishing in the central Florida heat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hieye?context=5)|Haha you probably have taken a pic with me!  the chipmunks were def the most fun.  the other characters were always jealous of what the munks got away with doing without getting in trouble.  it was fun being mischievous, and the guests always loved it.  plus, the chipmunks are always on set together, so it was fun always having a partner at work.  the face characters get paid more than the fur characters.  and yes, the performers who sing and do acrobats and stuff get paid more.  however, it is very hard to get those roles because a lot of them are taken up by cast members who have been with disney all their life.
 |Oh, and the most punishing character, from what i hear, is either beast or sully.
[So which character was the one nobody wanted to be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hf4bs?context=5)|I know some performers who did playhouse disney characters and that kinda got old after a while.  when i was there, russel from UP had an absolutely terribly uncomfortable costume.  and dug from UP had to deal with people constantly yelling ""squirrel"" at him.  all of the pooh characters who worled in the crystal palace had a rough time too.
[Don't know if you've seen this vid of pluto chasing a kid Link to www.youtube.com.  How common is it for cast members to break the rules of their character? What is the worst example you've heard?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hkdj8?context=5)|It is not very common for cast members to break character.  they know that if they do they will be immediately fired.  so the risk isnt really worth it.  i've heard of characters speaking to kids and then when the child told their parents the character would just shake their head and pretend like the kid was crazy.  that was just word of mouth tho, i never actually seen it happen.  most people like their job and want to keep it.
[How many times were you kicked in the balls? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hiklm?context=5)|Well, being female, i don't have balls..but i was punched in the chest many times!  
[How did that go down?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hk7b0?context=5)|Not too fun.  but there was a lot of padding to the costumes so i survived!
[Was it worth working at Disney?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hikiy?context=5)|Absolutely, yes.  if you are going there to make a lot of money then its probably a bad idea because the pay isn't great.  but it was an experience of a lifetime for me.
[I was at Disneyland one night and saw about six characters standing in a row, side by side, just grinning from ear to ear and looking out into the distance. I looked down and saw that they were casually trying to hide a person who was on the ground and in need of medical attention. I understand that the happiest place on earth wouldn't want to draw attention to such things, but it was really creepy. So, does the company tell you in orientation that one day you may have to hide a body with your smile? Did you ever witness or hear about any coverups like this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hweu3?context=5)|No i have never heard of such a thing.  i would think having the characters stand around the body would just draw attention to it.. that is really bizarre.
[When you're trained as a character performer, are you trained to do anything that a character does?  Are you limited to do just autographs, or do you learn autographs, parades and shows?  What I'm really getting at is can anyone be Mickey in Fantasmic, or are you specially trained for that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hm4pn?context=5)|You will start as just a character who does meet and greets.  this includes photos and autographs.  disney gives you a special code based on your dance and animation skills.  if it is high enough you have the potential to get trained in parades.  the shows, like fantasmic, are very very very hard to get a part it because they are pretty much taken up by full time cast members who have been with disney forever.
[1\) Best moment on the job?  2\) Why did you get in to the job? 3\) Why did you quit (or get fired\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6htzhd?context=5)|1) all of the make a wish kids that i got to greet.  2) i got into the job because i love disney and i love performing.  3) my internship ended.
[Are there any interesting unused or really old costumes sitting in the costume room?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hkwpb?context=5)|Yes, there were characters that i didn't even know existed.  one was clarebell cow..all of the costumes have been used, but some of them are pretty old characters.  disney pulls out special, rare characters for special events and holidays so those are always fun sound holidays.  costuming at hollywood studies is pretty fun because you get all of the pixar characters and even star wars stuff.
[Do they have Darkwing Duck? Because they should.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hmd57?context=5)|I've never seen him, but that doesnt mean he doesnt exist!
[Awesome AMA! I've always wanted to work at Disney but I never went to college. Is it true that they only hire college students or people who have degrees? I am fluent in Brazilian Portuguese, would that help me at all or would it not even matter because I don't have a degree? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hmdrw?context=5)|For the college program you have to either be currently in college or just graduated.  but to be hired as a regular cast member you do not need to be in college or have a degree!  being bilingual will def be an advantage for you.  i would apply online and see what happens!
[Bilingual in any languages?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10wppg/i_was_a_character_performer_at_walt_disney_world/c6hov25?context=5)|Yes, i am sure thats definitely an advantage.  especially if you want to work in epcot.

I just got contacted by like literally my dream company. I was first sent an email asking me if I was looking for an internship, which I am.
I then received a call a couple of days later from a recruiter who wants to interview me for a full-time position. It's not set in stone, he said he can't promise me a position but he can promise that he likes my resume, my phone interview went really well, and he would like to meet me. He gave me his name and cell number

My question is, I REALLY REALLY want to work witth this company, BUT I am part of two amazing research projects right now at my university, and I would feel really incomplete to just leave these projects unfinished (especially when each professor has told me they are publication worthy, which I can add on my resume). I also would love to do my thesis on one of these topics.

I really want to ask them to consider me for an internship, but I am afrraid that if I ask that, they'll be like ""hmmm well he doesn't seem to be interested in a full-time opportunity, so let's forget that, and he's a masters student so he's overqualified, so hmmm see ya later""

What should I do? I REALLY wanna work for this company once I get my masters, and I really feel very strongly about not leaving my current projects unfinished. Especially since they can be extra notches on my resume."

Being single isn't fun to me. I'm sorry, it's not. I'm naturally an extrovert so being without people makes me depressed and lethargic. I'm a touchy feely person so I like having someone I can cuddle and kiss and hug. I like sex but due to the fact I was sexually assaulted in the past, I'm very particular about who I sleep with which means no one night stands or fwb relationships. I like making plans and creating memories and sharing ideas. All of these activities are best done with people you care about and who care about you. 

I've had people argue that I must not be happy with myself/I must be an incomplete person if I want a partner. No, I am pretty happy with who I am honestly. I think I'm pretty funny, I'm kind, I'm giving, I'm intelligent and I'm attractive. I would make a damn good girlfriend. I don't understand what is so pathetic about wanting a partner....we're human beings, we usually live in groups, it's normal for us to want that closeness to people. 

Another thing I often hear is to ""just focus on/take care of you"".....but no one ever tells you what the FUCK that means. Getting your hair/nails done? Working out? Cooking? Doing your own hobbies? Trying new things? These are all routine, these are things I make a point to do whether I'm single or not. When you already take care of you, when it's a staple in your life, then wtf are you supposed to do more of?

Idk. Additionally, I had a friend of mine tell me that people ""choose whether or not they want to be happy"". I swear...not yelling at her was one of the hardest things I've had to do in a while. This woman goes to a 30,000 a semester university that is paid for my scholarship and her parents, she's studying abroad in Rome currently, she got a paid internship at Penguin Publishing Company in NYC last semester, she has a long term boyfriend who has pretty much already proposed to her, and she's doing all of this as a creative writing major. I'm sorry, but as far as ""choosing to be happy"" WHO THE FUCK WOULDN'T BE HAPPY WITH THAT?! Seriously. Does it ever occur to her that while she's spouting this to me that I'm sitting alone in my house, living next to a fucking farm in the middle of bumfuck nowhere, and barely even making enough to keep myself afloat and pay for online classes at a community college?

I'm interested in running obviously and more specifically, event management, so this was pretty much a no brainer. Dave is a 3rd tier contact for me, so it wasn't too hard to get his contact info. Just had to reach through two other people. Dave was really nice, and incredibly quick to get back with me, and as the icing on the cake, let me add him on LinkedIn! Have to make those connections!

If you have any questions, let me know, otherwise, here's what Dave has to say about a few various questions I proposed. 

He also knows I'm putting this up on the forum, I asked and he okayed it! 

*How did you get involved with the B.A.A. and what has been the path that has taken you to race director?*

**Started in 1988.  In 1987, there were issues at the start of the race and so the BAA felt a need to hire someone to help address those and so, voila!!  They hired me as the Technical Coordinator, then I was called the Technical Director and then the Race Director in 2001…all along my job responsibilities remained about the same….just making sure there are no mess ups!**    

*How many Boston Marathons have you run?*

**I have run 40 in a row…15 during the day and then 25 at night after my duties as race director are over.**

*What’s your best memory as race director?* 

**Probably helping to direct the 100th Boston with almost 40,000 in the race.**

*If you could change things and go back and redo your path to where you currently are, what would you change?*

**Business wise (I own my own event management business – DMSE, Inc.) maybe “own” more events then just managing them.  Seems like there is a huge market out there now for events!**

*What advice would you give to someone interested in working in the running industry, be it a sales rep, a race director, or anything in between?*

**Nothing better than to work at something you love and are passionate about but it is very, very labor intensive…you get “married” to it and the toughest part is slowing down and/or saying no sometimes.**

*The Boston Marathon is arguably the most famous marathon in the world, what have you done as the race director to preserve that image and prevent the Boston Marathon from losing that luster?*

**My job is to maintain the quality of the race itself and make sure that it all goes well for ALL the participants in the race.  I hope I have succeeded at that over the past 25 years.**

*This year you made it harder to qualify for Boston by making the qualifying times lower, what was the impetus behind that decision and what has been the general reaction to that decision?*

**The worst thing was turning qualifiers away. Didn’t make sense…people work hard, qualify, think they are in but in the end they are not. We had to respond to the marketplace and did.  It is working like a charm now.**

*The Boston Marathon is already a massive race, one that is planned out years in advance, how do you plan to continue to grow the name of the Boston Marathon or grow the actual race?*

**To grow participation wise, you need more real estate.  We just don’t have it.  We are not going to jeopardize the quality of the race for quantity. We could just be maxed out where we are right now…maybe room for slight growth but not much.**

*Do you foresee any big changes in the “marathon world” that you perhaps would be more privy to knowing compared to runners who don’t work in the industry?* 

**Nothing earth shattering but you never know.  Technology seems to be driving a lot of what we do now so nothing will surprise me.**

*What has been the greatest challenge for you as the race director of one of the most notable marathons in the world?* 

**Probably making needed changes (like changing the start time or instituting wave starts) while also maintaining the history and tradition of this 116 year old race.**

*What do you see as the greatest threat to the continued growth of the Boston Marathon over the next 5 years? 10 years?* 

**As stated above, SPACE, or lack of.**  

*How is the Boston Athletic Association and therefore the Boston Marathon adapting to the ever changing world of sports with particular emphasis to social media? E.g., Twitter, Youtube, LinkedIn, Facebook, Blogs, etc.* 

**Not my area of the race but I do believe the BAA is keeping pace with social media as much as possible and reasonable. I find all of this overwhelming myself!!!**

*How is the Boston Athletic Association and therefore the Boston Marathon encouraging the growth of distance running among young American athletes considering that distance running is often an overlooked sport and one that does not necessarily “captivate” the hearts of the masses?*

**The BAA does a lot with local schools and youth running.  We have numerous youth programs in place already and will continue to develop those programs over the years.  This is a very important initiative of the BAA.**

*What do you see as the general direction/trend of distance running and what do you think is the driving cause of that direction/trend?* 

**Continued growth in participation. The walls of intimidation have crumbled.  People get it now.  It’s not as much about competition as it is about participation.  It’s about building self-esteem and self-confidence.   I think we are still seeing just the tip of the iceberg.** 

*I plan on doing my internship over my last two semesters with the U.S. Air Force Marathon. If you could offer any suggestions that a new intern could bring to a fast growing and successful marathon such as the AF Marathon to make a very positive impact, what would that be?* 

**Maybe try to be involved in EVERY aspect of the event to gain an appreciation for what everyone does.  As a Race Director, I actually consider myself a “conductor” like in an orchestra.   Thus, my main job is to surround myself with the very best in all the different areas of the event.  I just keep them all going, all motivated, all inspired so as to insure that the end product is the very best that it can be.**

10y4sb,5,2012-10-04,"Full disclosure, or take the hint?",Dr_Santa,AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/10y4sb/full_disclosure_or_take_the_hint/,"Hello /r/AskWomen, I would like your help on getting some perspective on my situation.
The long story of this goes as follows: I have always been a chubby kid, and I adapted to my situation by putting on a thick skin and trying to be funny. In high school I was bullied by some people I had considered friends, and of course they would make fun of me for being fat. I believe this contributed to me developing a rather negative self-image, which put a damper on my ability to show interest and pursue relationships with the ladyfolk. Consequently, I have never had a serious relationship or any type of sexual contact, and I am 23 now. That situation is not good, in fact I would say it is very bad.


I think I sort of went into a downward spiral when I moved away from home to go to college and my bad consumption habits had free reign. I was at a personal worst last December: no job, out of shape, very fat, ate nothing but fast food, smoked a lot of pot, played games all day, and I was doing the bare minimum for my classes. I felt really unhealthy and I eventually had to confront myself and make some changes to avert impeding bodily disasters like a heart attack or diabetes


A few months prior to hitting rock bottom I had become friends with a rather peculiar but very cool young lady through shared our shared interest in marijuana. I think getting some perspective on her life made me realize how, well… pathetic I felt. She was a much better student than I, working an internship, in good physical shape, and just seemed to have her life in order. Even though she was three years younger than me, she had far surpassed me in overall life excellence. I considered her a remarkable individual and I had an interest in pursuing a romantic relationship with her, but it was apparent to me that she was out of my league. On the 1-10 scale I estimated her to be a solid 8 and I was like a 4. With such a disparity of apparent worth it seemed it would be inappropriate and rude for me to make any non-platonic advances towards her. 


But still, I felt like we had really good mental chemistry and she was like everything I could want out of a romantic partner. We are both very logical, analytical, well read, cultured, sophisticated as fuck, sarcastic, slightly evil, and somewhat conceited. With these traits, I don’t think either of us often meet people we really click with. With a lot of people I feel like even when they are present I am mentally alone, and I believe she feels the same way.


Anyways, starting in January I made some changes, started eating healthier, started exercising, and really tried to grow as a person and cultivate a better life for myself. I have sworn off soda, snack foods, fast food, started running daily, working out at the gym, and just spending more time outside and less time on the internets. I have lost a lot of weight since then, I’ve dropped ~75lbs and gained some muscle mass. Friends and family frequently comment on how I’m looking great now, which is sort of uncomfortable for me but still very cool. I felt really unattractive before, but I like what I see in the mirror now. I would say my lady friend inspired me to strive for greater personal excellence, and I would like to tell her about this.


I would say I’ve been working on my body image as a means to work up the nerve to ask her out, so for me there has been a lot of build-up to this. About a week ago I got drunk while we were hanging out and I made a pass at her by saying something to the effect that I find her very cool and very attractive, and she reciprocated by saying she thinks I am pretty cool and she values our plutonic friendship. I am wondering if I should tell her just how deep my feelings go, and the effect she has had on me, or if I should take what seems to be a very clear social cue that she is not interested in me in that way and let it go. So I turn it over to you, /r/AskWomen, how would you respond if you were put into a similar situation?



TL;DR: Developed a crush on a friend, used that as motivation to lose weight and improve self-image. 75lbs of weight loss later I politely make a pass at her, and am politely turned down. Want to know if I should press further and let her know what’s up, or take the hint, let it go, and move on?

i made a mistake when designing a part for my internship, i took priority of part simplicity vs availability of mounting screws.

Long story short i was making several aluminum spacers for firror mounts for my job/internship at my CSU's research project on atmospheric lidar.

i designed the spacer to be able to be fabricated with ease. the spacer has 2 through holes that a bolt goes through and screws into the mirror on the other side. unfortunately this requires a fairly long bolt that i cannot really find exactly. 

the bolt needs to screw into an M4 size thread and needs to be 85mm long. i found some that were 80mm but that only leaves 1 or 2 mm worth of threads on the end to bolt on, definitely not prime. i was not able to find anything quite that long online.
http://www.largescalerc.com/search.aspx?find=m4x80
and also on amazon

where would i be able to find these bolts (M4x85mm with socket wrench heads)? i need at minimum 4. only the end 1-1.5 cm needs to be threaded, but if the whole thing was threaded thatd be fine too. the parts are already off to anodizing so i need to find the 85 before i order the 80 to ensure it all works.

can anybody help me out? im sorry if this is the wrong thread."

",lyrelord,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10xl7w/what_bs_have_you_made_your_friendsrelatives/,"here's my story : I'm an intern at a dental college. About 4-5 months back I was sitting with my batch mates discussing stuff. I had just recently started twiddling my thumbs involuntarily. 

So i was just twiddling my thumbs while talking, and a batch mate interrupted me and asked me what i was doing with my hands. When i looked around, apparently everyone was perplexed at my mad skills(i still to date have no idea why none of those people knew what i was doing[probably cuz i live in Bhopal,India]). 

So this was my explanation :

 ""well i recently read in a dental journal that this a very basic way of sterilising your hands. And by the way, you should all subscribe to the international dental journal online, there are some excellent articles up there(added this to make my BS more believable). So the science involved is basically simple. when your thumbs go round and round, there's a formation of a couple, which induces a magnetic field. Now when you use the air rotar(the drill we use to cut the enamel and dentin of the tooth), the bacteria present in the vicinity and on the tooth gets electrically charged as the air rotar runs on electricity. Therefore, the magnetic field made by your thumbs pulls the electrically charged particles towards it making all the bacteria on your hand move into the magnetic field. Now you do this for about 3 minutes, and then, you do [this](http://i.imgur.com/N3q2T.jpg) . When you separate your thumbs, the magnetic field gets divided into 2, and it releases upwards along with all the electrically charged bacteria leaving your hands sterilised""

I fuck with you not, my batch mates believed this for about 3 months after which i just HAD to tell those gullible souls that i was messing with them cuz our teachers were looking at us all weird (Imagine 9 people sitting together twiddling their thumbs in unison with a serious look on their faces). I got the shit kicked outta me that day(while crying and laughing at the same time). But, it was all so so worth it.

P.S. I always sucked at physics. And apparently, so do my friends.
 Also, people usually believe what i say. Probably cuz I say it with a lotta confidence. I once convinced a friend that Shakespeare's real name was Shishipa Iyer and that he was from south India and also he fled to England while he was still a baby with his parents during the dark ages of the British colonization and then his parents changed his name to Shakespeare."

I know what 'going from being a know to a doer' is. I even know all the benefits of not drinking, or quitting drinking is. I've gone dry for a maximum of maybe two weeks at best. Yet, I keep setting myself up for failure, being a knower, preaching what I don't practice, and generally being an asshole. I keep winding down this path of self-destruction. Walking down the steps of madness into the basement of self-pity and laying on a cold ground of lamentation. Alone again, depressed again, buzzed again.


As of writing, It's a little past four A.M. and was awoken by my roommate laughing her stupid ass off, drunk as a skunk. Meanwhile, I couldn't sleep because I myself have been drinking. I figured this out when I looked at my bank statement seeing I took a cab home, and realized I'm yet another forty dollars lighter in the wallet. Everyone thinks I've gone dry to a degree. I'm buzzed, not drunk. I'm certainly depressed, and most certainly angry with myself. I can't seem to get myself together anymore. No matter what I do, I end up doing the same stupid shit: looking for a way to drink. Every stupid-fucking day, I look for an excuse, or a way into a drink, a way out of a drink, it's something that teeter-totters in my mind. It's that loose pendulum: instead of laying watching it fall towards me about to cut me in half, I opt to just jump into it. I'm sick of it and can't figure it out.


A little preface: I'm recently twenty-four. I've been drinking every day since about the age of twenty-one. I'm a senior in an art school. I would've graduated earlier but since I decided to fall in love and drop out, here I am, the oldest kid in an art school. I live in a bullshit city where everybody drinks (Chicago) and am growing tired of it. Everywhere there is a bar, a liquor store, a hipster looking for an angry fix, a group of dopes walking to the next bar, a fucking drunk begging for quarters in the middle of the street. I've become so isolated because everyone knows I want to quit drinking, yet, a few know that I keep doing it. I've tried going dry, and have had minor success but end up hitting the pink-cloud and drowning in a mug.


The night before I had a long day. I had school early in the morning, I'm on my way to becoming a tutor. Rather than discuss the readings involving pedagogy, we made clay bones for some stupid girls internship. I came home, and my roommates were already drinking, it was in the middle of the fucking afternoon, I.E. it was noon. I sat and played Nazi-Zombies to block it out. An hour later, I had to go to work. Bear in mind: I hate my job, I'm a barista, I won't say where, but it begins and ends with S and it certainly 'sucks.' After a long tiring day, I take the bus home, and mind you, it's two busses considering Chicago was designed by a schizophrenic because of the stupid grid system.


Guess what? I walk into a bar alone and start drinking. I tell myself I wouldn't do that, but I do. Why? I sat there alone, drinking shitty hipster lager and bullshit well-whiskey, hating the people next to me, hating the person sitting on my stool. I hate the bartender for asking me if I wanted another one. Why didn't I say no? Why didn't I smash the shot glass against my forehead and plead guilty to alcoholism? I lied to her, another five dollars to the wind, another unsuccessful night.


Fast forward to this afternoon: I get home after a wretched mentoring session. Part of becoming a tutor is shadowing, and the person I shadow under is a timid idiot-sophmore script-writer with doe-eyes and no conviction. I get home, and then invite my wast-of-life roommate out for drinks. Why the fuck do I do that?! Now who has no conviction? We eat pizza, drink crappy beer, and I go off to do homework at the local cafe. Guess what? I drink more. Even worse: It's expensive! Overpriced dare I say. I sit there, trying to do homework but by this time, I'm deep into it.  


About an hour ago, I wake up needing to go to the bathroom. I can't sleep anyway because I feel so shitty for myself. My roommate is laughing her stupid ass off, looking at pictures of cats (Who doesn't) only she's wasted. It's the idontfuckingknowhowmanynights in a row she's been drunk. I get up, pretending to walk to the bathroom. I stand and look at her, my only words: ""What."" She laughs, saying she killed a bottle of merlot, saying 'I should go to bed.' and stumbles into her room where her boyfriend is passed out from being a champion at life (the one I was drinking with earlier). It's an image that sticks out: Her red-face, surrounded by garbage, a full ashtray, empty cans that have been there for days, her beat up brand-new mac book, and cursive-eyes and inability to sit up straight. Worst off: that stupid, indiscriminate stare coupled with a hanging laugh in her throat. She was me a year ago before I realized I had a problem, and she's always drank more than me.


The thing is, is that I know it's fucking crap: I don't like drinking, I hate drinking. I hate sitting there, sipping the same stupid shitty fucking beer or whiskey and paying for it too. Yet, I keep doing it like it's the only thing I know how to do. I'll tell anyone that I don't like drinking. I'll say I hate drunk people. I'll lose sleep over this like I am now. I'll tell my friends I'm going dry. I'll lie to them and say I've gone without a drink. I'll lie to myself and make up the amount of days I've gone without a drink. Even if it's just a beer, two beers, I hate it. Yet, it continues, 'and so it goes' I'm told, 'we all have a vice' I'm told, 'the drinking will continue until the economy/morale/state of mind/state of the union/state of affairs/credit reports improve' I'm told. I know it's a lie. I know it's stupid blue-collar bullshit mantras that make it seem like alcohol is an acceptable daily ritual. Hell, I watched fucking Cheers on a night where I craved the worst. Who the fuck laughs at that shit? Norm is an alcoholic and in a real world, would have had his drunk ass divorced knowing he was at that bar nightly.


I know I'm surrounded by alcoholics: all my life I have been around it too. Both my parents. My bi-polar brother. My parents split on a night of heavy drinking. Two uncles died of this shit. Every family argument starts from this shit. My long-time girlfriend dumped my sorry ass because it blurred all my problems into me being in a zombie-like comatose. My stupid classmates update their Facebooks with ""Omigerd heres a picture of my retarded cat, I'm drinking forties!"" Meanwhile, my classmates don't do their homework, and complain of hangovers, meanwhile, I can't get my stupid homework done because I too was drinking to incapacitation, and I'm not hungover, feeling like an asshole. My apartment is a mess because my roommates are either drunk or high, and one of them works only ten hours a week. My birthday was a week ago, I get a text from that same ex wishing me well and that she couldn't come out. I was told to have a few for her, the irony kills me. Even my father called wishing me a happy birthday, but since he's somewhat of idiot, he told me someone I knew was killed by a drunk driver. Happy birthday family style right?


How do I break this cycle? No really Reddit. I know, I know damn well. I'm sick of it. I don't like it, I crave it, but I hate it. I don't want it, but I end up needing it. I don't enjoy it, yet I do it. How do I break the hand thats rocking the cradle? How do I fight the isolation? If I don't drink, the am I not participating? How does one beat the lonely submission? 


""How do I break from the cycle of drinking?"" Is what I'm asking. Because I know there are some atoned fellows here (I read, never post) and I need your help more than ever. Thanks.

10xdcg,7,2012-10-04,My first degree is in Music. I'm in my last semester of a second bachelor's (equivalent) degree in CS. Should I keep putting the former on resumes?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/10xdcg/my_first_degree_is_in_music_im_in_my_last/,"Admittedly, I'm proud of my work in music, but my resume gets some weird looks at career fairs. My internship over the summer was with a company whose recruiters thought it was kinda cool that I had musical experience, but I think I could consider myself lucky that they felt that way. I suspect that it may be leaving some employers doubtful that I'm committed to my more recently-chosen career.

By ""bachelor's equivalent,"" I mean something my university calls a Graduate Certificate in CS, which consists entirely of Math and CS stuff through the college senior level. It's basically designed for people who already have a degree in some unrelated field and want to enter the IT profession in a typical, entry-level capacity."

In other words, how to stop feeling stupid.",whyamidumb,IWantToLearn,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/10x99j/iwtl_how_to_stop_feeling_inadequate_about_my/,"Throwaway account here. A little bit about myself. I grew up in a family of scientists and engineers...really brilliant and hardworking people. Growing up, my parents constantly told me my (small) accomplishments weren't good enough. I was constantly compared to my higher achieving friends.

My entire life I've worked my ass off in school to get good grades. Not necessarily because I wanted to ""succeed"" and have a good career, but to prove to myself that I wasn't stupid. I grew up with the belief that I wasn't as smart as other kids, so I had to work twice as hard to get the same results. I have average intelligence, but a killer work ethic. That's the only thing I pride myself in.

Right now I'm pursuing Computer Science. Math/CS courses kicked my ass, and I'm barely holding on to a 3.1 GPA. I can't find the words to describe how much I studied to barely get B's. Despite being discouraged, I continued to fight my way through.

Lately I've been a little depressed. It's not even school that's getting me down, but my peers. All the CS geeks in my classes are so fucking brilliant. Oh my God. They're so smart and can solve difficult problems in their sleep in a matter of seconds. I work my motherfucking ass off to get 50-75% of the solution but I'm never quite there. I can't live up to them. They're getting such stellar internships and amazing grades, and I for some reason doubt I can ever live up to that.

My coding skills are mediocre at best right now. I'm working everyday to improve which is more than other people can say, but progress is incredibly slow.

My inadequacy pervades all my thoughts. All day I think ""I'm not good enough, I'm not smart enough..."" over and over and over and that's the only reason why I continue studying. To prove that I'm NOT stupid. Waiting for one day for the lightbulb above my head to turn on and make me realize ""Holy shit! I'm actually pretty smart!"".

So I'm not really sure what to do. Before haters tell me drop out and do something else, kindly fuck off. I'm hell-bent on finishing this degree. Despite all the negativity above, I do actually enjoy programming, so it's not like I hate my subject. I love the major, just hate feeling stupid."

Any advice for a future traveller?",Dawnasaurus,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/110lhz/ladies_my_dream_is_coming_true_and_now_im/,"So, some backstory. I'm a college student, and I've always lurked in TwoX, but never posted anything. I don't post much on Reddit either way, but that's a different story. ANYHOO, I've never really had much to share with the community, but my big moment is here and now I need some advice from the worldly women of TwoX.

Since I was a little kid, I have always dreamed about studying abroad during college. I planned my whole life around going to Europe, ""being worldly"" and getting out of Missouri. I made a four year plan and pushed away all the distracting classes so that I could make sure I'd graduate in four years with both my degrees.

Well, I just found out I got accepted to an internship program in Brussels. I am RIDICULOUSLY excited. But, at the same time as I am near tears of glee, I am also terrified and desperately needing advice/tips/the like.

I have never lived on my own before, save for a few months this summer when I was responsible for my own food and ordered Jimmy Johns every day. Any advice on living on my own in a city I've never been to that speaks a language I barely know? Even just recipes for delicious food...I've started a Pinterest board solely for recipes that aren't likely to burn down a building. Housing is all done through the program, but we live in apartments with just other students from the program. I've never lived outside a residence hall (I'm an RA), so even just living with 5 people will be an adjustment. 

Also, travelling/living in Europe. I've never travelled solo before and will readily admit I've been pretty sheltered. What do I need to know? How can I stay safe? Any places I have to see or things I have to do? Any tricks of the trade you've learned?

And then there's the miscellaneous ""you'll figure it out when you get there"" stuff. I'm sure there's things I don't even know I need to know. Was there anything you wished you knew when you went out on your own? Any tips or facts you wish someone had told you before you started travelling or moving or just living? 

Sorry for all the text, I am just so excited and needed to share! I am so excited to finally start living the life I've always wanted to have, internationally using my skills in one of the coolest cities in the world. I am continually inspired by the stories of success and empowerment I see in this community, and I really want to take that with me wherever I go (but particularly NOW!)"

That was a month ago. Since then, I've applied for 63 jobs, been on 8 interviews and as of this week, I've had 3 different offers extended to me.

Hopefully this post will give some encouragement to others who feel stuck or hopeless. I know that the economic situation in the US is such that no matter how hard you try and do everything right, finding a job just doesn't work out a lot of the time, but now I also know that there is always at least a chance that things can get better.

I was alone with several different year interns for the remainder of the night (3 hours).  This should be a piece of a cake just lots of checking with some counseling.  So this lady drives up in drive thru and is mad that we don't have her prescription ready to go.  We were out of mupirocin, sorry.  ""Why didn't you call me?"" (It had been probably 1 to 2 hours since the rx came in BTW).  The intern apologizes and offers to see if anyone else has it, she says anywhere from any store.  She lives in a suburb about 10 minutes away (which has our store chain there--which made me wonder why she didn't fill it there in the first place but anyways) We come back and say we will have them fill it for her as they have it in stock.  She gets angry and yells she just wants the prescription and she will take it to Walgreens across the street.  We apologize again but we can't because it is electronic but we would be more than happy to call over there for them to fill it.  She then gets even angrier, gets out of her car in drive-thru, comes into the store, and wants to speak to a store manager and the store manager finds out what she wants.  She says she just wants it called to somewhere that has a drive-thru and is open late.  None of the students nor myself live in the area so we finally get a chance to transfer it to said Walgreens across the street (as I had counseling and rx's to check for patients waiting in store at the time).  Once I call her she is beyond angry that it took us 45 minutes and she is now home. She was angry that we did not value her that much and she would call the pharmacy manager tomorrow.  I apologized immensely and said we had tried to do it as soon as we could and she cut me off each time I tried to talk.  She said that she was going to call the ""health board"" (because I am sure they would care) tomorrow and the pharmacy manager.  She asked what was my name I told her ""b00bear"" but I am not usually the pharmacist here I am just filling in.  She said it didn't matter (Although if she didn't like how I run things it does as she could come back and I wouldn't be there but anyways) and if she had to go back to the ER for her staph infection she would be billing us, she was going to call her doctor and have them call it into another pharmacy near her now and as I tried to say anything she hung up on me.  I contacted the pharmacy manager the following week and she never called back.  Either she realized that she was a total nutbag over this issue or something.  Have you ever had someone complain and insist that they are going to tell someone or some entity/organization about their complaint in hopes that they would get something out of the ""argument"" even though there was nothing to make the situation any better and nothing I could offer?"

So we're filling up the racks with the new servers, cabling them up, powering them on... I don't usually do hands-on server stuff anymore, but its all hands on deck for this one. So all the nodes start coming online except for one. It's beeping about 3 sticks of dead RAM. We swap out all the extra RAM we have available, it's not working. These are new i7 Xeons so of course, the memory controller is in the CPU. Eventually we rip the CPU out and sure enough, several bent pins, supposedly straight from the factory, we usually go straight from box to rack so its doubtful an intern was giving himself a hardware lesson. In any case, we tell the Director what's going on and he'll have none of it. Get it fixed. So we gutted the box there on the datacenter floor, stretched out across the floor and went to it bending the pins back into their correct position. It took over an hour but sure enough, we powered it on, prayed to our various sky Gods and saved the rollout date.

This summer I did an internship at large tech company (My degree is in CS). I had a fantastic time there. I really had no complaints about the work at all. They ended up giving me a full-time offer, which I gladly accepted. However, for some reason, I am kind of depressed these days and I have no idea why. 

I'll be hanging out with friends and suddenly they will all start annoying me and I'll want to go home and be by myself. Or sometimes I'll be by myself and suddenly I'll just start feeling really sad. I've also recently really started to hate school. I mean, everyone feels that way at some point, especially seniors. This feels different from that though. I've felt that before last year, but this is a more intense hatred. Maybe I feel this way now because nothing I do during this quarter actually matters. All I have to do is pass and get my degree, wheras before I actually had to try to get good grades so my GPA was respectable. 

My girlfriend of 5 years will be staying behind to finish up school. Some people might think that the thought of being away from her for so long is causing it, but I really don't think so. I fully intend to fly down and visit at least every other weekend, if not every weekend. Others might think it's because I'm moving from the city I've lived in my entire life to a completely new city in a completely different state, but I don't think that's it either. I'm actually excited to move up to Seattle and I had a great time there during my internship. I don't think it's that I'm finally starting work either. I've been in the work force for the past 4 years, so this isn't really anything new to me. I am comfortable working a 9-5.

Why do I feel this way? This is stupid and it doesn't make any sense to me. I consider myself very fortunate to have a good job already lined up after graduation so there should be no reason I feel this way.

11086x,11,2012-10-05,To what extent will fixing my Social Anxiety help with my Depression?,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11086x/to_what_extent_will_fixing_my_social_anxiety_help/,"WARNING: EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF TEXT BELOW

I guess I should give a bit of background. Several years ago I went to a therapist for CBT to help with my social anxiety. I had a bit of depression at the time. I didn't keep doing the exercises very long after I stopped seeing him, but at the time it felt like it helped tremendously.

Fast-forward to about a year ago. Some bad shit happened to my family, I realized I hated working as an Engineer over the course of my first internship, felt completely overwhelmed by schoolwork (very odd for me) and I started withdrawing from my friends. The depression I was (and still am) feeling was by far worse than anything I've ever felt before. I feel little hope for the future, and would end it without a second thought if I didn't feel obligated to my parents. After a lot of prodding from my Mom and my doctor, I returned to my therapist. He seemed like a different person; he didn't seem to understand what I was feeling and we were going around in circles. So I stopped seeing him.

On the recommendation of my former therapist (he's actually a really nice guy, despite not being terribly helpful this time around), I've been going to a local mental health clinic for the past month or so. During the past year (especially during this past summer), I've been avoiding social contact as much as possible. So when I returned to school this September, my anxiety has been noticeably worse. 

The social worker at the clinic wants to focus on working on my anxiety. I'm not opposed to this *per se*, but I feel like my anxiety is more of a symptom than a cause of my depression. He claims that they go together and improving my anxiety will improve my general outlook of the world. I'm skeptical but I'm going along with it since I don't have any better ideas.

So I guess my question is: how much does social anxiety affect depression? I'm really looking for personal anecdotes, but *any* information would be appreciated. My main problem with his approach is that the depression seemed to come first. I feel like I could improve my anxiety on my own if I actually gave a damn about my life.

tldr; I'm feeling hopeless and lost about my life; and I have no idea how to be happy or even not-sad, what does social anxiety have to do with that?"

We said we would split the business 50/50 so the moment we started we decided to split up the work. I would build the website (I had no programming experience at the time nor how much work it would take) and she would do the marketing and promotions section. Four and a half months later I'm still programming. Our idea has changed over time. However, ever since we started, I feel like she hasn't put much effort in.   

Over the summer she decided she wanted to take more classes. She also decided to take an unpaid internship in Washington so that has split us apart physically for the past 2 months. She has also, under my blessing (for good or bad), decided to take a job up with another start-up helping with their marketing. Two months ago, I told her that I was quitting. She came to be about to cry upset that I would do such a thing and begged me to stay on. She calls me telling how awesome the other start-up is, how they will fund her to go to MBA school, how she will probably get a job offer with the internship, all the while I feel incredibly cheated.  

She is my best friend and I'm happy for her, but I feel like she has played almost no to little effort in my business. I would say she has spent up to a week in working on this over a 4.5 month period, where I've worked 8+ hours every day over that same period. Plus, I've decided to burn all my bridges and not seek a job, focusing on the business, while she has gone to work in Washington and work for another start-up business. Her reasoning is that we could have connections in Washington (last time I checked the heart of start-ups was in San Francisco) and that the money she makes could be used for the website. This past Sunday, I begged her to help me out on something. She put me off and then two days ago told me she was too busy on the weekdays and would be only available on the weekends. I'm pretty sure she is busy on the weekends too. I'm about to quit. I have a different idea that I want to try and since I know programming it will be easy to do. What should I do? Talk to her? Quit?

Edit: I want to add that there are no contracts between us and we have not yet formed a LLC. "

10zze4,18,2012-10-05,My husband won't get a job and I work 40+ hours a week to support him. Should I leave him?,justcarrie,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/10zze4/my_husband_wont_get_a_job_and_i_work_40_hours_a/,"Reddit users- please help. I've been going through this since last January and I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm so close to giving up.

I married my high school sweetheart. We were together for two years, then, broke up, because my now husband was in college and caught the typical ""frat boy"" bug. Three years later, I was in college and he was in the military. Feeling nostalgic, I contacted him and we started to talk again. A few months later, we resumed our relationship, long-distance. After graduating in June of 2010*, I moved several states to be with him. Things were great at first, until we started talking about committing further. 

I was extremely stressed at the time- I could only find minimum wage, part-time positions on top of an unpaid internship. He asked me one night if I was ready to be engaged, which of course, I was. I was hesitant to tell him that, but he forced it out of me. When I told him I was, he told me he wasn't ready yet. I was embarrassed and humiliated. I considering ending our relationship then, but tada- turns out my overall feelings of stress and fatigue were because I was pregnant. 

He was incredibly supportive. He told me he wanted to marry me, wanted me to move in with him and start our life together. I agree- a bit hesitantly, but I loved him and knew he could come through. Shortly after we were married, I suffered a miscarriage. We stayed married, and for the most part, were happy. He was in the Army, I found a full-time yet low paying position. Things were great- until he ended his contract with the military. 

After leaving the Army in January 2012, he decided he wanted to finish his college degree. He only had a semester left. I had found a better job in a different state, and moved to take it. The pay was great and I knew it could support us until he finished school. He finished up in May and ""officially started his job search"". 

This job search consisted of applying to 10 jobs a week at first. Eventually, it became 2-3, and then, none. I tried to be supportive. He stayed up all night playing XBOX and playing computer games, and slept until 2 or 4 in the afternoon. We started to have trouble paying our bills. To try to help, I took two freelance jobs to help us get by. I started working about 50+ hours a week to make ends meet. We had to borrow money from our parents. Finally, our lease was almost up and we could no longer afford to pay rent. 

Thankfully, the stars aligned- our friends invited us to stay with them until we got on our feet. They have just bought a house down South, where the cost of living was less. A job opportunity was available at our friend's company for my husband. My work was flexible, and agreed to let me work from home for a few months while they found a replacement. We decided to move. We did it, and so far, it's been better, but I'm starting to see similar patterns from my husband.

He let the job opportunity fall through, and makes a minimum effort to find another one. I work all the time, and have started to get so stressed and frusterated, I take it out on him. I just started applying to part-time jobs around here, hoping to find nightly work so we can move into our own place and continue to pay bills. He seems content letting this all fall on my shoulders, and I've grown to resent him for it. 

Sorry Reddit- I just desperately need advice. Has anyone else had similar issues in their marriage? Am I selfish for wanting out? The thought of leaving him scares me, and I don't want to, but I can't help but feel a little relieved just by thinking about it. 

NOTE: Sorry- I accidently wrote June 2012 instead of June 2010. I've been married for two years. "

",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/10zkzj/depression_has_killed_my_selfconfidence_and_i/,"I want to start off by saying something. I used to post here on a throwaway, and though none of you know me, some of you here have helped me before in my worst times. So thank you, r/depression. 

I'm currently on my way out of a deep depression that I thought I would never beat. I'm not home free yet, but I have hope for the first time in years, and after a year of therapy I'm finally aware of all the progress I've made. I also recently ended a 2 year+ relationship and have had more time than I've wanted to sit around and think about myself, which has made me realize that I have absolutely no self-esteem or self-confidence anymore.

I've never been the most confident guy in the world. I'm overly pessimistic, one of the reasons I became depressed in the first place. I don't think I'm very good looking. Through being depressed, I put on somewhere between 20-25 pounds of weight, and now I hate the way I look. Every day when I look at myself after getting out of the mirror, I want to vomit. I barely fit in jeans that I used to have to wear a belt to hold up 2 years ago, and it's a constant reminder of how much larger I've gotten. I should be a senior in college, but I'm an entire year behind because of a combination of a major change and depression causing me to skip (and then fail) a bunch of classes. My GPA is 1.9 and I'm on academic probation. I went to a job fair last week looking for summer internships, but so far I haven't applied anywhere because I know no one will hire me when they could hire somebody who's actually successful in school. Having recently become single, I've toyed with the idea of going on a few casual dates, but I honestly can't see why any girl would want to waste her time on me. Even if I felt differently, I don't know how to go about meeting people. I don't know many single girls and I've never been the type of guy to go hit on random girls at a bar. I'm not looking for commitment, I just want to test the waters so to speak. I just don't even know how to begin doing that when I feel like there's nothing good about me. 

I want to build up my self-esteem, but I don't know how to do it. I've started working out recently, but I've always thought I was unattractive, even when I was a long distance runner and Third Degree Black Belt in Taekwondo. So no matter how fit I get, I'll always hate the way I look. As for the other areas I'm not confident in, I don't even know where to begin. My classes have actually been going well this semester, so that will raise my GPA, but it doesn't stop me from beating myself up over the fact that I'm in this situation to begin with. Basically I need to become more confident in every aspect of my life, but I don't know where to start. 

TL;DR: I feel like a fat, broken loser with nothing of worth to offer to anybody. How do I build self-confidence?"

Perhaps someone on here has even started a [virtual law firm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm#Virtual_Law_Firms)?  

Did you hang up your shingle straight out of school, or did you pick up experience at another firm of a different size (or in the public sector?)  

What fields of law do you practice and, more important I guess, do you feel limited to your field?  Are the cliches true that most solos are criminal/DUI and personal injury, or are there also solos/boutiques out there focused on property, environment, or IP?  Do you ever branch out when you see an opportunity to help a client win/settle a unique or interesting issue, or do you just refer everyone to someone who specializes in the area?

What sort of a background in business outside of lawschool did you have/want/need?  How did/do you find new clients? 

To give you some idea about me:  I'm still just a 2L at a smalltime regional law school ranked on par with other schools in the same urban legal market, but I'll also graduate debt free or close to it as long as I maintain my scholarship.

10z7uy,1,2012-10-05,Where to get internships...? ,internhelp,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/10z7uy/where_to_get_internships/,"Hi reddit!


I'm a computer engineering student in my fourth year (of a five year program). I plan on graduating in 5 1/2 so I can get better grades (taking 16~18 credit semesters has killed my GPA T_T). I have a GPA of 3.03... 


I have a lot of experience in college projects and personal projects, but I haven't done any research (planning on starting this upcoming semester), and I haven't had any internships. I'm not sure where to apply or where to look for internships.


Does anyone know which companies I should try applying to? I don't have a lot of experience in research or real work, nor do I have the best GPA... But I have a lot of experience programming!  I'm just looking for suggestions, as I'm feeling completely lost and overwhelmed. My biggest passion right now is javascript. I'm making my databases project using node.js and express :D. I'm very comfortable with C, Java, Assembly (x86) and Javascript. 


Last year I interviewed with IBM and Verizon ...and it didn't go so great :(. They asked me very technical questions in the IBM interview, which I couldn't answer (although now I can). And in the Verizon interview they only asked me about personal experiences, and nothing technical... I never heard from them again. 


This year (today) I saw an IBM recruiter and he told me to get my GPA up higher, to get an internship, and to do research. That only then, they would consider me. So I'm doing research as to what professors do research in my college, and which ones might be of interest to me! 



Any help is appreciated, thanks! "

Today she was talking to me about the differences between a psychiatrist and psychologist. (Earlier in the week, we watched some presentations by some psychologists and psychiatrists) She told me that most of the time, psychologists have better communication and presentation skills because they are trained in graduate school to excel in these areas. She also told me in graduate school, most classes are seminars. Then she told me, ""This is something to think about if you don't like talking to a large group of people"".  Then I just said ""hm okay"". She just had this convo with me really casually. 

I felt like she was saying I was too quiet. I feel that she sees right through me...well she is a psychologist.....My goals for the future to help people who have anxiety like me....I hate talking in public...can't even hold a conversation for 2 minutes to save my life.

10z1yh,0,2012-10-04,"I can't find a full-time job. After completing my 20th cover letter this week, I snapped and wrote this one.",[deleted],humor,https://www.reddit.com/r/humor/comments/10z1yh/i_cant_find_a_fulltime_job_after_completing_my/,"Dear Hiring Manager,

I hope you will consider me for the position of Bullshitting Assistant at Assbeards Inc.

I was very excited to see the position open up on your company website. As a loyal consumer of Assbeards products for the past 0 years, I was thrilled to discover that my credentials are actually a great match with the position’s requirements.

It has been my very recent dream to work for this company. In fact, I first learned about the existence of Assbeards Inc. approximately 30 minutes ago, when I stumbled across the job opening on the Jobs section of my local newspaper. I skimmed the listing carefully, noting with a sigh of elated relief that it was a paid position.

I immediately proceeded to your website. A quick series of clicks on the ‘clients’ page confirmed that you are not a scam. That was all I needed to go ahead and start the application process.

As swiftly as a coursing river, I robotically entered all of my information into your online application system. I uploaded a PDF of my resume. I copied and pasted a plain text form of that same resume into a box; I tinkered with the headings, the paragraphs and the bullet points until that dreadful wall of text looked presentable again.

Now let me tell you about myself. I graduated from a decent university in 2012 with bachelor’s degrees in business and a foreign language. During my junior and senior years, I completed two internships that paid me not with money but with humility, knowledge of workplace etiquette, two recommendation letters, and the exact same skills your listing requires.

Although I am currently able to subsist on my part-time job and some savings, I dread the day when I have to admit defeat and move back in with my parents, who, despite being perfectly good and kind people, are very much OCD, domineering, invasive of my privacy, and highly skilled at weighing me down with feelings of guilt and inadequacy. So please, Assbeards, give me a chance. Save me from that fate.

And this is the part where I talk about how much I want to work for Assbeards. I would like to work for Assbeards because the money would pay for the roof over my head and the food in my fridge. I would be willing to put in 100% of my energy, passion and diligence into my work at Assbeards, not because I love Assbeards, but because I, like many college grads, have been screwed over by the recession and will cling on fiercely to any job that I can get.

I do not know how working at Assbeards would be a more rewarding experience than working at Dickhairs or CatTits because most companies in your industry and area appear to be variations of the same thing. I believe that your website has a green color scheme, and Dickhairs has a yellow one, but I could be mistaken about that. I would be lucky to get an offer from any of you. The company that doesn’t turn me down is the best company.

As I draw closer to the end of this letter, I am already imagining myself sitting in a cubicle at Assbeards, chugging coffee and doing work. After I submit this application and go to bed, I will fantasize about this job some more. One of two scenarios will play out later. In the first one, two weeks roll by, three weeks, four weeks, and I come to the eventual conclusion that I am out of the running.

In the second one, two weeks roll by, three weeks, four weeks, and I get an email. You want to bring me in for an interview. I show up in my best clothes, sweaty, nervous, but prepared to tackle your toughest questions and shower you with insincere compliments on the office décor. The interview goes well because it’s my 1,800th interview. “You’ll be hearing back from us in about a week, either way,” you say with a smile. I leave. A week rolls by, two weeks, three weeks, four weeks. I never hear from you again. Fuck you. I never wanted to work in your crappyass soulraping ceilingless office anyway.

Thank you so much for taking the time to review my application. I hope to hear back from you soon. If you have any questions, please contact me at bitterjobseeker@email.com or 123-456-7890.

Sincerely,

Bitter Job Seeker

P.S. You used Taleo? Fuck you again. In fact, fuck you four billion times.

10yzy2,2,2012-10-04,Did I [25/M] over-react/act too harsh toward [21/F]? ,xlnc_throw,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/10yzy2/did_i_25m_overreactact_too_harsh_toward_21f/,"Background: 

Two year on/off long distance relationship that was never really “official” but extremely heavy in terms of emotional investments. Sex, talks of marriage when she moved closer to the city where I live after completing school etc., told each other we love one another frequently – for the first year or so anyways. 

This past summer (’12), she was down in the city where I live doing an internship so we would hang out more frequently. I would spend the night at her place, she at mine often. She knew how I felt and was aware of the fact that I wanted something more from her than just casual friends who date type of set up. She is a very successful, smart motivated girl who also has a lot of guy friends. I would become wary of her hanging out with other guys as well as see her texting them. I gave her the benefit of the doubt since she works a lot and is usually the lead on her school group projects etc. Anyways, due to a previous fight that we had gotten into before (hence the on/off), someone who was mutual friends with her on Facebook found that she was listed as in a relationship (I had deleted her on one of our breaks because I didn’t want to see her with other guys etc.) – even while still seeing me, going on dates etc., sleeping together. I confronted her about this and she denied it stating that she was doing it to keep guys away (bullshit?). At this point I told get to get lost and starting ignoring all contact with her. She would ping me once a week or so with sentimental bullshit like “I just found all the letters you ever wrote me, they were nice, thank you”. Continue ignoring. 

She had headed home for the summer and about a month goes by without hearing from her. Until last week, she calls me and leaves a VM saying that her birthday is coming up and she would like to spend some time with me while she came down to the city I live in to celebrate. Continue ignoring her at this point until one text comes in at around midnight asking if she could come stay the night with me. At this point I basically laid it all out on the table, how I had started to become overly distraught with her actions &amp; apparent emotional distance. Told her that I had been extremely patient and understanding with her in situations where I know she would snub me or give me the cold shoulder. I took her virginity, continued to tell her I loved her even when most of the time she would not reciprocate (after the first year or so), bent over backwards to make her happy, spent lots of money on taking her out, forgiven multiple breaches of trust, bit my tongue when she would get snotty or rude with me, set aside personal time to help her with schoolwork when I had a lot of more important matters to attend to, the list goes on and on. This seemed to get through to her and she seemed to come around, promising to get better, address her emotional distance, and even jokingly said that we should get married – as we had planned to do earlier in our tumultuous relationship. I caved and invited her to come down over the weekend and we would celebrate her birthday – took a day off of work and everything.

Fast-forward to the day we are going out. She shows up at my apartment with a travel bag full of her stuff to go out that night, and plans on spending the night at my place. OK fine. We go out to dinner and do a little shopping for some clothes and stuff for that night. We eat dinner and I pay for a town car to pick us up and take us downtown. While we were at dinner I had noticed that she was coordinating some friends – one of them a gay male friend (this matters later) -- to possibly meet up with us at a rooftop bar that we planned to go to. So we get to the bar and everything is going good, until she disappears to go the bathroom and is gone for about 15 minutes. I get up to walk around and look for her and see her standing fairly close to some guy at the bar (shoulders touching), I take a seat off to the side and watch them converse for a long time to ensure that the conversation wasn’t merely innocent in nature. Finally I snapped and walked up to both of them and gave them a piece of my mind. I totally made an ass of myself to the guy, not his fault one bit, and started running my mouth. She gets upset with me and basically shuns the fact that I am visibly upset with what is going on and basically sides with the guy she was talking to. Fuck this, I’m out of here. I leave by myself and head home, she’s calling me non-stop, to which I ignore all contact, and pass out in my bed alone. I wake up the next day around noon and there’s about 2-3 texts and voicemails, texts are from her gay friend saying that she went home with him last night and that she is safe. She left me voicemails bawling her eyes out apologizing and saying how she was sorry she didn’t consider my feelings etc. I’m extremely hung over from the bar and my roommate comes into my room saying that she is trying to buzz into the apartment building downstairs. Why? Oh shit she left all of her things in my room, including car keys. She’s knocking at my door for like 15 minutes while I try to ignore her. Finally I just gather all of her shit up and put it in a pile near the entryway to my apartment. One of the piles of stuff that she left in my place there is a piece of paper. I pick up the piece of paper and it says something to the effect of [21F] was seen by Mr. Doctor, MD on XXX date for a medical abortion. Absolutely not mine, no sex in that time frame with her. I open the door and she’s sitting on the floor and immediately stands up starting off with “I know you’re mad” blah blah blah, and I show her the pile of her shit and walk back into my room. I come back out of my room with the paper, she’s on her knees picking up shit off the floor and I say “Oh and there’s one more thing”, I hand her the paper and she starts reading it. The look on her face while she was reading the words was crushing. I couldn’t think of anything to say, first time I was literally at a loss for words and walk back into my bedroom and go to sleep. 

Few days pass and my heart is just wrenching, so I send her a text message that only says “I forgive you”. This might be seen as a sign of weakness to most people but here it was actually a cynical slap in the face. She is a hardcore Christian while I am an atheist. It was more of a sarcastic zinger than anything. She replies with a text saying that she will never talk to me again, and that she can’t believe that I would “throw something in her face” like that. She says she will never forgive me for that. I laughed at her attempts to try to spin this as somehow being my fault and haven’t heard from her since.

Having her crying in my apartment entryway picking up all of her belonging and then handing her a paper which is basically medical proof that she was sleeping around having unprotected sex with other men wasn’t too harsh was it? This girl has had a tendency to spin stuff and make things that are her fault seem like mine, and after a while I begin to believe them. I just need some reassurance here that I wasn’t some sort of asshole or huge dick for doing that to her? Not sure if I am blinded by the hurt but I do feel bad for making her pick up all her shit off the floor and shoving that shit in her face without talking to her like a human being first?

I've worked loyally at a grocery store since turning 16 years old, so naturally when it came time for the job shadowing aspect of my Pharmacy School application I asked the pharmacist in the back of our grocery store if I could observe him.

After the time I needed was completed for my application, the Pharmacist offered me a job as a Tech-in-training. I graciously accepted and the powers that be of corporate quickly re-assigned me as a Pharmacy employee with the further proclamation that I will become an Intern as soon as I reach the time after I enter Pharmacy school.

So the whole thing is really cool, but I'm left with some delicate questions that I don't really know best to ask, I'm looking for advice.

First off, I assume having a job in a pharmacy helps my chances of getting into the School of Pharmacy, but by how much would you guys think? I'm going to be racking up as many hours as possible in there during winter break.

Second, I realize that I should be really really grateful that I have this opportunity and the experience nearly pays for itself but I'm still making the same wages as I would if I worked stocking shelves or standing in a checkstand. I've asked the Pharmacist about my wages before I was officially hired in the pharmacy and he wasn't able to answer at the time and I don't want to seem too aggressive about it. Are they taking advantage of me?

How much should Pharmacy techs make vs Tech-in-training?

Right now I think I'm going to wait a while until bringing up any mention of the matter."

I cut off communication with him and started dating other people. A few months later he calls me wanting to get back together.

Since the reunion things were a constant struggle, he couldn't fathom that I would date someone else after him and had constant insecurity issues and was pretty much emotionally abusive towards me (tried to convince me I was an awful person with bad morals, that I shouldn't go to graduate school, that I couldn't travel abroad for the year but he could go on an 8 month internship in the states..it goes on and on) so I finally ended it this summer. 

I found out in September he is now in a relationship on fb with this girl who was suppose to be my friend. She is from his circle of friends who I got close to in the two years I was with him and we spent a fair deal of time together. 

I feel like I was doing great following the break up, deleted fb, hit the gym, started my masters, living in a new city, then some other bitch messages me because she 'thought I should know', she also mentioned in detail the pictures they have been posting of them kissing, how they slept together shortly after our break up and he went on vacation with her.

Leaving him was the best thing I've ever done for myself but hearing this news brings up all new kinds of anger and hurt. &gt;:("

I figure that if I create a group, we could meet maybe once a month over coffee or dinner and just talk about where we are and what we want. Maybe by meeting each other, in turn, we could help one another out with a connection or an idea? Or even just make friends! (After all, we'll be the ones running the biz in about 10-15 years, hopefully!)

I want the group to be open in terms of gender and age, but I feel like anyone who joins should at least have their foot in the door. That way, the group is mutually beneficial, but I'm open to ideas!

If you're interested, PM me or leave a comment. Or if you think I'm stupid/naive....tell me why. OR - if there is already a group like this, point me in that direction? THANKS!

$10 to get in, no big, you get a free Surfing Magazine subscription with it, but...

It's a TINY show, made up of:

- Small surfboard companies, though Bing and Rusty were there
- Surf Art 
- Board Foam companies
- A wave machine company
- 3 bored looking booth babes
- Fins
- Sticky Bumps (not handing out free wax) and staffed by interns
- 2 Wetsuit companies, one of which had a miserable looking under-18 girl manning the booth by herself in a skimpy wetsuit, cameltoe and all. 
- 2 Shaper Booths with bleachers (i watched Robert August shave foam for 10 minutes, that's how bored I was). 

I did get to (briefly) meet Mark Richards though, who was SWAMPED with fans as he was the only 'celebrity' there.  At least last year they dragged Rob Machado to do a shaping thing.  

Took me 30 minutes to slowly walk the show wandering past shapers hoping I would plunk down $1000 for one of their boards.  

Flirted with the stunning woman at the Rainbow fin booth, which was a highlight, as I'm certain I was the 78th person she flirted with this morning.  

The only free stuff were stickers of brands I've never heard of and a surfboard shaped piece of foam.

I have lately become very interested in a coworker of mine (we work in a restaurant, not a career type thing). He's in his early twenties, for information's sake. Anyway, a few weeks ago, I asked if he'd like to go out sometime. I got his number and through the next few days we hashed out some specifics for a date. We only see each other at work, and even there we haven't talked much, even while planning a date together.



  I figured we were just equally shy, and that the barriers would come down in the context of a date, however on the night we were to go out he suddenly cancelled. He said he didn't want to get involved with a coworker, didn't want to ""mix work and play."" I thanked him for being honest and left it at that. I knew couldn't change his mind, and although I was incredibly disappointed, I wasn't going to sulk about it. I continued to be friendly with him at work, and we had no more or less contact than before. 



   It's been two weeks, and I still have a pretty big crush on him, though I'm trying to get past it. However, it seems yesterday he put in his two weeks' notice here. I know he has an internship and another job and has been struggling with his scheduling. I am definitely NOT suffering any delusions that he's quit his job in order to date me. 



   But I can't help but view this as an opportunity to ask him out again. I am really interested in this guy, not to mention incredibly attracted to him, and I don't want to just watch this chance walk out the door. Would this be bad timing? If he's interested at all, do you think he'd come to me? Should I act early, or use his last two weeks here as a chance to get to know him a bit, show him I'm still interested? All advice is welcome, please, I really like this guy.



   **TLDR: A few weeks ago I asked a coworker (M, early 20s) out on a date, he cancelled and said he didn't want to be involved with someone he's working with. Yesterday, he put in his two weeks' notice—for reasons involving his schedule—so my question is this: Would it be tacky/bad timing to ask him out again? I am *really* interested in this guy.

I didn't really eat well, exercise regularly or doing anything that beneficial for my health in college, but I'm now trying to build muscle mass and lose a little bit of weight. I try to maintain a strict schedule, but my job at a local theatre sometimes requires long hours that are hard to predict. [The show must go, etc.] It's also worth noting that my job is fairly strenuous as I'm usually building scenery/hanging lights/being generally active. I'm looking for any advice/guidance/suggestions on my current workout plan/diet in the interest of specifically building muscle mass(bulk) and becoming generally more fit.


Here are some quick facts to start with:
Height: 5' 11""
Sex: Male
Age: 22
Weight(10/4/2012):188lbs
No medical disorders or injuries to speak of.
Non-smoker. (Though I will admit to smoking occasionally while with friends drinking.)
My history of exercise is varied, as I had a few limited stints of running regularly in college. I've never been devoted to a weights routine for long, however. 
I have access to a local gym. (YMCA)

My diet is limited to ~$40 dollars worth of groceries a week. I almost never eat out/get fast food because it's generally unhealthy and more expensive. I do drink beer and whiskey weekly. I eat almost the exact same thing every day, with a few variations.

Breakfast 1: Yoplait Light Yogurt, Two Pieces of French Bread, 1 oz Sharp Cheddar Cheese, 24 oz of Black Coffee
Breakfast 2: Yoplait Light Yogurt, 1.5 cups of Honey Bunches of Oats w/ Almonds, 1 cup of 2% Milk, 24 oz of Black Coffee

Lunch: 1-1.5 cups of Kroger Vegetable Medley(Broccoli, Cauliflower, Carrots), Orange/Apple/Banana(2/3 daily, rotates), 1-2 cups one weekly rotating main dish(ex. Chili, Chicken Alfredo + Garlic Bread, Beef Spaghetti + Garlic Bread, Cream Chicken + Rice, etc.)

Pre-running snack: One Clif Bar
Pre-lifting snack: One Clif Builders Bar

Dinner: Varies. Usually a couple more slices of bread, sharp cheddar cheese, and another piece of fruit.

(Note on diet: MapMyRun is a tool I use to keep track of my workouts/runs and do basic caloric calculations. Under the ""Exercises multiple times a week"" they suggest 2950 calories a day based on my weight. As I log foods, it appears that I'm not getting anywhere near that amount and typically have way less(only ~60%) than my daily required intake. I'm not sure of the accuracy, but I try to overestimate what I eat and typically work out 6 days a week.)

Currently, I rest one day a week, run three days a week and lift three days a week. So:
Running days: 4~5 miles, ~35:00-~45:00
Lifting days:(I struggle with the last two or three reps with each of my 4 sets)
All of these exercises are machines and I typically warm up by running around the track for 5-10 minutes. I make my rounds with a 32oz Nalgene water bottle and drink water significantly between sets/exercises.

4x10 Pectoral Fly-120lbs
4x10 Rear Deltoid(SP?) Fly-90lbs
4x10 Dual Axis Pulldown-130-150lbs
4x10 Tricep Extension-105-115lbs
4x10 Bicep Curl-70-80lbs
4x10 Abdominal Crunch Machine-100lbs
4x10 Lower Back Machine(?)-160lbs
4x10 Overhead Press-70lbs
4x10 Leg Press-195-235lbs(Just added this recently, haven't found my correct weight yet)
4x10 Pectoral Fly(Closer)-50lbs

How can I tweak my diet to be inexpensive and effective for my fitness goals? How can I tweak my cardio/lifting ratios to build the most endurance, strength, and bulk? Is there anything I'm doing horrendously wrong that I should stop immediately? Is there anything I'm not doing that I should start immediately?

Currently I've been on this schedule/diet for about a month and I'm already more energetic, have more endurance and can see some muscle growth(or fat loss.) My weight varies from 186-192lbs.

111qpf,12,2012-10-06,Paleo vs. Keto for a student (long),[deleted],Paleo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paleo/comments/111qpf/paleo_vs_keto_for_a_student_long/,"Hey all! Just to jump right in, I'm a female, 19, 5'10"", 174lbs, goal is 140lbs, history of depression, ADD, hypoglycemia, and PCOS. At the start of the summer, I was 191.5lbs. I FLIPPED shit when I saw that. I was so horrified, embarrassed and depressed about it, I instantly committed then and there. I've always been kind of a chubster, but at this point I was simply making excuses to be a lazy ass. I'd tried going on diets for a few days or a week before, but obviously none stuck. Seeing that number was a rude awakening to me that I was almost TWO HUNDRED FUCKING POUNDS.

I joined a gym with my mom, worked out about 4x a week while counting calories, and in 2 months I lost about 14 lbs (down to around 176lbs). I was ecstatic! However, I was prone to ""sample snacking"" a.k.a. ""oh, I'll eat a few of this, a little of this, a little of that, it's okay cause it's a small amount!"" Ummm, no. I eventually tapered my exercise down to two days a week, started snacking more...up to 181lbs. Mid-August I discovered keto. I was intrigued by the science behind it and decided to switch over to that. I had the typical ""I'm eating fat??"" worries, but I stuck with it, and I'm currently down to 174lbs! :) However I have some problems with keto.

My main issues are concerning ketosis and my personal limitations. First, I am a college student, with my last year in the dorms. I have access to a kitchen, but it has no utensils at all. I have zero space to store anything like a pan or slowcooker, not to mention any place for frozen food or anything larger than a minifridge. As a result, I use a microwave and minifridge for my meals, and supplement with my cafeteria. Thus, I eat a lot of deli meat and cheeses, or both in romaine. A lot of almonds, string cheese, and jerky. The cafeteria food is incredibly non-keto, besides an omelette bar and grilled chicken or hamburger patties. What I've just listed is literally 90% of my diet. It sucks. 

I think about food constantly because I am so deprived. I see all these awesome things ketoers make and it makes me really sad because I can't make any of it (coming from someone who loves to cook) and I'm basically living out of Meijer's deli section. Not to mention, it's getting expensive. I'm an intern (unpaid) and my mom pays for my groceries. I have to buy groceries every week and it's adding up quick. Combine all this together, and you get a sad girl over here. I don't get enough red meat, so my nutrients are way down and I'm exhausted. I do strict keto and then binge on carbs because I'm so frustrated by lack of options, then I annihilate a 5 pieces of pizza - don't even want it, don't even like the taste (cardboard?), not even hungry. I just NEED to eat something other than fucking deli meat salads or deli lettuce wraps. Obviously, not good.

Second, it is incredibly difficult to stay in ketosis for me. I must be super sensitive to getting kicked out. For example, I was worried about fiber intake. So, I get some psyllium husk powder - disgusting, literally gagged on it. Finally found those sugar free fiber gummies, thought they were perfect, but alas, no. They have xylitol which keeps kicking me out. I am going in and out of ketosis every day I take them. Typically at night, the sugar alcohol is gone and I'm back in, but the next morning, when I take them, I get thrown out. That went on for 3 weeks alone before I narrowed it down. I tried looking for other fiber supplements, but they all have excess carbs or sugar or sweetened with something not keto. It's frustrating. There are many other examples I have for this, another being that my mom made me a special cherry cake for my birthday, used almond flour and sugar free/unsweetened everything, but I couldn't eat it because of the cherries, WHICH ARE MY FAVORITE FRUIT. 1 slice had about 12 net carbs, and that would put me way over for the day.

For these two reasons (and some minor issues), I've decided I have to quit keto. It's simply not feasible for me right now. Next year, in an apartment, with a job, absolutely. When I can control exactly what I eat WITH VARIETY, I want to try it again. I fully support keto (at least short term) and I WANT to keep doing it....I just literally can't. I think diets are about doing what you know you can do, and doing keto right now, the way I have to do it, just sets me up for failure. Also, I think it's giving me a bad relationship with food. I focus way too much on my macros and I feel like I live in /r/keto. It's depressing to think about how much time I spend in there.

ANYWAYS, I've read the paleo FAQ and searched a bit about comparisons, but I'm wondering if paleo is a viable option for me? Or will I be in the same place I am with keto? My meat sources are chicken/hamburger patty from the caf, turkey breast/ham/chicken breast/salami from the deli or jerky. Vegetables are what would be in your basic salad bar, plus romaine leaves I have. It might sound like a lot, but it's to the point where I dread meals because I know I'll be left kinda depressed about them. I'm not getting my nutrients, the lack of choices is frustrating, and I'm pretty sure it's making me lash out at people. If paleo doesn't work, I'm thinking of trying a low-GI gluten-free diet, any comments on that as well?

**tl;dr;** quitting keto, interested in paleo or low GI maybe? any recommendations, suggestions, or tips?

edit: I should mention, pre any diet, I thought I was lactose intolerant. On keto (eating lots of cheese), I was fine. Maybe I'm wheat/gluten intolerant?"

Just wanted to share my situation to and get your opinions or feedback.

I'm currently living in Canada and studied engineering for 5 years as my undergraduate. Throughout the 5 years, I didn't have any breaks as my program had internships every other term so I ultimately graduated school with 2 years of work experience at several different companies in different roles. I am now currently working for as a consultant for a very large company, but I don't feel like this is right for me. After all my different experiences, I have decided that I no longer want to work for companies and other corporations as an engineer/consultant/project manager etc. Instead, I would rather use my time to help those in need.

I've always had my eye on becoming a doctor even before entering university, but I was too chicken to pull the trigger. I was worried that if I didn't make it, I may be stuck with a science degree and the job opportunities with this degree were not ones that I was interested in.
So here I am, weeks before officially submitting my resignation to my company. I've already signed up for school to take a bunch of prerequisites that I never took during my engineering degree (e.g. bio, chem, etc.). I just calculated my GPA on a 4.0 scale and it looks like i'm around 3.7 cumulatively. Looking at admission averages for universities in Canada, I feel like this GPA may not be that competitive as I've seen many schools with averages over 3.8. Not sure if it means anything or if admissions even takes this into account, but my program is arguably one of the most difficult engineering programs in Canada. Also, as I was in engineering, I don't really have any of the 'research' experience that many science majors seem to have. I used to do a LOT of volunteer work before university (volunteered at hospitals, long term care centres, day camps, etc. easily hundreds of hours of volunteer work) not sure if that counts but during university I was so busy that I didn't have time to do any volunteering so I feel like that area is also lacking...
I'm not really sure exactly what I'm asking here, but I guess I wanted some sort of assurance that yes, I do still have a chance and that I'm not doing this 180 degree change for nothing.

[I consider buying this pair of shoes](http://imgur.com/a/Hbw1Y) but I'm not really sure in regards to the advice given in the [Shoe Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/p7usf/shoe_guide_v20/c3n7ffi).

According to the Shoe Guide square toes should be avoided but chisel toes are fine. I'm having a hard time to see the exact difference and to decide in which category the pair given above belongs.

The context is that I'll start an internship at a bank next month and I want to avoid looking like (complete) a fool.
The linked pair is the only one I found online with a leather sole (which is rather important from what I understood :x) in my price range (&lt;=150e). Do you guys think the shoes are okay?

If you want to recommend other/better shoes please consider I'm from Germany so shoes only available in the USA aren't helpful. :/

I'm a computer engineering student from Puerto Rico in my fourth year (of a five year program). My GPA is 3.03, and I don't have experience with any previous internships. However, I've worked on a couple personal projects (web development, android development) along with my college projects, and I feel like I've been doing a good job.


Since I'm in my fourth year, I feel like I should start looking for Summer internships more aggressively.
Recently, I've been working with node.js and javascript, and I'm loving it, so... I figured I might as well try finding some internships where I can work with javascript :D. I looked into nodejs and their parent company, Joyent, but I wasn't able to find if they offer internships :(. Although I think I'd have to work with C... But regardless, I think node.js is awesome. 


Now I'm not sure what I should be looking for. I'm very comfortable with javascript (currently using node.js + express for server side, and jquery on client side), java and C. (And x86 assembly :D) Does anyone have suggestions as to places I should try applying to? Or where I can look? I went to my college's job fair today, but I still feel like I should look for more opportunities online, since a lot of the companies at the job fair didn't seem interested in javascript at all.

Career advice for getting into patent law?,[deleted],law,https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/113orc/working_on_msee_program_after_jd_career_advice/,"I graduated from a top 25 law school last year with mediocre grades and no law journal experience.  I have a BS in biochemistry and no work experience in that field.  No luck finding a job coming out of law school.  I got the impression that electrical engineering is a highly sought-after field for patent law, so I enrolled in a master's program for electrical engineering.  I plan on being done with that sometime in 2014, depending on what I choose as my area of emphasis.

I'm not sure whether I want to get into patent prosecution or litigation, but for now, I'm leaning toward prosecution.  I took a patent drafting class in law school and I liked it.  I took a couple substantive patent law classes and found those interesting, too.  I plan on taking the patent bar this summer.

I realize that it's kind of an unusual path, as most EE/JD people do the EE degree first.  I’ve been kind of a lazy turd my entire academic career (which might explain the odd mixture of degrees), but I would like to start getting my life in order.  

Does anyone have any insight/advice to give regarding employment opportunities after I'm done with the MSEE?  Here are some related questions in no particular order.

 1.  Have any of you gone down a similar route?

 2.  How difficult is the job market for entry-level patent attorneys these days?  Patent agents?

 3.  Should I try to get some kind of engineering internship this summer?  Do law firms even do summer internships for post-JD students?

 4.  Has anyone heard of any IP firms that have a part-time work/internship program that I would be able to do during the school year?

 5.  I haven't chosen an area of emphasis yet.  Are certain areas of EE more marketable to IP firms than others?  Or would an MSEE in anything be good enough?  I only ask because certain areas of emphasis take longer than others at my school.

 6.  By the time I finish the MSEE, it will have been about 3 years since I graduated law school.  Will this be problematic in getting love from firms?

 7.  Does the name recognition of my graduate school play a large role?  I don’t go to a prestigious-sounding school

 8.  I also plan on applying to engineering firms as I get closer to graduation.  Will the JD help me at all?  Hinder?  No effect?

**TL; DR** – BS biochemistry, JD, working on MSEE.  Want to find a job after finishing MSEE.  Advice?  

Thanks to everyone in advance!

From the perspective of hiring managers, which is more valued - internships at industry-known electronics companies (e.g.  TI, IBM, NI, etc...), or internships at DOD labs?

Is it perceived as a bonus that a person was even able to be accepted to a DOD lab (and obtain an interim security clearance)?  Or is that not worth anything?  Obviously, there's a pretty good chance you wouldn't be able to talk in any detail about projects you were involved in - so I don't know if that makes it harder for DOD internships to be beneficial for future job interviews/searches.  Is a normal electronics firm considered more valuable experience?

I can see pros and cons for both, but I'd like the opinions of established engineers (as opposed to students), and especially people who are or have been hiring managers themselves.

I have very little variety in the clothes I wear, but I absolutely abhor the idea of spending money on clothes. And to make it worse, I currently don't have a source of income (internship). 

As far as fall/winter clothes go, I have:

-A couple generic long sleeved shirts.

Somewhat similar to that, except it's blue

That's about all the cold-weather clothing I own, literally. My other clothes either don't fit or they're in bad condition. I won't even address my summer/spring clothes right now. 

I'd rather own a few nice clothes, over a lot of ordinary clothes. With that said, if I was to set my clothes budget for the winter at...$100-150? What is the best you could recommend?"

So I turn to you, r/Travel. I have little knowledge of Australia beside kola bears and the Outback Steakhouse. With a month free of anything, any advice for what to do? I would be most likely with my friend who would fly out to meet me. We are both 21 year old females who studied abroad together in Europe. We love to backpack and would probably prefer something more along that lines. Also, not too expensive, we are both broke college students."

The best sitcom I've ever seen that lasted beyond 5 seasons (and in my top 5 of all sitcoms).  I'll leave with two parting ""gifts"".

Comic book guy observations:
The penny truly being the cause of the stuck door as indicated in the Finale was not possible as the door was jammed when J.D. arrived on his first day.

Janitor reminiscing about giving Lady a duck on their first date to swoon her couldn't have happened because he tried with a squirrel midway into their relationship and she hated it and he quickly agreed with her.

Chocolate bear used in college memory as J.D.'s nickname for Turk was introduced during the series as a new nickname J.D. was trying out with Turk.

Favorite episodes (in order from most to ""least"" favorite--least still being I LOVED IT)

You may disagree with these, but some were my favorites because of either an especially poignant ending, a great character insight (e.g., Kelso knew about the doctors working around insurance issues) or both.

**My Screwup (Season 3)**
Jordan's siblings, Danni and Ben (Brendan Fraser) visit to celebrate Jack's first birthday. Carla tells Turk she will only take his last name if he has his mole removed. Dr. Cox is dismayed to learn that Ben has not been to a doctor for followup since his remission. Dr. Cox angrily blames J.D. for a patient's death and excuses him from his duties.This episode received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series.

**My Musical (Season 6)**
The arrival of a patient who hears music all the time results in Sacred Heart turning into a full scale Broadway musical. Elliot tries to tell J.D. that she doesn't want to be roommates with him any more, while Carla attempts to decide whether she should return to work or not. The episode guest stars Stephanie D'Abruzzo. 

**My Old Lady (Season 1)**
The three interns have to face death for the first time: J.D.'s patient is a headstrong but kindly old woman, Turk's is a young man who just needs some company, and Elliot's is a Hispanic woman who does not speak any English. The episode's writer, Matt Tarses, won the 2002 Humanitas Prize in the 30 Minute Category for this episode. 

**My Porecelain God (Season 3)**
Dr. Casey (Michael J. Fox) and J.D discover the toilet the Janitor installed on the roof, which earns the name ""epiphany toilet"" after every Sacred Heart staff member finds a solution to a problem or a revelation after using it. Dr. Kelso closes down an entire wing of the hospital to save money; Dr. Cox and Carla fight back by using his own office as a patient room. Turk asks J.D. to be his best man, but J.D. is hurt to discover that he wasn't Turk's first choice. Noticing how helpful Dr. Casey has been to her fellow staff, Elliot seeks advice from him on intubation after she botches the procedure.

**My Lunch (Season 4)**
After repeatedly running into annoying recurring patient Jill Tracy (Nicole Sullivan), J.D. feels guilty when she dies of an appararent drug overdose and he didn't act on warning signs. Carla and Elliot convince Todd to admit to being gay, but contrary to what they had hoped, this does not change his personality for the better. Dr. Cox initially consoles J.D. but struggles to follow his own advice later on. 

**My Roommates (Season 4)**
J.D. is having some trouble with Kylie. Turk and Carla ask J.D. to move out to give them space. However, his absence causes them to realize they're having problems with their relationship. Meanwhile, Dr. Cox believes his friend's child has autism. The episode guest stars Michael Boatman. 

**My New God (Season 5)**
Dr. Cox's born-again Christian sister, Paige Cox (Cheryl Hines), visits the hospital and wants him to participate in his son's baptism: Dr. Cox wants nothing to do with it, and her for that matter. Elliot tries to convince Turk why Carla finds babymaking to be romantic. The Janitor and J.D. begin a friendship, which is sabotaged by one of Janitor's more elaborate pranks. The song playing during the Janitor's 'Evil Stare' is ""Koyaanisqatsi"" by Philip Glass. 

**My Scrubs (Season 6)**
Unbeknownst to Dr. Kelso, J.D. and Turk try to beat the system to treat the Chief's uninsured friend. Elsewhere, the Janitor blackmails Carla with a case of mistaken dog identity. Meanwhile, Dr. Cox tries to convince Elliot that a reformed drug addict isn't quite clean. All the while the entire staff is condemned to wearing dirt brown scrubs when Kelso suspects a clothing thief in their midst. The episode guest stars Alexander Chaplin as Sam Thompson and Victoria Tennant as Maggie Kent.

**My Overkill (Season 2)**
After Jordan revealed that she slept with J.D., he expects the worst from Dr. Cox. Elliot, embarrassed by Jordan's revelation about her lingering feelings for J.D., is avoiding J.D. at all costs. Carla is angry with Turk for not telling her that Dr. Cox was in love with her, and Dr. Cox is annoyed at Dr. Kelso for being played for a non-existent promotion and at J.D. for sleeping with Jordan.A new design for the opening credits was introduced with this episode, with Neil Flynn (the ""Janitor"") listed as a regular cast member. The network behind Scrubs did not approve of the opening scene, featuring Colin Hay performing an acoustic version of ""Overkill""; such a scene had never been done by a sitcom.[1] The episode's title is derived from the featured song ""Overkill"", which Colin Hay performs onscreen. 

**My Big Bird (Season 4)**
J.D., Elliot, Turk and Carla are all formally interrogated following the death of a patient, where it is learned that J.D. and Turk were unnecessarily visiting a patient's home, Carla was gathering the staff to purchase lottery tickets in a group effort, and Elliot was dealing with the wife of a married man she kissed. The episode guest stars Jason Bateman as Mr. Sutton and Peter Jacobson as Mr. Foster. 

**My Big Brother (Season 2)**
J.D.'s older brother Dan (Tom Cavanagh) drops by for a visit, but J.D. can't hide how ashamed he is of his brother's life. Turk learns a lesson when he makes a bet with Dr. Cox on whether a patient lives or dies. Meanwhile, Sacred Heart staff is in costume for Halloween, and one person in particular is wreaking havoc in a gorilla suit, much to Dr. Kelso's disgust. 

**My Nickname (Season 1)**
J.D. and Carla's relationship changes when he starts to have more medical knowledge than she has, and takes offense at her nickname for him (""Bambi""). Elliot treats Jill (Nicole Sullivan), a patient who's just as nervous and neurotic as she is. The Janitor comes up with a new nickname for J.D. 

**My Cabbage (Part 1) (Season 4)**
J.D. tries relentlessly to get rid of Keith while sticking up for his favorite intern ""Cabbage"", while the staff says goodbye to Mrs. Wilk. The Janitor keeps a magpie in the hospital which proves very adept at stealing things, much to Dr. Kelso's displeasure. The episode features a cameo appearance by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. His Story IIINarrated by The Janitor: J.D. begins a video postcard for his mother, but gets locked in a water tower for the day by the Janitor. Finding himself with free time, the Janitor bonds with a severely quadriplegic patient who can't communicate. Elliot and Carla argue over an intern's mistake. Turk is embarrassed by his impending fatherhood when Dr. Cox accuses him of having a stereotypically white personality. 
 
**My Friend With Money (Season 6)**
Elliot is enjoying private practice a little too much, causing J.D. and Dr. Cox to show a little jealousy. Carla's post-partum depression symptoms worsen. Dr. Cox and Janitor try to co-exist in the hospital's new luxury suite. 

**Honorable mentions:**
Elliot remembering Carla watching out for her
Kelso's dance routine on his ""one happy approachable day of the year""
Fantasy sequences
Cox bringing people back down (maintaining humanity) such as when they were celebrating not being the source of the error causing the person's death.

It's been a long distance relationship for the entire time, as our colleges are around 7 hours drive from each other. (We knew each other while we were in high school, but did not go to the same school). Before I list all our 'problems' I would like to say that I love him, we get on amazingly on a day-to-day basis, we have lots of common interests and I think we communicate well. It's just our overarching aims that are different.

We come from very different backgrounds. His mom had him at 18 and his father was an alcoholic. My parents both went to college, met while volunteering in a disadvantaged community and moved to Nepal to train nurses when I was 5. They are still passionately in love with each other and with planet saving. They have their heads screwed on well, and have good judgement on a lot of things, and they don't like my boyfriend. I am unsure as to whether its because they think we are incomparable or because he has different religious beliefs. I hold their beliefs and he doesn't, and they are worried it will be a problem. It might be a problem if we have kids.

He wants to get married and have kids. As soon as we can afford it. I think I want that eventually, but I want to live in the same place for a year or so first to see if it works. I definitely don't want kids within 5 years. Also, I would like to take a couple of years off when I do have a kid and I can't see that happening if I earn most of our income.

He wants to live in the country. I love the city! I also need to work in the city because I work in a very specialised area.
I am going to finish my degree in water engineering in July. Not to be overly boastful, but I went to a good school and have good grades. Also, through an intern program, I have landed a job for when I graduate on a $60,000 salary doing my dream work- flood analysis. He did less well in high school and his school is not as good as mine. His grades are terrible, and after 5 years, he has failed so many subjects that he still hasn't finished his bachelors degree in mathematics. Some of the failing is due to him driving to come and visit me instead of studying, which I feel guilty about. So, he has decided to drop out and work as a day labourer in his step father's business in order to move back to where I live. If he passed everything next semester, he would finish his bachelors and could transfer to teaching, which is what his original plan was, once he knew post-grad math was off the table. I am really angry at him for putting our relationship in a difficult place for 5 years for no apparent gain and a hell of a lot of debt. I don' t understand why he doesn't want to stick it out. It will only take 6 extra months, then he can move back and do the teaching degree here. I don't know why he is willing to give up on his dream. I don't know if this anger is justified or not. Am I being unreasonable?

He is my best friend, and I am worried that if I break it off I will never find someone else I can relate to as well as him. He has made far more sacrifices for our relationship than I have. I am worried that I would be breaking up him because of what other people think. I am worried that he loves me more than I love him. Our relationship is really unequal from a social status point of view, but I would hate to be a person who broke up with someone that I really loved solely because of that. Is all this crap worth pushing past? Or are the practicalities of life going to mean that it is better if we call it off now?

112yys,1,2012-10-07,The Life and Times of the Perpetually Single 28 Year Old (Spoiler Alert: It's me.),[deleted],ForeverAloneWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneWomen/comments/112yys/the_life_and_times_of_the_perpetually_single_28/,"I cannot even begin to express how grateful I am for this place.

I'm a 28 year old FA lady. I often want to talk about my experiences (or lack thereof, ahaha) but find that other subreddits aren't always understanding of the issues surrounding perpetually single women.

Please, please, allow me to ramble for a moment.

I have never once had a relationship. I've never had sex. I've been kissed a handful of times, and always in a platonic way.

In high school -- which is when most of my friends started hooking up -- I had extreme family issues, to the point where the very idea of finding a boyfriend was ridiculous; I was too busy worried about not becoming homeless, the extreme legal battles my family was involved in, fighting off the local media as they tried to take photographs of me and my family for the local papers. I had no room for romance. I had no room for much of anything, really. It was a horrible, terrible time.

I was accepted to a ton of universities but ended up having to take a year off because of my family situation. When I finally got things together enough to leave my crappy town, only one school would take me. I suffered from depression, PTSD, reoccurring nightmares and flashbacks and a crippling anxiety disorder. I gained weight, I got awful haircuts, and I generally didn't care about much of anything. Once again, even in college, boys weren't on my radar. I was too busy trying to survive myself.

Eventually things got better; I got my depression and anxiety under control, I started taking better care of myself, I got rid of some awful ""friends"" who used me only to feel better about themselves, and I worked really hard in my classes. I stopped caring so much about my family situation and I started caring a lot more about myself and my real friends. I lost weight, I won a place on an internship to China, I got a 4.0 GPA (compared to my previous 1.9, woohoo) and I became a much healthier person.

But by that point, college was just about over. There was no point in even thinking about romance, since I had accepted a job in Japan and was going to be leaving the country anyway.

So here I am. I've been in Japan for over four years. I absolutely love my life here... except for the total lack of a love life. And I need to talk about this, because it drives me nuts, but it's an issue that is absolutely taboo in any Japan-related online forum.

There are, of course, exceptions -- I know a few -- but, for the most part, Japan is a desolate cesspool of loneliness for western women. Western men are a different issue, and I fully suggest any FA guys reading this to come teach English here, because you WILL find a cute, adoring Japanese girl who wants to be with you, it's almost guaranteed. But western women have no such luck, so I've been absolutely torn about what to do with myself. Should I leave and go home to try and prioritize finding a boyfriend? Or should I continue living my enjoyable life here and just accept that it's not in the cards for me?

Japanese guys -- of which I am very attracted to! -- tend to prefer Japanese girls. This is totally understandable. Western guys in Japan -- in my experience -- also tend to prefer Japanese girls. This is also totally understandable. I had just hoped that I would have found a guy here, of any race, creed, whatever, who'd happen to both click with me and find me to be dating material.

I've pretty much determined that I have to go back home next year anyway, because I want to get experience in a job that doesn't involve teaching English before I turn 30, but I'm increasingly worried that my total lack of romantic experience will hinder me from ever even getting started. I'd like to find a partner, I'd like to be with someone, but I never have before, and I'm so used to being alone that I'm nervous I'd totally fail at anything beyond a simple friendship.

Bla bla bla, this is long enough already, but THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, COMMUNITY, and I wanna hear your stories as well.

TL;DR: My life has terrible timing and that's one of many reasons why I'm super single. How about you?"

I went from fapping once a day to once a month. I asked a girl out at a coffee shop, something I've never done before. I was very comfortable with talking to girls in general. After returning, I went back to my old ways and am fapping once a day. I realize the time it is wasting, and how I am no longer as forthcoming to meet chicks. After reading your stories, I know this is an issue that is worthy of fixing. I intend to try to prevent fapping by being in a public place when using the computer, since I'm a college student that includes work, library, study quarters.
Any advice would be appreciated, I hope to be held accountable by you guys. "
112wip,12,2012-10-07,Money is stressing me out and I feel like I'm losing control of my life.,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/112wip/money_is_stressing_me_out_and_i_feel_like_im/,"My shitty job in retail barely covers the bills. I want to get a better job, but I'm afraid it's impossible because I'm still in college, so no company in my field of study will hire me since I can't work two days out of the week. Not to mention every job posting I look at requires experience or a degree, and experience is impossible unless I get an internship, which is out of the question since that would require taking more days off of work, and I'm barely getting by as it is. I can't wait until I get my degree, if I even do, because otherwise I'm going to continue being perpetually broke.

I feel like I'm going to be stuck in school forever, since I slacked off too much in an expensive university for five years, racking up ~$80k in school loan debt and only getting 55 credits to show for it. I finally wised up and transferred to a cheaper school (and I'm actually concentrating on classes this time), but my request for a loan got declined (I can't blame them, since I already owe them so much), so I'm stuck with no way to pay for tuition, and I'm afraid I'll have no choice but to drop out of school since I can't pay, and an enormous amount of debt with nothing to show for it will haunt me for the rest of my life.

Everyone else I know from high school is getting jobs, finishing college, getting married, and actually enjoying themselves. I'm still stuck in the same job I've been working since high school, I can't seem to complete college no matter how hard I try, and I don't even know how to talk to women, let alone date one. The last time I had a girlfriend was in high school, I'm a 23-year-old virgin, and aside from LAN parties once a month with a small group of friends, I have zero social life.

Why do I fail so hard at being a grownup? How the hell does everyone else do it?"
112v60,2,2012-10-07,I'm sick and have to go to work tomorrow. What suggestions do you have to make an 8 hour day more tolerable while suffering from flu-like symptoms?,hippocuddles,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/112v60/im_sick_and_have_to_go_to_work_tomorrow_what/,"I have an unpaid internship, so I have to go to work tomorrow, and I have no guarantees that I'll feel healthy (the sickness has already lingered longer than I thought). I work with a large group of people and I am depended upon to do my job gracefully and without getting snappy or annoyed at others. What suggestions do you have for managing a day at work while sick? 

(I've taken all the health precautions I can and I never cough or sneeze anywhere but into a tissue, my elbow, or hanky - this is mostly on the mentality side/ or special tricks anyone has.)

Thanks!"

Plus, I heard about it again from my college back here in the states. So as far as I can tell it's a legit and international program.

[IAESTE](http://www.iaeste.org/) 

&gt;The International Association for the Exchange of Students for Technical Experience (IAESTE) is an independent, non-profit and non-political student exchange organisation. It provides students in technical degrees (primarily Science, Engineering and the applied arts) with paid, course-related, training abroad and employers with highly skilled, highly motivated trainees, for long or short term projects. With over 80 countries involved and exchanging over 4000 traineeships each year worldwide, it is the largest organisation of its kind in the world.
&gt;
&gt;The Association was founded in January 1948 at Imperial College, London, where representatives from ten European countries agreed on the initiative. The geographical coverage soon spread to include exchange in over 80 countries on all continents, and IAESTE became a registered body according to Luxembourg law in 2005. Since its inception, IAESTE has exchanged more than 350,000 students worldwide, playing a key role in the development of young engineers and scientists."

[So according to IMDB you are on the new Star Trek movie...care to tell us something about that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ijghu?context=5)|I cant tell you about the scenes I'm in, but it was an amazing set to be on. I am a really, really small role.
[If you cannot talk about the scenes, then please tell us something about the behind-the-scene stuff...it's much more interesting anyway !](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ijxg4?context=5)|Well it was amazing working with J.J. Abrams in the short amount of time that I did, he is a genius! we were on location filming (crystal cathedral, but I cant say what was there or happening) but walking around really felt like being in the movie with everyone wearing their star fleet uniforms. and the entire cast was amazing and so nice. Really all I can say.
[If Gearbox (for whatever reason\) decided to do a Borderlands 2 movie, do you think you and Yasemin Arslan would reprise your roles? Great work in the games, by the way. I loved how the colorful, cartoony nature of the games clash with the seriousness of Angel. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ilvwo?context=5)|It would depend on the direction they would go with the story. Yasemin would have to work on her accent but I cant imagine anyone else playing our roles.
[Do you play the games you are in? Also I thought I would let you know that your voice is very attractive. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ij8o6?context=5)|I do play Borderlands and Borderlands 2, they are my favorites besides me being biased ;)

[You've hit like... Every single favorite on Reddit.  Okay, I'm kinda lying. *My* favorites.  If you said XCOM, I'd probably pass out.  That's really cool that you're into the games you worked on too. It's not weird for you to play a game with yourself... Narrating you through it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6in0d5?context=5)|Oh and xcom! ;) kidding I havent played xcom.

[Do you like what they did with Angel in Borderlands 2?  It's funny how there was next-to-nothing for a plot in the first game (still a big fan!\) but Gearbox is certainly showing their ability to write stories more and more.  That said, is there anything you would have liked to be done with Angel's character?  Anything you didn't like?  Hints for Borderlands 3?  (!?!\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ikrk7?context=5)|I like her story and how emotional it was in Borderlands 2. Plus I loved that Angel had a bigger role in the story of course.  I would've like to see angel in-game character more than just in her chamber, but you never know what Gearbox will do. They are so creative with their story and characters.
[SPOILER If there is a borderlands 3, are you disappointed that you probably won't be in it? Also how was working with Gearbox?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ijtq4?context=5)|You never know what Gearbox has in store with my character... I mean you can come back after you die right?! ;) I was lucky to work with Gearbox closely, they are an amazing team.

[100 Spiderantling sized Butt-Stallion or one Butt-Stalion sized Spiderantling?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6isfur?context=5)|100 Spiderantling sized Butt-Stallions... I think one butt-stallion sized spiderantling would cause me to instantly die of a heart attack. I couldnt handle the scary spideresque-ness.

[Hi! Thanks for doing this AMA, I loved you in both games, I hated that part in the BL2 though...  Are you anything like your character in the game?  1.5 I noticed that Angel wasn't as 'coarse' or crazy like some of the other characters in BL2. Did you have any input on her lines or ad lib anything?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6iltuh?context=5)|I'm exactly like my character in the game oddly enough, Im a bit more akward and humorous though. 1.5 I did not, but again, the sirens you have met have not been very coarse have they?
[Well Lillith is a siren and she's like ""this \[spoiler\] stuff is the TITS!"" Maybe not coarse, more like crazy lol =P.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6indl5?context=5)|Oh hahah ok i get the Tits thing now... mind in the gutter. oops.
[Did you go to school for any of this? Do you feel a formal degree is really necessary in today's entertainment industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6indl5?context=5)|I did not. My degree is in something COMPLETELY different. In video game industry I do feel like you do need some type of training and degree. even in production or anything technical behind the scenes in film/tv. but you can easily intern and gain experience that way.
[Also, if you're like your character, I hope your dad wasn't a douchebag and hooked you up to... stuff injectors... lol... ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6indl5?context=5)|Hahah no my dad never pumped eridium into me or anything like that.
[I must say you had an amazing character in game and you look SOOO georgeous (I just fall apart when I see a dark haired girl with blue eyes and you are pretty much absolutly perfect for that explanation\). I would like to ask you how were the ""screaming"" scenes you had to do when Angel was hurt. Did they feel a bit weird? And did some other?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ilrx8?context=5)|It was weird, nothing I have ever had to do before. In fact It took me a bit to get ready for it and worked up and I got really light headed doing it.  BTW thank you! Im glad I had a look that everyone really liked and connected with.
[Xbox or playsation? And what's your gamertag?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ikf2n?context=5)|XBOX, I am also figuring out what system I want to set up my new gamertag on and play with everyone. I will be releasing that info on My twitter and facebook pages.

What is your perspective on her personality and her life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ikf3c?context=5)|I love Angel, she is so mysterious yet always sticks with you. Of course her story in BL2 is saddening but I love that the connection she has made with you in the past two games really draws you into her. Plus I'm a pretty freakin amazing siren. cant beat that.

Why couldn't you cuss? lol.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ilrh8?context=5)|One of my powers is supposed to be telepathy, which is why I'm not actually talking to you ...
[Where you inspired by the post earlier by Yasemin Arslan? Or did you decide to do this on your own?  Other questions: Do you play BL or BL2? If so, favorite character? Why?  Edit: Jamie Hyneman from Mythbusters is doing an AMA at the same time...Truly this is a golden age :'\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ijrnq?context=5)|I actually had a AmA posted yesterday under gaming and realized I needed to repost under this subreddit.

Since then I finished school and moved out to Los Angeles to continue my acting career. I'd say my lifestyle has changed ALOT, but I cant imagine it any other way.
[TCU? Were you Greek, there, by any chance? I spent a week at the ADPi house once on accident, like something from a freakin' 80's movie.

Final Fantasy 7. Loved the story, best memories playing it growing up, and Its the one game I'd love to see square enix do again... you know same story, minus the block hands...
[Oh God...&lt;3 the whole materia system.  As a side note, What kind of gamer are you? Do you yell at the screen, or are you more calm, casual cursing? etc etc.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ilm0u?context=5)|I get super tense and stressed out, not so much yelling at the screen but under my breath cursing!
[This sounds really bad but, How much are you paid to do voice-over in such a large game like borderlands?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ik333?context=5)|I was paid Over Scale and it is not the same as how much voice actors get paid since it was live action filming.
[Did you have any input on the development of Angel's character or dialogue in either game?  Also, they couldn't have picked a better actress for the role IMO, you did a FANTASTIC job really bringing her character to life in both games.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ikdtl?context=5)|I might have had more of an input in the first game but It didn't have much weight. it was really up to the team at gearbox.

Coincidence or were you planning to work with them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ikq1f?context=5)|I went to a casting call for the first game and landed it. It sparked my interested because I was interested in acting and I loved gaming so it seemed perfect, I did not have the intention of working with them otherwise, but it definitely led me to being more involved in the video game industry.
[Thank you so much for doing this! I hope I'm not very much too late!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6iu55j?context=5)|Of course!

[While shooting, did you know the context of the scenes? Like, did you know what was going on and how that footage of you will be used? Or was it like, ""ok now I need you to look sad, happy, afraid, angry"" etc. and the devs just used the segment they needed every time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6iu55j?context=5)|3.It was a bit of both. Alot of times I knew the context of the scenes, then just for content we would do go down the expression list so that they could use that if anything changed in the story

[What is your favorite eye color?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6imv9v?context=5)|Blue, like mine.
[What would you say is your favorite genre of movies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6in365?context=5)|Sci fi/action/thriller ... like inception, looper, star trek type stuff.
[Woah, it's Angel. I'm surprisingly psyched. Probably because you're beautiful. Alright, let's questionize.  How strange is it to follow your own directions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6iqffg?context=5)|It's a little strange... I'm obviously more inclined to follow my own directions, i guess.
[So Yasemin Arslan was doing an AMA earlier and she said something about you being BFFs now or something, is this true?  Can I have a signed photo or something?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6iqffg?context=5)|Ok lets answerize! Yasemin and  I are pretty close, we hang out all the time when we are in town together and keep in touch when she is in Sydney.  Yes you may have a signed photo (send me a message on facebook with where you want something signed sent to)
[Also was she the one who put you up to this AMA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6iqffg?context=5)|She did not, a fan put me up to this. but Im glad I did it!
[So did you play Borderlands one before being directly involved with the franchise? And, do you play on the PC? Did you do voice acting or modeling for the game character? Both?  P.S. You said ask you anything, for ONCE can I actually get an answer from some one doing an AMA?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6imb3p?context=5)|I was involved during the development process for Borderlands 1, I didnt play it until it was released. I play on xbox. I did the Live action acting! I worked a little bit in the booth BUT the voice is done by a voice actor in Texas.
[Why do you constantly stand in front of a fan?  If you're conversing telepathically why do you send so many gratuitous close ups of your eyes? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6jamt1?context=5)|Eyes are the most captivating...
[What's your ideal zombie killing weapon?  Also, here's a picture of my Western Hognose Snake:  Link to i.imgur.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ilp6h?context=5)|Ooo snakes scare me! I have a dog. I would have to say a sniper rifle... i was going to say flame thrower but I'd rather kill them from afar...
[How did you get in to voice-acting?  How does it feel being a big part of a great game-series?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ijomk?context=5)|I was never really into voice-acting, especially since I am live action in Borderlands but now I know a bit about it. If your interested make a reel and submit to an agency in your area. I started out in modeling and fell into acting which I'm 100% grateful for. I didn't know what I was getting myself into with Borderlands but it ended up being the best thing that ever happened to me. My favorite project I've worked on thus far.
[As someone who loved your character, it was a pretty big mind blow when I finished the mission ""Where Angel's Fear to Tread"". What did you think when you first found out the back story of Angel?  Also you are awesome and thanks for doing an AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6im5yl?context=5)|I loved this, Thanks for asking away! I was of course sad when they told me what was going to happen but they also said you never know what Gearbox will do, they can always add some crazy twist. They are all so creative... I mean when you die you can come back right? ;) we'll have to wait and see i guess.
[Hearing that gives me a lot of hope-If anyone can pull off crazy plot twists, it's Gearbox. Hopefully we get to see you some more in the upcoming dlc! Also, what does it feel like to see yourself in a video game? I can imagine it's pretty weird at first  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6inm0n?context=5)|It was weird during the first game. now I'm used to it and can play the game without it being uncomfortable. 
[What is your favorite class in Borderlands 2? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ijcwk?context=5)|Thats hard, I like both Zero and Maya alot!
[What are you doing when you aren't working on work?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ijh98?context=5)|Playing games with friends, going to concerts or movies! I'm a big foodie and love to cook or go eat at new places..
[So then what's your absolute favorite dish to cook, regardless of the cleanup afterwards?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ikajr?context=5)|Strawberry Nut Bread! or pad thai.
[Any thoughts on omelet technique?  Mine always seem to come out drier than I want them to be...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ik5vh?context=5)|I don't really cook omelets, I'm more of an eggs benedict person.

[Do u have a ps3 and.some extra time on your hands?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ilksr?context=5)|Sounds like a wild night!
[How do you feel about the character version of yourself in the game? Your character version lools like skrillex.  EDIT 1: eti skelly avatar.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ijjfs?context=5)|Hahah I get the skrillex comment alot. Angel was designed to look like me. and she does completely (except the side shaved head) I love what they did to my character.
[Heya Britanni, awesome job on the game, glad to hear you're really a gamer.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6iokc9?context=5)|Hahahah well Angel's face/body was designed to look just like me, the hair was a bit off. but they wanted to stick with brown-swoopy bang... and the joke started about the skrillex look.
[Now I'm curious, why does your character look attractive throughout the game, but suddenly you turn into Skrillex when we find you?  Tell us the truth... that wasn't really you who ... um... \[redacted for spoiler\] in Jack's chamber, was it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6iokc9?context=5)|I am not fully aware of Gearbox's intentions and direction with what is next :) 
[Probably won't get a reply but I wanted to ask something about the beta of Borderlands(if you would know anyway\).  I've read a few things by people saying that Tannis used to be Angel, but wouldn't have been nearly as illusive and would a been an A.I. from Oasis. There are a few cut sound files that support this that consist of a female voice warning about the sandstorms. Is this true at all? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6iqcwb?context=5)|Hmmm, this is truly a question for the developers and writers. I really am not sure... but now you sparked my curiosity so I'll look into it :)
[Whats the next upcoming job/project/whatnot that you're most excited about, and/or think we (internet people fans things?\) would also be excited about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ip8hl?context=5)|I am collaborating with Machinima and I am pretty excited about that. but I cant say exactly what yet, I will share as I set stuff in stone.
[Hi Britanni, I was curious, do people ever regonize you in public? If so, is this positive or negative?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ir3ie?context=5)|Occasionally, and its positive because they are always fans of the game which is exciting for me!
[How's your use of language in real life? Angel tries to correct her profanity in-game, what about you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ishmr?context=5)|Hahah I would be lying if I said I didnt cuss, however I'm no sailor. I keep it respectful.
[What's your favorite video game ever?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6is1q4?context=5)|EVER? Final Fantasy 7.

[Have you beat the game yet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6imaw8?context=5)|NOT YET!!!
[I don't know if it's possible to even ask you questions that haven't been asked already.  But maybe I missed it, but is it timed on purpose that you and Yasemin both are doing AMAs at the same time? I mean, it's obviously probably not 'coincidence' but did you both just agree to do it at the same time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6isnu9?context=5)|Hahah no I posted one yesterday in the wrong subreddit and just reposted today in here. We didn't collaborate on doing an AMA together, but its pretty fun!
[Is it christmas already? whats with all the awesome AMA's?!  Britanni, Did Gearbox have you read the storyline/script in order to portray the character's responses according to occurrences in the game, or did they just ask for generic responses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6iut1x?context=5)|First game I had the script when filming. second game was a bit of both, they would tell us what was happening and being said and we would act it out.
[You did good as Angel, how did you decide that was a role for you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6it654?context=5)|Thank you, since the character is based off me that was definitely a huge plus, but it was just a dream come true to be in a video game... they could've made me a talking tree and I would've been happy.
[Which character do you think is the hottest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ipiks?context=5)|Its an obvious tie between Lilith and I ( I would choose myself... since the character is based off of me... but I didnt want to sound self-indulgent)
[If you (in real life\) had to choose between Lilith's Phase walk and Maya's Phase Lock, which would you choose?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6iqeib?context=5)|In real life... Phase walk... because I wouldnt have any use for Phase lock. but phase lock would be so much cooler to use in a fight.
[So how do you like Reddit?  Thinking about staying? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6iwib0?context=5)|Yes I'll continue to stay involved on reddit.
[How long does it normally take to do a couple voiceovers and what not?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ijyg0?context=5)|Voice-Over? I couple hours. Filming, which I did? Borderlands 2 a day, Borderlands 1 a week.
[Would you rather fight 100 duck sized horses, or 1 horse sized duck?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ik0nu?context=5)|100 duck sized horses!
[Wouldn't it have made more sense to space out the borderlands actresses/models' AMA's by more than a couple hours?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ijxp1?context=5)|We didnt plan on doing this AMA together. 
[So did you have to come to Dallas for your role, or did you do anything from a LA studio?  If you didn't, you should have come to the Gearbox Community Day. I didn't see you there though, so maybe you did and I just missed you. The Gearbox guys are great. Fun to work with, and great people all around to have a beer with.  Have you been contacted about doing work for the upcoming DLC yet? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6iu923?context=5)|I am from Texas. After we finished filming Borderlands 2 I moved to LA. However I was back in town for community day and the launch party. IF you saw yasemin then you probably saw me too.
[Is borderlands the first franchise you've done voice acting for, and how did you get involved in it in the first place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ion1v?context=5)|Borderlands is the first franchise I've acted for. and I got involved by going to a casting call back in 2009.
[Favorite playable character in BL1 or 2? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ioqz5?context=5)|Its a tie between Maya and Zero for me. ugh. thats hard.
[Was it strange filming the sequences where Angel talks to the player? Was the general direction to look intense or concentrated while interacting? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6iugfk?context=5)|We played through the emotions of the game and emoted the script.
[Yeah, then why are WE able to respawn? Why didn't he just turn off the New-U at the end of the game died and/or take us out the system? Then, if we managed to die by the hands of the warrior/him, that was it for us?  I guess those are just questions I/we should just leave unanswered. Ahg, oh well.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ix4ma?context=5)|Mind blown...
[During the first borderlands, were you aware about Angels less than honest motives?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6isc8w?context=5)|You mean my motives in the second game? As the actress no. As Angel... Id like to think she knew what she was doing the entire time.
[Is it just me or Angel looks just like Skrillex?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6is0ku?context=5)|Your the bazillionth person to say that. lol I hope Skrillex plays the game one day and is like ' holy crap... thats me!'
[Favorite breakfast food ?  What do you like to do in your free time ? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6ivc1g?context=5)|Cookie Crisp Cereal!
[Kinda late ;-; but will you play borderlands 2 on PS3? I'm pretty sure there are PS3 players who will love to play with you ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6iryql?context=5)|Hmmm maybe I'll set up my PS3 rather than xbox... let me sleep on it.
[Was it strange just having to act like you were portraying a voice when you weren't?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6iv69z?context=5)|Nope, because your thinking about what is going on in your head and still feeling the emotions.
[What do you think of the creepy fan art people make about your character? (hentia.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/111s4w/iama_britanni_johnson_aka_angel_from_borderlands/c6iljle?context=5)|I love seeing the drawing and stuff people made of my character.

* **Description**: Greetings, Crafter. We would like to introduce a server fresh off the press. Yes, indeed. It is none other than InvisionCraft, a genuine Survival Multiplayer/Role Playing Game Server! InvisionCraft has actually been around for some time now. Almost a year to be precise. As a community, we have been through thick and thin. Our time here spanned out over three generations, which is why we're currently referred to as Generation X. But you are not the least interested in our history right? You want to know what makes our server worthy of your expectations. Haha, very well. We are a Survival/Role-Playing Game server that has recently become ""premium"". Our ""generation"" is approximately a week old, meaning there is much potential for anybody who decides to start today. We feature dozens of plugins (listed below) and several venues that may pique your interest. Such venues include The Mall, The Event Plaza, The Gallery, NPC Villages, etc. In addition, we try our very best to host events daily regardless of how many players are online. Some of our events include Unscramble, Trivia, Zombie Apocalypse, Hunger Games, PvP Tournament, Building Contest, Pig Race, End of the Line, and the King of Ladders. We strive to provide the best service possible. Our staff is always ready to assist players on the go. In short, we assure you of our best attention. Our grand desire is for all players to have a memorable experience here at InvisionCraft. With everything said, it is up to you to walk into the door. Are you in?

112d6f,3,2012-10-06,"I can't do benchtop chemistry anymore, other directions to go with a BS in chem?",thrashtherapy,chemistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/112d6f/i_cant_do_benchtop_chemistry_anymore_other/,"So I'm a senior undergrad, graduating in December and I have no idea what to do anymore. I always thought I would either go to grad school or go into industry. Unfortunately I've come to realize that benchtop chem doesn't keep my attention anymore. This is after 3 years of organic &amp; organometallic research at undergrad (~15-20 hours a week). Plus a summer internship at Cornell CCMR. 

Don't get me wrong I love chemistry, but I've just come to dread my research. I was worried about going for more school for a long time and then with how sick of research I've become its starting to seem like a bad idea.

I know some of this is because I've lost all interest in my research and my adviser doesn't seem to have any direction for the research, it more like lets see what happens if we do this. I need goals to achieve to feel like I'm doing something worthwhile. But all in all it's left a very sour taste in my mouth toward research and making a commitment to grad school (or at least grad school for straight chemistry) seem like a poor choice.

So I'm hoping with all of your infinite knowledge you can give me some other directions to head or look into. Big or little anything I can do with my degree other than hang it on the wall helps. Thanks!!"
115y0p,21,2012-10-08,A wonderfully unexpected way my SO (21M) was there for me (20F) today.,GetThee2ANunnery,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/115y0p/a_wonderfully_unexpected_way_my_so_21m_was_there/,"I am currently studying abroad in Spain while my boyfriend holds down the fort in Texas. Since it's about that time of the year, I started looking for summer internships online. Unfortunately, for the industries I want to intern in (written communication), you often have to submit physical applications, resumes, writing samples, etc.

Naturally, that stresses me out. I won't be back in the States until January, and that's way past most of these deadlines...so I needed help. I especially wanted to apply for a summer internship with a local newspaper, but they required that all application materials (including **eight** original copies of my writing straight from the campus newspaper) be MAILED to their office and the deadline is the end of October. I couldn't possibly pull all that together in Spain. What about references? What about a well-tailored cover letter? Letters of recommendation? Archive diving? It was all too much.

So I was venting my stresses to my beloved boyfriend - who should really receive a medal for all the venting of stress I put upon him - when he said, so simply, ""Well, I could put it all together and mail it for you.""

Cue jaw drop. Maybe he just didn't understand how much work that would involve, poor idiot, but he was the world's biggest champion at that point and I think my heart exploded and leaked out of my ears.

So I worked my ass off to get all the materials I could together and emailed to him, with specific instructions on how to assemble the final package before mailing it from within Dallas. His last text: ""Got it! I'll get it done quickly!"" What would have taken about three weeks to mail from Spain will now take less than three days to mail from within Dallas, and that manila envelope will arrive looking professional, clean, and intact (crossing my fingers for this one).

And that's how my boyfriend saved the day and possibly got me an internship. We'll find out in January!

TL;DR - Boyfriend promises to work his bum off to make sure my application to my dream internship gets in on time and intact. From 5,000 miles away.

115rv3,3,2012-10-08,Full time job &amp; benefits vs. experience question.,counttess,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/115rv3/full_time_job_benefits_vs_experience_question/,"~~Long story short:

I am graduating in December. I currently have a part time job that could *potentially* become full time after I graduate.

I just got offered a part time internship that also offered *potential* full time for when I graduate (at least full time hours, but honestly the pay isn't fantastic for full time).

First job is great, love the people I work with, but it isn't really in a field I want to be in (basically support desk right now). Have been offered to move to another department in the company if I am able to go full time (positive vibes, but not definite). The other department would provide extremely specialized training, and basically jobs I would be qualified for after that are limited based on that training... although obviously could go into another field, just a little more difficult.

Second job seems great, and will provide me with experience that I really want (training and technical writing). In the interview process, he said that many of their interns go full time and it would be a definite possibility for salary. Pays less than other job.

My original intention: I intend on trying to move away from my current location in about a year. The area I'm in is okay, but it's my college town and while it has a neat culture, it's just not quite where I want to live forever. I was going to work full time hours between both jobs (they both have said they can keep me on part time indefinitely).

Problem: My mom is pushing me to go full time somewhere so I can get benefits. The thing is, I can still qualify for health insurance under her so I don't see much point in this. She doesn't want me to go off her plan unless I get benefits through a company, although I would be more than willing to go on my own personal plan. I won't pay for the plan she has me on currently as it costs wayyy too much for what I  need, plus I have a feelings it's being affected by her pricing due to her having had cancer (survivor woo!) and muscular dystrophy.

I can get a 401k plan with matching through the first company (become eligible at the end of this month), so I will start contributing to that.

So, my options:

1. Keep my current plan.

2. Go full time at one of the jobs, I would likely go with the first one due to it paying more. However, I want experience from the second one. I would likely just fight that battle when I get there. What I hate however about this option is my intent to move soon. I simply want to save up money before I move somewhere else.

3. Keep looking for full time positions while working both jobs part time. Again, this seems silly to me because of my intent to move and by the time I found a full time for December, I would only likely be at it for a year at the most.~~

Edit:

**TL;DR**: Is it more worthwhile to get a full time job for benefits, or work full time hours at two different jobs to get experience that I want?"
115qm6,7,2012-10-08,SAP Audit plan for IT Assurance?,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/115qm6/sap_audit_plan_for_it_assurance/,"I have been tasked (as an Intern) to create a basic level IT Audit plan for clients who are utilizing an SAP environment. This means that I am responsible for creating the steps necessary in order to receive the necessary outputs (logs, reports, etc) from SAP to provide us with evidence. 

As an example: I am aware that if I would like to see a list of all transports that were transported into production I would open up T-Code SE16 (Data Browser) and view table E070, which would give me all transports (based on entered criteria) released into production. 

This is about as far as my research has gotten me. Can anyone else point in the right direction for some more information or procedures? Also, is there any way for me to get my hands on a 'sandbox' or sort to ""practice"" the audit procedures that I am coming up with. Finding information and understanding it is one thing but being able it to visualize it and know what to expect is a completely different ballgame. Thanks so much in advance. "
115nf0,0,2012-10-08,How much do you pad your resume?,nroberts666,cpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/115nf0/how_much_do_you_pad_your_resume/,"Just got offered a job that a friend of mine had been offered earlier.  He was offered a good 10k more than I was.  I'm the one he comes to for C++ advice and even design advice.  Very rarely has it gone the other way around and those times have been about particular APIs.

It came down to years of experience.  He had apparently counted a bunch of his intern time as C++ experience while I was only counting my fist real C++ job as that starting point.  So he comes off looking like he's got over 10 years and I look like 7.  Truth be told though I was probably using the language long before he was.

So, obviously I'm selling myself way short here.  I'm still happy with the offer though disappointed that I was offered less than he was...I really am the better coder and even the better C++ specific coder.

What are some ways to leverage more of my pre-official time like that without being a liar?  Do I count the little chat program I made in C++ 12 years ago for $300 as ""professional experience""?  How do you stick stuff like that on a resume?  I've not really counted stuff like that.

Seems like I probably should have gotten this figured out earlier in my career but this is the first time I've really noticed I'm being *harmed* by being too straight forward and not stretching the truth.  Now of course it's a bit too late...very easy to sell the tech guys on my abilities but then the offer was short-changed by numbers.  Would like to improve my offer next go around though."
115mxd,12,2012-10-08,[Story time] I don't think I'm gonna go couchsurfing again anytime soon,Saucy_Puppet_Show,gaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/115mxd/story_time_i_dont_think_im_gonna_go_couchsurfing/,"Story time, bros. Gather round. So, this past weekend I was on a road trip with some work friends (4 girls) to Belgium. 

Being unpaid interns, we found a couchsurfing guy who let us crash for free for a night at his house. I had my reservations about the idea, but on paper, it was a sweet deal: he was going to let us crash for free, make us some food, and give us alcohol. The only thing he wanted from us was to stay up and talk with him and his friends (I think the idea is that he likes the wide range of people you'll encounter when you open your home to strangers). Anyway, we show up and he's got some friends over and some apple mojitos made (I totally got the feeling that he was going to roofie us, but we all made it out un-raped). 

Fairly early on and several times again during the night, our host told us that he was ""a homosexual"" (I don't think the Belgians like using the word gay). Not a big deal, but I don't particularly care to interject my own sexuality into this conversation. But then at one point where my female travelling companions are in their own conversation, he flat-out asks me if I am a homosexual. I casually reply, ""actually, yes."" Much to his surprise. See, he and two of his friends had been discussing the matter (in Dutch, or else I would have understood them). He and his male friend thought I was straight, but his lady friend thought I was gay. She claimed to be able to feel my presence. They then proceed to ask a series of fairly personal questions: am I out to my friends, why didn't I mention it when our host came out, do people usually assume I'm straight, etc. I dodge, dip, duck, dive, and dodge their questions (none of their fucking business).

At this point, he told me that he was not actually gay. Then, he asks me why someone who wasn't gay would claim to be. And I'm just thinking, ""Dude, I don't know. You're the one who fucking did it."" He never really explained himself well, but I think he did it because he likes seeing people's reactions.

The night wound down, and I spent the night in a sleeping bag on a camping mattress.

The next morning, I built him an IKEA entertainment center.

**TL;DR:** Couchsurfing. Host tells my crew that he's ""a homosexual"". Flat-out asks me if I am. Then pulls 180 and says he's straight. I build him a cabinet in the morning."

There's so many games mentioned here that I've never played (WoW, Minecraft, even ones as coveted as Zelda), that I'm beginning to feel like a Gaymer-in training. I'm trying to figure out which games I need to check out, but kind of wanted to get a general idea on where to start first. 

So what's a must-play game that you would strongly recommend to your gaymer intern? 

EDIT: I probably should've mentioned I have a PS3, a computer that I don't think could handle games but I'm willing to try, and an XBox 360."

More about the apartment: It's furnished. The bed in the master bedroom is big, probably a queen-sized matress. The apartment has a washer and dryer in it. Includes basic things like microwave, dishwasher, etc. Back porch. TV.

Once again, Create Now is coming to Reddit for help! You guys were lifesavers on the Reddit Day of Service, so we figured we'd also take advantage of your collective intelligence.

Does anyone know which schools have spring semester internship programs? We have a solid list of tasks and a professional development plan in place and would like to bring in an intern for the spring semester.

We're looking to form a symbiotic relationship where we can train a student in nonprofit management, grant writing, and allow them to take classes at the Center for Nonprofit Management while they take on some basic duties within our Development office. 

So far, I've checked out the websites for a few area schools but if anyone has any advice on the logistics of hiring an intern in LA, we'd appreciate it! Or if anyone can name a few schools with internship programs in place, that would be very helpful. Working with a college to provide credit is a first for us, so any advice in that arena would be useful as well!"

For those of you who are graduating soon, I would like to share this advice. In the real world it doesn't matter how much you know, what matters is who you know. I learned this the hard way. Sure, I graduated with first class standing, I was on the Deans honour roll three years in a row, and I was the recipient of several academic related scholarships, but what does this amount to in the real world? Barely anything. 

My advice to you is START NETWORKING. Develop relationships with people who can help you secure employment upon graduation. Whether you do an internship, volunteering or summer work placements, do something proactive to develop connections. Had it not been for some of the connections I established during my career at Brock, I would likely still be searching for a job. 

Remember, everyone has a bachelors degree nowadays. It's pretty much equivalent to a high school diploma twenty years ago, everyone has one. Depending what program you are in, your degree standing alone will not secure you a job. It's a harsh reality. "

I'm a recent UCF grad, and I came back to UCF to do an internship for the Fall semester.  I need someone to take over the second half of my lease:

The apartment basics:  Hunter's Reserve, on Alafaya and W. Palm Valley Dr. (One block north of Aladaya and McCulloch). You'd have the (huge) master bedroom in a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom. You'd have your own bathroom. 

The price: $500/mo, plus $15 for Internet and roughly $50 for electric.  Pay me the $475 security deposit I put down, and as soon as you sign forms to take over the lease, the apartment is yours.

The roommate: Your roommate is a UCF alum, who is currently in grad school at UCF (and also a part-time substitute teacher).  He's a good guy, and he's a Redditor.  He's dependable and responsible. He's easy to get a long with. No preference as to whether my replacement is male or female.

More about the apartment: It's furnished. The bed in the master bedroom is big, probably a queen-sized matress. The apartment has a washer and dryer in it. Includes basic things like microwave, dishwasher, etc. Back porch. TV. 

The lease: The lease runs until Jul 31, I believe.  I'm heading back to school, out of state, so I need someone to take over the lease.  I was thinking of transferring the lease starting Jan 15th, but since UCF starts Jan 7, I can transfer the lease starting Jan 1 instead.

If you're interested, send me a PM or comment below."

Career advice for going into patent law?,[deleted],Patents,https://www.reddit.com/r/Patents/comments/1154os/working_on_msee_after_jd_career_advice_for_going/,"I graduated from a top 25 law school last year with mediocre grades and no law journal experience. I have a BS in biochemistry and no work experience in that field. No luck finding a job coming out of law school. I got the impression that electrical engineering is a highly sought-after field for patent law, so I enrolled in a master's program for electrical engineering. I plan on being done with that sometime in 2014, depending on what I choose as my area of emphasis.

I'm not sure whether I want to get into patent prosecution or litigation, but for now, I'm leaning toward prosecution. I took a patent drafting class in law school and I liked it. I took a couple substantive patent law classes and found those interesting, too. I plan on taking the patent bar this summer.

I realize that it's kind of an unusual path, as most EE/JD people do the EE degree first. I’ve been kind of a lazy turd my entire academic career (which might explain the odd mixture of degrees), but I would like to start getting my life in order.

Does anyone have any insight/advice to give regarding employment opportunities after I'm done with the MSEE? Here are some related questions in no particular order.

1. Have any of you gone down a similar route?

2. How difficult is the job market for entry-level patent attorneys these days? Patent agents?

3. Should I try to get some kind of engineering internship this summer? Do law firms even do summer internships for post-JD students?

4. Has anyone heard of any IP firms that have a part-time work/internship program that I would be able to do during the school year?

5. I haven't chosen an area of emphasis yet. Are certain areas of EE more marketable to IP firms than others? Or would an MSEE in anything be good enough? I only ask because certain areas of emphasis take longer than others at my school.

6. By the time I finish the MSEE, it will have been about 3 years since I graduated law school. Will this be problematic in getting love from firms?

7. Does the name recognition of my graduate school play a large role? I don’t go to a prestigious-sounding school

TL; DR – BS biochemistry, JD, working on MSEE. Want to find a job after finishing MSEE. Advice?

Thanks to everyone in advance!

Edit: I forgot to mention that I would be looking primarily in California (LA, Bay Area, SD), but would also be interested in NY and DC area."

114zgu,12,2012-10-08,"Followup to my post four months ago: ""Clueless Single Guy with Questions""",Throwaway91216,AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/114zgu/followup_to_my_post_four_months_ago_clueless/,"[Link to my first post for context.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/tzjua/clueless_single_guy_with_questions/)

I'm 21 now and my summer internship is over. I have received several job offers from the company I was working for this summer. I've actually lost count of exactly how many job offers (very large company, many different departments). Even after I accepted a job offer they just sent me more job offers. The offer I accepted is not 1600 miles away from home like my internship, but rather fairly close in my home state. Basically I am starting my senior year of college (midterms are this week, not really ""starting"" anymore) and I already have a well paying job lined up for graduation.

So as usual that part of my life is going splendid (no sarcasm, I'm happy).

Not long after my last post (before I left on my internship) I received a message on okcupid. She was saying that the quiver functionality of okcupid finally did something right and that I seemed like an interesting guy. Over the next month we exchanged upwards of 115 messages (long, thought out messages, not ""lol how r u 2day?""). She was also an intern but another major at another company in a place very far away from where I was (and from the area we lived in), but she still went to a local college around where I lived. After that point she deleted her okcupid account and I was left confused. I figured she just wanted a break or something but she never returned. I actually managed to find her on facebook (on which she was evidently an active user) but she ignored any attempts at communication. I decided not to pester her and move on.

So whatever, I'm over that. We talked a lot online obviously never got to meet up in person. Which leads me to my next adventure. Around that same time another girl on okcupid had sent me a message. Her profile listed her as ""seeing someone"" and ""looking for friends."" I have nothing against friends, so I talked to her for the remainder of the summer. Towards the end of the summer there was a period when no messages were sent for a few weeks. Eventually she made contact again asking me how my job was going. I replied saying it was going well, but more importantly I noticed that her profile now said ""single"" and ""looking for friends, long term relationship."" Fast forward a few more weeks I'm home and we're talking on AIM. She starts mentioning this fair that comes to our area once a year so I asked her if she would be interested in going. She said yes so I bought some tickets online and made plans to pick her up from her school (which happened to be my first college). She asked me if I wanted her to pay me back for her ticket. I told her not to worry about it.

So we go to the fair, have a good time and all that. During the whole fair I noticed that she is extremely shy. Not a big deal, that's only natural. I drive her home and ask her if she would like to get dinner with me some time. She said, ""sure."" We became Facebook friends and made plans for dinner. As a side note her Facebook status confirmed her as single. She also deleted her okcupid account (which was sort of a red flag to me just because the last person who met me from okcupid who deleted her account wanted nothing to do with me anymore). Fast forward to just over two weeks after the fair I picked her up and we went to dinner. I'm noticing that she's still extremely shy and I figured it was just her personality. After dinner we decided to go catch a movie. I wanted to hold her hand or something but she always kept her hands close to her body. Same thing for after the movie -- we were walking to my car and I wanted to hold her hand but they were inside her sleeves and she was slightly huddling over (arms crossed). She said she had a good time. So I'm driving her home at this point. It's important to note that I was planning to at least try and kiss her. We got to her place. Ask the car was coming to a stop she already had her seatbelt undone and when the car came to a complete stop she had her hand on the handle. But she didn't open the door. She just sat there for a bit, huddled close to the door as if she was contemplating leaving but wasn't sure. This position made it so there was no chance in hell I could kiss her in a way that was comfortable for everybody. I was buckled up and she just seemed so far away. We sat there awkwardly for I don't know how long. I eventually asked her if she would like to go out again some time and again, she said, ""sure."" Now I'm driving home and it looks like she forgot her leftovers from dinner. Whatever, I'll keep them in my freezer. I sent her a message saying that I have her leftovers and I'm keeping them in my freezer. She said she realized she forgot them as I was driving off. She then, ten minutes later or so, sent me another message saying, ""Sorry if I was like, weird. I've been feeling kind of weird all day."" I told her not to worry about it.

Fast forward to now. It's her birthday and there was a game on Steam I knew she wanted, so I went ahead and bought it for her. It was a cheap game, no big deal. But now I head over to her Facebook page to wish her a happy birthday and I see, ""In a relationship with [EX BOYFRIEND]."" ""Oh no,"" I thought. Judging by the wall posts between them they are indeed back together. The latest message I received from her was thanking me for the game, saying she's going to be playing it all the time now.

Now I feel lost. I'm asking friends for help on what to do. One friend said he's ""not qualified to talk me through a breakup or whatever."" Another friend says I should confront her. She says that I ""deserve an explanation and an apology.""

I'm a very non-confrontational kind of person. I honestly thought that this might have been going somewhere... she was the first girl I've met who was interested in seeing me again after a first date. I felt good about it. Now I feel shittier than ever about my romantic status. Not that it matters, but I'm out about $200 now on something that turned out to be nothing at all. I had bought her another birthday gift (a physical item) which is normally about $20 but thanks to the magic of rewards points only cost me 55 cents. I was going to invite her over to my place for dinner and Dexter (she hadn't seen Dexter before, but she said she was interested in seeing it). Now I don't think that's going to be happening.

What do I do? I just don't know."

I interned for a large corporation last summer. I loved working there and made it known to my boss that I'd like to return. Some of the other interns in different departments/locations received return offers, but none of the interns in mine have yet. I feel like my performance wouldn't keep me from coming back.

I emailed the senior engineer who I worked/interviewed with and asked him if I should plan on coming back. He said he would bet on my return, and that he'd push for a decision soon.

So I haven't gotten anything in writing yet. Is it ok to be interviewing with other companies? Recruiting season for this industry is early and I don't want to get left in the dust. Ideally, I just want to go back to my old company. If I get an offer should I email my previous internship again? Is it ok to go on 2nd or 3rd round interviews (flying for site visits) for new companies with this in the back of my mind?"

What would be a bad idea? My three ideas are:  
  
1) A former intern of mine I trained from scratch, helped me manage volunteers and witnessed me give educational demonstrations. She eventually went on to grad school herself.   
2) A former boss (from about 5 years ago and in my field) who we've stayed in touch and he's become a sort of mentor of mine  
3) The volunteer coordinator for the place I'm helping out. She probably has an idea about my personality and work ethic, but I haven't been helping them very long.  ~1 month

I'm moving to your wonderful city tomorrow and just had a pang of anxiety about how little I know regarding the day to day stuff. If someone was moving to London I'd immediately say that they should:

   * Get an Oyster Card for Travel and put pre-paid credit on it for Public Transport
   * Get a Giff-Gaff sim card for £15 a month no contract all you can eat data and minutes
   * Go for any major bank for a current account there's not much difference
   * Look at MoneySavingExpert.com to get the best Credit Card for you
   * Sign up with a government backed Gym, they're much cheaper
   * Sign up to the RunRiot mailing list for fun and different events
   * Use TimeOut.com as your go-to for Restaurants and Mainstream events

So it's those sort of things I'd love to hear.

I have a room in an apartment sorted in Nolita, so no worries there and I'm coming because of a job so that's sorted, I also have a SSN already as a result of an internship I did in California. Anything else you can help me with or that you wished you knew before coming to the city i'd be glad to hear from you.

Side Question: Have any of you taken a driving test in the states having had a European license? Is it easy/cheap? I don't want to use my passport for ID in case I lose it!

114myu,3,2012-10-08,I'm looking to take some time off (1-3 years) between my undergraduate and applying/going to law school. I have a bunch of questions about priorities and several other issues!,EnterpriseE1701E,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/114myu/im_looking_to_take_some_time_off_13_years_between/,"Hi-- thanks for taking the time to read/respond.  Additionally, I'm sorry if this is in the wrong subreddit, but I didn't know where else to put it.

As the title says, I'm looking to take time off between finishing my undergraduate, which will be done in the Spring of 2013. I'll be graduating with a degree in Philosophy and English, and genuinely want to go into law (probably something criminal justice related). 

I've talked to many sources, some law advisors, others ADAs, others jaded corporate lawyers, but they have all told me that taking time off between the two can be really good, since once I graduate, I will genuinely need to work because debt/other factors will be very strong reasons to really use my degree.  

But they've all varied differently in relation to what they think I should be doing with all of this time off. The corporate lawyer in particular thinks that taking a few years off, getting some semi-mindless job, or going for an MA, while making sure to get drunk a bunch is a good use of my time.

The law adviser has pointed out that there are a lot of law-esque positions, not all of which take place in an office (advocacy/positions helping victims of violent crimes, etc), and that even being a paralegal for a few years could be a good boost on my resume, and help to make sure I want to do law as a career.

A few other notes-- I'm currently taking an internship as a legal assistant and am genuinely loving the experience. I work in a legal services office for students on campus.  Additionally (not sure if it is relevant), I've put off taking the LSATs, as I've been self-testing at ~167, but would like it higher, especially for the scholarships/wider opportunities that come along with the higher scores.

To the actual question, maybe you could see me working up to it-- I've decided I want to take some time off, but genuinely am baffled to figure out my priorities (what I want done with this time), what I want to do, where, if I should be helping my resume, or picking a job I'll love, or what!  I'm incredibly nervous about the entire experience, even just on the level of thinking about what I want to do in this time!

Any feedback, or any thoughts are super appreciated! Thanks."

I asked her why she hadn't gone to the police, and she told me that she didn't want to cause anyone any pain. (What?) The problem is, it happened a while ago, and there's basically no evidence.

We see each other at work every day, and we share coffee and talk like nothing happened. I'm one of only two people on the planet who knows besides her and her rapist.

I wanted some advice on whether it would be in my best interest to pursue traditionally male-dominated industries in my job hunt.

Quick rundown of my job hunting situation:

- I am looking for marketing related work, ideally promotion, communications or consumer insight.  No sales!

- In May 2012 I graduated from one of the top #25 MBA programs in North America.

- I went straight to my MBA program out of undergrad.  I chose to do this because I started a successful online business my senior year of high school.  I ran that business for 4+ years while getting my undergraduate degree.

- I had 3 valuable internships during grad school, including significant social media experience.

- Over the summer my job hunt was restricted geographically, and I didn’t have many interviews.

- Interviewing picked up towards the end of August.  I’ve had 8 interviews since then (2 were second round) but no offers.

- I’m currently doing an unpaid internship to avoid having a huge gap of unemployment on my resume.  It’s nothing special but they’re very flexible, which is perfect for me right now.

I recently decided that I am no longer restricting myself geographically, so I am now focusing on companies I am personally interested in.  And where I get back to my original question, I’ve always had a little tomboyish-geek streak, and I want to know if this could be to my advantage. 

**As a woman, would I have a better or worse chance finding a marketing position in male-dominated industries?** (I’m currently considering video gaming, professional sports, beer.)  Would companies in these industries actually be interested in female employees who are passionate about their products and services?

After the chapter reading is over, I try to lead a discussion by asking questions.  Unfortunately, a literary discussion with 7th graders is very hit or miss.  I close the discussion by giving them a journal entry to complete in their notebooks, something that connects the book with their real life. 

Today convinced me I should change it up.  Discussions are not working the way I want to with their rowdy behavior.  They get too riled up to want to complete the journal, and when they finish, I can't convince them to stay quiet to let the others finish.
  I'm afraid to do any cooperative learning exercises or games or anything that'll convince them to shout over one another.  

The one thing that worked is a series of tasks.  Right after one chapter reading, I lead a short (often loud) discussion about the chapter and how it could relate to slavery.  Then I gave them a picture prompt, a pic related to slavery, and asked them to write about it....and then the reactions from two of the characters.

I've just reached chapter 20, and I'm low on ideas to keep them engaged while keeping them from creating chaos.

Please help!  Any ideas for teaching a core novel?

EDIT:  I'm also being observed by my supervisor every week!  No pressure!

117t6f,0,2012-10-09,"Dream opportunity, but complications with temporary visa, UK/USA &gt; Canada -- Please help",Iemaj,canada,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/117t6f/dream_opportunity_but_complications_with/,"Hi guys,

Senior undergrad in the U.S. -- I was born and raised in England, but moved to the U.S. and have a green card.

I was offered a paid internship for 4.5 months from spring to end of summer in Toronto Canada.

Here's a detailed explanation of where I stand currently:

I looked into traveling abroad in terms of owning a US Green Card as a UK citizen. This will not be an issue as it will be for 4.5 months, and I will still be making payments on my car, through my U.S. bank account, and I will still be registered at my university with plans to return in the fall. More than enough to certify this is my permanent residence for re-entry to the U.S.

2: http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/work/apply-how.asp#step2 This is the step by step on getting a temporary work visa. It tells us:

Before you fill out the application, you will need:

a written job offer from your employer

proof that you meet the requirements of the job (for example, proof of certain education or work experience) and

the positive labour market opinion on your job offer from Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC), if one is required. If you are applying for a work permit for a job that requires a Labour Market Opinion (LMO), you must now include the valid LMO with your application. We are no longer accepting work permit applications without valid LMOs.
If you need an HRSDC opinion, it is up to your employer to get it and send it to you. For more information about HRSDC opinions, see Frequently asked questions.

 In following this, I emailed my potential employer, for the internship, asking for an official job offer in PDF, along with a HRSDC opinion document, if they needed to provide one, and if not, acknowledging that in the job offer. Unfortunately, I have received this reply:

""... [our company] is not able to assist you in obtaining a work permit. Your offer of an internship is only an offer once you have already obtained your work permit... [our company] can not hire a foreigner for this job unless we prove to the Canadian government that we can not find a Canadian to do the job, (the HRSDC #)... I would suggest that you look into the SWAP program...""

I originally tried to go through SWAP, but they said that they wouldn't help me with my particular situation, and so contacted my schools International Student Services Organization, which haven't been any help so far. They have been emailing people looking for advice, but without any luck as of yet.

This was the embassy I was planning on going through. Note my permanent residence is Massachusetts.

http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/offices/missions/new-york.asp

With all this in consideration, should I just apply for the temporary work permit for canada without the certain employment letter in NYC and hope I get the visa?

Another thought I had was that since I have a UK passport, I know I can travel freely in Canada for up to 6 months without a visa. Would I be able to do the internship if I were not being paid? This would involve renting an apartment there etc. Is this legal?

This could mean potentially be getting a great job in the field vs being unemployed for a large amount of time after graduation. If any of you have any advice, tips, knowledge, or anything that might be of assistance to me I will be very grateful, unfortunately this is the perfect internship for my field, and so I really don't want to let it go. 

tl;dr -- I am a UK citizen with a green card in the U.S. offered a paid internship in toronto canada -- How do I get a work permit without the companies confirmation during application process?"

Where to go from here?,Throwaway77665544,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/117qkj/she_22f_moved_to_paris_until_next_may_left_me_25m/,"We started dating in March. At that time, we didn't know she was going to be selected for this internship. Both wereleaving school at the same time. Everything was amazing. She is the first girl I have ever loved. Then she gets selected. This isn't the first time she has been there. Studying abroad and temporary work. 

The summer rolls by and the clock is ticking. She moves in with my parents and I because she wants to spend all the time she can with me. She tells me how much she has fallen in love with me.

The night before she leaves to stay with her parents before the big leave, she wakes up crying saying she isn't ready and how good she is going to take care of me when she gets back.

Fast forward a week to being with her parents. We get into an argument because she doesn't want me to spend the money to come visit her. Makes me feel insecure and unwanted. A few days go by and within that time she decides to break up with me. 

I'm hysterical. She cries and tells me she still loves me but needs to be free in Paris. Says that I'm too old and she is too young and needs to experience life before she settles down. She says I need to be comfortable without her and find a career path.

She keeps talking to me. I can't help it. I love her. She finally leaves for Paris. She gets there and is scared. Tells me she might want to be with me and to give her a month. Finds all kinds of friends. It's my birthday, and she tells me I can visit. I start to look up flights. She gets scared and says that she doesn't want it to mean we are getting back together. Still tells me she loves me. I tell her she needs to make up her mind. She says she knows

Fast forward to now. I leave this past weekend to visit some friends and for her to think it over. I come back to a message on Skype saying she isn't ready and that she doesn't want to have a long distance relationship with the expectations of being together when she gets back. Still says I can come visit. I apologize for putting too much pressure on her and that I have cabin fever with my parents. Doesn't respond.

Catch her on Facebook today asking if she got my message. Says she doesn't want me to visit her anymore but she still misses me but can't be in a relationship.

I don't know what to do Reddit. She gives me hope, only to take it away all the time. I feel like I'm the one who has to sacrifice everything until she fulfills her dream, again. What scares me is in the beginning of the relationship is she told me all of her sexual fantasies there, which I have no control over now. I'm scared that if she does come back into my life, her vagina will be used property. She tells me that she isn't there to do that, but all signs point to that. She is also insecure about the number of women I've been with.

As I sit here at my dead end job that I hate with a vague degree, living with my parents at 25, and away from the social scene I was used to. I'm lost and driving myself insane. I work, go to workout, go home, go to bed (or at least try to sleep). I love her so much but I feel like I'm loosing her.

Reddit, what should I do?

TL;DR Girl uproots herself to move to Paris, leaves loving guy behind only to be all wishy washy and wants her cake and eat it too."

Brouns office today....,AngryFarmGuy,atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/117p6y/so_i_called_rep_brouns_office_today/,"Actually I decided to call 2 of his offices today to see what they had to say. The first office I called was his DC office (202) 225-4101. A pleasant sounding woman answered and I asked a simple question:

""How does Congressman Broun reconcile his religious beliefs with the fact he has been divorced 3 times?""  

The woman took a decidedly different tone, and stated ""I will not respond to that attack"" and hung up on me.  

I then called one of his Georgia offices (706) 447-3857 and again a pleasant sounding girl answered the phone, so I asked her the following question:

""Why does Congressman Broun use the bible as a guide for voting instead of the Constitution? He didn't take an oath to support and defend the bible, he took an oath vowing to support the Constitution"". 

The girl stated she was not allowed to comment on that, and then she admitted that she was an intern. I asked her what her personal thoughts were on the question and she again said she could not comment. 

I then asked her if someone stated that they would use the Quran as their guide to voting, would that be a problem?  To that I was actually surprised she said yes, that would be a problem for many people.  

I actually felt sorry for this girl simply based on the tone of her voice. She sounded worn out. I inquired as to whether she had received alot of calls similar to mine, and she said yes, all day long both yesterday and today. I thanked her for her time and hung up. 

This dumbfuck doesnt only need to be kicked off of the science and tech committee, he needs to be the fuck out of Congress.

And I have never voted for a democrat in my life :)"

Any other suggestions?

Just some background information before I start to ramble.  I've been working at a food service place for almost 10 years and I started in high school to get extra money to get pay through college.  I've been working through all the positions but still have not been put on all of (chef and cold bar[salad recipes]).  I mainly work 7am - 3pm but it varies on what position I'm on.  Plus I'm only making 10ish dollars an hour which makes me even more angry.  

This past week I was washing dishes with two other co-workers and one of my co-workers decides to leave the area and not come back till an hour later.  This drives my crazy so I sit outside for awhile to cool myself down so I don't yell at her. We finally finish without her and sit down while someone else comes up to me and tells I'm not supposed to be sitting down.  This fuels the fire with in me and my co-worker, that didn't do anything for an hour, comes walking by and I raise my voice and yell at her.  After that I got pulled in the office for yelling at her and was told next time I need to go to a supervisor when my co-worker is gone.  Reason I'm angry is she does this all the time and nothing happens with her.  

Today, different from previous, I was not aloud to leave early because supervisor needed help with some stuff.  Again I'm angry because people are outside smoking and I'm not aloud leaving early? (we generally are aloud to leave early if we have everything done).  

I'm so stressed out and I know some of you will say to look for another job.  I've been doing that since I've gotten out of college.  Jobs around me are only paying 10 dollars or less or the jobs that are 10 dollars plus I have no experience for.

So I went ahead and just cancelled my EY requests for interviews. I barely talked to them, and here's why I don't think I'll get one:

I spent damn near a year talking to 5-6 people at PwC, including even having worked for a client of theirs, getting to know a Manager, being on pretty solid terms with the recruiter, and I have two relevant internships (including that client) that cover both internal AND external auditing and controls. 

I didn't get that interview. Got rejected for them, GrantThornton, and McGladrey. So I said fuck it. 

Some of you may know I work for a smaller/mid-size firm. I do, and I'm happy with them. I love it. I won't receive or get to discuss an offer until next summer however, and this is why I went ahead and recruited anyways. I wanted to have the options and not be left hanging. 

So I just want to say thanks for all the advice. This OCR has been depressing, and I'm out."

Has anyone else been here before? ,this_guyyy,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/117k18/the_most_important_period_of_my_life_is_slipping/,"First off, I'm new here, just found it the other day. and thank god! 

I know there must be many of you who must be dealing with the struggles of university, balancing a social life, missing an ex and trying to fight their addiction fapping. 

Here's my story
* Final year of university, trying to attain an A- average for my so I can get into a good grad school.
 
* I play on two sports teams (used to workout)  
* I'm on student council 

* I have a great internship that gives me a big time opportunity in my field (if I can get the work done). 

* I am a seemingly happy, handsome and sociable guy. I get girls, but not ones that live up to my standards of the past (see below)

The bad: 
* I have a crippling addiction to fapping and porn 

* I procrastinate and procrasti-bate so much that my future is slipping away from me
 
* a year ago I broke up with the most beautiful, loving girl I've ever met (who did more than internet porn could do for me). She was the perfect and incredible in bed. I was immature however and did no appreciate her and for some reason couldnt see a future with her. I broke up with her believing that she was the one who was holding me back from attaining the success and happiness I was searching for in life. I WAS DEAD WRONG. She wasn't holding me back, something else was..

* I've been masterbating daily since I was about 14. I am now 21. Since my breakup I increased my fapping to about 3-4 daily and I've noticed the changes: 

* I'm far more anxious
* I'm tired 
* Far less concentration in general 
* I get into bi-polar moods
* I'm not my funny, witty self anymore
* I can't concentrate on homework 
* I think far too much about my ex (including fapping) 
* She's also very happy with another guynmow (the guy I could have been)
* I've begun to loose my hair (stress and masterbation induced I suspect {increased DHT levels}) 
* I can't talk to other girls like I used to (subconsciously I want it sex) 
* I am have no self confidence, despite having the tools to do the job (I don't want to sound like a cocky guy, I know some people probably wish they had it as good as I do)

I went without fapping for about 3 weeks this summer while I was travelling Europe (2 months total) but thats cuz I had virtually no time alone. But now I'm back home and I have infinite wi-fi at my hands and lots of alone time.. 
I stopped 6 days ago but relapsed yesterday. And because I have no willpower anymore I said fuck it and fapped 3 times today :( . I've already missed the deadline for 2 assignments now. (hello late penalties) 

At the moment I have all this work due this week and I can't sit down at the damn computer fucking touching my self. I hate it. I hate myself. 

The love of my life fell for my potential. I have lots of it, and I'm half the man I should be.

I just found this subreddit and I sure am glad. I knew it wasn't right all these years. I knew there was something wrong with me. 

I just need to know that someone else has been here before. This is the 4th quarter, this is the shotclock running down. I NEED TO GET MY LIFE ON TRACK IN THE NEXT 6 MONTHS OR I'VE WASTED EVERYTHING. This is crunch time for me. I need serious motivation, techniques, tricks, things to block porn, anything! I just want to do my work... 

I will not stand by and watch the demise of men. Help me and I promise to be a regular contributor the conversation.


**Update** 
**Today I was able to do the most beneficial thing for my recovery thus far**. I told my roommate/one of my best friends about my struggles. It came about after he bombed an interview for his dream job. He wanted to go for a walk and I knew it was time to tell someone. Honestly, it was extremely difficult to get it out of me but once it happend we talked for hours. Bottom line: SEEK OUT YOUR FRIENDS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HARDSHIP AS WELL, THEY WILL FIGHT ALONG SIDE YOU. The future is bright! Thanks guys**

117igr,16,2012-10-09,"It's hiring season at a lot of universities, so how are your career fairs/interviews going?",ahage16,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/117igr/its_hiring_season_at_a_lot_of_universities_so_how/,"I'm a junior ME/CS major, and I managed to get three interviews this time around (2 from career fair, one by applying online). This was my first time interviewing for a position in industry, so I didn't know what to expect, and I figured I would share my experience.

My first interview was with a smaller software company who would have use for MechE skills, and I think this one spoiled me a bit for the other two. I spent about 30 minutes talking to the CEO of the company about what they do, which areas I like, where I would fit best, etc - nothing technical. Then I spent another 30 minutes talking to a newer hire about working there plus some other cliche interview questions like my strength/weaknesses. It all felt really casual, and there was no pressure at all. We were just having a conversation about the company and myself to see if it would be a good fit for both of us, and I wish they all went that way.

Second interview was with a much larger company involved with the oil industry - standard ME stuff. If nothing more, this interview convinced me I don't want to work for that company. I was interviewed by engineers, but all their questions were so boring, and they seemed completely uninterested in the work they work they were doing. Maybe those two engineers were just inexperienced interviewers, but starting every question with 'Tell me about. . .' doesn't really keep the conversation flowing. Lasted about 20 minutes total.

Final interview was this morning at a midsize-large company in the aerospace industry. We had an allotted time of 30 minutes. First 10 minutes were spent just going through my resume, and talking about things I've done. This portion went pretty well I think - not much can go wrong with describing my experience and answering some basic questions. Second 10 minute portion didn't go quite as well - it was all technical  questions. When I went to talk to this company at the career fair, I had wanted to talk to someone in product design, but they didn't have someone in that area, so I talked to a systems engineer. What he was doing seemed really interesting, but I haven't had any courses related to that yet, such as control systems. This wouldn't have been that bad if we were just talking about the problems, because then I could explain what I don't know and what I think I understand, or could at least try and figure out. But he just gave me a piece of paper and asked me to write down my answers. I didn't have much to write down because even when I thought I understood what was going on in the question, I didn't know how to put it very neatly in words. Once we started discussing the answers, though, and I asked a question, he would just tell me the complete answer, so I didn't really get a chance to show any of my thought process in approaching that problem. I thought this was sort of an odd way to ask interview questions for an intern, but I don't know if this is how it is usually done.

And that's everything. Basically, I have no idea what to expect of interviews since so far they have all been quite different."

Today, it's been about four months and I've had a stressful day at my internship, got into a huge argument with parents, and to top it all, got in a minor crash at the parking lot.

I had a cigarette, but it wasn't like the many times I smoked on a stressful day at college. I didn't feel so great. Sure, I felt a bit lightheaded from the nicotine, but it wasn't a relaxing sensation. I felt a bit sick, that I given up on my resolve to stop smoking. However, I think that I can learn from this event that smoking is only a temporary escape from my problems and that it won't do me any good.

Good luck to the rest of you quitting smoking. "
117g7k,12,2012-10-09,Desperation is a smelly cologne I don't want to wear/Am I being played?

Also, I texted her yesterday night to see if she wanted to hang out tonight, haven't heard a response; does it come off as desperate to call her this evening?**

So I moved to a new area - a college town - a month and a half ago into a house with a bunch of grad students. There's this girl who's a friend of several of them; she recently moved back to the area for school after a brief stint for an internship a few months ago.

Anywho, a couple weekends ago my housemates and I are going to go out to this party where this girl will be and it's mentioned to me that she finds me cute. We end up flirting most of the night but nothing physical beyond occasional contact happens. The next night there's another party, and it's basically a repeat of the night before. This bums me out and I say as much to my housemates who warn me that 1) she had a relationship with a past housemate that began and ended in the course of a few weeks, 2) she would have one-night stands, and 3) she probably didn't like me but was just out for attention, so I should tread with caution.

The first two points they made didn't bother me but the third one did. Nevertheless I got a text from her the following day asking if I wanted to hang out, so I went over to her place the following day and chatted with her for a while - again, nothing physical, but she extended an invitation to hang out the next night. I maneuvered that into going out for a couple drinks. **Here** is where I started to get nervous; I realized that I was starting to like her. What my housemates said could only be so troublesome when she was just some pretty girl, but the fonder I became of her the more dangerous it could be for me (I came out of a long-term relationship at the end of the summer and while I'm not necessarily looking to hop into a serious relationship, it would still hurt to be into someone and have them do a total 180). The night ended with a hug and a peck on the cheek but nothing more.

I was feeling pretty confused: if she's kind of an easy girl then why would she move so slow? This made me think maybe she was just out for attention. A few days later, though, I went over to her place to watch a movie, at the end of which we made out for a good while in her bed. No sex, but the physical barrier was definitely broken. Before leaving I said it'd be fun to get a drink again and she told me anytime.

Last time I saw her was Saturday night and yesterday night (Monday) I texted her asking if she wanted to get a drink tonight; I didn't get a response yesterday nor have I gotten one today.. The warnings of my housemates echo in my ear but it really *seems* like she's at least enjoying herself. Furthermore, during a break in making out the other day she asked me if I had a girlfriend, as she had been told that some Americans operated that way (she's foreign). Why would it matter to her if I was involved if she had no semblance of affection towards me?

Basically I'm looking for advice on A) does it look desperate to call her up this evening having not received an answer to my question, and B) does it seem, based on what I've written, that I'm being played?

**Edit**: Hooray! I just checked my e-mail and she sent me a message; turns out she lost her phone while out this weekend. And to boot, she asked me in the e-mail if I was free later this week.

Is it common in this industry to pay EEs more than MEs solely on the fact that they're an EE? This work isn't at all hard technically. More alongside the business/sales side of engineering.

--------------------------------------------


They say that I am a pillar 

Strong warrior woman, who gives a damn 

And fights injustice with a baby at the hip

An idol

Driven, motivated and absolutely set 

On ending oppression and saving the rest

I'm perfect.


They think I must not sleep

Or that all my dreams amount to unassured realities 

And then I speak.

I lead.

But those who fight, like I do

Tooth and nail and without stopping for breath

Are running

We're running from something terrible, because in the past

Or currently and sometimes forever, we are hurt.

Running wild, constantly moving and forgetting to eat is how we forget 

And the injustice - It's spread out like a blanket

unraveling and knitting it's self into new shapes.

I bite.


It was the rape that kicked me into high gear

To forget the greatest insult to my self determination 

I determine how to stop the whole damn world,

Turn it around, and perhaps in the process,

Turn back time. 

I hide. 


On the eve of my collapse it was fever pitch

I never said No to anything, like before -- Nothing good came of that.

4.0, 4 positions of leadership and power. The hours and pressure couldn't be higher.

All of the sudden remembered.



The battlefield blurred and I was alone in a sea of meaningless jargon

Videos, leaflets and drives. Movements, interns and praise to grasp at

All swirling before my eyes. 

I stood still.


It was vertigo, and My world shrunk to the head of a pin. 

I remember running, but in which direction I can't remember.

I can find my way and see color, but it's so beautiful it blisters my fingers when I touch it.

I can't breathe. 



Now I watch, covered in bandages and sucking open wounds

My mouth utters small explainations

My ass is creating a small indent where I sit on the sidelines.



The battle is inside me now. 

All of my running is paced and under flourencent lights

Pills and co-pays and reorientation to feeling. 



Everything around me swirls and energy is high 

I'm almost consumed by any gravitational force. 

There is a small person with a long shadow inside my heart

And to the warriors around me and the stumbling efforts at regulation

She whispers and yells

Give them hell."

I want to quit,Not_Ayn_Rand,finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1175x4/first_internship_and_it_sucks_i_want_to_quit/,"I've already posted this on WSO but I wanted some reddit input as well. [WSO post](http://www.wallstreetoasis.com/forums/first-internship-and-it-kinda-sucks-wanting-to-quit)

I'm a sophomore in college and got my first finance related internship this semester. This is my third week. I'm supposed to work until December and I'm not getting paid (just compensated for lunch and transportation).

The problem is that it's not really related to finance and it's basically a sales role at an analytics company. And I really suck at sales with English not being my first language and just being a shy person in general. I basically get yelled at every day. I'm pretty sure the company REALLY needed interns and that's why I got an offer. I don't really like the people in my office, but I assume that happens everywhere.

More information on the company: it is an outsourced analytics company. All research work is done in India and no one in the NYC office does research.

What I do: I make cold sales calls, dig up companies and phone numbers to call, and sometimes write memos about companies my bosses have sales meetings with.

Since this was the first offer I got, I got too excited and accepted right away, which was a huge mistake because a few days later I was offered positions at different companies where I could learn more about the finance industry itself.

I really wanted to quit, but the boss, who went to my school, keeps telling me that she'll be in a difficult position if I quit. And she promised me that she will put me in contact with different people if I do well (she used to work in IBD). I'm afraid she might talk bad about me to her contacts if I quit. Since I don't have any relevant work experience, I need something on my resume too.

But every day it's just frustrating because I feel like I'm not improving at all and I keep getting yelled at. I'm sure sales skills are probably a good thing to have, but I want to go into equity research (presumably a sector I wouldn't need a lot of sales skills for).

Since I only have two more months, should I just suck it up and stick with this job?

**TL;DR:** Sophomore majoring in finance doing sales internship. Job sucks and I'm not learning a lot. Boss who used to be in IBD says she can put me in contact with people if I do well. I don't have work experience. Should I stick with the job until I get done in December?

Edit (10/18/12): I've been sticking out so far and will probably do so until at least this month and then see what happens. Don't let that keep you from commenting though, I'm appreciating everyone's advice."

Last Spring, I took an internship with a production company in LA, who happens to have partnering offices in Köln and München, and other places throughout Europe.  I just contacted the Köln offices yesterday about taking a Praktikum (internship) with them and the vibe i got was pretty good.  

My only problem is: fuck, i love los angeles but i love production and camera work (which can take me anywhere) too.  I also really enjoy Germany but what if i fuck up, ya know?  I don't want to lose a chance but at the same time, what if I should just go with my connection in LA?  and on top of all of this, i have a relationship with a really good girl...the best connection i have had in a relationship.  

People tell me that if i have a second thought about it, than i shouldn't do it.  but honestly, i don't believe for a second that you can't move to another country without thinking critically about it ATLEAST once...I need some guidance.  As you can tell, i have so many thoughts going on this morning that grammar has completely flown out of the window.  I am suppose to be studying for two exams, but i can't even concentrate. 

Also, speaking of grammar, i am pretty good with basic German.  But I definitely need more work before the end of the school year.

I used to be optimistic about my chances of finding a job, but now I'm pretty much disillusioned. Have sent out about 100 apps since the end of August and haven't heard back from a single one. (The only plus is that my cover letter writing skills are improving significantly.)

My first question is: do I need to start applying a LOT more aggressively? Right now I'm averaging about 1 or 2 apps a day, and I worry that I'm not sending out enough apps. (However I am balancing 6 classes and 2 part-time jobs and am just exhausted all the time...) Writing 2 customized cover letters takes an hour of sleep away from me and I guess I'm not motivated enough to sacrifice sleep for filling out applications...

Second question: do I need to be less selective? I'm only applying to jobs that pay money, nothing that exceeds $30,000/yr, I think. However I am worried that in the eyes of hiring managers I'm basically crap compared to all the other applicants who already have 3-5 years of experience. I'm thinking about looking into unpaid internships just to get a foot into the door and maybe segue into a full-time job as a result of the internship, but am not sure if these unpaid internships will translate into any tangible worth, or if they're just ploys to get free labor....

I know this probably sounds naive as hell, so I would really appreciate it if somebody could help put it into perspective for me. Thanks!

EDIT: just to clarify I am not in DC. I am actually halfway across the country. That makes it about 100x more difficult."

* I have an MS Ed. in School and Mental Health Counseling from an Ivy League.

* I finished my Masters program with a 4.0 GPA.

* I completed internships at an elementary school, high school, and a community mental health agency and I have worked with a huge array of clients, many of whom were on the very severe end of the spectrum.

* I am currently working in the field as a child/adolescent therapist and plan to work for another year before applying to PhD programs, so I should have significant work experience by then.

* In another year or so I should be eligible for licensure as a professional counselor (I passed the NCC; now I'm just working toward fulfilling the hours requirement).

* I am quite sure that I would receive outstanding letters of recommendations from any of my supervisors.

* I serve on the alumni committee for my Masters program and work closely with the program director, who likes me and would probably be willing to help me out.

* I'm a strong writer.

The Cons:

* My undergraduate degree was in Journalism, and I graduated with a low-ish GPA (3.1), albeit from one of the top journalism schools.

* When I took the GRE two years ago, my quantitative score was abysmal (we're talking bottom 2%) and I almost gave up on applying for Masters programs. I had studied dutifully for months. I have always had a *serious* deficiency when it comes to math and I suspect it might actually be a cognitive impairment. I otherwise did well on the verbal section (70th percentile), and scored a 5/5 on the writing section.

What do you think, r/gradadmissions? Do I have a shot? Is it even worth applying? Any ideas for programs I could apply to? Anything I could do to improve my odds?

- Should I be applying right now while I'm still in school or should I wait until after I graduate? 
- Do most applications for professional jobs at least let you know you weren't selected, or do they just not respond? 
- I've mostly been applying through Indeed.com and from company websites directly. Are there any other sites or resources I should use other than UIC's Career Services department? 
- How can I find smaller businesses and organizations to apply to other than walking around and asking if they're looking for an accountant?"

I am sort of new to the fitness game. Little background about myself... I am 22 yrs old, I weight a whopping 250lbs and I am 6'1. I  recently started (1 month ago) really trying to get fit, I moved away for an internship and have nothing better to do. I have been doing a lot of cardio(6 days a week... most of it comes from doing Insanity since its getting colder outside) and working out my arms every other day.

 After today I really felt my my muscles were dying after my workout, i just felt like they were deteriorating. My cousins and friends have mentioned to me to try taking protein shakes, such as Isoflex, since I am trying to burn fat and not gain mass. It;s a little expensive for me to buy protein shakes. I have heard that replenishing my electrolytes also helps (gatorade and etc), and I have heard good things about chocolate milk. I haven't had time to do my own research yet, but I am on a really healthy meal plan right now... which I think is doing wonders for me. I wanted to know what would you guys recommend in regards to what I should drink post workout to help my body recover and keep my (what little amount of) muscles I have intact. 

Thanks for the help, I hope to become an active member in this reddit!"

11682z,8,2012-10-08,21F graphic design student looking to fit in the creative professional field,[deleted],femalefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/11682z/21f_graphic_design_student_looking_to_fit_in_the/,"* **Height:** 5’4
* **Weight:** 125-130
* **Age:** 21
* **Body type:** Curveless pear
* **Why?** I’m a graphic design student without a wardrobe to reflect that. I feel that I don’t have bad taste or a bad eye, I just have trouble pushing myself to try more adventurous looks. Especially after moving to NYC, the disparity between the way I dress and my coworkers/other professionals/twentysomethings I see on the subway has become painfully obvious. I recently got my hair cut to something a little more polished and modern and would like a wardrobe to match. I've also started working out and getting more in shape and confident about my body so I think a celebration of new clothes is in order.
* **You now:** Simple/basic. Solid colors with subtle patterns and clean cuts, usually somewhat fitted. Lots of tank tops. I have a few interesting pieces, but no distinctive style. Very few accessories. Typically wear blues/purples, red on occasion and neutral colors. I know what I like, but typically think I can’t pull it off and default to a minimalist aesthetic. I wear no make-up except the occasional eyeliner when I remember to (hardly ever).
* **You after:** I’m torn between styles. Styles that appeal to me are as follows: androgynous (especially vests/blazers/button-ups), slightly edgy, classical feminine. I’m not really a fan of bright or distracting patterns or crazy cuts, or anything overly feminine/frilly. I’m flexible with having different styles but I want each outfit I wear to be purposeful, rather than something I just threw on. The designer's dress code is lax, so I’m looking for ideas on how to be more put together, yet still creative and not overly professional. The general tone I would like overall (aesthetics can vary) tone to be ""badass/snarky."" I look pretty young (and too sweet) for my age so any ideas on how to look older and more put together would be appreciated. I'm open to start wearing make up as long as it isn't overdone or time-consuming.
* **Budget:** I’m a college student with paid internships, if that’s helpful. I’m pretty open to anything $50 and under, within reason. If it’s really special/unique/an investment I’ll shell out anywhere from $50–$120 for it. I need help knowing where to look besides the typical big brands and obscure boutiques I can't afford.

* [**Photo Album:**](http://imgur.com/a/JOcLT#0) Contains headshot, full body, and some inspiration outfits that appeal to me. 

I hope that's enough for you guys to go off of. Thanks in advance, FFA!"

I will go see a psy. office this week.


this is a problem I've been having since I was around 16. I'm 22 now. It's been very mild up to today after having a talk with my ex who catalyzed how I feel (will get to that later). everything I mention here never really seriously affected my life before, but it did change my mentality. however, I feel I should've looked for help sooner, as I am having a rather difficult time right now, at a delicate point in my life when I have to be 100% focused on work.

Ever since I learned how the world functions it all appeared wrong in my eyes. the need for money, the inequality of wealth, famine, corruption, wars, religion, etc.  while I was pondering upon these subjects I started having suicidal thoughts, I didn't want to live in this world, nor did I want to bring a child in it, but my love for my family helped me overcome those thoughts, also meeting some good people helped me regain some faith in humanity. as time passed by I got more and more disgusted with the world, and I started feeling like I do not belong to this society. I have a handful of friends who I love, however, and I only feel good with them. also, I love spending a lot of time with older people, because they have much to teach me about the world. my family is deeply religious, and I never feel comfortable with it (I am an atheist), except for my father who, I learned, shares most of my feelings, except that he managed to get past the phase where he lets these global problems affect him. 

so, during this past month I finished a research project for one of my classes (I'm in a Chemistry B.S., one more year before my MS), and my professor told me to gather up some more data and publish the results. I have never been a truly good student, but apparently (I am not fully convinced about that, but my professor is) I am a very good scientist (without the grades to prove it), I have 1 paper published so far, and by april I should have my name in 3 more, one of which I'll be main author. so I have to say that I *am* rather proud of my achievements so far. but I do not feel proud. I know what it takes to feel proud of something, but I do not have the feeling. my parents are confident that I can go really far in my studies and research, but I don't see it. I always believe that someone else out there deserves what I have more than I do, and that many can do my work far better than I can. ok, so after finishing this research project and getting close to my masters I started asking myself where do I want to go after? why would I like to continue in this society?   all the reasons why I hate this society started resurfacing in my head, and now I feel a bit lost. I am not really motivated to study, and I lost a lot of will power due to what happened in the next paragraph.

during this summer I met someone who made me love myself, made me discover what I am capable of doing for love, and what I am generally capable of, made me to always go one step further and surpass my limits. I felt amazing. we were amazing together. however, after she left home (she was in our lab for a 3 months internship, during that time we fell in love, or so I thought) things changed. she realized that the fact that she was away from home (another continent) and that I was so amazing with her (gentleman, romantic, passionate and sensitive), blinded her into thinking that she really would like a life with me. she realized that she just wanted us to be friends. I was devastated. all my great positive feelings were gone. it tremendously affected my work and studies. she broke up with me 1 month before I had to present my research project in front of my professors. the presentation was awful (but I was great during the questions part), and that really made me despise myself, I thought, and still am thinking, that I have become a failure during this summer (period during which I worked on the subject, and had the most amazing time with my ex), not to mention that I don't feel that my project is as valuable as I thought in the beginning, and the fact that my professor was somewhat disappointed by my presentation.
she was feeling very bad for having hurt me so much, though. but that's not too relevant right now. she didn't want to talk to me for a while in order to put her feelings in order. she hurt herself by hurting me.

I had a talk with her yesterday, first time we talked in 3 weeks. she decided she was ready to start talking again. it felt great being able to talk to the person who changed my life so much. and the good part is that right now we're talking at the same level we were when we were together, minus the feelings. she knows me better than my mother. this allowed me to be open with her, told her how badly my presentation went, and told her my inner problems, the lack of feeling that I belong to this society, the lack of will to express myself in front of it, and how much I despise it, etc. she couldn't help me. it was the first time I told her one of my problems, and she couldn't give me any advice. after that I remembered all our times together and started crying, thinking about *us*, my work, the society, the future.. everything was bad in my eyes. I stopped crying as I decided to post here for some support.

I told this to my mother as well, albeit in much less detail. she couldn't help me either, told me to go see a psychologist. I did some research into depression, and from the questionnaires I seem to have something like it, except the fact that I can hide it to some extent.. but it is getting more and more difficult right now, and my professor and friends saw this change.
also, forgot to mention that I am living about 6000km from my family, alone.

I really have to get my will back. I do want to have my own research lab one day, but right now I am not motivated enough because I have no faith in society, I don't find it motivating.

I should also mention I am very sensitive to stress and other stimuli (coffee, chocolate, being upset, mad, smoking etc..), I have a sensitive nervous system, and 2 autoimmune diseases (Hashimoto's thyroiditis and vitiligo). I often want to escape reality either through books, games, watching tv shows and movies, mixing music (I'm a DJ). the only drugs I tried are weed (which makes matters worse actually), MDMA (amazing! my favourite so far), and cocaine (I hate this one). I was planning on trying maybe LSD, and am interested in this new ketamine research into depression. after all these experiences I realized that I don't like drugs (it is only a temporary solution), which is a good thing. I never got addicted to anything else than chocolate, however I smoke from time to time, mostly when I am really stressed.
also, I hate myself for being so sensitive. the effort I have to put in to get a result is more than what someone stronger than me has to do. moreover, I am rather lonely and shy person.

as I am finishing this I already feel better. however I do not know when it'll resurface. it already happened at the office (luckily I was alone and nobody could hear me cry), and in the metro once..  but it usually hits me when I'm alone at home or during my walks. and when I'm in public I usually manage to hide it and keep a positive demeanor, but recently it has gotten difficult.


I don't know what to do to put my mind straight. I feel like my mind and feelings are one big puzzle that I need to solve in order to advance past this point.
as far as I know this feeling could just as well pass by morning.. I don't know what to believe or do right now."

Plan to graduate in May 2013 with a BS in Math, Minor in stats and business. GPA around 3.0 with a math GPA of about 3.3. I have an internship lined up for next semester, and I am an officer for my Uni actuarial science club. I have also passed exam 1/P and am taking exam 2/FM on Saturday (woooooo).

My long term plan is to try and get a job as soon as graduation with hopefully 3 exams under my belt and an internship. Then I would like to work for a year or so while completing my ASA designation. 

This is where I would like some opinions. I would really like to go back to school to get a masters in quantitative finance. I understand that it may not be necessary, but I believe it will open many more doors for me in the investment side of risk management. I'd still try to pass exams during this time. 

What are your thoughts on this game plan? I've always loved dealing with risk, managing risk, messing with the stock market, money exchanges, and all that kind of financial stuff.

I""ll be moving to Albuquerque in December, thanks to my dad's job being moved, and am very heavily leaning towards a CS degree. I'm a senior in high school (yes, my senior year will be split between two schools). 

I did an internship with a local software development company here in Lincoln, Nebraska, primarily in C#, but also included WPF. 

I am still considering the University of Washington in Seattle, we flew up there to visit and were blown away by how good the program is, but for cheaper tuition for me, it'd mean gaining residency in Washington State. It's not impossible, but the school makes it sound impossible. The requirements are to live there a year, and established a bonifide domocile (close all legal ties with other states, and file your tax returns in WA). 

So, in curiosity, what's UNM's Computer Science program like? Hopefully its leaps and bounds above UNL's program here. I know Intel is in Albuquerque, as well as Sandia and Los Alamos.

119w5g,2,2012-10-10,I had an awesome second interview yesterday at one of the biggest media companies in the country.,carolinax,GenYPepTalk,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenYPepTalk/comments/119w5g/i_had_an_awesome_second_interview_yesterday_at/,"It went *way* better than expected. I can't go into too many details, but basically I feel like a $1 million bucks. It's for a junior production coordinator position, so basically junior tv producer. The pay is okay junior pay, better than my last job (unpaid intern lolz) and the director I was interviewing with actually condemned the idea and practice of unpaid production internships. I have a feeling, however, that this company probably doesn't take on too many interns if that's his belief though. And that's fine too.

I'm up against 2 other applicants and one of them has a lot more production coordinating experience than I do, however the personality/connection isn't there (his words, not mine). 

There's a good chance I could get this, but there's an equal chance I might not. I gotta be realistic and not get my hopes too high. 

Anyway, pep-talkiness/what I did right:

* I made it about them: I focused on their team building as their mainstay of quality, allowing them to create great properties *because* of their team, and then expressed great interest in joining that team.

* Asked questions that were related to the job, but also what they need from the person entering that position. Not only do you learn more about what they need from you, but you also have more face time with the interviewer. 

Example: What are your expectations for a [job title] within the first 30 days? What kinds of problems do you need the [job title] to solve immediately?

* Sold my abilities and accomplishments, that although I'm new to the industry and don't have as much experience, I'm a fast study.

* Researched the company like crazy, and because I knew who I was interviewing this time I looked him up until I found his bio online.

Things I didn't do so right:

* I did talk about my mistakes, however I didn't mention that I learned from those mistakes and avoided repeating them. I feel kind of stupid for that, because that conversation happened at the end of the interview - that's the last thing he heard, therefore most probably the freshest thing on his mind. :\

* When nervous/excited I can ramble. I did that at the first question, almost didn't answer the question asked until I realized it and steered the conversation back to where it needed to go. My answers got more clear when I focused on answering the topic at hand, instead of wondering what came next.

* My farewell wasn't strong enough. I shook his hand and kind of fumbled a bit. Should have been a ""thank you so much for the opportunity and I hope to hear from you soon"" or something. First impressions are so important, but so are lasting ones.

I hear about the job in a week. Until then I'm finishing up some vidja gaemz. "

She lives in Florida, I live in the Netherlands (-6hrs). 
We had seen each other on the cams in the chat room, but never talked with each other.

Anyway she pmed me out of the blue. We started talking, I was a bit stiff as I always am but I immediately thought she had something. Something I never experienced before. 

One thing lead to another, we continued on Skype for a more personal talk and this way we could hear each other as well as see. Before we knew it, we where talking for hours on end. Within 2 days I was in love. She was amazing, perfect, the girl I dreamed about (like literally dreamed). The most beautiful smile, the occasional frustration that I find damn sexy in her. 

So we became a couple within just 4 days of talking. Falling a sleep on Skype, texting and sexting (something I had zero experience with. And apparently I can sext. I can write novels like im Dan Brown searching for a new clue). I soon realised this girl, I want her and never let her go. She has that same feeling. We even talk about marriage, kids, living together. It all feels so natural. 

Fast forward one week. I told her that I wanted to look for an internship close to her so that we could be together at least for that period (6 months). And before we knew it, I had a list of companies I wanted to contact. Since my field is very rare and specific she helped me out. She started calling the companies for a direct contact, she drove up to some businesses. Nearly getting tasered upon entering a building (badass chick!). 

She is making this so much easier for me and hopefully we can find something in time before my signup date is due and I need to look other avenues. But she is so supportive and wants to help me and without her i would be clueless and this would take at least another month. And 2 days ago see even managed to get a direct contact from someone, so this way I will skip at least a 100 loopholes and jumps. Thank you so much, sweetie! I really mean that. 

However if it doesnt work out, the internship thing, I will fly to her in February no matter. Right before I start my graduating internship here in the Netherlands. And spent a week with her in sunny Florida. 

After being single for almost 8 years, being a dark and sad place for years, she is the best thing that could happen at this point in my life. After I graduate all my effort will go into moving to the US, be with her and get on one knee! 

And this all in a 1 month period. Love can do amazing things in a short amount of time! (today marks our 1 month)

I moved to this fine city at the end of May with a degree in International Relations and French, several years' experience working in a professional capacity with a university's international office, several years' experience working and travelling abroad as well as a fair amount of nonprofit and grassroots organizing experience.

I currently put in 45-50 hours a week for just over minimum wage at a national retailer and small nonprofit as an intern.  Have interviewed with Sierra Club, international education schools, nonprofits and more - to no avail.  Lately, not even getting calls back.

I was hoping to make this something of an open discussion about what the heck it takes to get a foot in anywhere in this city.  49.7% of all jobs in the last 4 years created here have been in the tech industry, which I have no relevancy in.  Shoot.

A couple friends and I ""run"" a small ""publication"" we call the Water Closet Weekly (the name started because it was originally put up only in the bathrooms of our college resident halls last year.) It's basically an article a week that's more or less of a satire of something that's happened around our campus. It's heavily inspired by the Onion. This year, we've moved to putting them up around town (Old Town Fort Collins, Colorado) and we were thinking the other day of how others do this. We were thinking of getting some ""interns"" to do it for us, but we have nothing to offer them (no part in creative process, no payment, etc.) We are car-less and have little money (I mean, we are college kids). What do you guys suggest we do?"

Interactions with male vs. female advisors,[deleted],LadiesofScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/119n19/can_anyone_else_comment_on_my_experience/,"I'm currently in a master's program, but I've been in many labs as an undergraduate intern (I'm in biology). I'm 22 and female. My PI's have all been men in their 50-60's. I now work under a female PI for the first time. This had made me notice something about myself:

I always have my guard up when working with male PI's. It's an automatic thing. There's usually a weird father figure dynamic that makes me slightly uncomfortable. Now that I'm working for a female PI, I don't have that wall up and I feel more at ease. 

Don't take this the wrong way. All of my mentors have been amazing people that have helped me grow as a scientist. I would just like to know how I can get over this issue. Does anyone else feel the same way?"

Unfortunately there are almost no job offers that directly ask for this kind of qualification. She is also interested in different kinds of jobs,
e.g. archive work, human resources, public relations, marketing, council work etc. Since she's dyslexic (not too bad) she would prefer a job that does not involve a lot of
writing. She also has a little trouble with foreign languages so the job should be in German or English but except that she has no special
requirements. She is smart, reliable and learns new things quickly but so far nobody in the fields mentioned above wants to give a chance since she is not specialized on
this areas :( This situation is quite depressing for her and I would really like to help her somehow (but so far I had no success)...

Do you redditors have some inspiration what she could do? Maybe some of you (or someone you know) have a similar academic history and have a story how you found a job?

PS: She does not want to be self-employed since she has the feeling she needs some ""real"" work experience before... 

Edit: I think my initial question was too general so I want to rephrase it: Can someone give me some advice how she can get the required qualifications for her fields of interest quickly? She also applied for internships but so far, also no success...

1. Is the double major worth it? I like to code but also love the art side of design. 
2. What are some good ways to network? I am a member of AIGA. We have an organization here at college I am a part of.
3. Is there any advice you would give to a beginner designer? Anything that you had to learn the hard way?
4. How do you feel about internships? Are they important? And how do I begin set myself up for one?

We're doing mostly Analytics, but lots' of other good stuff too.  Some of our tools are, ANT, svn, YUICompress and JSDOC.  Also making pretty good use of Eclilpse, Jira and Pivotal tracker.  Experience in any of the above, in addition to being a hotshot JS coder and having the attitude put forth in the book ""The Clean Coder"" and being at least familiar with The Tao of Programming, will get you the job.  PM me your resume if your're interested.

Apologies if this is considered spam, but I did ask first in the Javascript Subreddit IRC and shwetank said it was OK :p  I'm also not a recruiter and whoever is hired will be working with me, so I'm not even really the manager, at least not in any ""official"" sense ;)

Anyway, good company, lots of work and 100% telecommute.

Update By OP:
Thanks for all of the responses.  I set up an e-mail to receive resumes.  If you have them please send them along.  PDF or Open Document format is preferred.

Also to answer a couple of recurring questions.

Type of work: Lots of JS coding, writing doc and testing in JS for Fortune 500 company websites. (So Enterprise experience is a plus, i.e. no coddling, suck it up, big boy/girl pants all that)
Mostly Analytics Focused, but we are also doing some Data Warehouse stuff and have more things on the horizon.  MySQL/Postgress, Apache, Hadoop, those are some things that will be desirable for this position as well. 

Pay is going to depend on experience, and I have not been unhappy there regarding compensation.
Need someone to really hit the ground running, and it's full time, so not really an Intern position, although that might be on the horizon.   We've got more work than we can shake a stick at so who knows, send your resume along and a cover letter.

Speaking of which I have an e-mail to send resumes and cover letters to:  undergroundalt@gmail.com

Send them along (so you don't need to post your e-mails/personal stuff in this thread) to the above e-mail address, and we'll be getting back to everyone as soon as possible.  Thanks for the great response Javascript sub-redditors :).

I am currently a sophomore in college and majoring in Networking with a concentration in Security and I need a little advice on how to start looking for a networking internship for summer of 2013. I know it is still a little early but I like to get a head start on things. I am still new to the networking field and only have a little bit of experience from an internship. I am currently in Illinois and am hoping to land an internship somewhere down south so one of my questions is where are some good places to start looking? I really wanna go to Nashville or Chattanooga TN but location is not my main concern as long as I get out of the Midwest for a bit.

I have been an intern at the same company the past two summers in Desktop Support where I basically fixed computers all day and last summer there wasn't a whole lot of work to do so I went over to the Networking team and worked with them on changing all the IP's throughout the company since we were bought out and had conflicting IP's. I gained a lot of experience including: working in an environment with Cisco routers, switches, Wireless access points, and also gained experience using CLI in Cisco IOS, subnetting, VLAN, and Solarwinds. I feel like I am forgetting a few things. Anyways the point is I do have experience and just need a little advice on where to go from here. Like when I start looking for an internship what kind of ""positions"" should I look for? Also, I am sure getting my CCNA would be good and might help but is it NECESSARY? I hope I am not too confusing and thanks in advance for any advice!"

I think they expected us to find jobs outside of the uni - but seeing as almost everyone has gone to internships they're stuck with an overflow of students with nowhere to put them. 

It's the third week in

*I'm supposed to have completed a number of hours of work

*I'm supposed to have found out who my mentor person is

*I'd very much like to know what I'm doing

I got put on the local newspaper run by a staff member who isn't there half the time, and the journalism students. They all know what they're doing, they all have their roles, they're all grounded in the local community. I'd be fine with this, except: I got put onto this late, I didn't get any idea of what I was doing until the deadlines of when and where were right on top of me, so I couldn't produce anything, I've no idea what was going on, and I commute in so the local scene is alien to me. 

This would be easier to stomach if I'd been able to attend the fucking seminar on Monday - which I didn't know about. Nope. last minute time switch eclipses that idea. So I still have no idea what I'm doing. I'd like to know who my mentor person is, but I haven't been told, despite requesting the info, (which may be due to my request for a switch to this new thing that's coming up where I can actually do something, but I still don't like sitting in fucking limbo while I wait for more information). 

So, it will four weeks in and I will have nothing to say for myself. It will be four weeks in and I may or may not have an idea of what I'm doing. It will be four weeks in and I won't know who I'm supposed to see about sorting shit out.   

Fuck this module. This clusterfuck of a module. So hard. If Lit theory didn't look so utterly boring I'd have transferred."

I originally planned to do law school preceding my undergrad, but the investment does not seem like a sure thing in this job market. 

I have been accepted into a state university for an AACSB accredited Full-Time MBA program in May. My reason for wanting an MBA is so I can get a good mid-level position in a large corporation. I want to take that as far as I can and try to achieve an executive level position in the 10 years proceeding. 

The thing that is gnawing at me is the opportunity cost of the MBA. When I graduate in December I want to start applying for jobs and see if I can get one to stick before May. I will apply for banking jobs, civil service, financial, HR, and even management. I have a fairly impressive resume with judicial internships and leadership experiences so I am pretty comfy with that at least. If I can get one of these jobs that pays well the cost of the MBA is tuition plus lost wages. 

I have a wife and an 8 year old daughter with one on the way and I can't just keep scraping by. I want to build her a college fund, buy a house, pay off our bills, and etc. 

I wake up in the morning happy looking at my family and then I feel sick when I get my realization about my financial obligation. I want to make a decision that is right by them and me. I can't be sick over this anymore. It is literally killing me.     

Should I forgo the MBA if I can get a job making 50k+? 

Is this a reasonable expectation while looking for employment?

What is the most I can expect to make with just my undergrad?"

I'm 20, a business major at a pretty good college. Recently I've started to feel as I'm just not good enough as most of my peers and no amount of hard work can compensate that. I basically do nothing besides studying all the time and yet after most exams I come back disappointed. No matter how good my concepts are, upon seeing the exam I instantly enter panic mode and make silly mistakes. I suck at applying concepts to problems. I have horrible presentation skills. Thing is it doesnt matter how many times I tell myself that it's going to be okay and that I need to calm down. Even if I practically know the questions coming on an exam, I'd still be so anxious during the exam that it becomes certain that I'll make mistakes. The same problem I can solve just fine alone in my room becomes the hardest question ever in an exam hall. You can ignore this once. You can ignore this twice. But not every single time when your GPA is low and scholarship is in peril. I just came back from another one of those quizzes and I'm totally unable to get over how badly I fucked up and move on to the next one. I haven't a good night's sleep in days and yet I can't fall asleep. I just feel as if minor issues (for most people) like constant worrying, emotional instability, poor communication skills, one dimensionalism, constant anxiety, total inability to deal with stress, bad comprehension skills, too much focus on details while ignoring big picture and low self esteem etc. are  ruing my life. I dont know what I'm going to do with my life once I graduate and all. Recently did an internship but soon realized having a job wont change things. If anything it might make them worse. 

I could start taking SSRIs again even though they havent been of any help in the past but even that's not going to solve any of the academic problems I'm facing. 

Edit: Have any of you guys had similar academic problems or is it just me? also how related are these to Autism/Aspergers and anxiety? I mean specifically the issues of not being able to reproduce material despite having went through the reading material several times, missing the big picture/general idea of a theory far too often and failure to apply concepts you have learned to practical situations."

Is there really a lack of ""true"" hacker content worth posting? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jw0ar?context=5)|The problem here is that everyone has a different definition of what a ""hack"" is. Is it the most complex electrical engineering trick you can think of? Is it the most elegant re-use of objects? It is defined differently by people based on their area of interest. What you see are people complaining because a post doesn't interest them specifically. Basically, they are being self centered.
 |We talked a tiny bit about this when [we announced international hack day](http://hackaday.com/2012/08/11/announcing-international-hack-day-august-11th/). We took the opportunity to ask as many of our friends as possible for their definition of a hack.

Sometimes multiple times a day. It is a more difficult question to answer than it would initially seem.
 |It really all depends on what kind of hacking you want to do. Most of the time a basic understanding of electronics helps, but are you wanting to be an electrical engineer? Are you wanting to do more mechanical things like animatronics? Are you wanting to be a code guru? The possibilities are endless. 
[Why do you put \[\] around (user\)names?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jwdae?context=5)|Often people use peculiar usernames.

 |An exmaple: I find [Scary Putin](http://hackaday.com/2012/10/08/scary-putin-guards-your-stash/) more interesting than [Linux friendly ISP programming](http://hackaday.com/2012/10/05/stcdude-is-linux-friendly-isp-programming-software-for-stc-8051-chips/)
 |However, *this site isn't about me*, so everything gets a fair shake. 
[Do you ever hold back on writing up on certain topics for fear of legal consequences?  I've been watching you ease around some of the hardware hacking with ""Hey, here's a link to a blog that does something"".  Finally, how many cease and desist letters do you receive on a weekly basis?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jw2zv?context=5)|We had 1 C&amp;D that I can recall. I've been here since 2008. It was very recent and it was to change the name on the [shocker Drone](http://hackaday.com/2012/08/27/the-taserdrone-a-shocking-mod-for-the-ar-drone/).
 |So far, we haven't held back. Then again, we also haven't really had many super dangerous projects on our plate (maybe thermite?). If someone else publishes information that we think is interesting, we'll share it. 
[Recently there have been a couple of great ""How to"" articles (ARM, OpenOCD\) about getting stuff up and running. Do you guys plan on increasing the number of how-to's or will you stick mostly to news and off-site tutorials?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jx4nt?context=5)|We are currently in the process of increasing our original content.
 |*cool projects (my shockerDrone)
 |*how-to videos (basic stuff and possibly some old school game modding now that we've brought [platinumfungi](http://www.platinumfungi.com) on board!)
 |*reviewish style videos (we don't really want to start asking for stuff to review, so this is kind of iffy).
 |On that note, What would you like to see? **What videos should hackaday make for everyone?**
[MikeS latest debugger was good and Jacks old ones were also good. With respect there has also been some that were just 2 bit of crap duct taped together and were not as good lets say.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jxuno?context=5)|Those 2 bits of crap (the lightsaber right?) had more hits than all the others... combined. 
[C'mon man, don't be like that. Since when has popularity had any correlation to quality. Personally I'd rather see some analogue stuff you mentioned elsewhere.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jzese?context=5)|That's why we bring it all. both are included.
[What is your favorite joke?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jwvoz?context=5)|I've always enjoyed really long anti-jokes. The problem is that the person delivering it has to be a very good story teller. Otherwise you just don't get the build up for the let-down. 
[I have an old ms pacman coctail table that doesnt work. Any suggestions for something cool to do with it that doesnt involve spending a lot of money?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jw6da?context=5)|Multitouch table, mame cabinet, aquarium. 
[What experience do you and the other editors have especially with electronics and coding?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jx8p2?context=5)|I've been tinkering since my first electronics class in 3rd grade. I have had some classes in c++ but am self taught in everything else. I've done php/mysql for a few years casually and 3d animation for a few years professionally. I'm not an expert on anything.
 |Basically, I'm inquisitive and enthusiastic.
 |I'll let the others speak for themselves.
[What's the most ridiculous hack you've ever put together on a whim?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jx4qs?context=5)|The [BugZapper LightSaber](http://hackaday.com/2012/06/18/building-a-bug-zapping-lightsaber/) was easily the most rediculous and actually, one of the most popular. It was done in 20 min as a ""heh, this'll be funny"" kind of thing.
[What types of projects do you personally enjoy working on the most? Mechanical, electrical, microcontroller-based, comp sci?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jx4qs?context=5)|I personally prefer mechanical/electrical stuff that has a wow factor. I want people to enjoy it that don't have to understand it. The guts should be irrelevant. 
[Fix it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jwh5l?context=5)|HA! yeah, that too. 
[I've been a fan of HaD since several years. Will you guys ever consider publishing all your archive as a book later on? The amount of ideas you've covered is very inspiring and useful. Thank you so much!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jwtx2?context=5)|We've talked about it. There's one HUGE problem.
 |Most of the actual content isn't on our site. We bring you a short summary and a link to someone elses stuff. You'd get a page of summaries without projects!
 |However, we might assemble a few volumes of projects if we could get people to agree to it!
[Have you posted stories that were obvious jokes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jwcus?context=5)|Yeah, we have several ways that this has happened. 
 |Our [april fools jokes](http://hackaday.com/2011/04/01/i-can-has-hackz/)
 |Our [""troll edition"" posts](http://hackaday.com/2011/12/19/ask-hackaday-troll-physics-edition/). 
[You're an editor and you started a sentence with ""Myself?""  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jz4p9?context=5)|It happens.
[I would like to say that I visit Hackaday almost every day at work while I eat my lunch. I work in an engineering firm and it's full of nerds who are always building cool things. I have been gathering ideas for my diabolical invention, but I have no master plan. **what do you think I should build to leave on my desk and impress everyone who walks by it?**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jy5i7?context=5)|Stop thinking like an engineer and think like a child. As someone walks by, they'll be drawn by shiny things and lights.
[I'm planning a project to put a full desktop computer into a briefcase like case, it won't be battery powered. Its going to be like a giant 22"" laptop with the full processing power of a desktop and a graphics card, i have the hardware except for the case. The plan is to use furniture grade plywood, other than cable management and heat dissipation are there any other things i should be mindful of when designing the case?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jwbj4?context=5)|Sounds like you've got it covered. I guess ergonomics would be fairly important too. 
[I plan on maximum height being just enough to clear the heatsink, and the lid side just thick enough for the monitor.  Thanks for the reply, and when its done I''l log it on instructables and send it your way.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jwv3z?context=5)|Regular keyboard? if so, I guess it could be removable for better ergonomics. 
[What are your personal favorite top 3 ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jwaic?context=5)|I just can't answer this. I'm sorry. I know it is cheezy but I'd have to go back and read ALL of them again to make sure.
 |Plus, it depends on what I'm interested in at the time. Right now it would be all fire and rust. A few years ago it would have been interesting PCB construction. 
[Have you been to many hackerspaces? What do you think of them?  What do you think of the labels ""hacker,"" ""maker,"" etc. HaD has always seemed so much more elite than Make and the surrounding communities. What do you think of their recent explosion in popularity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jzj08?context=5)|I've been to several (maybe 15). I don't think the label hacker really means anything since ""hacking"" can mean so many things. Maker is somewhat more appropriate but it makes me think of the damn magazine. I tend to just call people by their name.
[Why do you continue to post projects involving compressed air tanks made out of Schedule 40 PVC when the manufacturers and common sense dictates this is a horribly dangerous idea?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jz7v1?context=5)|Because we're not going to ignore cool projects. Hopefully those people will see the criticism and learn from it. 
[The hackerspace visit videos are a great element of the site.  Do you see any patterns to how they are spread accross the country?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jwj21?context=5)|Sure. More population dense areas have more hackerspaces. Its simple math. However, the projects coming OUT of the hackerspaces are spread very differently. It is, at my best guess, random as to whether a hackerspace will produce something awesome. 
[What do you think of the Arduino Due?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jyaag?context=5)|I'm a big fan of options. Sometimes it can be crippling, but I'd rather have too many than too few (assuming they all actually work).
 |I haven't messed with teh Due personally and would rather have my writers who are more well versed in microcontrollers weigh in on it.
 |However, the arduino platform has become a giant in terms of tutorials and documentation so I have no doubt that this board will open many doors for people. 
[What's the best/coolest free gear you've gotten simply for being involved with hackaday? What companies could be taking advantage of getting you advance hardware that aren't?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jxr7n?context=5)|Free stuff makes me feel really uncomfortable. I avoid it if possible. 
[What did it feel like to be tazed? What is it with you and those VW vans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jyio9?context=5)|Ever bridged a power plug when plugging something in? Like that but over more area.
[Are there any types of projects you will not display, and are there any projects you hope to see in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jyi9v?context=5)|I don't like anything that involves innocent people being hurt, even if it is minor. An example is Jackass. I like watching them hurt themselves, but there were some videos of Bam hurting un-suspecting strangers. Don't like that at all. 
[Yeah that's a good policy! Also, If it has not been answered, what has been your favorite project so far?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jzt8y?context=5)|Can't answer that one. waaay too many. 
[Do you have an android app in your plans for the future?  I love the site by the way.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6k2l3t?context=5)|Not the immediate future. The best you could hope for would be a REAL mobile site. 
[I'm a fairly frequent reader of Hack-a-day, personally, I love the site, though I do have a tick about the all inclusive bit..  I once had a friend that wrote an article or two for HAD, I went looking for his article(s\) recently out of curiosity because, well, I couldn't remember what they were about, and I couldn't find them.  So I guess what I'm asking is, have you ever removed someone's articles who doesn't do work for HAD anymore? Maybe they were removed under his request?  Maybe I should just ask him. lol.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jzo55?context=5)|Not that I'm aware of! 
[They were pretty shitty articles if I remember correctly.  Infant Hackaday maybe? Who knows.

If he wrote it, it should be there. I've not removed an old writers posts and I don't think any of the previous editors have. 
[Would it be possible to put links to similar sites on your page.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jzgw9?context=5)|Yes, this is my full time job. I visit everywhere.

[Have the comments become more trollish or less over time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jz6nj?context=5)|[both](http://hackaday.com/2011/07/27/hackaday-comment-policy-were-cleaning-up/)
[I am pretty sure MikeS only exists on the internet, the hands are just some hacker who plugged his hackey aggressive security system to the internet and Mike is holding the  poor dude hostage with it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6k35ps?context=5)|Haha. MikeS is actually a professional musician. you can follow along on his personal blog at jumptuck.com, though it is pretty much the same stuff he puts on hackaday.
[What is the average age of your writing and editorial staff?  Oh and like everyone else said, thanks for existing, been reading since ~2006, you didn't quite make me an awesome inventor but at least I own a soldering iron and fix my own stuff.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jzj8d?context=5)|Not sure. maybe early 20s to mid 40s?

[Do you have a favorite ""Hacker Space"" that you have vised or one that you frequent ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jxlqu?context=5)|I tend to like the grungier ones more. Freeside atlanta, makers local 256 in huntsville etc. If you need to shower after you worked there, it is my kind of place.
[How often do you look for new writers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jxaka?context=5)|Occasionally.

We just write and occasionally document our projects. 
[If you get time can you do a monthly/weekly ghetto hacks showing true kludge's / hacks? I love to see crappily kludged potentially dangerous junk people cobble together.

[Did you invent Kraft Dinner?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jyqhy?context=5)|I wish.
[Why don't you proofread your posts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jyzpj?context=5)|Usually it is time vs payoff. We should do better. 
[Who is fartface?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6k14em?context=5)|No idea.
[You're a Senior Editor but don't know the proper use of ""myself.""  Here's what your sentence should say: ""I, and possibly some writers, am here to answer your questions.""  Do you have any job openings for editors who know proper grammar?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6jzvvb?context=5)|Haha. yeah, this is a common problem. It is something we're working on. 
[May I just say I applaud this very rare AMA where tons of questions are actually responded to. It's very very rare and most of the time 95% of the questions are left trailing. So kudos HaD guys, you stand out in excellence.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1174qy/im_caleb_kraft_senior_editor_at_hackadaycom/c6kynrp?context=5)|Thanks.

[So, when I go back to my plastic surgeon for follow-ups and he just looks at them and jiggles them a bit (now I'm being totally serious here\) is he looking for anything in particular or just kind playing with my boobs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jxsgu?context=5)|He's actually checking to see how you're healing and how the breasts are softening. They soften about 1 percent a day, so at 3 months they are about 80 percent soft. But if the man jiggling your breasts then says to you, ""Hold on a moment; I'll go get the doctor,"" I'd be concerned!
[What do you appreciate most about a pair of breasts?  Are you looking at size, shape, symmetry, nipples, areola, or some combination?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jy382?context=5)|Personally, I appreciate shape and symmetry.
[Also, when a woman walks into your office are you able to instantly determine what her breasts actually look like or are you still surprised when they actually expose them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jy382?context=5)|I'm often surprised, because bras can lift and enhance breasts very nicely. 
[So if a woman hears ""that's an incredible bra"" from you they should take it as a back-handed compliment? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k28j8?context=5)|Cute.
[Do you have fun at work (jokes/banter/etc\) or is it all serious business?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jxyk4?context=5)|It's serious business, but I do have fun at work. I work with the same team each day. We know each other well. We listen to my music. A few years back, my daughter made a CD for me for Father's Day. It had some unedited rap songs on it. I didn't know what was being rapped. The circulating nurse was horrified and told me never to bring it back to the operating room again. Now my music is edited.
[What was your reaction when you first got the job as a young naive doctor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jxyk4?context=5)|My first major surgery on my own in practice felt a little bit like the first time I jumped off a high dive into a pool. It's a little scary to approach it, but once you're in safely, you look back up and think, ""Look what I've accomplished. I'm glad I did.""
[Do you remember any particular song or lyric that got the nurse's attention?  How old was your daughter?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k46ko?context=5)|I think it was a song by Ludicrous that went ""I wanna, lick lick lick lick you from your head to your toes, whoa from the bed right down to the floor... I believe she was in middle school at the time. 
[Are you able to determine the region of a person by their boobs? If you were put in front of 100 pair of JUST breasts, would you be able to tell if somebody is Irish, Swedish, Mexican, etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jynmn?context=5)|Great question. In general no. But at one point, when I had two Cambodian patients in a row, I noticed that neither had cleavage. In both women, their breasts connected in the middle. It's a small sampling to make a gross generalization that Cambodians have no cleavage.
[What? How does that even. . . What? You mean they were just too flat? Or was it just like some weird monoboob with two nipples on the edges?  I'm having a really hard time picturing this.  You could be a great submitter to /r/WTF ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k0uxk?context=5)|It was two breasts with nipples with next to no space between the two, a little like your description of a monoboob.
[Are you married? If so does your wife mind your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jxnsf?context=5)|Yes, for 39 years. My wife appreciates the difference I make for a lot of women, and she knows that at the end of the home, hers are the breasts I come home to.
[Does your wife have natural breasts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k9a7d?context=5)|Yes, she's happy with the size of her breasts. She gave me permission to answer this question.
[How many of the 20,000 pairs were attached to a male?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jxreg?context=5)|Just a few. Early in my career, I did surgery to correct large male breasts, or gynecomastia. 
[So are you a boob guy or an ass guy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jxpk8?context=5)|In general, I would say a boob guy, but a nice ass turns my head.
[When someone comes in with already mildly large breasts (C/D cup\), do you usually advise against them from getting an enlargement? Same goes with reduction? Or do you just do what the customer wants?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jyki0?context=5)|I would talk to them, and say, ""It seems like you already have a fair amount of breast size. Tell me more what you're thinking."" If possible, I try and do what the customer wants, but part of my job is to assess their physical and emotional health before proceeding with any type of surgery.
[Its interesting that you, the doctor, refer to these people as ""customers"" and not as ""patients.""  or maybe you're just re-using the same words as mac77.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k36s9?context=5)|You're right. I was just reusing customer like mac77 did. I always refer to the women who come into my office as patients. 
[*assess their physical and emotional health.*  What about mental health? Also, shouldn't a psychiatrist/psychologist do this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k0eey?context=5)|By emotional health I meant mental health. When a patient mentions that she is in therapy, I do involve the psychiatrist or psychologist in the process. I request a letter from her therapist to find out if he or she is supportive of this woman having the surgery, and at this time.
[How does a plastic surgeon get into knife throwing? And does it ever tie into surgery?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jy3wi?context=5)|I didn't start in the OR. Always loved Crocodile Dundee, James Bond movies. Was fascinating how they could accurately throw a knife across the room into a target. Found out that the 10-time world champion tomahawk thrower lived in my neighborhood. He invited me over. I love it.
 |It does tie into surgery. The focus and concentration are important in both. 
[Who makes a good throwing knife? I've always been afraid United Cutlery used weak steel that'd break or go dull quickly. What should I look for in a good thrower? Ever visit /r/knives ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k0wf4?context=5)|Not the knife in your kitchen. You could get started with www.throwzini.com. There's good info there. There are a lot of guys who make custom knives and they are not too expensive. 
[Who's the youngest woman you've ever given a boob job to? And what's the youngest age you'd be willing to perform on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jz7ka?context=5)|18 is the youngest woman I've ever given implants, too. And that's the youngest I'd go. This represents less than 5 percent of my patients.
[My mother has been denied authorization from our insurance company for a breast reduction. She is a j or k size cup and obviously is someone that needs this procedure for her overall well being. She has constant neck and back pain, but they still will not say yes. Do you encounter this situation a lot? Do you have any suggestions for getting our insurance company to pay up? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jz9bv?context=5)|Sounds like she's a good candidate for breast reduction surgery. Most insurance companies will allow you to appeal a second time after denial. Having letters to support her need from her gynecologist, family doctor or other physicians will help her case.
[Looking at breasts all day... awesome, or not awesome? I'd imagine it kinda like being a gynecologist. For every great set of boobs you see, there have to be 20 that are simply horrifying. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jxmw7?context=5)|Probably the most upsetting breasts would be in women who have a congenital abnormality, or chest deformity, where the rib cage might be extended or depressed on one side, pushing the breast in or out. 
[ they could just be really fat or something.  Edit: Sorry, didn't realize you were OP. I was actually asking your constantly being surrounded by breats impacted how you look at them in a sexual situation. Does it enhance or diminish your enjoyment of boobs outside of a work setting.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k06m8?context=5)|I still enjoy boobs outside of work.
[What's the biggest size of breasts has a woman ever asked for?  Have you ever turned someone down because the size they wanted was too big?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jyf9d?context=5)|DD/DDD. If a woman wants bigger implants than will fit in her frame, she might require a second operation after her tissues have stretched a bit in order to go bigger. 
[What is your favourite joke?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jz3o4?context=5)|A lady had a bad rash. She went to see the doctor, who told her a remedy would be to go to her local dairy farmer and get enough milk to fill a bathtub and then take a bath in it.
 |""Should it be pasteurized?"" she asked. The doctor reply. ""No. Just up to your titties.""
[Wow, I actually laughed...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k21ca?context=5)|Thanks. I have more, but they are visual jokes, so they don't work well here. 
[Was your choice of specialty always clear that you wanted to be a plastic surgeon? Was it shun down by any of the people you studied/worked with on your way to becoming one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jzeva?context=5)|I was a good student. I went to Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. Both of my older brothers went there and I knew it was a good school. During my internship, I realized my best aptitude was in surgery and that my hands worked. I was inspired by a nose job lecture with before and after pictures and amazed at the immediate difference surgery can make for someone in their appearance. I decided to be a plastic surgeon. It looked like a long road ahead to get there, and I considered being an emergency room physician, but my wife supported the decision in following my passion and I went for it. Time went quickly and I'm glad I did.
[Has this profession altered your view of female aesthetics? Do you honestly believe that breasts are the core of a females attractiveness?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jzeva?context=5)|I actually think a really nice smile is the core of female attractiveness.
[What's your go to joke while holding a pair of breasts to make it less akward?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jz4dj?context=5)|No joke. I just acknowledge that for some women it's an awkward moment. I might say, ""I'm sure getting your breasts measured and photographed doesn't happen to you every day.""
[Ever get a porn star in there who counters that with, ""Well, actually...""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k2f2h?context=5)|Yes, I have.
[Have you ever had sex or any sort of affection towards your client/patient?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jyfiq?context=5)|Sex, no. Affection, yes. When they are discharged everybody gets a hug. And sometimes, I hold a patient's hand while she gets anesthesia and goes off to sleep. I don't do what the doctors on Nip/Tuck do, who have sex with their patients when they make a mistake, and they make a lot of mistakes. 
[Do you ever get aroused when examining breasts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jy033?context=5)|Actually, no. I'm evaluating part of the anatomy in a professional manner. A breast is just a breast -- like a hand or a leg -- until you some meaning to it.
[Do you ever advise women not to have breast augmentations? How many of your clients would you say probably didn't ""need"" an augmentation (based on body type, symmetry, etc\), but went ahead with it anyways?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jyoia?context=5)|Yes, about 20 percent of the time. Lots of women have curiosity about augmentation. They come in for information and might decide it's not right for them. If someone asks me, ""You're the expert, what should I do?"" I say, ""You should go home."" The point is that they should be there because implants are what they want, not what I think they need.
[Do you have any proof? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jxn67?context=5)|Proof has been provided to the moderators, but you can also verify by going to my website www.lookingnatural.com.
[I call bullshit... I saw some 20,000 number up there, and 5,000 at your website... thats 10,000 by my count.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6kayyq?context=5)|Thanks for giving me the chance to clarify this. I have performed over 5,000 breast augmentations, which is over 5,000 pair. Now consider this: I examine breasts before surgery. After surgery, each woman has at least 3-4 post-op visits, where her breasts are examined as she heals. So, I multiplied 5,000 cases x 4 examinations = 20,000 pair of breasts examined.
[Do you ever get feeling that your work merely furthers the shallow nature of American society?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jyoeh?context=5)|Cosmetic breast surgery is not for everybody, but I've found that for those women who choose to have it, sometimes it can make a profound difference in their lives, both emotionally and physically.
[In a pair of breasts, what is the biggest difference in size you have seen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jyc1d?context=5)|One patient had a droopy D cup on one side and was completely flat on the other. She had a congenital defect called Poland syndrome. I enlarged the flat side with an implant and raised and reduced the droopy D cup.
[Have you ever thrown a knife at a pair of breasts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jz948?context=5)|I have not, but I know people who perform ""impalement arts"" -- though the goal is not to impale. One guy dresses up as Spiderman, hangs upside down, and throws knives around his wife. Sometimes she's on a wheel. Recently she starting shooting a crossbow from 17 feet at an apple on his head. Sounds fair to me. [Link to www.onesharpmarriage.com](http://www.onesharpmarriage.com)
[Saline or silicone?  And why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jzgki?context=5)|In my practice, most patients request saline over silicone. Silicone are especially useful if patients have very thin skin and are concerned about feeling the implant on the side or underneath the breasts.
[Assuming I'm not in medicine and have no contacts and know no one who's been augmented, how does one find a good surgeon?  And what kind of questions should I be asking to maximize the likelihood of a good experience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jzgki?context=5)|If you know no one, probably the best place to start is with your family doctor or gynecologist, because they work with doctors in your area and know their reputation and their results. Secondly, you could call a hospital in your area; most likely the surgeons at a hospital would be certified and qualified. Medical societies and online chat rooms have lots of information, including lists of questions to ask at your consultation.
[What's the recovery time for returning completely to normal activities, assuming no complications?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jzgki?context=5)|Recovery: My patients generally return to an office setting 5 days after surgery, to aerobics, running and swimming at about 3 weeks; and to upper body activities closer to 6 weeks after surgery. If their job involves lifting (like nurses, waitresses and hair stylists) most return to work towards the end of the second week.
[How much, ballpark?  Good surgeon.  A cup to C. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jzgki?context=5)|Ballpark price: It's about $6,000 in the Philadelphia area, where I live; silicone cost about $1,000 more. 
[Is it 6k per breast or is that for the pair?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k4ib9?context=5)|It's 6k total - for the pair.
[What do you do to guard against having the complication of capsule contractions?  This can horribly deform a breast and the rate of occurrence increases with revision surgeries.  Any woman considering this surgery should be very concerned.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jyorp?context=5)|During the first three months after surgery, I have a patient massage the implant through the space that I've made behind her muscle to the capsule as open as possible. 
[Explain how to become a professional knife thrower. Where did you learn, how and why?  Can you show us before and after pictures of your work?(Nevermind, this should do.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jynj2?context=5)|After a day of instruction from a local tomahawk champion, he suggested that I compete and connected me to two organizations - IKTHOF and the AKTA - that sponsor events around the country. When you get a knife in the bulls-eye, and you hear the thunk, ""it's like the whole universe comes together in that moment just for you"" (quote from my mentor, Joe Darrah).
[Do you only do breast implants or all kinds of surgeries. Such as breast reduction and mastectomy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jynj2?context=5)|For the first 14 years in practice, I did general plastic surgery from head to toe, including breast reconstruction and reduction. The last 12 year's I've focused my practice on cosmetic breast surgery - augmention and lifts.
[If you are married, or ever plan on being married, have you/would you operate on your wife? It's my understanding that a lot of cosmetic surgeons won't operate on their wife.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jyirc?context=5)|I am married. If my wife wished to have surgery, I absolutely would want to be the one to operate on her. Early on my career, when I performed facelifts, I operated on my mother. I don't think anyone would do as good a job or take as much care as I would. I know it sounds egotistical, but that's how I feel.
[How has seeing so many pairs of breasts breasts changed your perception of them? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jynge?context=5)|When I was in middle school, all I wanted to do was get to see a pair of breasts. Now I see them all the time. I guess the Breast Fairy heard my wish.
[Do you have many clients that come back to change their breast size again?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jyazk?context=5)|About 1 percent of my patients come back to go bigger. Usually it's because they lost some volume from either pregnancy or weight change. Recently, a woman after 13 years of having implants chose to have them removed. She said she enjoyed while she had and she felt complete.
[Have you ever thought about using Eisenboob as your nickname? Or Breastenberg.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jyztw?context=5)|Great nicknames. I especially like Breastenberg. My knife buddies actually gave me a nickname -- The Boobinator.
[How vast is the difference between my local surgeons and those like yourself (from an end-result pov\)? Is it really worth seeking somebody specific out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k06lt?context=5)|When my family asks, "" Who should I go to?"" I tell them, ""The person who has the most experience with it."" I think that'll provide the best results.
[What's more common for women, deciding they went 'too big' or 'not big enough'?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k06lt?context=5)|Women more commonly say ""not big enough."" One reason is they were afraid everybody would notice, so they held back. They didn't realize that most people are not that observant. Another reason is because after consultation, friends or online forums suggested they were going ""too big"" and they listened. They weren't necessarily comparing similar body frames, or apples to apples.
[My wife has a small lump on the bottom of one of her breasts that we've been told is not a concern, does augmentation provide an opportunity to look into what it really is? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k06lt?context=5)|No. 
[How many cup sizes (A to C, etc\) can you grant before quality is compromised? At what point does enlargement become obvious?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k06lt?context=5)|It depends on a woman's frame size, but it's not uncommon to go up two cup sizes.
[How many women have you turned down for breast augmentation ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jyp7j?context=5)|About 1400 women, close to 20 percent of my consultations.
[Ever consider combining your love of breast augmentation with your love of knife throwing to create a non-traditional, innovative, and intense new form of spectator plastic surgery?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jyyvk?context=5)|I haven't. Sounds like an interesting idea. But if I try, I should probably not use a blindfold.
[What percent of clients are there for a breast reduction or other non-implant surgery?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jz677?context=5)|About 2 percent.
[Do you remember breast #7080?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k77to?context=5)|I can clearly remember 7079 and 7081, but 7080 is elusive.
[(. \)( .\)   perhaps?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k7gdc?context=5)|That's her! Thanks for jogging my memory.
[I was thrilled to see your name in the AMA schedule because, for the past several weeks, you've been somewhat of a celebrity on my dormitory's floor. We have a Ted Eisenberg here. One of us googled his name a while back and, well, there you were. Needless to say, we have been calling him ""The Boobinator"" since then. We have your Wikipedia article posted on our communal whiteboard and are all fans of yours.  **Why breasts?** What about them drove you to become a record holder in breast augmentation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k0rqj?context=5)|Fun to know I'm a celebrity in your dorm. Say hello to Ted Eisenberg for me. I know one who's a lawyer at Cornell, but not your Ted. I transitioned my practice in 1999 to focus entirely on cosmetic breast surgery. While at a knife throwing tournament in Greenville, Ohio, my wife and I saw guy who was trying to break the Guinness World Record in most whip cracks a minute. It made me wonder if I had a Guinness Record in most breast augmentations. Turns out I did.
[Can you tell me **something about breasts I don't already know?**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k0rqj?context=5)|Did you know that breasts are sisters, not twins? Almost no one has symmetrical breasts.
[In what ways would you say your patients lives have been improved by your efforts? Have you ever refused surgery due to concerns of enabling a psychiatric issue?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k11oe?context=5)|Patients tell me that they often feel more confident, better in their clothes, more feminine and less self-conscious when they are undressed.
 |I have often refused surgery because of mental health concerns, including Body Dysmorphic Disorder, eating disorders, or psychotic disorders.
[If someone broke into my house how plausible is it to open my knife draw and start throwing knives at them?  What's the best way to throw the knife? (Sorry for two questions in one.  You're a badass mofo though!\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k0c3k?context=5)|Probably not the best method of protection. Half-spin military throw would be the ideal; the knife is often held by the blade. It can be thrown accurately from any distance. My mentor can throw anything from a screwdriver, butter knife, scissors to even a golf tee into a target.
[I knew I recognized your name... They advertise you on Q102 and some of the other local radio stations in the Philadelphia area. Funny! Anyway, if you were no longer allowed to do breast augmentations, what other part of the body would you be willing to do plastic surgery on? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k5h3f?context=5)|Good question. I'd do eyelid surgery. There are two of them, they are roundish, and they can get droopy. And if I fix eyelids that have drooped and obstruct vision, the patients be better able to see breasts.
 |I've heard comments that both the eyes and the breasts are the doorways to the soul. A Romanian plastic surgeon was the one describing breasts like that. 
[I work for a company who is endorsed by the ASAPS. What do you think of that organization? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6jyrsy?context=5)|It's a great organization. It provides good education opportunities for plastic surgeons and they are a good watchdog for the safety of patients.
[My girlfriend is fairly self conscious about her breasts, she is 5'11"" and wears a 38 AA or 38 A bra depending on brand. She seems to think breast augmentation wouldn't be able to raise her up to ""just a B"" cup to make buying clothing easier. Is that true? Is increasing a small size harder?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k56dl?context=5)|Increasing to ""just a B"" is not any harder to accomplish than placing a bigger-sized implant. 
[How long do they last? Ie. a modern pair of saline implants, good for life? How will l they sag differently compared to real breasts over time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k315m?context=5)|No one knows for sure. They don't have to be changed every 10 years, as many people think. I had a woman last month who after 15 years wanted to go bigger. When I removed her implants, they looked exactly like they did the day I put them in.
 |About sagging: When your breasts sag, the implants will go south with them. They won't stay up high.
[Are fake breasts always obvious on very thin women? I know they would be on very thin, very flat chested women, but what about someone with, say, a small b cup? Is there a small size that you can go and it still look natural? What is the smallest set of implants you have ever given a patient? I feel like I can always tell when they are fake on think girls. Am I correct or am I just ""seeing"" the bad ones?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6kb8x1?context=5)|No, especially if the implants are placed partly behind the chest muscle. Then the rim at the top of the implant is usually hidden, so the upper breast fullness that can be seen has a natural look.
 |On the average, women who want a small change are usually asking for about a cup more than what they currently have. The smallest implant made is about 125 ccs; on a small-framed woman, this would be equal to about 2/3 of a cup size. 
[Why didn't you pursue an M.D?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k2j0m?context=5)|I admired my two older brothers, both of whom got D.O. degrees and became family doctors. I had the fantasy of a family family practice. I didn't consider any other option than osteopathic medical school. I suspect that if they had gone to an M.D. school, I would have done the same.
[We did the exam together, he drew on her with a sharpie of one color and me of another.  He agreed on the minor changes and the overall plan to re-do them to combat the ravages of age when they were cumulative enough.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k5m1v?context=5)|I do also throw hatchets and in a way they are my sharpies!
[Do you have a knife within three feet of you at this very moment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k6ze7?context=5)|Yes, I do. Do you have a hidden camera peeking into my home office? On the shelf I have 5 knives and 1 tomahawk. The 5 knives are all trophies won in tournaments. Most are engraved with tournament stats. The tomahawk was a gift from my office staff. I even have one knife standing up in pencil holder. I use it to open letters. Thanks for asking.
[Why would you think that your average size of implants has increased?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k9cgq?context=5)|I think it's because everyone wants to look proportional. It's a fact that our waistlines have grown, and to have proportional breasts, you'd need a   bigger implant.
[Also, do you think reductions are harder to perform? I had a reduction in May, and I'm incredibly impressed with how skilled my surgeon was to reshape everything to look right.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k9cgq?context=5)|Yes, because there is more sculpting involved, which certainly would require another skill level. 
[Have ever had a patient die on the operating table during plastic surgery? If not, do you have any colleagues who have?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k0732?context=5)|No, I haven't had a patient die on the table. I do know colleagues who have. Fortunately, this is a rare occurrence.
[What percentage of your clients have gone into porn?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k3w4g?context=5)|Less than 1 percent. Interestingly, I've had nurses who after augmentation have gotten jobs as exotic dancers. On the other hand, I've been told by exotic dancers and porn stars that after augmentations, they became nurses. Go figure.
 |From time to time, patients send me autographed pictures of themselves skimpily dressed and posing - either for a magazine or just because. 
[I've recently been trying to get approved for a breast reduction. I went to two separate doctors and a plastic surgeon and was approved by all but now I'm waiting for the insurance company. I was supposed to hear back by now and haven't heard anything. Is this common or should I be concerned that I was denied by my insurance?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k0odt?context=5)|My experience, on average, it takes about a month for the insurance company to complete a review. If it's much longer than that, you can call your doctor or the insurance company to find out.
[Do you refrain from saying 'boobs' and only say 'breasts'?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k9073?context=5)|I do say ""breasts."" I hear my patients use a lot of different expressions like the girls, the twins, tits, ta-tas, knockers, mommybops, chesticles, and breasticles. Some women also name their breasts, like Siegfried and Roy, License and Registration, Naughty and Nice, and Ben and Jerry, among others.
[Can you perform surgery at 60 paces using nothing but throwing knives?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k6r8v?context=5)|I have thrown knives as far as 51 feet and can get them to stick. But never in the operating room. It's too small to try that.
[So... it that a maybe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k744v?context=5)|It's a no. My medical liability insurance does not cover this.
[Hi!  I am a fellow knife thrower, what kind of targets do you like to practice on?  I went from dart boards to plywood, to red wood planks(lined up and nailed together, sort of like a barn door\).  I have tried a few kinds of really dense housing insulation styrofoam.  I hear cotton wood round log ends work really well(self heal when you spray a hose on them, but have not found any yet\)  What is your favorite type of target?  Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k4h04?context=5)|I started with an old door in the garage. As I moved outside, I needed better targets. In the Philadelphia area there's an abundance of pine wood. I called a local tree surgeon, who cut up a fallen pine tree and delivered log rounds to me. Cotton wood and willow, also softer woods, work well as targets. For more details, check out www.throwzini.com.
[Odd question, but relevant with October.. Have you ever discovered a lump in any of your patients and possibly saved them? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k2v1c?context=5)|When doing a breast reduction, the removed breast tissue is routinely sent for pathological evaluation. One time, the pathologist reported finding breast cancer in the tissue. This early discovery saved her life.
 |Women age 40 and older and those whose mother or sister have a history of breast cancer are sent for mammograms before surgery is scheduled. On occasion, there are suspicious findings, and the patient gets further evaluation.
[What was the age of your oldest patient? What would you say is the average age?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k4m5k?context=5)|My oldest patient was 63. I recently read about a great grandmother who had breast lift and augmentation at age 83. My patients are clustered in two age groups -- early 20s (women that never developed) and early 30s (women whose breasts ""disappeared"" after pregnancy).
[About how long after breast feeding should you wait to get augmented? Is it best to do it sooner (for loose skin\) or later?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/117boz/iama_guinness_world_record_holding_breast_surgeon/c6k8jwp?context=5)|You should wait a minimum of six months after you stop breastfeeding to allow the milk to disappear and the breast tissues to normalize. Timing, sooner or later, doesn't matter.

118svj,2,2012-10-10,I [M22] am stuck between a serious rock and hard place by my GF[19],JTFocus,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/118svj/i_m22_am_stuck_between_a_serious_rock_and_hard/,"Note: This is my first topic post on Reddit, and seeing as I'm fairly new, I apologize in advance for any formatting errors. I'm a n00b.

Let me just put this out there, I've wanted to talk to someone about this for a long time and it's a long story, and I can't seem to find the right person to talk to. The internet is always good, so here it goes.

My current girlfriend and I have dated for the last 14 months. I love her more than I have ever loved another woman, but don't know what to do anymore. I started talking to her while I was in Florida on a Disney Internship last May, and we hit it off quite well. We were friends in high school and I was good friends with her brother, so she and I talked every once in a while but nothing serious. I came home from my internship that August and we spent lots of time together, as I was moving in with her brother and our mutual best friend. We started dating a week later and spent nearly every day together after I was off work and she was out of school. 

After she graduated, we continued to spend every day together, outside of me working, as if we were living together, except we weren't. Our relationship had grown rocky; we would argue about stupid things, she would get angry with me for no reason, and it had an overall different feel than it did in the beginning, but I was still in love with her and wanted things to work. In June, I was offered a job with Disney World, with fairly good pay, and the girlfriend was all for leaving and moving down there together. I didn't have proper living arrangements, and had been saving money for a car, which I didn't have at the time, and passed on the offer because I didn't have sufficient funds and things needed to be able to make it happen. Fast forward to August, girlfriend signs to play softball with a local college in our city in GA, and I'm offered the Disney job again, and this time have family who live in Florida willing to help me out. She's extremely unhappy with my decision to even interview and consider it, but it was an opportunity for her to do a year of school while I work to provide for a hopeful/hypothetical future for us. I'm sure you know where this is going.

I get the job, and started in early September. Since then, our relationship has been long distance, and not nearly the same. She's always miserable, seems to not make an effort to try to be happy, and cites the reason as, ""I'm the only thing that made her happy and now that I've left, she has nothing to make her happy"", even though we're still a couple. We argue constantly, and I just want to make it work, but she doesn't try and makes me feel as if my efforts are useless. I went home to GA last week for 3 days to specifically see her and spend time with her. Things went great, it was like I never left, our sex was great, we didn't argue, and it was an overall wonderful 3 days. Since I've returned to Florida and work, it's been back to the same arguing and her not knowing what to do. Today she told me that she didn't feel the same about me as she did before I left for Florida. It was literally like she just pulled my heart straight out of my chest, like some Mortal Kombat fatality. All I've wanted is for this relationship to work, because I have some sort of blind faith that we can do it. And for her to say that has just diminished any sort of hope I have, as if she's already given up on me. 

So, Reddit, what do I do? Do I cut my losses and try to move on with my life, continuing to work here at Disney and just accept it? Or do I continue the battle, when it seemingly ends up being the same thing over and over? I love this girl more than I know how to express, but I just wasn't happy at home, and she was the only thing keeping me there. I don't want to end things, because I feel as if I'd be giving up, but I honestly don't know what to do anymore. 

**TL;DR**: Dated girlfriend for a year, took a great job in Disney World in September while she committed to school for softball back home in GA. Relationship has been on a total downward spiral, tells me she doesn't feel the same as she did before I left, feel heartbroken, need help deciding what's best for me in the long run.

A large and sincere thank you to any of you guys who read this and can help."
118sok,2,2012-10-10,Should I become a photojournalist?,napmeijer,photography,https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/118sok/should_i_become_a_photojournalist/,"Alright, little background; I'm living in the Netherlands and I applied for a master's degree (outside the field of photography) in Germany, but just now I got an e-mail that my application has not been accepted. Too bad, time for something new I guess. 

I like photography - but not the fashion stuff. I like documenting real stuff. During my bachelor's I moved to Malaysia for 6 months for an internship where I bought my first DSLR (a Nikon D3000) and the next year to London (bought a Nikon D7000 before I went) for an internship too. In between I traveled quite a bit.

When I was in London last year, I photographed the first day of the Occupy London protests - the heavy police presence made it a very intense experience. And 2 weeks ago I photographed some riots in my hometown - very intense, but damn that was fun. On the other hand, I also watched documentaries like War Photographer and the movie The Bang Bang Club - while I could see myself doing that, I do realize that the chances of getting shot at are rather high. How James Nachtwey photographed that funeral in Bosnia.. I'm not sure if I could do that.

So, I've traveled around, I've got experience photographing riots and I've worked at a night club for 5 years during my studies so I'm used to weird times to be awake. I know all relevant technical aspects of photography. Do I have what it takes to be a photojournalist?

1) [My photojournalism portfolio](http://www.flickr.com/photos/npmeijer/sets/72157631711809387/detail/), is this good enough?

2) Right now I'm shooting with a Fuji x-pro1. I love the small size, but I also realize that now is the time of big-ass telephotos and camera bodies that can go through hell and back. Besides the obvious fact that I will need a second body regardless, would it be better to look at something a little more rugged? The Canon 7D is a little out of my budget if I also need good lenses to go with it and I don't really see the Nikon D300 as a good investment right now. So that leaves the Pentax K-5 with the 16-50/2.8, this would give me a waterproof set-up but no real back-up if either the lens or the camera breaks. The Fuji XE-1 would be ideal, but would it survive? Selling my x-pro1 isn't really an option because I'll simply lose too much money that I invested in the system just 5 months ago, and I'm really fond of the small size.

3) If I do want to go through with it, where should I start? Internship at local newspaper? Do a workshop or short course?

Thanks."

I transferred back home and got myself straightened out a couple of years ago and am going to graduate with a Bachelors of Science in Biomedical Sciences in the coming spring. My GPA right now is 3.28 (before transferring it was ~2.2, I'm not sure if my school averaged the two together, I don't think they did). 
Anyhow I also started out in Aerospace Engineering but that did not work out as I honestly didn't go to class or do much work in general but still managed approximately a 2.0. It took me three and a half years to realize that I should just cut my losses with that degree as I had lost interest anyway. I then went a semester as a Comp. Sci. major. Then I finally switched to Biology and left that school soon after. 
I'll be 26 when I graduate in the spring, with no experience in the laboratory or really any work experience at all. I hope to get an internship working in genetics next semester, but seeing as how I am not completely straightened out (Major Depressive Disorder w/o medication) I let myself get behind on the application process which is due Friday.

118dvv,2,2012-10-09,"Most important decision of my academic/professional life: Should I get a Master of Public Affairs, MBA, or PhD?",MPAorMBAorPHD,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/118dvv/most_important_decision_of_my/,"Not sure if this is the right place... but I need some advice please.

I'm an American, 26-year-old male, happily married and gainfully employed, but heavily in debt and *lost* career-wise.

For various reasons 3 years ago I made a choice to get an M.Phil. in Religious Dialogue from a major European University.  I got good grades, made great connections -- it was the best experience of my life and I would do it again in a heartbeat.

My American public school humanities BA was also funded with debt, and lots of it.  But the debt never seemed like a problem because I was always good at building websites.  I am employed at present in a role which borders on web development and marketing, making a salary which (barely) can support my wife and myself, while she goes back to professional graduate school in the health sciences.  I have worked since my college internship in the same small company, and I could see myself leaving in a year to try to build a career in either client management or internet marketing... if I weren't so bored with it.

Long story short, I have always been interested in religious dialogue and conflict.  (In my mind, this is the most important question of our age.)  For years I assumed I would get a **PhD**, but the jobs for religious studies professors are few and far between, and tenure-track positions seem to be incredibly rare.  Plus, a PhD is a 6-year process probably.  My wife and I are close to our family, and after graduation I don't want us to end up in a tiny college in the middle of nowhere, where I'm lucky to have an adjunct position.  Even still, this admissions cycle I have reached out to a number of top-tier religious studies programs and professors in the US, and they seem interested in my proposed thesis topic.

In recent months though I've had the idea to pursue another Masters, this time in a **Master of Public Affairs**, focusing on International Affairs.  This way I could study international geopolitical (and religious) conflicts throughout the world, perhaps focusing on Eastern European/Caucasian conflict centers.  I'm very excited about 2 years of studying such a topic, but very anxious about the career placement.  MPAs by definition usually get jobs in government, and again, my wife and I want to remain relatively local, and aren't thrilled about moving to DC forever.  Some MPAs do find work in the private sector, but I'm not sure if they do so in international affairs.  And if I'm just going to get a job in marketing, I might as well continue as an internet marketer, without going back to school!

Finally, there's the **MBA**, which offers a chance to stay local in my city of choice, studying in a couple of ranked national programs; both provide a part-time option, which might allow us to pay for it as I go.  The financial benefits are obvious, but it seems completely contrary to my childhood dreams of being involved in religious studies, or my adult dreams of working towards achieving religious dialogue.  BUT, if I got my MBA in International Business, maybe I could jump on board with a multinational company and focus on international development, or work as a consultant with expertise in European conflict zones, etc.  Sure -- but how many MBAs are in it for the altruism?

Senior undergrad in the U.S. -- I was born and raised in England, but moved to the U.S. and have a green card.

I was offered a paid internship for 4.5 months from spring to end of summer in Toronto, Canada.

Here's a detailed explanation of where I stand currently:

I looked into traveling abroad in terms of owning a US Green Card as a UK citizen. This will not be an issue as it will be for 4.5 months, and I will still be making payments on my car, through my U.S. bank account, and I will still be registered at my university with plans to return in the fall. More than enough to certify this is my permanent residence for re-entry to the U.S.

http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/work/apply-how.asp#step2[1] 

This is the step by step on getting a temporary work visa. It tells us:
Before you fill out the application, you will need:

a written job offer from your employer

proof that you meet the requirements of the job (for example, proof of certain education or work experience) and

the positive labour market opinion on your job offer from Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC), if one is required. If you are applying for a work permit for a job that requires a Labour Market Opinion (LMO), you must now include the valid LMO with your application. We are no longer accepting work permit applications without valid LMOs. If you need an HRSDC opinion, it is up to your employer to get it and send it to you. For more information about HRSDC opinions, see Frequently asked questions.

In following this, I emailed my potential employer, for the internship, asking for an official job offer in PDF, along with a HRSDC opinion document, if they needed to provide one, and if not, acknowledging that in the job offer. Unfortunately, I have received this reply:

""... [our company] is not able to assist you in obtaining a work permit. Your offer of an internship is only an offer once you have already obtained your work permit... [our company] can not hire a foreigner for this job unless we prove to the Canadian government that we can not find a Canadian to do the job, (the HRSDC #)... I would suggest that you look into the SWAP program...""

I originally tried to go through SWAP, but they said that they wouldn't help me with my particular situation, and so I contacted my schools International Student Services Organization, which haven't been any help so far. They have been emailing people looking for advice but without any luck as of yet.

This was the embassy I was planning on going through. Note my permanent residence is Massachusetts.

http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/offices/missions/new-york.asp[2]

With all this in consideration, should I just apply for the temporary work permit for canada without the certain employment letter in NYC and hope I get the visa?

Another thought I had was that since I have a UK passport, I know I can travel freely in Canada for up to 6 months without a visa. Would I be able to do the internship if I were not being paid? This would involve renting an apartment there etc. Though I believe this will be illegal, being an Unpaid Internship.

This could mean potentially getting a great job in the field vs being unemployed for a large amount of time after graduation. If any of you have any advice, tips, knowledge, or anything that might be of assistance to me I will be very grateful, unfortunately this is the perfect internship for my field, and so I really don't want to let it go.

tl;dr -- I am a UK citizen with a green card in the U.S. offered a paid internship in toronto canada -- How do I get a work permit without the companies confirmation during application process?"
118594,10,2012-10-09,"Most important decision of my academic/professional life: Master of Public Affairs, MBA, or PhD?",MPAorMBAorPHD,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/118594/most_important_decision_of_my/,"American 26-year-old male here, happily married and gainfully employed, but heavily in debt and *lost* career-wise.

For various reasons 3 years ago I made a choice to get an M.Phil. in Religious Dialogue from a major European University.  I got good grades, made great connections -- it was the best experience of my life and I would do it again in a heartbeat.

My American public school humanities BA was also funded with debt, and lots of it.  But the debt never seemed like a problem because I was always good at building websites.  I am employed at present in a role which borders on web development and marketing, making a salary which (barely) can support my wife and myself, while she goes back to professional graduate school in the health sciences.  I have worked since my college internship in the same small company, and I could see myself leaving in a year to try to build a career in either client management or internet marketing... if I weren't so bored with it.

Long story short, I have always been interested in religious dialogue and conflict.  (In my mind, this is the most important question of our age.)  For years I assumed I would get a **PhD**, but the jobs for religious studies professors are few and far between, and tenure-track positions seem to be incredibly rare.  Plus, a PhD is a 6-year process probably.  My wife and I are close to our family, and after graduation I don't want us to end up in a tiny college in the middle of nowhere, where I'm lucky to have an adjunct position.  Even still, this admissions cycle I have reached out to a number of top-tier religious studies programs and professors in the US, and they seem interested in my proposed thesis topic.

In recent months though I've had the idea to pursue another Masters, this time in a **Master of Public Affairs**, focusing on International Affairs.  This way I could study international geopolitical (and religious) conflicts throughout the world, perhaps focusing on Eastern European/Caucasian conflict centers.  I'm very excited about 2 years of studying such a topic, but very anxious about the career placement.  MPAs by definition usually get jobs in government, and again, my wife and I want to remain relatively local, and aren't thrilled about moving to DC forever.  Some MPAs do find work in the private sector, but I'm not sure if they do so in international affairs.  And if I'm just going to get a job in marketing, I might as well continue as an internet marketer, without going back to school!

Finally, there's the **MBA**, which offers a chance to stay local in my city of choice, studying in a couple of ranked national programs; both provide a part-time option, which might allow us to pay for it as I go.  The financial benefits are obvious, but it seems completely contrary to my childhood dreams of being involved in religious studies, or my adult dreams of working towards achieving religious dialogue.  BUT, if I got my MBA in International Business, maybe I could jump on board with a multinational company and focus on international development, or work as a consultant with expertise in European conflict zones, etc.  Sure -- but how many MBAs are in it for the altruism?  I can't pretend to kid myself that I *also* would be doing it for the money.

What degree, if any, should I pursue?  It's already October and I'm falling apart.

**tl;dr: I love religious dialogue and have a major interest in international geopolitical conflict zones, but I need a lucrative career because of debt load, my wife and I don't want to move permanently for work, and I want to make an impact on the world.

I basically hate my job, and since it's completely unrelated to what I studied in school, I struggled daily with anxiety and fear that I'm never going to have the opportunity to pursue the career that I want. I have applied to jobs almost every day for the last year. I network and network and network, but always run into the same thing: my work experience is impressive, but unrelated to what I want to do.

My boyfriend graduated in May 2012 with the same degree. He didn't really put much effort into applying to jobs. It often felt like he only applied to jobs after I had applied to them and talked about how interested I was in them. We both ended up getting interviews for a position that he had originally decided not to apply to because it was asking for a Masters, but once I said I applied he did too. I ended up freaking out and cancelling the interview because I was afraid to quit a full-time job for an internship (as much as I want my dream career, 5 months of unemployment made me uncomfortable taking the risk when I wasn't yet financially stable). He got the job and I was extremely happy for him.

A few weeks into the internship he started complaining about the job. We call each other during our lunch break and he'd tell me about how he got an assignment that he thought was dumb so he just wasn't going to do it. Or he'd admit he didn't put 100% effort into something, but hey, it's good enough. He knows how much I wish I had pursued the internship (I've actually told him a million times that when he gets a new job, I want him to recommend me to replace him), so it bothers me that he's so comfortable telling me that he doesn't give a shit about a job that I'd give almost anything to have.

Last month, our University posted about on-campus interviews for a local Fortune 500 that I'd love to work for. I worked really hard to write a perfect cover letter and write a job-specific resume only to find out that I couldn't apply because the system automatically rejected anyone who graduated before December 2013 (even thought the posting said they were looking for recent graduates with 1-2 years experience). I refused to give up and eventually found the hiring manager on LinkedIn so I sent him a message stating my interest and asking if I could send him my resume via email, which he agreed to and commended me for putting in the extra effort. I told my boyfriend and a couple days later he said he messaged the guy as well. I know it's kind of a dumb thing to be mad about, but I feel like he doesn't consider how much effort I have put into my job hunt and it really bothers me that he doesn't even acknowledge that he's taking my ideas. I think my jealously is also enhanced by the fact that he got an interview and I didn't. 

This has been eating at me slowly for a few months now and I really need to bring it up, but I feel like I'm being petty and jealous and I'm not good with sharing feelings to begin with. Also, he had multiple interviews in the next week and I don't want to make him feel bad about his success and have it negatively affect his ability to perform well at those interviews. I want him to succeed and his happiness is incredibly important to me, but I'm at the point where I'm having a difficult time staying positive about my career and I really need him to be more supportive before I crash.

TL:DR My boyfriend has the job I want, and interviews for jobs I want, but constantly talks like he doesn't give a shit about them, which makes me feel insecure because he knows I'd give anything for the chances he has."

While setting up the forms for the sidewalk, it was noticed that all the water service boxes (or curb stops) that were on the radius of a street, were placed too close and were encroaching into the sidewalk.  They were placed up to 2 feet too close to the centerline in some cases. Note that along the straightaways there were installed correctly. [Shotty diagram for visual](http://i.imgur.com/qMzzK.png)

The locations were staked using gps technology. I do not believe the issue to be Builder damage because of the trend of all faulty location occurring at street radii.

I heard that sometimes when staking locations, the surveyor must look up from the trench and get a misleading idea of where to place the stake (or something to that effect). I was only an intern and have not seen the execution of this phase of development.

Any information would be great, Thanks.

TLDR; why were water boxes on straightaways ok but water boxes where the road turns were off location, which were all originally staked via gps?"

My question is, with no debt coming out of college, and about $4,000 left over from internship money, what price range should I be looking at for cars, max? I've been looking at the Honda Accord as a nice, reliable car, but I definitely want to make sure that I have the money left over to, if not max out, definitely invest heavily in a Roth IRA and of course max the 401k of the company I work for.

After at first being excited, I realized that this was my first interview as a programmer. I am a self-taught programmer, so I think this says that I'm at least going in the right direction. 

Here's a little about me, if this helps. I have degrees (not in programming), a Bachelors in History and a Masters in Non-Profit Management. I am going to go back to school for a CS degree when my financial situation pans out. I have been teaching myself programming for the past year and a half and have amassed a modest portfolio detailing my efforts. I have made two games in C and C++ as well as a basic game engine to get a simple handle on DirectX (and all of it's parts) and FMOD. Right now, I'm working on two games in UDK, one of which is far enough that I could show something, but neither are complete.

This first round of interviews is a group interview, has anyone had any experience with these types of interviews? What can I expect from this? How exactly would I set myself apart in a group interview?

The email also says that if you are picked there will be a coding evaluation at a later date, so I guess I don't have to think about that now.

My only experiences with interviews where outside of the field of programming. Usually for those I would dress as nice as possible, what is a acceptable attire gaming interviews?

There are some extremely good schools in the Seattle area, so I think this is going to be a difficult interview process.

Any advice is helpful! Thanks!"

I am currently living in the Midwest (Madison, WI), but I would be willing to relocate for the correct position.

I'm currently a sophomore in college studying for a B.S in Networking and Telecommunications Management. I currently work for a department at my school as a web application developer. Given this, most of my experience so far is with web development, as I have not gotten into Networking/Telecomm. specific courses yet (still in the generic IT courses right now). 

Recently, I attended an internship recruiting fair specifically for IT students. While handing out my resume and talking with various companies, most informed me that 

A) They do not have a Networking/Telecomm internship available
or
B) They have a Networking/Telecomm internship available, but given my current experience, I would most likely be matched with a web development internship.

So my question for reddit is this: How should I proceed with an internship? I would like to keep my current job, as it is very nice, I am learning a tremendous amount (about web dev), and there aren't really any networking/telecomm. positions open for students.

Also, is there anything I can be doing right now before I get into networking/telecomm. specific classes that will give me some experience or knowledge about networking/telecomm.? 

Thank you!"

Then as the term progressed, I started to make more and more mistakes, people started throwing me under the buss, and my boss started calling me out on alot of very small things. 

Basically, work responsibilities have been revoked due to my mistakes, i am no longer allowed working overtime (sucks because I get paid 1.5x for OT), work that is given to me is extremely tedious and boring, and I feel tension between my coworkers and I (specifically those who threw me under the bus). The biggest thing is that my boss makes it evident that he doesn't like me/i'm doing everything wrong.

So now, I dread every single day. I come to work at 730, and all I think about is getting off work. I skip lunches just so I can leave this hell-hole asap. 

I don't know what it is, but I kind of feel depressed. my heart is constantly beating fast (I believe this is called work anxiety), and I am seriously hating my workplace. If i wasn't on a school coop program, I would have quit this job immediately, but I am stuck here until the end of the year. 

My car also just broke down over the weekend, and need the engine replaced. The only thing I have going right in my life is my wonderful girlfriend. She has been supporting me the whole way, but will be leaving this weekend for two months for training. I think part of the reason i feel like complete shit is that I am constantly worrying how i'd survive these days after she's gone.

Sorry, this is honestly more like a rant, and I don't even know which subreddit to post this to. But please, give me some advice on getting my shit back together at work. Help me stay positive through this !"

So, I knuckled down and decided Id rather have a degree in my hands and then apply. 
So I graduated and applied for every design, and photography position they had open and all were denied...now what do I do?

I was paying for college 100% out of my own pocket because my parents have bad credit and lived from paycheck to paycheck, so they couldnt help me out at all. Well, by the time I dropped out, I owed nearly $30,000 in student loans. I couldnt get much financial aid because they were married and apparently made too much money for me to get much aid. Well, after I dropped out, I started working. and over the next 2 years, I got a job where I made 500 bucks a week and I was able to have my own apartment and a $17,000 car. Well, I made a poor decision and decided to quit my job for a girl who lived 10 hours away, and I moved out there to be with her. The day i got out there, she broke up with me. Saying she didnt feel the same way about me. So whatever, I came back home and was not able to get my job back, so i started working part time at a restaurant, but wasnt making enough to pay for the car, so it got reposessed. I started going back to school this fall. Going to a community college, so it's a lot cheaper. and I was offered a paid Internship with Disney. Now, yesterday, I recieved a booklet from my bank, with payments for the student loan starting next month for $300 a month, and also received a letter from a lawyer saying that I'm going to be sued for the remaining balance of my car (about $9000). 

I dont know what to do. Should I go to Florida for the internship? It will give me a huge leg up once I graduate, but that might not be for a few more years, and I'm not sure if they would invite me back if I don't accept it this time. Or should I stay here and work while i'm in school to pay these debts? Dont know if I should take care of the long term or worry about the issues at hand, or if I should file bankruptcy or what."

This means I have to finish this internship or else my residency could be endangered. Well I took a position at at the visa and immigration office, thinking that would be perfect, they'd know how do deal with foreigners and I could learn a lot; I was so wrong. My boss was often gone and I was left alone with three enployees who were to oversee my internship. All of them were great except for one. She didn't like me from the very beginning: when confronting her in private as to why she was making my internship so difficult, she wouldn't let me do anything or interact with people, disabled my computer, hid my food etc., she said it was because little Kanacken(an extremely offensive word in German) piss her off and that I was a little shit for having a friend help me secure this internship by exerting political influence. Well what she said went too far, I threatened to report her - she countered with a threat to ruin my internship report, a letter detailing what I did while working and necessary for me to get credit for my internship, she said if I told she'd personally make sure I never got that amd that she would personally see to it I would get my residency revoked and be forced to leave the country. Well her threats were real, I have to attend university two days a week and am not there, my boss is gone for two weeks on vacation. After talking to one o my other coworkers I reminded him I would not be at work on Thursday because I have to atudy. Well he isnn't at work either, so I sent an email to the lady who hates me, the only one there today, and reminded her where I currently am. She respondes saying nobody had informed her of this and my other coworker was never aware of such an explaination. She forwarded this to my boss, his boss, and the immigration pffice responsible for me, she is clearly trying to get me fired.

I have roughly 1 and 1/2 years of internship experience in Marketing roles. The first was working on an online/print catalog for a local electrical distributor and another working in an Audience Research role for a pretty major media outlet (known nationally). Prior to that I worked in a retail setting for nearly 3 years (gained lots of selling experience and some management). Before that as a Customer Service Tech for a broadband internet company.

I've mainly been searching for roles in Market Research which is a long shot since I know most of these roles prefer to have people with a Masters degree. To my own surprise I managed to get two phone interviews. I've since expanded my search to general marketing roles.

**Here comes the question:**

Is there a huge disadvantage not living where the job is being offered? I'm mainly applying for positions in Chicago and Seattle but I'm currently living and volunteering in North Dakota (I really have no choice to live in work here for the next several months).

There is a chance I'm just not that great of candidate (I'll happily post my resume for anyone who wants to take a look).

Thanks for the help in advance.

11ad5p,9,2012-10-10,"My gf [21f] left me [23m] after 3 years, mostly LDR. Need help figuring it out",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11ad5p/my_gf_21f_left_me_23m_after_3_years_mostly_ldr/,"We started dating in 2009 while I was in her town working a summer internship. We started the long-distance relationship with some uncertainty. By the end of that year we both seemed confident we might have something and I visited her. We're over 3k miles away from each other so visiting has always been a hassle. We would normally go several months between visits, but would Skype almost daily and text constantly. We were very dependent on each other for support.

We planned for a while to try to end up in the same city together and be together. There was a brief break-up a month before I graduated in spring 2011 (she just graduated this past spring), and before I had any kind of job lined up. During that brief break-up period I accepted a job even further away from her, not knowing what else to do in a sparse job market. We drifted back together and our relationship was stronger than ever before.

I started my job, and we continued the LD, visiting at first a little bit more often because I had freedom and money. In 2012 for reasons primarily relating to her strict focus on schoolwork I didn't actually visit her until May for her graduation. She then visited me for a while right after, staying with me until early June. She accepted a spot in a grad school program in her home town which started in September. I was excited for her, but scared about her future. I probably wasn't as supportive of her as she was expecting and hoping -- primarily due to my fear of what may come next and the challenges we now faced.

I should note that around March of 2012 I started talking to a company that was started by a friend which was based in her hometown. For many weeks they made it sound like they would be able to add me to the staff ""soon"" and that is what I told her. Eventually my focus on thinking about that job led to me neglecting our relationship and focusing solely on that. Even though it was entirely out of my control. Things started to slip a little and I was blind to it because of my focus on that job. After she left from our visit in June, for the first time we didn't have a plan to see each other next, which is vital in a LDR. It was around this time that I kept hassling her to come visit me -- I don't have much vacation time at all and she was on a summer break. I asked a handful of times, the last couple were asked jokingly but not received as jokes...

Then a few weeks after our 3rd anniversary, she ended things. I was stunned and am still in shock. I am still thinking about her at least once an hour, which is down from once a minute a few weeks ago.

We talked -- or rather I hounded her with texts -- for the next few days. Then things settled a tiny bit and seemed to move towards us talking about what went wrong and if it was possible to make things work. 

Then I had a freak-out and did something stupid. Started drinking bourbon from a bottle and before you know it I had bought a plane ticket and told her I was coming to town soon. It was after this event that we exchanged some heated e-mails and settled on not talking for a while. We ended up talking about once a week for the next three before I decided I couldn't handle talking to her anymore and needed to truly cut contact for a while.

When I told her my plan to cut contact, she supported the idea, which I expected. The thing of it was her tone. She seemed disinterested in even talking to me. I am probably reading too much into that, but now we're a few days into this and it is just so foreign to me to not be able to speak with her.

The company I spoke of earlier has since told me that they can't hire until February. I do not like my current job, but I'm not going to go find a new one and quit that after six months. I am making good money and learning a lot, but I do not like the culture here (in fact I believe adamantly that some of the aspects of my personality that she cited as leading to the break-up were slowly enhanced and encouraged by working here).

The things she told me were problems, I took it upon myself to work on those aspects of my personality -- they are the least favorite parts of my personality, and I found myself agreeing with her during a lot of our break-up talks. The thing of it is, I don't know if I want to do this for me or if I want to try to get her back. Either way I'm going to do it and emerge a much better man for it, so I guess I have THAT going for me...

If the option of ending up with her in the future exists, I need to completely cure myself of the NEED to talk to her constantly and prove that I can function on my own and make the improvements that I want to make in my life. I also need to give her the space she needs to focus on her studies. I know this will take time, which is why Feb '13 is a great target for me to end up in that town. Be it to try again or to finally get closure face-to-face. The thing of it is that  I KNOW that I need to just give it time and give it space right now, but I have so much anxiety about it that have an urge to DO SOMETHING to fix it now. I need help getting over that.

What does Reddit think?? I can talk about more detail if folks ask.

Worth noting: this was the first serious relationship for either of us, and my first of any kind.

TL;DR - Another failed LDR. Seems we changed when I wasn't paying attention. Shocked by breakup. What do I do next? Need some encouragement. Need help learning how to move on."

I must say I let the issue rest, and waited if it maybe actually was a one-time thing. An opportunity to bring it up would present itself if it was needed, I thought.

---events:

It did. Today, my husband was skyping with his sister (my bridesmaid), and since I like her very much and they don't happen to be online at the same time very often, I didn't want to mope around gaming in another room and unplugged my laptop, moving it to his desk. 

At some point, he gave me the mic to speak with her. I had noticed earlier that he was reading other things meanwhile, like he always does when talking to his family. (With his mom, I can understand that VERY well although i still find it uncorteous, but with his sister I felt kind of sorry for her.) 

As I looked up, because his sister had her webcam activated, I noticed that he was not only reading, but also facebook chatting. Now guess with whom, it was the goth girl. I had enough decency not to read their texts too while talking to my SIL. 

Just one time - the talk had shifted to him again and his sister had noticed that he wasn't reacting to her question and obviously heard him typing and asked ""Hey, are you chatting to someone other, too?"", I looked at the conversation. They were currently chatting about how the goth girl cleavage was judged in one situation, whether by photo or live. I decided I did not exactly want to know what kind of situation they were talking about. 

Well... the rest of the evening went kinda nice, except for one situation later where I was back at my usual laptop place because it had run out of electricity and was writing a message to a fellow pregnant lady, when he asked ""Well, what are you writing that much?"", what I promptly answered. But until going to bed, he was really nice and lovng, not in an unusual way, it just felt great as ever and since he hadn't been exactly suspicious or secretive earlier, I nearly decided to drop the issue. 

--discussion:

But it bugged be too much and so, after cuddling up in bed and turning off the lights, I told him that the situation with the girl bothered me. Since I wanted things to stay nice, I told him that it bothered me that she obviously hates my guts but still chooses to hang around with him that much. The conversation promptly took a turn to ""Well, if she doesn't like you, do you expect her to still talk to you exactly as much as she talks to me?"" This already alerted me a bit. Hadn't he stated some days ago that he wouldn't even consider her as a friend? 

Of course I do not expect this, I explained calmly, and then actually told him about my feelings, how I felt that she chooses to ignore my mails (where I actually tried to do something for HER (""For HER? I thought you were doing this for yourself!"" True, but I also go out of my way to share it with her and get next to no reaction.)) but still finds time enough to chat with him about obviously irrelevant things. I told him I was offended by the fact that she chose to spend so much time talking to him while simultaneously deciding to so dedicatedly not give a fuck about me and the fact we're married.

After this explanation - and I really made an effort to use lots of I-messages and make my feelings clear since I've often been accused of talking like a logbook or a lawyer - I got surprisingly little, almost no reaction at all (mostly ""I don't know""'s - what the fuck do you not know that I am currently not telling you about??). So i told him with a bit more urgency that I didn't like that behaviour of her AT ALL and that I expected more respect of her.

No reaction.

""Well, I guess I can't really *expect* respect of anyone just like that"", I almost asked, promptly getting a ""Yeah, indeed."" Concerned, I steered over to ""Then I have to make obvious assumptions that do not please me at all, if she chooses to disrespect and disregard your wife just like that while intentionally approaching you that much!"" - ""Maybe it isn't intentionally"", he said. On my notion that it would bother me even more if it was unintentionally, I again got no reaction. 

At that point I already felt like crap because I decided to speak about how I feel freely and openly one time, like he always wants me to, and I get basically ignored, but definitely not confirmed. So I decided to end that talk - because maybe he was tired and therefore not answering any more, I thought (what actually seems incredibly naive to me even right now), and said ""Well. I only know that I have a REALLY bad feeling about this whole situation that I don't want to just ignore, especially since I even have some factual reasons for it."" Silence.

Just a few minutes of silence later, the dryer had finished his cycle, creating an even heavier silence in the room. Upon this, the husband said ""Goodnight!"" quietly, friendly and happy, as if nothing had happened. I repied ""Goodnight"" and turned away, upon which he said some kind of nice stuff that actually managed to make me smile. 

And soon he fell asleep, but I couldn't. Because that whole talk was so awful, and this extended not-talking was so unlike him (he didn't even try to start a discussion, like he always does when I criticize something, because he usually is good at them), that every moment I spent thinking about how it went and how I felt, I felt more and more like crap. 

----

My obvious conclusion is that this woman is NEVER going to babysit my son. Ever. And I still have hope that my dearest husband is only so disgustingly friendly towards her because he seemed really excited about the idea to have free babaysitting available. But what did I read in /r/parenting? No one, EVER, offers free babysitting just because he's that good of a person, so be aware. 

The things I definitely want to avoid are approaching him with all the blame I can muster up (I still believe that this goth girl is a huge bitch and I hate her guts - I know that my husband plays a part in enabling her but *technically* he does nothing wrong and I think I would have noticed if he was hiding something), and I definitely don't want to turn into the jealous housewife, demanding to know everything they talk about that's soo interesting. (Fuck, even if I am boring - he is interested in psychology and the mind, and he's pedagogue. His sister is about to become a grade school teacher and currently has an internship in a school for mentally challenged, ill or otherwise ""special"" students - and he chose to write nonsense with that goth girl because his sister ""Only speaks about the children""???)

But what can I do? I think I will go into the zen mode and continue doing what makes me happy as long as he treats me nice and correctly, but then again there's that little voice in my head telling me that I am a huge asshat for even considering that. Still, I feel strangely calm, even though I think I should be crying uncontrollably right now, I only feel a slight clenching of my teeth as an expression of my uncomfort with that girl. 

No, seriously, I'm at a loss of what to do. I fear that with every mention of her (and especially if I turn it to ""she's stealing you and you let it happen""), I create an atmosphere of ""You're crazy, I would never do that"" (what I firmly believe) as well as heighten the chance that he STARTS thinking about her that way and discovers she actually is able to provide him with more support or other means of recognition than I am able to (what's obviously also true.)

--------

tl;dr: Husband chats with said goth girl at the expense of rare conversation with his sister. I feel shitty about this, confront him (nicely) and get an atypical, unsatisfying response. I feel like crap. What do?"

I get back to my desk and start checking my email.

I get there and she explains to me how she was listening to a CD and turned her computer onto it's side and the CD got stuck in the drive. I fish it out and make a nice woman very happy.

My focus was primatology, and I have experience working with primates, both from an internship with an extremely well-respected research facility, and from gathering observational data for my (uncompleted) thesis. 

I seem to have the necessary experience and education most the jobs I'm interested in require, but I don't know how to sell myself because I feel like I'll look like a quitter or failure. I've been in Q&amp;A sessions with potential university hires, and it seemed like the line ""I left because of personal issues"" is a death sentence in that situation, but I don't really want to tell potential employers about my personal issues.

11ds0c,5,2012-10-12,r/jobs... Thank you!,counttess,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11ds0c/rjobs_thank_you/,"I spend a lot of time on r/jobs as a student about to graduate in December in a somewhat silly field and in need of a full time position (as does everybody).

I wanted to say thank you for giving me the job and negotiating confidence I needed to move forward. I currently work part time at a company I love and I have a meeting next week to talk about going full time when I graduate in another section of the company. Will it go through? Maybe, maybe not.

But, even if it doesn't, I already gained another internship and will at the very least have full time hours when I graduate between the two jobs (both have said I can stay part time indefinitely).

**What worked for me:**

Honesty, as well as who I talked to first.

First, I made sure that the people in the other section would possibly be interested in hiring me on by careful inquiring. Basically, not outright saying I AM INTERESTED! but asking about the qualifications, etc. and out of that they said that they would think I would make a good fit.

Second, I got the internship. As much as they are ""interested"" in me going full time, there's no contract written on paper, and I wanted to ensure that I would at least have a competing opportunity. This ended up happening extremely quickly or else I would have told my manager that I was interviewing for other positions (I phone interviewed, came in the next day for the real interview, got the call to hire a few hours later). 

Third, I talked to my manager. Not my immediate supervisor, not my peers. I had no desire to let any information leek up to my manager before I got the chance to talk to him. I had already expressed interest in the full time position before, but that was it. This time I expressly told him about the internship (to make sure it was okay) and asked him more directly about the other job opportunity since it had just officially become ""open.""

Now, I have a meeting. Will I perhaps have to leave this internship early? Possibly. But that's okay, I've secured at least the next year as far as jobs go. Would I prefer to have benefits and whatnot? Of course, but luckily I'm still under my parents' insurance and don't have immediate need. I still get 401k benefits and stock options as a part timer.

So...

**TL;DR: Be honest, and start at the top. Don't let any information leak to the person who controls your ability to go full time or your movement within the company *without* talking to them first. Also, be direct. I told him my goals for my future exactly how I intended to go about them.** It seems obvious, but it seems all to often people talk to their peers too much... and well, it spreads more than you want to."

After perusing the first few pages of r/PoliticalDiscussion, I've started to notice a somewhat peculiar stance that a few posters have. They have two main claims.

*They claim that the rich should be taxed at a significantly higher rate, some were advocating for rates as high as 70% for top income earners.
*They also claim that the rich currently have too much influence in the political process.

While I understand these claims at face value, I am not certain of the reason. Not to single out liberals, because it's been rampant all over in society lately. The ""cool"" and ""hip"" thing is to hate the rich and successful. 
Without making a sweeping generalization, why do you hypothesize that the latest trend has the rich painted as demons? 
Aren't we all trying to become more wealthy and better serve our families?
Further, if you were to become wealthy say over the course of the next few years you are promoted much faster than you expect, does your viewpoint change? 
Would you pay more than required in taxes to show your expectations of others?

I am a graduate student and I interviewed yesterday for an internship in a tax department at one of the major studios in Los Angeles. I was hired on the spot. I was not expecting an offer immediately,I felt I was put on the spot, and I accepted.

I had a second round interview at a mid-tier firm on Tuesday, and I was the only one in the group interviewing for an internship (they were interviewing for full time tax). The firm said it would contact us on Friday (today) to inform us of what is going on, even if a decision has not been made yet.

I want the mid-tier internship, because if I am hired for winter, I was told I would work in the summer as well, and it could turn into a full time job (who doesn't want that). The industry internship did not say anything about being brought on full time. the hire six interns each year for the busy season. I already did an industry internship at a Fortune 500 company in the tax department over the summer, which was similar. It hires one intern each summer to help with State and Local tax returns.

tl;dr:I don't want to be a douche by rescinding on the offer I already accepted, but I really want the mid-tier internship. Can I rescind if I am given an offer by the mid-tier firm?

My ultimate objective is to be a data scientist, but I also enjoy software engineering / architecture.

Here is what I am doing now: I am doing a Post-Bacc degree in Computer Science. I have a Solid 4.0 and have done discrete and Intro to CS 1 and 2. I already have a solid A in my Comp. Architecture and Data Structures course, it is not over yet. I've self-studied (through coursera and on my own) algorithms, design patterns, compilers (wrote a lexer and grammar generator), played with some AI, and automota theory. My professors are always amazed at the work I come up with and the graders call my code pro.

My 1st degree was in Economics, and I have done 3 graduate courses in Statistics (Applied Stats, ANOVA, and Regression). I know SAS and Java really well; C fairly well. I have in various degrees programmed or learned bash, awk, R, Haskell, vb.NET. I know Linux and its command line decently as a user.

So I think I have something of worth. But I am not sure what companies are the leading data analytics companies to intern at. I really want something that challenges me and will get me deeper into the data science as practiced in industry aspect of things.

Does anyone know of which companies I should be looking at given what I know?

I was starring at a wall, and tearing up. My mom asked what was wrong. I said I felt sad. She asked why. I said I don't know. She laughed and said I'm just becoming a teenager.

Felt incredibly depressed from then on. When I was 13, I was suddenly very ill physically. This lasted for 6 YEARS. High fevers, all over body pain, sleeping constantly, daily headaches. I barely went to high school. I spent anytime out of my bed being carted around to various incompetent specialists. I somehow still graduated, and got into a good college. I went to college, still sick. Still barely going to class, still absolutely miserable. After 3 semesters, I finally dropped out after having literally not left my room for a month. Spent a few more months seeing doctors. Finally saw an infectious disease specialist who found that I had a potentially fatal lung disease all these years. Great, all I needed now was a spinal tap to see if it had spread to my brain or not. 

That was botched. Horribly. It was literal torture. No anesthetics, and an incapable, unsupervised intern. I was stabbed in the spine 18 times because she couldn't find the fluid. It was the most pain I have ever experienced in my life. I was sobbing and begging her to stop as she held me down, refusing to get help because she didn't want to admit she didn't know what she was doing. Eventually she wrote me a referral to another hospital to get the procedure done properly. I left, barely being able to walk, completely traumatized. I had the procedure done properly a few days later, and started treatment.

The lung disease was cured. The spinal tap left me permanently disabled with severe nerve damage. Every day is hell on earth. I experience that same pain going down my leg constantly as I felt when there was a needle in my spine hitting my nerves. I tried to sue. That fucking bitch lied on the medical report. I had pictures of my back that showed 18 holes bleeding profusely. I had other doctors tell me that she was doing it in the wrong spot and that after 3 attempts she was obligated to stop, but wouldn't put pen to paper on that. The medical malpractice laws in my state protect doctors like crazy. 

I also developed PTSD and fibromyalgia and chronic migraines after that experience. I have a migraine almost every day of my existence. I have constant knots in every single one of my muscles. I feel excruciating pain in every point of my body. I can't control my body temperature. I have horrifically violent nightmares and wake up saturated in a cold sweat every night. Anytime someone gets near my back I have a complete breakdown. 

The only thing keeping me alive is a high dose of sleeping pills and constant use of narcotics. I hate my life. 

I'm 23 now. My condition will never get better. This is what I've been told by neurologists, pain managements specialists, physical therapists, rheumatologists, all supposedly the best in their fields. I've been classified as severely disabled, and require a disabled parking permit. 

I can't do anything. I can't sit in a chair without being in agonizing pain. I can't do any light housework, it destroys my muscles. I feel like I just cannot live in this world. 

But the thing is, I keep forcing it. I went back to school, I graduated on time. I enrolled in grad school. That's where I am now, and I fucking hate it. I hate having to drive to school, it hurts so much. I hate walking the 10 minutes from the student disabled spots to my academic building. I hate sitting on those fucking horrible plastic chairs with broken backs. I hate those fluorescent lights bearing down on me while I have a migraine. I hate listening to people complain about their trivial problems. I hate shifting around in my seat during class in complete agony, holding back tears, and thinking ""I'm putting myself through this to listen to some guy talk about functional continuity with respect to metric spaces?"" I don't fucking care about any of it. I keep doing it, because if I don't I might as well kill myself.  "

I always feel like I didn't give it my best, and that I could have done better, and that there's no way they're going to hire me.

For example, yesterday I had a interview at my school with Cisco for an internship in the spring.  There were about 13 of us in the information session, and I think around 5 or 6 of us got interviews.  I was called 15 minutes after the session got out for an interview the next day.  I was totally nervous about the interview, but went in strong, answered all the interviewer's questions correctly.  I told her I'm working my ass off for their certification and she really liked that.  She told me I had an awesome resume and that I'd be a good candidate, but they look for people with 3.0 GPAs, and I have a 2.99, and that it could make or break the deal.

After she said that I instantly was in the mindset that there's no way I'm going to get the job, and someone better is going to come along.  I get in this state of mind where I'm really depressed, and I just don't know what to do.  This happens every time I interview.

The members inability to respect my political stances and constantly trying to change my views. What they say about the political party is just untrue and disrespectful, and is a huge turnoff. 

The Youth Pastor will not hire me to help him with the group, even though I am there all the time, and most of the people around me say that they agree with me. He says it is because of budget issues, even though he was able to hire the Childrens Pastor daughter to intern for him. I told him I do not have to be paid a lot, but I do need to get paid. I am a college student, and the extra money would help my parents. 

The third is a selfish issue. Most of my college friends who go there. Are gone. They have gone of to college, and the ones I care most about I see out of church when they come home anyway. 

I do not know what to do. This is the church I became a Christian 5 years ago. Everyone I know now are people from this church, and my favorite mission trips are from this church, the ones that I go to multiple times a year! Would I still be able to go on these if I left? Would they still help me financially with those trips if I left? I do not know where I would be today without these peoples help. The few that are spoiling it for me, are doing a very good job at it.

[He wasnt asking about their physical appearance. He was asking if a majority of the women in your movies really do have some serious mental health issues or if that is a misconception. I would like to add, if a woman seems to have some serious mental health issues would you feel ok about letting her have sex on film, or would you request she gets evaluated to make sure she is capable of making sound decisions? Also, when a woman gets older/gains weight/ becomes unappealing in a traditional sense do you let her go with some type of severance, just fire her outright, or do you find new movies for her to make that appeal to a different audience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11baqw/iama_president_and_ceo_of_a_large_porn_company_ama/c6l03o2?context=5)|For the most part, misconception.

11ck4r,62,2012-10-11,Just wanted to talk about how much i enjoyed Handsome Jack as a video game antagonist and why i think he's one of the best. What do you guys think about the character designs?  [spoilers],ForteFZ,Borderlands2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands2/comments/11ck4r/just_wanted_to_talk_about_how_much_i_enjoyed/,"I just wanted to say that ive had a blast with BL2, especially now that they've fleshed out what we had always wanted to ask from the first series. In particular, i found that Handsome Jack was a character that i cant help but look at as one of the best villains that i have ever seen. I think a lot of people woudlnt agree with me on this, so i thought id try to expalin why i thought so.

Jack really breaks the mold for the usual villains we get. He's not the serious, psychotically evil, omniscient, straight-forward secretly-a-coward (debatable) villain. He makes jokes (where's our butt-stallion easter egg boss) and we get alot of story on who he is during the games playthrough. He's not truly a coward at heart like a lot of the other villains we get, as he personally appears without a super robot suit to fight us, and continues to argue and fight to the very last shot we get for his mask and loot. He does show genuine care for his daughter, he was just a complete failure at how to do it. I think they could have fleshed out the relationship between him and his family just a tad bit more, like the whole mother and angel situation. 

We get to see how he rose from a little intern at Hyperion to the big shot he was in the game, and then we watch as that slowly changes to a distraught tyrant hell-bent on revenge and power for the daughter he didnt know how to (and couldn't truly) love. 

He does a great job at making us hate and think ""wow, you are an asshole"" (Bloodwing, killing hostages on echoes or unethical slag testing on captives), and if you ask me i think his voice acting was really well done and you could feel the emotion he had behind it. 

Was just wondering what people have to say about the fleshed out personalities of everyone in the game?


I think Gearbox has done a giant jump in terms of character development and im loving it. I really hope the borderlands universe grows into something huge. With the discovery of all these new vaults.. the possibilities are endless. "
11cicu,1,2012-10-11,Should I intern for a company with a culture I love that pays low or a company I don't that pays high?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11cicu/should_i_intern_for_a_company_with_a_culture_i/,"The first one is a small but very popular music company similar to Pandora.  I really like the company and it looks like all the employees are chill people that I could work really well with.  I'm also a musician so I naturally fit in with their culture.  They said they would pay for my housing and provide free breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day of the week.  The only downside is that the internship is unpaid and people say it's not a good place for career growth because it's a small company:(

The second company is a huge software company which makes one of the main browsers we use today.  I've heard from past employees of said company that the code is very outdated, and they had to work with people who were much much older than them.  I'm also not too passionate about this company.  However, the company pays a tremendous amount of money to interns, and this company could potentially be great for career growth.

So, what do you think I should do?  Take the risk and go for a low paying company I think is awesome, or take the safe route with the company that pays a lot with higher potential for career growth...?"

Met him(24M) a little less than a month ago at a party. Really hit it off. Started hanging out (watching TV, studying together).  I made it very obvious that I was into him-telling him that I found him very attractive and at what point straight out saying ""I like you"". Being this forward is very unlike me, but he's a somewhat reserved guy and I just felt like I should put myself out there. He responded positively  but without actually reciprocating my sentiments. 

We kissed for the first time about 2 weeks ago and since then we've spent a ton of time together. We're both students so we're pretty busy during the day, but in the evening he'll invite me over to his apartment and I'll sleep over (no sex yet) after staying up all night talking, giggling, and being stupid together.  He took me ice skating last week. 

All in all, it's been a wonderful experience.  I've fallen really hard for him and really hope that we could potentially progress from friends to an actual relationship. 

So here's the problem: Last Sunday, he slept over with me here at my dorm. We had a fun little evening and then went to bed. On Monday morning, we cuddled in bed for a little and then he got dressed for his internship. On his way out the door, he pulled me close, gave me a hug, kissed my forehead and gave me a 'lil pat on my butt. *sigh*. cutest thing ever.

So that was Monday morning- the last time I saw him (very weird- we've never gone more than 2 days w/o seeing each other since we met esp. since we live 5 mins away from each other).  We've texted back and forth a few times with me initiating 75% of the time- also very weird. He usually texts me all day about what's going on. Things just seem...different.  

He hasn't said anything directly that would indicate there's a problem, but something just seems off and it's killing me.  I'm scared to ask him if there's anything wrong because I don't want to come off as paranoid or overly attached or ""too into things"" and then scare him off for good.

So AskMen- help! 
-Why would a guy just shut down like this for what seems like no reason? I'm super confused!
-What is my next step? I've been fretting about this and feel like an idiot sitting here waiting around for him to start ""acting normal"" with me again, but don't want to seem clingy and push him further away if there is something wrong. What do I do?  

Thanks, guys. "

1. I like Europe, all of it, except U.K.. I haven't yet been to parts of Asia or South America, but have close friends who have and do like these parts, and thus I am pretty sure I would like these part, especially South America.

2. I speak Spanish and English fluently. I am currently thinking of learning more languages. I know intermediate Chinese and Japanese. I don't mind learning new languages

3. I am currently studying business with a focus on entrepreneurship. I know you can't ""learn entrepreneurship"" and am looking for ideas to start business, hopefully online. 

4. I don't mind learning new skills to make me multi-faceted. Currently I am getting into programming and web development. I'm also getting into photography.

5. I am a U.S. Citizen, And i don't mind resigning my citizenship.

6. I prefer to live in a relatively inexpensive city, in other words, no Switzerland or Scandinavia

The questions I have are
Where are the easiest places to get long-term visas with a business degree? Has anyone gotten an internship abroad? what was that like?

Should I consider seeking a different or second degree if my primary motivation is to work abroad? 

Last but not least, Is anyone on this board living a four-hour work week type life? This would be the best bet and probably what I want to go for, but I also want to have  a variety of ways for traveling.

11c8h3,86,2012-10-11,Finally a reason to swing the banhammer at Gawker! Aww yeah!,I_hate_bigotry,circlebroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/11c8h3/finally_a_reason_to_swing_the_banhammer_at_gawker/,"Well, this is interesting. After my last segment of covering the takedown of /r/creepshots with some rather extreme methods, people followed through with their threats against Gawker.

I won't touch the actual event that much, everything has been said, just a reminder, /r/creepshot was so controversial that imgur.com removed. That's telling a story.

Why do redditors support a persona, that seems to have been constantly fapping to everything controversial? Well, let's hope we find out.


/r/mensrights banned [all gawker links while naming them all](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/11a7rk/the_follow_domains_will_no_longer_be_allowed_to/) (is there such a thing as bad publicity? According to /r/creepshots, no.) 

mensrights seems under the delusion, that the internet is place of complete anonymity and therefore your shitty actions in the web (which happen to affect real people) never ever are suppose to affect *your own* life.

It's an extremist viewpoint where everything on reddit seems to be allowed since reddit is soooo open and progressive and so. I wonder, why do we not have CP subs? If you have that spirit you should follow through it after all!

Let's take a look at what will bring you lots of karma:

&gt; Gawker is literally a cesspit of bad journalism even before these recent developments, this makes me happy!

Blatant swearing! Gawker gives them a little trollbait and the catch he makes is just outstanding.

&gt; [I applaud this move. Tabloid journalism and vigilantism have no place in our community or reddit as a whole. We will not tolerate witch hunts.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/11a7rk/the_follow_domains_will_no_longer_be_allowed_to/c6krosq)

But SRS has to go! *Picks up pitchfork* But pictures of sexulised minors and unaware women have a place in our community? I love the cherrypicking here.

The outcry swaps [over to Subredditdrama](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/11a8jf/several_big_subreddits_are_banning_links_to/):

The best way to gain karma again is to swear at those Gawker sites:

&gt; [Thank god. Gawker is completely terrible.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/11a8jf/several_big_subreddits_are_banning_links_to/c6kov6j)

PIMA thinks that being doxxed is something illegal!

&gt; [I do wonder if some of those Redditors who were doxxed have any grounds for possible legal action against Gawker?](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/11a8jf/several_big_subreddits_are_banning_links_to/c6kphmo)

Someone at least broke the jerk:

&gt; [ITT: Redditors with degrees in Internet Law.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/11a8jf/several_big_subreddits_are_banning_links_to/c6kv710)

Some reddit superiority complex:

&gt; [It's smart - Gawker needs reddit far more than vice versa.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/11a8jf/several_big_subreddits_are_banning_links_to/c6kol22)

Clever isn't it?

Subredditdrama also [brigaded](http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/11bk8o/announcement_gawker_media_content_is_no_longer/c6l2ign) the /r/torchlight Gawker ban thread whilst claiming doing so only because SRS invades, [since some people weren't actually not so happy with the decision of the mods.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/11bk8o/announcement_gawker_media_content_is_no_longer/c6l0qyt)


/r/politics also banned Gawker in a bold action:

&gt; [Reddit prides itself on having a subreddit for everything, and no matter how much anyone may disapprove of **what another user subscribes to**, that is never a reason to threaten them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/119z4z/an_announcement_about_gawker_links_in_rpolitics/)

The bravery is off chart here!

Now that is a nice twist of the reality. That user made himself the target he was for being the creator and sustainer of /r/jailbait and /r/creepshots and [many more high quality subreddits](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/119z4z/an_announcement_about_gawker_links_in_rpolitics/c6l0y1l).


&gt; [Fun fact: Gawker requires its interns (or at least required when I interned there) create reddit accounts to promote Gawker links.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/119z4z/an_announcement_about_gawker_links_in_rpolitics/c6kp1o2)

And I pulled that out of my ass without a source or anything! But the hivemind doesn't mind that and upvotes me to +1366. [There's no way someone would lie on the internet!](http://anongallery.org/img/4/8/go-on-the-internet-and-tell-lies.jpg)

Ladies and Gentlemen, we have broken jerk over here:

&gt; [So a mod from /r/creepshots didn't want something relating to him posted on the internet without his permission?](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/119z4z/an_announcement_about_gawker_links_in_rpolitics/c6ktc1s)

&gt; [Well, ain't that some shit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/119z4z/an_announcement_about_gawker_links_in_rpolitics/c6ktc1s)

And with that we find many more broken jerks. It's beautiful. Somehow people seem to finally get back to their senses and point out the irony of the situation.

""Women have no privacy."" - VA; ""My Privacy!"" - VA

Nevertheless I'm a little shocked how childish they react towards gawker: Since that they I haven't seen any proof of Gawker being part of the blackmail or the doxxing. They did an interview with that ominous 25 year old women who did the actually the doxxing and reaped in all the pageviews of enraged redditors. PIMA just claimed that Adrian Chen blackmailed VA.

At first people blamed without proof SRS, now it's Gawker, which seems now to be perfectly fine to censor. When will people demand that PIMA has to deliver some evidence?

11fcgf,1,2012-10-13,I need some advice. SO doesn't want to seriously discuss the future with me...it's been over 3 years,Throwaway121991,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/11fcgf/i_need_some_advice_so_doesnt_want_to_seriously/,"Long post, sorry...

Background information: I'm 21/F, he's 26/M. We've been together for over 3 years now, long distance. I'm in Canada and he's in the US, and we both live near the border so we're not too far apart. Both of us live with our families still.

When we first decided that we wanted an LDR we didn't have a strict end date in mind, but we agreed that we wanted to begin making preparations for him to begin to move here with me when I was finishing university. Barring that, we had a goal of being able to see each other at least every 2-3 months or so, saving our money to move out together. I was fine with not having a strict end date, as long as we had clear goals to work towards.

At the time, he was finishing up a community college diploma that he'd started just after finishing high school, but never got around to completing. He was working at a retail job at the time (still has the same job). I started to worry a bit seeing how he would just skip class/assignments, fail, and then pay to retake more classes, but he assured me that it was ok and he would take it more seriously. He promised me he'd get the diploma out of the way so that he could get a better job, and improve his chances to immigrate here.

Fast forward to now...nothing has really changed. I think he's still enrolled in school and still has his job. He often talks about marriage and having a nice home together, but in very vague terms. He also talks about things like getting a teaching degree or opening his own business. But he doesn't care to think about the logistics of achieving these goals, and they just get pushed further and further back. And since the job he has pays jack shit, he has no savings either. He’s gotten better about spending his money on junk (over 170 games on steam) and saving instead, but I’m not exactly rolling in money either so it’s not like I can help here.

Whenever I ask him about planning for the future, he gets upset and says I’m trying to pressure him or that he’s scared I’ll dump him and move on. Or he’ll get depressed and say that I think he’s a bum and a loser. But I’m not asking for definite plans, just goals that we can expect to accomplish within the next few years. I have a pretty good idea of what I want to be doing in 1-2 years’ time, and how to get there. I think that’s pretty normal…

I'm starting to feel really worried...it's like even though we treat this like a serious relationship, he doesn't seem to make smart decisions or try to plan, instead leaving it all up to me. A few days ago I was telling him that I felt burnt out from school and his response was that I should drop out and permanently go to my summer job (I had a summer internship that paid a few bucks above minimum)...I'm set to graduate with my bachelor's in June 2013. What kind of logic is that? It just made me realize how bad he is at making life/financial decisions. 

I really love him a lot and I can easily picture us settling down together. These problems didn't really hit me until now, since I'm preparing to graduate and look for a job. I'm considering just going to professional school/college or something since there’s no way we’ll be even remotely ready by the time I graduate, or even within 2013. I hate this feeling of uncertainty…how long is this going to last? We’ve only been able to see each other 3 times over the past year and a half. I think I could deal with it better if we had an end in sight…but right now it doesn’t look like there is.

What do I do? I don’t know how to articulate that he needs to start thinking seriously about the future if he wants this relationship to pan out and be something more than daily skyping and occasional visits. I just get stonewalled whenever I bring it up. Am I being unfair or do you think this is reasonable for me to want?

How do I approach this?,[deleted],advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/11f8ue/got_an_interview_for_a_traffic_coordinator/,"Months ago, when I had just graduated, I realized I wanted to do everything in my power to get into advertising. I applied to ad agency job postings, emailed agencies, networked, and did internships. Through the process, I also realized that I wanted to become a copywriter, more than anything else in the world. It was invigorating, and when I finally got a copywriter internship at a very small agency, I was in heaven.

Just recently, I got an email from an agency that I've been extremely interested in for a while, and they want to interview me for a traffic coordinator position that I applied for a long time ago.

My current internship ends sometime in Dec/Jan, and it may or may not lead to a full-time position. At this point, it's not very clear. And ultimately, I would like to end up at this other agency I was recently contacted by, but as a copywriter.

How should I approach this interview? Should I be upfront about what my goals are? Is there any way this interview would possibly lead to a meeting with the creative director? Is working as a traffic coordinator a pretty good way to get myself into the creative department, or is it something I should avoid if I'm dead-set on becoming a creative? I've heard some people (Luke Sullivan in Hey Whipple) say that when you're trying to break into the business, getting any position in an agency is helpful. I've also heard others say that you have to make sure you only get copywriting gigs, to show you're dedicated to copywriting. So I'm not sure what to do.

Dear Reddit, what can I do to turn my life around? For everyone else, too? It seems no matter what I do I keep screwing up in my classes, I get turned down for jobs no matter where I go, no matter how impressive a resume I have, no matter how many calls I give, I've only ever gotten three interviews and one was for a seasonal position I had to stand hours for and never got a call back for. To make matters worse, I completely need a job because they messed up the first month of my school year thanks to two classes getting name changes, resulting in me no longer requiring two foregin languages, but instead an internship, an internship I'm struggiling to get thanks to the fact that it's a month in and they've all been taken. A job will work too, but not even McDonalds is returning my call with my pathetic 1.8 GPA.

I try to be nice, but that's hardly enough. Anywhere I turn there are six, seven, eight more people in the world abusing kindness, choking out a few more dimes from the dimeless. Nobody seems to care, everyone seems to have given up, no matter how hard I try and speak out, try and convince them that there are still causes we have to fight against. NDAA is still kicking around, there are the wars we're fighting, the shortages we're facing, but people would rather plug their fingers in their ears and go la la la. Worst yet, any kindness I try to show people gets quickly swallowed up by the void of the world, any progress gone with a snap. 

I can't help at home, either. My father's third marriage is falling apart, and there's nothing I can do about that. I can see clearly what's wrong by now, but he refuses to listen to anyone, no matter what. He's a megalomaniac, and he doesn't even know why I don't think. He just keeps doing it because it's what he's used to.

So I'm guessing, Reddit, I'm turning to you because I literally do not know what to do. I've tried everything, nothing seems to work, and everything, including my life, seems to be turning to shit, and it just feels completely out of my grasp.

So I do very much like my internship, I am learning lots everyday which is exactly what I hoped for. Its just when I get home thats the problem. I am increasingly isolating myself from my friends and loved ones because I feel I am becoming boring. I have a lot of resentful thoughts about the people I am close to and I can't stop them. I am naturally a positive person and choose to see good in everyone but recently I just cannot shake being negative and oversensitive about everything. I am causing trouble between my bf and I because of this and now whenever we talk I just feel I am saying boring stuff because I am talking about my work day and sometimes he says its not very interesting for him. It got to a very upsetting point this week and I needed to speak to my closest friend about it but she cancelled on me and has since not asked about how I am...though I have continued to ask her how she's getting on and lending an ear for her troubles. I know I am not at a great point right now so I am wondering if the people close to me have had enough.

Ultimately I am just stuck on how to get out of this negative state of mind and was hoping you guys might have some tips. I desperately do not want to be here I am generally sad most of the time because I have these resentful thoughts, even though my mum knows I feel this way and texts me all the time to cheer me up but it just irritates me. Its so horrible to feel that way and I hate myself for it. Perhaps its because I want my bf and friends to be doing that, not my mum. 

I cant afford to speak to anyone professional about it so was hoping writing this here would help. I just guess I need some help/advice from people who have been able to get themselves out of these odd, negative frames of mind.  

*Note*

As I am told by my bf my problems are not huge and its not the worst thing in the world that can happen to me and I do understand this but comparing my issues to real life big scary problems does not help me just shun mine aside even though I would like to. So if anyone does reply to this please try not to compare this to anything major that is going on as your time will be wasted on me.

I never had aspirations of Big Four, but simply a regional or small firm would have been nice. So then I looked at industry a few months ago on craigslist, monster, indeed, and such, and decided to apply to everything I could find. It hurt to see such low pay, but I figured at least get a foot in the door. No replies for an interview or anything.

I'm starting to become really depressive about this and wondering if I wasted my life away. I know I could have done more and have many regrets, but I can't take them back now. I have 40K in loans that I'll have to start paying off soon, and that's whats really creeping behind my back. I want to study and take the CPA exams at some point, but I need to get paid to support myself, pay for the study materials, and pay for the exam fees. Is there someone, anyone that can help me get through this or share a story or prevalence? I feel lost, and seeing those around me finding security has thrown me into a rut I'm having a hard time crawling out of. I just want a chance.

Here's my empty resume:

11emix,27,2012-10-13,I've had a pretty strange week and I just need to talk to someone.,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/11emix/ive_had_a_pretty_strange_week_and_i_just_need_to/,"I don't normaly share my inner most thoughts with strangers on an online forum, but I feel like I need to share this with someone (anyone) that doesn't have a biased perspective of me. Here's the thing, this week has been like an emotional roller coaster for me. That's not actually the strange part about it since from what I understand it happens to everyone throughout their lives and it's happened to me before when things get hectic. No, what's strange about it is that nothing noteworthy happened! It was a very boring, stress-free week and yet very mentaly intense at the same time.

I felt incredibly lonely this week. In fact I hadn't felt like that since I was in 10th grade. Back then I had a massive superiority complex and felt like I didn't need friends since I was ""so much smarter"" than everyone else. I actually loved House MD during that time since I related to how House was so bitter, cynical, and lonely. God I was such a stupid teenager, but I digress. The reason I'm bringing this up is because now I have plenty friends and hadn't felt like this since those days in highschool. 

It's like all of my insecurities came out of nowhere and did the best Chris Brown impression they could muster to the Rhianna that is my mental well being. I'm afraid no one understands me and that I'm really as alone as I think I am. I'm afraid that my ""friends"" don't really care about me and are only in it for themselves. I'm afraid I will never accomplish anything important in life because I'm just too lazy to do anything about it. I'm afraid that people are sick of me because I'm a boring person that doesn't have anything to say, other than snarky comments that trivialize whatever is being talked about at the moment. 

I know I have a big test coming next week, but instead of studying I just choose to sleep or waste time on reddit. Instead of applying for internships online, I just pretend like I have plenty of time for that later even though it could take me about an hour to fill out all of them. I know I should go for a jog or something in the morning to stay in the shape I am but I don't have the will power to just dedicate 15 fucking minutes to it. I can't even edit my own goddamned résumé (which should take me about 5 minutes) and print it out to get a part time job at GameStop. 

This whole week was composed me, myself, and I cycling through all of these thoughts with as little human interaction as possible while I paced through my apartment or slept during the day. Hell, at one point I even cried myself to sleep! I really reached a new low and I just needed to vent all of these feelings somewhere. I'm extremely ashamed of the fact that I'm posting this on frigging Reddit, but what else was I supposed to do to feel better? Am I a freak? Is this normal? (sigh) I feel like I'm losing my mind."
11em8n,2,2012-10-13,Amazon fails to support its sellers when USPS fails even more,melawesomee,amazon,https://www.reddit.com/r/amazon/comments/11em8n/amazon_fails_to_support_its_sellers_when_usps/,"Time for a little Amazon.com rant...... So I'm in the realm of ""F-bomb"" pissed at Amazon... I have my own ""store"" on Amazon that I sell my used textbooks and a few other random things at and this week I am SUPER pissed.... So here's what happened: A guy purchased a book from me and wanted it shipped to Hawaii. No problem.... Well except for I was running a little behind in shipping (about 4 days.... yes, I know) Anyways, I let the guy know that I was shipping his item. Well I sent it USPS with a delivery conformation, as Amazon suggests. Well it seems this guy still has not gotten the book, which I would be upset too. Well instead of contacting me and saying ""hey where's my book"" (even though I sent him the tracking number), He writes a scathing review on my page and then files a complaint with Amazon. Amazon sends me an email asking for shipping details and whatnot.... Now keep in mind, I have NEVER had an issue like this before. So when you look up the tracking number https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction_input?qtc_tLabels1=03113260000118356680&amp;qtc_senddate1&amp;qtc_zipcode1 
it shows the package getting to California on about the 17th of September and leaving the following day...... That's it.... nothing else, now this item was on its way to Hawaii, but seems to be missing now. Well not only does Amazon say I am ""libel"" but that they are going to refund this dudes money and charge me for it and that I can contact him and ""ask him to send back the book should he get it, but that he is not required to do anything"" WHAT? Oh and Amazon considers this matter now CLOSED.... Well I DON'T..... I realize I would be tons of pissed too if I hadn't gotten something I ordered, but my first complaint would have been to the POST OFFICE. and since I have absolutely zero history with something like this happening before, ZERO....... ZERO, why is AMAZON holding me responsible? They also told me that ""while it's not required, in the future I should add a delivery signature to it"" Well guess what amazon, it didn't f........ing get there, a f....ing signature conformation wouldn't matter for shi... OH and how would that help me with having to give them a refund AND potentially be out the product? If a signature slip is REQUIRED to not be charged if a package goes missing, then you damm well need to require it and say so on your page. I want answers AMAZON. 
Now the customer paid about $45 for the book and shipping, and so I am now out that money PLUS the cost of the book, so in my world that's $90. Maybe $90 isn't a big deal to ""RUPA, from Amazon"", but to me, a college student who makes LESS than $70 a week and is doing an UNPAID civics teaching internship Monday-Friday, then working Saturday and Sunday at a bookstore in the mall-It Damm well is. I am so livid over this whole thing especially when I have sent SO MUCH business Amazon's way, and have recommended customers look to them when I can't find a book at work and I have also recommended my fellow college students open their own retail store with them. Maybe to RUPA and the rest of you at AMAZON, $45 or even $90 is your Friday night bar tab at Santana Row, but for me, that is almost one-third of my MONTHLY RENT, yes ONE-THIRD........ I am seriously considering closing my seller and buyers account once this whole issue is settled, and I will stop recommending you to them and start recomending Barnes &amp; Noble for them to sell their used books with.... they might not be a better choice, but they haven't charged me $45 for a book that I have no way to get back. I have usually gotten great customer service from AMAZON when I have purchased items, but even as a ""seller"" I am still a customer. I don't know why I am being treated differently in this capacity.... (package finally arrived on Oct 10th, I emailed customer asking them to return the item by putting ""return to sender"" on it so they don't have to worry about shipping... haven't gotten a response..... totally NOT surprised) I have tracked you down on Facebook though!!!!"

During the summer, I work as an archaeology intern, so I spend almost all my time out in the sun messing up my nails. So this fall, while I'm in school, is the perfect time to experiment with nail polishes and art. I've been seeing so many great design ideas/nail polishes that I'm super excited to be here, and I've been trying to buy every polish in sight. Everyone seems so nice and welcoming, so I'm excited to be here! "

[Have you ever had to investigate a child homicide? I recently watched a program about how people were being wrongly accused of child homicide because of how difficult it is to keep emotions out of the case, on the part of the autopsy performer.Even if you haven't performed one, what are your thoughts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11dfow/im_an_autopsy_tech_death_investigator_and/c6lhrf7?context=5)|Never worked a child homicide... uh, can't imagine it being very fun.

Going to tell his mother her only son was dead was the most heartbreaking things I've ever done.
[Why exactly were you the one to be telling the mother this (it sounds like you're still training\)? I imagine you don't have the authority to pronounce someone's death, and medical professionals/legal professionals should be the one's doing so.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11dfow/im_an_autopsy_tech_death_investigator_and/c6lj9hl?context=5)|He was pronounced by the coroner.

[Sounds a bit unprofessional, are there rules as far as having respect for the dead and their bodies? Vagina and all? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11dfow/im_an_autopsy_tech_death_investigator_and/c6lliq0?context=5)|Gallows humor is a necessary coping mechanism when you're surrounded in death and suffering all day. Rules are adhered to, but things could seem rather grim from an outsiders perspective. 
[Wait, what? How do you cut off a vagina? I mean, It's basically a hole. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11dfow/im_an_autopsy_tech_death_investigator_and/c6llu2h?context=5)|Picture a large cube of jello.

 |Then chase your housemate around the room with it.

We found his written recipe for cooking old school pseuo meth, it was bloody illegible. 
[Holy shit, the sawing off heads part seems a bit overkill.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11dfow/im_an_autopsy_tech_death_investigator_and/c6ljdov?context=5)|They were really high. They didn't bother burying them or anything, just threw them in the bushes.

He had been sitting in a cheap motel room for several days with the heat cranked and had become a bit bloated.

Fortunately no, I don't think I could work on someone I knew. 
[If I could go back in time to tell my dad how to do this better, I wouldn't change a thing.  He made me brave about my own body, its strengths and weanesses and how those strengths and weaknesses could be mitigated by my own choices.  He hated cop shows that showed ""bad"" cops because he insisted that it didn't happen, and if it did, the cops who followed the rules hated them more than the public ever could, but he did make me promise him that if I was ever arrested for anything, even if I was innocent, to shut up and call a lawyer.  Kind of a trust the cops... but they're not your dad philosophy.  Watching cop shows is always amusing with him because a detective will make a statement about where the assailant was standing and my dad might retort ""not with that blood spatter pattern"" or they might conduct a search and he would say - that's illegal, wouldn't happen.  So what do you plan to tell children about your job?  Or relatives at the holiday dinner about your work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11dfow/im_an_autopsy_tech_death_investigator_and/c6li17w?context=5)|My relatives won't shut up about it and I have to draw a line somewhere with the gore factor.

[Worst smell, noise, sight ever?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11dfow/im_an_autopsy_tech_death_investigator_and/c6lif3h?context=5)|Any decomp, they are just bad man. The sight doesn't bother me. I grew up on /b/ b0g and ogrish. XP.
[My uncle recently died after being sent home from the hospital with chest pain. The autopsy report lists cause of death as ""acute poly pharmacy"" but doesn't have a toxicology report included. My aunt and I are trying to figure out if that means OD or Drug Interaction?  Is that commonly listed as a cause of death rather than like ""respiratory failure as a result of acute polypharmacy"" or whatever? Last questions I swear. Is it normal for there to be a toxicology related cause of death but no toxicology report?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11dfow/im_an_autopsy_tech_death_investigator_and/c6ljilb?context=5)|Acute poly pharmacy usually means that the person died as a result of a combination of the drugs he was taking at the time. There is never a tox related CoD without a report. Full reports can take a week or so to get back though.

Suddenly every potential juror thinks they know all there is to know about forensics. DNA and fingerprints are a bitch to lift, sometimes it doesn't work. Time since death can be really tricky to determine depending on condition of the body, wounds, weather patterns etc.  
[How are corpses treated? Have you ever witnessed any disrespect? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11dfow/im_an_autopsy_tech_death_investigator_and/c6lhf0n?context=5)|Never direct disrespect, that just isn't done. Tasteless jokes? yes. We need to sleep at night too.

11ehi3,2,2012-10-13,How will this situation affect my credit score?,murtyjones,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/11ehi3/how_will_this_situation_affect_my_credit_score/,"'So basically, I'm a 20 year old college student who has had one of those responsibility ""starter"" credit cards for young folks, giving me a credit limit of $500 for the past two years. I was incredibly responsible, being careful not to carry a balance, which has paid off recently. I was just approved for a big boy credit card from my bank at a limit of $6000, and with 0% introductory APR for 12 months. 

Unfortunately I have to put this credit to work right away. I have a rental down payment for next year's living at about $1200, and I need to fund some very necessary trips for the purpose of attaining an internship next summer. I'm expecting to run about $1500-1800 on this card and pay it off a little every month. Will my credit end up hurt because of this? It's hard to tell with no interest being charged."
11efq4,2,2012-10-12,Are full-time job offers received after completing an internship usually contingent on finishing school?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11efq4/are_fulltime_job_offers_received_after_completing/,"Some background. I'm a 5-year BS/MS student, will have my BS THIS May and my MS (theoretically) next May.

Here's the hypothetical situation I'm considering: I get an internship offer for this summer for some company. I get my BS in May. After getting BS, I go to the internship. At the end of the internship/some point during the first semester of next year, company offers me a full time position for next summer, I accept. I quit my MS program, take the remaining time off to travel and do freelance work instead of completing the MS.

Is this typically possible? I ask because I will have my BS this May regardless of completing the MS or not, and the job itself likely does not require a MS.

Thanks!"

There is a possibility that I may get an internship in your city (which would be amazing!). The internship would pay me $14/hr for 15+ hours a week. Keep in mind, I currently live in a small town in Ohio and living off $14/hr would definitely be possible. However, I don't know how economically feasible it would for Seattle. If I worked full time, would it be possible to live anywhere near the city at that pay rate?


Please, any help would be much appreciated! Thanks "

Why can't I be the greatest engineer that ever lived and partake? I'm looking forward to being a professional, but not being tested because I know I will be. If anything, the greatest thing effected is my crrativi, it's enhanced. My focus is always on the activity I am on when on trees. I'm very worried growing into a world where efforts of enforcement are wasted on harmless people that work hard and do extraordinary things. Why should I fear getting a job in the future, or even an internship? I should forward to a career in something I'm passionate about and enjoy what I want to. I just find it strange that people fear now something that was found ""harmful"" in the past. Alcohol (no offense) was once found harmful, but we find that it all depends on the user. A lot of people are responsible enough to use what they want to. Have we not learned from history that we, as humans, have been wrong in judging right from wrong? Harmful from harmless? Dangerous from safe? We once thought certain things were dangerous and were wrong because we did not know. I just hope I see the day it is legalized and I won't fear losing a future job for my recreational activities. I hope I can help this actually happen someday.

TL;DR College freshman hoping to be an engineer and not losing future job or internship."

Recently I've pondered about studying abroad for a semester (or two), and I wanted to know how my chances are, if I wanted to study in America. I've visited the country twice: First time I toured the East Coast, highlights of the journey including New York City, Washington and a day in Canada (the Falls). The other time, I went with my school, visiting New York City as part of a project organized by our government and the school I went to.

I find the American culture most intriguing and everything about seems just so exciting! 

I've been thinking about settling down in Portland, as it seems like quite a ""Big City"" which is the place I'd like to live, if I gained to opportunity to move there: A really big city, with lots of ""life"". 

But tell me, realistically speaking: How hard is it to study in the US, in comparison to Denmark? One of the things that I'm quite worried about is also the cost of living: will adapting to the American economy be too overwhelming? 

Alternatively to studying, I was thinking about taking up an internship as part of my bachelor project (I'm still in the 1st semester of the degree and the project doesn't start until the beginning of the 6th out of total 7 semesters) - I'm taking a bachelors in IT Engineering. How good are my chances of landing an internship like that, in the Portland area?

I'm looking forward to hear your input :)"

I promised I never would leave you under those circumstances, yet there I went and did exactly that. I tried to give signs and hints that I was having problems. I tried to talk and reason.

If I threw away the most important person in my life. 

I have so much regret and so many questions. Why did I always come second? I don't just mean the internship-- that last ten weeks of hell...I mean everything. I loved you....no, I love you. So incredibly deeply. But the fact is I had so much difficulty ever seeing a place where I could be yours. You would talk about how great it would be to be my wife one day and yet the next tell me how you felt that you don't know if you could ever be married. There were nights when we'd go out that I could tell that maintaining harmless flirting with other guys was sometimes so important that if it wasn't received, I had to pick up the pieces. Was there anything I could do to make you less insecure about the other people in my life? Did I try enough? Did I try too much? Every time you insulted your appearance I tried to pick you up and I was so exhausted....So exhausted, and something happened today and brought it all into perspective.

I've got about a year of experience under my belt but I am interested in continuing my studies and expanding my design perspective. I've been looking at different schools in Europe, more specifically Copenhagen (Royal Danish Academy) and the Netherlands (Amsterdam, Rotterdam). 

I'm not really interested in going back to school for another 3-4 years and completing another Bachelor's degree as I feel my work experience is more valuable. Ideally I'd like to find a short-term program (around 4-8 months/1-2 semesters) where I could study design and learn in a different environment where design has a very strong history. Perhaps some of you would be able to give me advice or recommendations on schools that offer this type of thing. Maybe trying to find an internship somewhere is my best option. Any advice or other information would be great and much appreciated. Thanks!"

[The craziest story ever?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m43fi?context=5)|Well, near the beginning of my career as a front office manager, I had gotten a call to help calm down an irate woman. Her beef was that she was convinced she was confirmed at a $49 rate. Our rates at the time were running at $129. I tried to talk her through it, and we eventually came to a a point where she agreed to go out to her car for the confirmation letter. I breathed a short-lived sigh of relief. Something in writing almost always solved my problems, one way or another. Except, there was no confirmation letter. Instead, she loaded in to her Suburban, threw it in to drive, and floored it... Right in to the side of the building. She calmly got out of her smoking vehicle, strode up to the front desk with a smile and said, ""I think I'll take that $129 rate.""
 |You know, watching the FBI run a sting in my parking lot to pick up some guy from another state who had murdered his family was pretty crazy, too. When the FBI shows up with a court order for information, you know it's about to get crazy. 
[Did you call the cops? Did she get arrested?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m4pw3?context=5)|I carefully told her that she absolutely could not stay there, and I called the cops. She melted down in to a fit of rage and they had to lift her up and carry her to their car.
[What was her reason for doing this? I'm so confused.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m50fc?context=5)|My guess? Rage issues. 
[Did you ever catch anybody having sex? Where was the weirdest spot? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m3txx?context=5)|Always. I think walking in one one couple literally hanging from the gym equipment having sex was a bizarre one for me. It was compounded by the man begging me for ""just 30 extra seconds"" so he could finish.  I offered my sympathies to his lady friend and told him he had 2 minutes to be clothed and out.  
[You seem to be a great person.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6mbyma?context=5)|My primary rules: Always do the right thing, and don't be a dick. :) 
[What is the best way to get free stuff at a hotel? I'm talking anything from knocking the internet fees off the bill to comps on drinks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m3trt?context=5)|It takes a few steps: 
 |Make sure you join the chain's loyalty program (HHonors, Marriott Rewards, etc). You get instant free things that way. Generally you can easily get wifi, room upgrades, and food or drink coupons.  
 |Make nice with the front desk folks. They generally want people to have a great time and they have a slew of freebies they can give away. Make up a special occasion... Even if it is something silly. Tell a story and get some buy-in. 
 |Don't ever threaten, yell, or try to belittle. You get put on the ""no freebie"" list. 
[If you have a special occasion, should you just come out and mention it and then just wait for them to offer some free stuff? Isn't that bad form?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6mesil?context=5)|Here's the honest answer: just come out and say it.
 |As a guest I know it feels weird, though. When we went on our honeymoon I had found all of these cool stories about one of the resorts we stayed at. They did all kinds of fun things for honeymooners. Did I once mention we were honeymooning? No. I silently sulked.
 |I'm not great at taking my own advice, but if you truly want a fun experience for a special event you have to tell someone. 
[Did you ever get to bang a guest there randomly? Or anybody every invite you in for some awesome party? More or less tell me your best night at work.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m4eqh?context=5)|Sorry, no randoms for me. As a girl, I got the offers all the time, but they were definitely not good offers. Not that I didn't think really hard about it a few times... But it's way more fun to have romps at someone else's hotel. 
[I've been reading this for quite a while, and up to this comment I thought you were a man and look like this..  Also, i don't remember his voice so I put you the voice of  a white Morgan Freeman.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m7mfp?context=5)|Hey, at least he's, uh... Dignified. :)
[OK this brings up a question I have.  What would you suggest as being a good approach to asking out a hotel staffer?  Is there a policy to never go out with a guest during off hours?  What if that guest lives in town? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m8u2z?context=5)|There is a policy that everyone ignores. I had an associate marry a man she met while he was a guest.
 |It has to be done carefully because it might not be easy to tell if the person is in to you or just being super nice because that is their personality. If you can talk to them away from coworkers, try starting by asking if you can bring them a cup of coffee or something. (Most of us are rampant coffee drinkers.) The reaction is a good gauge. Then just come up with something fun to do, and ask.
 |I never appreciated the creepers that would literally just invite me up to their rooms. That's lame. Nobody really bites on that trick.
 |Slipping $100 in to a note with your room number... is not a good method. 
[Do you get to keep the $100 when that happens, even if you refuse?  :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6md6y7?context=5)|Ew. No. That's dirty money. :) 
[Any interesting celebrity encounters?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m45hf?context=5)|Definitely. Dr Ruth was honestly my favorite. She's a tiny little lady that could barely see over the front desk counter, but would come down early in the morning to visit with me. She is hysterically funny, full of energy, and very smart. Upon leaving, she grabbed my hands and in her very thick drawl exclaimed, ""You're going to have GREAT sex for the rest of your life!""
 |I did also watch Sting get chased through the restaurant by a mob of middle-aged women.
 |BB King was another good one. He wandered around every day telling jokes and giving away guitar picks.
 |Oh! And I did also have Wee Man help himself to the kitchen. He pretty much just went wherever he wanted. Super funny. 
[I got way too much of a kick out of picturing Sting running through a crowded restaurant away from a stampede of middle aged soccer moms who just read 50 Shades of Grey.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m8cq7?context=5)|You just nailed it. That man is a master of evasion. 
[*Upon leaving, she grabbed my hands and in her very thick drawl exclaimed, ""You're going to have GREAT sex for the rest of your life!""*  Was she right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m8poj?context=5)|Absolutely! 
[It seems like the escort business wouldn't exist without hotels -- so do you know when it's happening on the property?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m3vy7?context=5)|Every damn time. I can spot even the best escorts right when they get there. Men are a little more difficult, but we usually figure it out. 
[So do you get rid of them, and call the cops, or is more like keeping an eye on them? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m4n1i?context=5)|Neither, really. They don't usually cause trouble, and who am I to ruin someone's fun? :)
[What is the five away? Is there a difference in look between an attractive pro and just an attractive civilian?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6malps?context=5)|It's more in behavior than physical traits. There are a few tells that I've picked up on. 
[What's the single weirdest thing you or a co-worker has walked into in one of your guest's rooms?  First thing that comes to mind...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m3upx?context=5)|I mentioned this on another thread, but I walked in on a woman who had gotten drunk and handcuffed herself naked to the legs of the bed.  She'd been expecting company and hadn't realized that she couldn't answer the door or the phone. By the time we got there to do a wellness check on her she had peed all over the place. I asked her what she was thinking and sheepishly answered that she thought it would be a sexy surprise. Failed.  
[Wow.  How did you free her?  And how any people had to witness this before she could finally shut the door, shower and get dressed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m4627?context=5)|She had stashed the key, so she lead us to it.
 |As the saying goes, misery loves company. I used the buddy system. Luckily it was just two of us. 
[Whats the craziest weed related story you have?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m4cmb?context=5)|We got a call from the police department that they had picked up a guest of ours for writing fraudulent checks around town. An assistant and I went up to the room to start packing and inventorying his belongings. He was clearly OCD, and had neatly arranged a ton of soap bottles all around the room. After getting a good laugh out of his organizational systems, we grabbed the first duffel bag. It was full of weed.  So was the closet, the drawers, and a number of other duffel bags. He had some large bags that we expected to be full of video equipment.  Nope.  Weed.  It was all packed down very tightly and stashed everywhere that he could manage. Overall, the cops told us that he had nearly 20 pounds. It was an incredible amount. 
[You ever regret not keeping all or most of it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m8tb6?context=5)|Never. 
[He became Adrian Monk.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m5iqa?context=5)|Hah!
 |We had nothing to do with Trudy's death. 
[Did you take any? I mean, I would have but I love cannabis.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m5skd?context=5)|No. Even if I were a smoker, I can't ever seem to escape my own moral sense of obligation. 
[Who leaves the rooms the dirties, the rich elite people or the middle class type of people?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m3vbl?context=5)|Sports teams and middle-class families on vacation.  The amount of trash and broken items in one single room is astonishing.  Cheetos ground in to the wallpaper, seventeen pizza boxes, shaving cream in the light fixtures, chocolate cake on the pillows... You name it. 
[Man, I treat that shit **way** better than my own house. I don't know how people do that to you guys. they must know someones gotta clean it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m4qt8?context=5)|I once read s random statistic that something like 94% of people do things in a hotel they would never do at home. Little things, like eating toast in bed. It's really crazy to see exactly how far they take it. 
[When we travel with our two small children we are so ultra careful about picking up after ourselves. It's like staying at someone else's house! I can't  stand slobs. We leave a big tip not because of our mess but because of other peoples.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m5efp?context=5)|You are awesome! On behalf of hotels everywhere, thanks for being the rarity. :) 
[Eating toast in bed? That would just make it all crumby when you tried to sleep. That's counterproductive...  If anything, eat toast on the toilet.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m51b5?context=5)|Seriously. Who wants to sleep with crumbs? If you ca talk on the phone on the toilet you might as well just eat toast there, too. Hah!
[Do you feel you were fairly paid for your job?  Overpaid?  Underpaid?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m54ia?context=5)|Well, most of us agree that we don't work in hospitality for the money... I have always felt okay about my salary, but its definitely below an equivalent in another industry.
[How did you handle drunk loud people in the lobby?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m54ia?context=5)|Most of the time I treat drunk people in the lobby like kids in a daycare. They're obnoxious and completely irrational. I usually make them laugh, entertain them for a moment, and then convince them that sleeping in their room is going to be way better than jail. I rarely have bigger problems. I give them one chance to behave. Sometimes fist fights have broken out and I won't tolerate those. I instantly call the cops.
[Ever had to evict a guest due to complaints from other guests?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m54ia?context=5)|Yes, I've had to evict people. It's rare, but it happens. It's usually worse than noise.  Fighting, breaking things, or threats usually come along with the complaints.
[How many guests were at your hotel to cheat on their spouses?  Were they obvious?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m54ia?context=5)|I can pick out the cheaters sometimes, but not as often as the escorts. I don't know of any regulars, if that's kind of what you mean. 
[How often do mid to higher end hotels clean their carpets and bedspreads?  Do they ever do a deep cleaning of rooms to get the accumulated crud out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m4yb7?context=5)|Most of us triple-sheet the beds, so every part of the bedding except for the decorative throw at the bottom gets cleaned each time. I can't speak for those that still use bedspreads now, but my experience before was that they got washed at least weekly or as needed.
 |We shampoo the carpets in each room once a month. Every time there is a party, smoking, or anything gross like vomit we'll do it immediately.
 |The philosophy on cleaning a room is that it should seem as if nobody else has ever stayed in that room... Every single time they clean it. We also do something called a PM that is a super detailed check done on a rotation. We will redo little things like caulking, calcium removal on the shower heads, cleaning window sills, tightening screws, etc. 
[Is there a way I can swim at hotel pools for free?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m477v?context=5)|Walk in behind another family and pretend like you just got lucky? It's tricky to loiter in the common areas in a swimsuit and not look like a creeper, though. You'd have to come up with a good plan! 
[Also don't leave your clothes next to the pool.  It's a dead giveaway to security that you don't have a room.  I've caught sooo many kids that way.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6mb1um?context=5)|Absolutely! And carrying your bright orange pool towel in will get you, too. 
[How do you get the lowest hotel prices?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m3xk9?context=5)|Unfortunately it really is opaque websites like Priceline. There are tricks to figuring out which hotel you will get. Otherwise, use the advance purchase rates. Those are a good discount. Some hotel chains are really loose with their Friends and Family rates. You often don't even have to prove you know someone. Those discounts can be 50% or more. 
[*There are tricks to figuring out which hotel you will get.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m9jjn?context=5)|Do a bit of research. Find out where you want to stay and if there is anything unique about the hotel. I recommend Tripadvisor. So, you notice that this is the only 4-star hotel in the downtown area that has both a pool and free wifi.
[Go on...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m9jjn?context=5)|When you make your Priceline selections, be sure to check those amenity boxes, bid on a 4-star hotel downtown, and there you go. You'll get that hotel.

Ehhh... The honest answer? No.
 |Is it possible to balance work/life as a hotelier? Yes, but something always has to give. We work very long hours and are on call 24/7 365 with no real relief from that.
 |It's an industry that gets in to your blood, though. I wouldn't want to dissuade you, but it's hard. Families sometimes struggle and parents feel like they're missing out. Yet, we go back every day.

[Sweet AMA,  What rooms in a hotel are the worst and best (besides the usual next to an ice machine etc. \)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m67xf?context=5)|Almost every hotel has rooms with a better view. They usually sell for more, but are easy to get as a free upgrade. Make a casual reference to how great it would be... I think the best rooms are the odd rooms. We have a few that used to be some kind of Junior Suite but don't quite currently make the cut. They're bigger, but sell for the exact price of a standard room. I always ask about stuff like that. I don't know about worst. It almost always pertains to noise, though. We do have one room that tilts a tiny bit.  We call it the vertigo room... It's so bizarre. Another one vibrates ever so slightly.  Hah! Loyalty programs are the easiest way for an upgrade.  Second easiest way? Ask. Super nicely. Be cheesy if necessary. Front desk folks love to feel like they've done something really meaningful. Non-peak times are super easy. So what's the $20 trick? I'm curious.

Keep trash in the trash cans, throw your dirty towels in a pile on the floor, and be careful about leaving your electronics on the beds. Some hotels will move them and pick up after you, others won't even make your bed.

 |My General Manager died on a treadmill while at a yearly Brand meeting. I was very new in my role, and he sat down and told me he was going to need a small procedure done sometime soon. Doctors were telling him a valve that had been replaced was failing. He said he was going for a second opinion after the meeting. I disagreed as wholeheartedly as I could, trying to get him to go immediately. No luck. He laughed and insisted he was doing the right thing. I called him to see how things were going while he was gone. We talked briefly and he said he was in the workout room to go for quick run before dinner. Just like that, and I never spoke to him again.
 |The family could not do a memorial service that our staff and community members could attend. He was from another state so they moved him. So, I held a funeral service for him in our restaurant. I wrote an delivered a eulogy for him. He was very young (mid-30s) and an absolutely incredible GM. He was loved by many, so there was a huge crowd.
 |I couldn't have imagined what a tragedy it really is for the staff to lose their leader. It was the hardest thing I've had to do so far. And the saddest. 
[Are the bed sheets ever ""dirty""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m5di1?context=5)|Shouldn't be. If my executive housekeeper suspects anything, she will backlight the room herself. She'll even mark sheets with invisible ink to make sure all beds have been changed.

It not only lends credibility to any endeavors in a market where the recruiters don't know the validity of your experience, but you're likely to learn something, too. It's not a bad idea.
[I wanted to go to school for Hotel Management since I graduated from High School, but I'm wondering if that's a good route to go now.  I talk to people locally and they say that experience is more beneficial than a degree.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m65qk?context=5)|On the flip side of that, I have never declined a qualified and ready internal candidate based on a lack of formal education. The work you demonstrate speaks volumes. I would try to move to a few more day shifts. Night auditors have a hard time receiving the recognition they deserve. It's hard to evaluate their performance and promote accordingly.
[Would you recommend going back to school for the degree, possibly taking classes online, or stick with working full time and using experience as a leverage?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11fxzp/iama_seasoned_hotel_executive_who_has_spent_the/c6m65qk?context=5)|I usually feel that after 3 years someone should be up for promotion if they're performing well. It sounds like you're due. :) Maybe a talk with your manager about areas of opportunity and where you're currently doing well would help.

I had a guest once insist that I move the two queen sized beds out of his room and bring in two kings, instead. I tried every trick in my bag to make him happy in a way that did not include dismantling the beds that were attached to the walls... He fought me for hours. Days! Every time he saw me he got aggressive. He complained about the river not being high enough, the bushes being too green, the windows being too small. He was making me crazy. So, when he'd call needing something like towels or something... I was never in a big hurry.

The idea is that for every dollar you spend at one of their hotels, they'll reward you with ""points"", or in some cases airline miles. Those points can later be redeemed for free night stays, free stuff, or vacations. That varies a bit by loyalty program, but they all operate on roughly the same premise. The programs are always completely free to join, and the more loyal you are, the more goodies you get. You'll move up levels and get more perks (free upgrades, free drink/breakfast vouchers, free newspaper delivered to your door, free wifi, etc). If you're a person who frequently needs late check-outs, they're really valuable. That's a fairly universal perk offered to almost all levels. There's no reason not to join, honestly.

 |Good instincts. Feel free to start sharing your insight on any situations you may be involved in. 
 |Always act with 100% integrity. Inspire your coworkers to follow suit. Never get caught being a gossip or bitching about work conditions.

Job B is with a company that provides web-based solutions related to health care, basically working with Java and databases and MVC frameworks.  I have lots of experience doing the kind of work that Job B would require and none, outside of my internship, that has prepared me for Job A.  My natural inclination is to go with Job B, but I don't want to rule out Job A simply because I have never done that kind of low level work before.  It could be interesting.  Since I'm open to both kinds of work, I guess what I would like to know is what kind of development would be best for my future career?  Embedded systems development or server side applications and MVC development?  What sorts of skills would be valued in the next 10+ years.

I do have some questions though, and if anyone on here is able to answer them it is much appreciated.

I am in Ontario, Canada and there is a program at Northern College for an additional year where you learn specifically about being a wildlife technician.

If anyone has done this schooling, or even continuing education for this field, does it help? Or do you still essentially learn a lot hands on at the job?

Is there a large difference between this Northern program and CE courses? Or courses through [OWREN](http://www.owren-online.org/)

Does anybody know any good volunteer abroad programs?

Details:
I am a graduate student, and I don't make very much money during the school year. Over the summers, I usually work as an intern for a major corporation in my field. This allows me to save money for the school year and buy nice things that I can't afford on my graduate stipend alone.

The monthly pay rate of these internships is approximately what an entry level employee at the company would make (minus benefits). In the past, the companies have never asked me anything about my salary expectations. As soon as I would get approved for the internship, I would receive a standard offer letter. I have always just accepted this  offer, assuming all interns get the same pay.

This year, for the first time, I am planning on returning to a company where I have already done an internship, and I would like to negotiate for a higher salary this time around. I consider myself slightly above entry level at this point (many of the actual entry level employees at this company are less experienced than I am). Also, if I left school now, I could probably get a full-time position with the same company for higher pay, plus benefits.

How do you think I should approach this? Would the first step be to ask the recruiter if she would be willing to negotiate? "

I will have gone two weeks without PMO, despite having spent the majority of my time at home in my room (when I wasn't out job-hunting). I've also got a job interview for an internship abroad, so woo!

Previous attempts would have me fail in the middle of the second week - so I know I have to be extra vigilant these next few days.

I went to a house party this weekend. Met a cute girl and engaged my normal drunken life of the party self which usually gets the interest of at least one pretty girl for some time at least... Well I kissed her, and she took me up to her room to 'roll another joint'. 

I knew the implication of this (so did the rest of the room) but once up there I never made a move. I blamed this (in my mind) on being 'out of state' from having already had a couple of joints on top of the booze. But the reality is that I have no sexual confidence from my previous embarrassing experiences with ED caused from excessive masturbation. The thought of sex with a woman terrifies me because although I have had good experiences too, the ones dominating my mind at the moment are the negative ones, and I didn't want to risk the feeling of ED - I couldn't trust my body to perform.

I realise this is pretty fucked up, as I am basically self-sabotaging on something that I have been down about not getting for a while. But it forces me to acknowledge that I am not getting laid as a direct result of the lasting effects PMO has had on me. That I have to eradicate that habit from my life, or continue to suffer, with only myself to blame. I actually edged the day after thinking about how that night could have gone better. Pretty stupid, but I managed to reel myself back in, which I've never managed before. My previous attempts have failed so quickly as I've never really been committed to them or taken them as seriously as I should, but I really feel confident

On a slightly lighter note, fuck wet dreams. I don't even remember the dreams any more, just get woken by that sticky sensation, often in the middle of the night. Can't wait for those to subside a bit.

I'm a computer person. Been programming for a while but I'll be working at an eyeglass store until I find an internship. Still in college.

When I read, it is usually fantasy. I like R.A. Salvator. Drizzt remains my favorite character. The Ender series is also great.

I used to watch a lot of anime growing up. Now-a-days I watch a show every once in a while.

I ride a KLR650 everywhere and don't own a car. If anyone can manage to make that not look so cool it's me. I ride all gear all the time.

I also live with my parents, unfortunately.

Looking for a girlfriend but friends are nice too, as I don't really have any."

I could continue on for my masters at my current school, as my professors all consider me a top student in the program, despite the 3.248 GPA, and I'd certainly get in, but that sounds absolutely MISERABLE to me. All the programs that are actually relevant to my interests are in highly competitive schools in London or NYC, though. And either way, I get kicked out of my housing the day after graduation, and I don't make enough money to save up for an apartment. 

So, AMA. I've been freaking myself out searching for grad programs all day, and I've stress-ate all the food in the house. Distractions are welcome."

I'll agree the resume doesn't look tailored for any specific thing, but that's because I'm still unsure of what I want to do. Lately I've seen my interests shift towards software, so I plan to apply for mainly software engineering internships, but I am also enjoying my embedded systems, and computer vision classes.

I originally had housing secured, -  I was originally planning on a relatively cheap sublet in a 3-br in Ukrainian Village - but that fell through last minute. So now I'm doing the whole Craigslist thing, and its proving a bit difficult to do so remotely.

I think I need some perspective and framing, because I'm still somewhat unfamiliar with Chicago. The internship is a full time 9-5 thing in River North, and my primary objective with housing is cost. Am I dreaming if I'm looking to find something for $450-600/mo (utilities included) that is relatively accessible in terms of getting downtown? I know it is a bit of a weird time to get into a lease, and ideally, I'd like to find a sublet from November to April/May. I've already been religiously using the resources in the 'Moving to Chicago' post, and I'm not finding much in my price range. I'm in the process of reaching out to everyone I know in my network who is in Chicago.

Can anybody suggest what my best bet is at this point? Are there particular places/neighborhoods in which I should be looking? What can I expect or hope for given my price range?

Edit: Thanks so much for everybody's help - I've got a lot more leads now. For clarification, I'm more than willing to live with roommates - I was in fact planning on it. I'm just looking for the best place to find sublets/extant leases with people currently looking for a roommate "

I was an intern for Disney World during the fall of 09. I was out there for 6 months working as a 'merchantainer' in TomorrowLand at the Magic Kingdom.

I knew how to handle federal paperwork, write loan authorizations, do independent audits, prepare loan files for review, handle client disputes, and could tell whether or not a business was going to make it by the time I was 15.  I was also tech support for about 30 of my dad's clients, and made a good bit of money on the side doing it.

I also ran a horse/goat breeding farm almost singlehandedly since I was 13, so I've dealt with heavy amounts of research, marketing and sales.

Now I'm 21, in college, looking for something part time around my area.  I'm a technical communication (art and science of communicating an idea) and international studies double major.  None of my experience is in retail, or any traditional student job.

I've had four different places in two months say that I was overqualified, I guess because they thought I'd ask for too much money.  I freelance in social media, which is ok money, but I'd really like to find a good part time marketing/social media/writing position around here.  Four people I know who are completely inexperienced were hired for those positions over me.  They all worked at Walmart in electronics.

Several said that part of the problem was me taking two years off after a semester of college when I had to come back home and help run the family business/farm full time.  I had two years of work experience, they were looking for almost none.

I am also having a hell of a time with internships.  I've already had one this summer that was paid.  Now I'm looking for something next summer (yes, some are already open, but I'm mostly asking around random areas of the country, want to get out of my geographical area).  I've probably sent out 30 emails, about 20 of those were returned, and about 15 said no because I had too much experience.  The other 5 said to contact them in December.

I'm at a loss.  I thought experience was a good thing?  Am I just looking in all the wrong places?  My resume plays up my experience at a college radio station (I've been chief engineer and music director), instead of the places they claim I'm overqualified in. (Can post it if anyone is interested in looking)

**tl;dr - Family business and farm experience makes 21 year old ""overqualified""**"

He moved a while back for internship, and works 70 hour weeks, so it can be hard on him. Because of his crazy schedule, visiting is pretty limited and we've only seen each other once since he left, so I feel like the gifts I send are pretty important.

Recently I went all out and made a huge Halloween themed present, with candy and glow sticks and little costume props. It was awesome. But the postal service lost my package. I am so upset, Reddit. I spent so much time to try to make Halloween special for my SO and now he wont get anything. I knew if anyone would understand this frustration, I would find them here.

11glr0,0,2012-10-14,I feel apathetic about... lots of things. Is there something wrong with me?,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/11glr0/i_feel_apathetic_about_lots_of_things_is_there/,"Some background info: I'm 19, in college, no job (I do want one, just hard to find right now). 

So I don't even really know how to begin this. I'm studying to become a network engineer, don't know what specific direction I want to take yet but I'm sure I'll figure it out. I want to do well in school, if I put in the effort now I'll reap the benefits of it later in life. But I just can't be bothered. I don't really know why. I'm pretty lazy I guess. 

Same with finding a job. I quit my job in september of 2011 because I had to do a fulltime internship, which ended last febuary. Since then I haven't found a job, but I also haven't been looking that hard. Why? Meh. Can't really be bothered. 

I'm a bit overweight. Nothing too terrible, just chubby. It used to bother me more than it does now, but I'd still like to lose weight. I've tried on 4 seperate occasions, the most successful attempt resulted in me losing 10 kilos but putting them back on in a month or two after I stopped being bothered. Haven't gotten far after that. I just can't really be bothered. I bought some running shoes last November, so almost a year ago. I have used them twice now. I just can't be bothered to go running. I have judo once a week, but I often don't go because I don't feel like it. It's not even like I do anything productive instead. I just sit at home and play video games, skype with some internet friends or listen to music (pretty big music nerd).

I feel like I should go out more often, I don't hang out with my friends too much and as a result I don't have very many close friends. I've got enough friends I guess, but more and closer friends can't hurt. I really should hang out with them more often but usually when I try to hang out I don't really try that hard, and often just kind of let it go. Meh.

I'm not really motivated to do all too much. Most of my free time is spent listening to music, playing video games, watching TV shows/movies and that kind of stuff. I just feel really apathetic about lots of stuff and it's keeping me from being who I really want to be. I was talking to someone a couple of days ago about how I've never really had to take any risks and I've always been in a really 'safe' environment. I really don't like coming out of my comfort zone. It's one of the reasons that I don't have a job yet and don't go out too much. 

So... I guess I'm looking for advice here? People with similar experiences? I'd really like to change but I'm holding myself back.

edit: I should add that I don't really feel depressed or anything. I'm pretty happy and cheerful, and pretty much always in a good mood."
11gkb7,23,2012-10-14,"How do you guys balance yoga with high-stress, time-consuming lifestyles?",wordtothemotherbird,yoga,https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/11gkb7/how_do_you_guys_balance_yoga_with_highstress/,"I recently went through a really troubling, dark period of my life. My ex and I had been together for four years in an unhealthy relationship where we were essentially recluses, and it all ended with him trying to take his own life. Without yoga I could not have had the strength to get through transitioning back into ""normalcy"". I started practicing about a year ago today. Since the ""event"", yoga has kept stress at bay and kept my self confidence up. I practiced nearly 6 or 7 times a week, and became really close to my yoga studio (which also provided therapeutic reiki healings). Part of my transition was moving away and entering graduate school and bettering myself academically so I can move forward with a career that will make me happy. Now I feel like I'm drowning in academic commitments, and I stopped practicing regularly about two months ago. I definitely feel it physically and emotionally. But grad school is only temporary and I keep pushing off getting back into my yoga practice with the excuse, ""well, once I'm done with school I'll have more time. School is the priority, second comes establishing the social connections that I lost when I was with my ex. Yoga can wait""

Sorry to ramble, but the point here is: how do you all balance getting in your yoga practice with all of your other daily obligations? I was working only part time over the summer and had the time to throw myself into a daily hour and a half practice. But what do you guys do when you're balancing kids, school, work, internships, social commitments, etc? How do you prioritize? And for those of you who have fallen out of practice, or moved to a new area where the yoga studios are relatively inaccessible, how have you gotten back into regular practice? I used to lament a day without yoga, now I'm lucky if I get a sun salutation once a week.

I feel as though my confidence in myself and my practice is waning, and I confess I do fear that I will lose yoga as a part of my identity and self-healing. "

11gh2b,74,2012-10-14,[FR] Seducing an Alpha Turkish girl.,foreignsexualrel8ns,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/11gh2b/fr_seducing_an_alpha_turkish_girl/,"World traveler here. 

I just spent two weeks in Istanbul and met a Turkish HB8 at the club. I danced with her for a bit and then handed her my phone. She knew what to do and put in her phone number. 

I bounced from the club 5 minutes later as it was 4AM.  

The next day....  

&gt;M: I was thinking about robbing a bank before I leave Istanbul for some extra money. I need a get away driver. How are your motorcycle driving skills?

&gt;H: Not good at all, motorcycles scare me to death. But who is this?

&gt;M: The part time bank robber you gave your number to at the club last night. No rides on my moto for you then!

&gt;H: Robbing banks is not as much fun as it used to be. And what is your name? This is no use.

&gt;M: True. Identity theft is way more fun. I would be a lousy robber if I told you my name! Jk. foreignsexualrel8ns from California.

&gt;H: Oh u r xxxx's friend. Now everything makes more sense :)

&gt;M: I should have kept you wondering ;-). Come get some coffee.

&gt;H: I m not leaving my apartment today even if there is an earthquake, i promised myself :) i m dead tired; working, travelling, going out at nights.

&gt;M: Promises are made to be broken.
    

An hour later....
    

&gt;M: Well I can say on my deathbed that I asked an attractive Turkish girl to coffee :-) . See you in the club next year!

&gt;H: Haha that is amazing :) you said u r leaving soon right?

&gt;M: Thanks I try. Hehe. I leave tomorrow for a looooong moto ride.

&gt;H: Where to? Sounds interesting.

&gt;M: Igoumenitsa Greece with some stops along the way at ancient Greek ruins. Then a ferry to Venice and finally to my apartment in Croatia for a last month in Europe.

&gt;H: Wow, sounds amazing. It ll sure be fun. But u live in istanbul normally or just visiting?

&gt;M: Employee meeting. Back. I don't really have a home anymore. I guess I spend the most time in xxxxx though.

&gt;H: What do you do btw?

&gt;M: Dolphin trainer.

&gt;H: Alright then.haha

&gt;M: I own a software company. But I would rather be a Dolphin Trainer for sure. And you? Lion tamer?

&gt;H: Siberian tiger ^^ well actually i m juggling my masters degree, thesis project, and a hardcore internship. I m at the foreign news department of xxxxx, maybe you ve heard.

&gt;M: Sigh..I always pick the stupid girls. Hahaha. Impressive.

&gt;H: Hahah i try :)

&gt;M: A shame we will have to get coffee next year.

&gt;H: It is, really :) you shouldnt have been leaving, istanbul is amazing :)

&gt;M: I think the world is conspiring to make me stay longer. xxxx invited me to his show Wednesday, a free place to stay just arrived...

&gt;H: :) great! Who wants to leave Istanbul, i dont get it :)

&gt;M: Also. What is your name? I can't hear a damn thing in the club because I ruined my hearing DJing.

&gt;H: Good god, why is everybody dj'ing nowadays. Haha. My name is HB8, HB8 Turkish is the full version :)

&gt;M: I was DJing before any of these new guys ;-) . I have the record collection to prove it. I like the very Turkish name.

&gt;H: My name is so typical turkish, it is the second most used female name :) but my last name sounds amazingly weird in turkish.

&gt;M: It looks like I will stay. Lets get coffee tomorrow.

&gt;H: Actually we could do that. I get off of work at around 7, if nothing comes up.

&gt;M: See you then.

The next day....

&gt;M: I am heading to Taksim in a bit. Let me know when you're on the way.

&gt;H: Heyy, so i m still at the office. :/ but i ll leave in like half an hour. Then i ll drive home, leave my car and head to taksim. What will you be up to?

&gt;M: Eating and then executive moustache decisions.

&gt;H: Haha sounds important ^^ i ll text before i m on my way. Where should we meet?

&gt;M: It is! I must decide what to do with my moustache but I am open to employee input. I will find a good place. Not my city :-)

&gt;H: Hmm good luck :) i left the office now btw.

&gt;M: K. I am keeping it. It is to awesome to destroy :-P.

&gt;M: Meet me at Journey Cafe.

&gt;H: K, i think i know that place. I left my place right now, today the trafic is crazy for some reason :)

&gt;M: Ok. I will wander over in 15 mins.

&gt;H: Heyy i m there :)

We have a nice date. We chat about many things and I try to keep it light and fun. I do notice that she doesn't really ask me many questions about myself though. I would ask about her family and she would not ask about mine, etc.. She plays with her hair all night and we have a nice chemistry. 

I put my arm around her as we walk to the Taxi stop and steal a somewhat awkward good night kiss. I invite her to come out again tomorrow as I am leaving Istanbul soon.

&gt;M: That was a fun night :-) . Looking forward to giving you a real kiss tomorrow.

&gt;H: I had fun too :) see the location was so unlucky for that kiss, i feel so weird kissing someone out on the street. Sorry, turkish girl moment :))

&gt;M: Hahaha. I was actually referring to being mad at myself for half assing it. Amazing how two people can have different perspectives. No street kisses. I can live with that ;-)

&gt;H: :) i got so cold btw, i was shivering in the cab, i cant imagine how cold you must have been in that t-shirt. Feels so good to be in my bed. Good night to you good sir and i ll probably see you tomorrow :)

&gt;M: Not cold. I guess I am warmed by my awesomeness. Sweet dreams good lady.

The next day....

&gt;M: Meeting xxxx for beers and then going to Wake Up Call. You should come.

&gt;H: Oh wow completely forgot about that! I just came home, dead tired :( a syrian passenger plane was forced to touch down by turkish fighter jets and hell broke loose in the news room. I dont even have energy to sleep :(

&gt;M: Sounds like the perfect time to dance your troubles away :-)

&gt;H: Oh i m dead tired :(

&gt;M: Hope you get some good sleep. I am in heaven meeting club owners and getting invited to DJ.

&gt;H: That sounds like so much fun! I just feel glued to the couch :)

&gt;M: No worries. I will have fun for both of us. I will text you tomorrow before I reach Greece. Buen suerte.

&gt;H: Talk to you tomorrow then, good night!

I decided to stay another night in Istanbul to see my freind DJ one more time. Unfortunately, the Turkish government shut my phone off due to their bullshit ""terrorist"" phone laws. So, I texted her from a friends phone the next morning.

&gt;M: Hey! It is xxxxx. xxxx invited me to his show tonight at Kasette. You should come check it out. My phone got shut off by the government but you can email me at asds@asdsa.com

&gt;H: I think I am going out tonight so I will email you later :).

I checked for an email a few times throughout the day and got nothing. So, I got some pre-clubbing sleep and checked my email one last time before heading to the club at 1AM. She had sent me this email at 12:30AM:

&gt;H: hey i m at the kasette, i wont stay for long, will u be here?

I think to myself, WTF. What is the point of emailing me once you are already at the club? I decide not to respond to the email. I have already asked this girl out many times and she is controlling the scheduling and it is making me look needy. If she can't be bothered to email me in a timely manner I need to say 'Fuck it' and focus on having a kick as time. If she is still there when I arrive, good. If not, her loss.

I arrive at the club and I am just Alphaing the shit out of it. Five different local people give me high fives on the way into the club. The DJ pulls me into the booth and we greet each other and talk about things. I am feeling pretty damn good and it is a rare moment of being the top dog. I am hoping that she sees this display of awesomeness but sadly she is not there.

I borrow a friends phone and text her to see if maybe she is at a nearby bar or something.

&gt;M: Hey! It is xxxxxx. I saw your email and arrived at the club. Looks like I just missed you.

&gt;H: You did! I was tired anyways. Have fun :)


I proceed to have an awesome last night in Istanbul partying with my new local friends. The next day I leave and head towards Greece.

I am often stuck in this position and it always confuses me greatly. I need to show a girl that I am interested but it is constantly ME that is making the requests for meetups.

If I ignore her, I will probably never hear from her again. If I send her the typical 'I hope I see you again' email I am letting her yet again control the interaction. Maybe someday I will figure out how to handle these situations like a boss.

I think I am going to let this one go. If I see her again, I see her again.

It is a big world out there guys. 

Go and seize it!"

I looked into internships and all the companies want someone with two years of uni completed.

How does this happen?",SweetMuffin,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/11gaxx/i_keep_reading_that_i_dont_need_to_go_to_school/,"I'm really excited about going to this film program at a local community college because one way or another, I know it will help me get into creating films, however, I've been reading online in many posts that there is a way to get around school. Which would be very nice on my pocket since I've been working on minimum. 

I've looked for internships and haven't found any for a couple of months, and when I do they just ask me to work for free and to have my own gear... Which I don't really have except some cheap lighting and a crap digital camera and tripod. 

I also live in the middle of nowhere so most of the films I have are landscape or of myself so I don't have any experience. Along with not having any artsy friends to be adventurous with. I did take a crap film course at another college, so I know the basics and different editing programs and such, so I do understand the long random hours, hard work and hassle that goes into filming.

I'd really love to just jump right into the industry and shit myself and get over it rather than going to school to spend my money and find someone to send me in a direction where I will still have to jump in and shit myself.  

How does someone go about finding their way into the industry? Any suggestions on what I should do? Help me out please. I'm pretty passionate in becoming apart of your world. But I'm just an ignorant baby right now who needs help."
11g5w1,3,2012-10-14,just bummed.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11g5w1/just_bummed/,"had a pretty good day.  worked a temp job where they seemed to like me last week, and working stimulates my mind and confidence.  its not permanent.  i'm low on friends these days because i spent a lot of time in a relationship that i'm not seeing much of a future anymore with.  Lately when I talk to him I just get bummed out.  

he has ocd (I mention that to illustrate that he's emotionally remote through no fault of his own--as if that mattered).  we've both been unemployed for over a year but he's had a harder time finding work.  We both had bad attitudes about work but i've been working actively on changing my situation while he seems to just stay stuck in his idea that anyone who earns money through ""the corporate world"" (translation:  killing your soul to work for ""the man"") is evil, stupid, detestable, uninteresting, bland, and just wrong.  On a deep level I've always felt similarly due to my being one of those right-brained people who no one could really reach, and I was also specifically victimized by the left-brainers even though I do have tendencies to operate left-brained naturally to a certain degree. I've always ridden the fence naturally...I knew I was different, but I also knew that I fit in.  My boyfriend never fit in, through no fault of his own, and also had no guidance.  I know that for the most part, right-brainers generally end up as the outcasts, the geeks, the socially lame...and get picked on by the jar-headed conservative frat-boy/sorority girl pack.  At least in my generation.  

I took a different path after college--which I never wanted to go to anyway, I was forced to by my parents, so I didn't study hard and never found anything I was interested in or good at.  I traveled and then became a musician thinking I would succeed at that.  Now I'm 44 and temping. I still think I can succeed musically because I've had some success that I can build on in my past, but I'm going through a creative dead spot that may never end, and it's pretty late in the game, right?   Never meant to be an admin, but didn't know what else to do, couldn't figure it out, had no guidance and had no one interested in helping me find it.  But I see now a different sort of person in certain workplaces than I have in the past.  I see young people right out of college who are forward-thinking, and smart.  Yes, they are deeply entrenched in the corporate system, meaning they went straight through high school honors programs into an ivy league school, tons of activities, internships, into a good entry-level job, on up the ladder...they are everything I fought against becoming when I was that age....but they have more than the people I grew up with.  They are 21-23 years old and have skills I couldn't have even IMAGINED having at that age.  They look like the quintessential left-brainers I grew up with, but they don't appear to be the jar-heads I knew growing up --the jar-heads who harrassed me relentlessly growing up, even going as far as to harrass me about being molested/raped by one of them -- who never had to answer for it, because he was in the IN crowd --no wonder I avoided anything that looked like them like the plague, right?.    These new people I see are bright, perceptive, they have depth and breadth of mind; they are inexperienced but that's ALL they lack--their present and future lives are all but guaranteed to go swimmingly well.  I'm impressed with them -- perhaps a little over-impressed-- but it is what it is.  I took a different path from them--for better or worse-- and I am who I am.  I wouldn't trade it...I *get* a few more things now-- I *get* why / how I made my choices, and they're not bad or wrong, but I see now how I made choices that put me at certain disadvantages, simply because I didn't know things.   Nobody's fault, and I wouldn't change anything, but I know I KNOW I can learn so much from the people I'm in contact with now, these young turks who have their shit together.  

Boyfriend not so much. He is stuck in resentment of those people who hurt him growing up, and I don't blame him for his feelings, but I am getting tired of the lack of insight on his part.  I am frustrated with the black &amp; white thinking, with the way he blames everyone but himself for his challenges, they way he feels sorry for himself because he has to work a minimum - wage job and blahblahblah and how he just wants to beat up some arrogant rich yuppy who so richly deserves it, obviously.  I just can't do anything with this attitude anymore.  I just don't know what to do anymore.  I know we all have to evolve in our own time and I get sad and depressed when I talk to him these days.  And, I vascillate between being excited about possibilities for my own future, and being depressed that I fucked up so much in my past and have had such a difficult life so far, and that at how 44 is such a late place to be starting to enjoy life (if I ever truly could), and it appears that I may have to do that alone.  I know I just spoke to him and it stimulated some depression listening to him vent about how how he had to be on the phone with comcast for umpteen hours because they're falsely charging him for something and it's making him bounce his rent checks and other things that, to me, I'm just tired of hearing about.  THESE things are his challenges?? Really?  Seriously??  He's 44 too, when does he grow up and out of this shit??  

HEre's where I say to myself ""Ah, just drop it for tonight, and don't worry about it, it will blow over"".   But I'm saying that a lot these days...and I'm pretty lonely. Im just fucking sick of my disjointed, under-achiever, self-sabotaging life."

Any groups that I previously had access to where I could interact and practice with others using Japanese have basically fallen apart or moved away and I don't really know where I should go from here.

One was today, another will happen on Wednesday.

The interview today went *okay*. I was given a fairly straightforward algorithm question related to strings, and I got the most time efficient algorithm immediately, which I could tell the interviewer liked. Made a couple stupid mistakes due to nerves (i.e. != null instead of == null) but generally everything was good on that one. PROBLEM: she asked me, after I wrote that, to make it more *space* efficient. I totally blanked and she had to move on to the next question. :( It was so easy, and of course the solution occurred to me right after the interview but it's too late now.

The 2nd question was related to OO design, and I struggled with that one initially because of all the variables in the problem (it turned out to be the interviewer's work a month prior) and didn't actually finish it due to running out of time, but she said she ""saw where I was going with it, and it was good"" or something along those lines.

So yeah. Mixed feelings overall. I don't feel I totally failed but I'm unsure about it overall. Has anyone had an interview like this for an internship at Amazon and then went on to kill the 2nd interview and get the job? Any tips to share?

I don't have any other debt and I don't have any savings. Through an internship I did while studying, I have managed to secure myself a job starting February 2013 with a salary of $49,500 of which $2,542 will automatically be deducted for the loan repayment. 2% of my salary will also go towards my superannuation and will be matched by my employer. Based on the budget I have, I will be able to (conservatively) save $12,000 per year. 

My father has told me to put all of my savings towards the student loan and pay it off as quickly as possible but to me paying off an interest free loan as soon as possible doesn't make sense. Are there any pros to my fathers line of thinking? Should I just put all of my money in my savings account (3.15%pa) or are there other investment options I should consider?

**tl;dr at bottom**


Almost everything that I read always mentioned that family kicked them out, or at least weren't too pleased with them being trans. Because of this, I put it back on my mind and tried to live a normal male life. It ended up not working, and I had to do something and move forward with accepting myself as trans, and eventually transitioning.

Anyway, cut to the good part: yes, there were some troubles with myself regarding transition, but overall everything has been just fine. I got my letter okay-ing HRT, and found a doctor (who didn't even need the letter) to prescribe me hormones...all while in a smaller, more conservative city.

About a month or so after I started HRT, I sent a letter to my mom coming out and explaining everything. She was fine with it. It took her ""about a week to have it settle, but then was fine,"" and the rest of my family were told the next couple months. 

I started laser removal on my face, not mentioning to my technician (privately operating place) I was trans. She actually knew at the beginning since she saw the meds I was on, aka hormones. She was very nice about it and legitimately wanted to help me out. I was a bit wary since I saw crosses, and she seemed religious, and again: smaller conservative city.

My mom even found a lawyer to change my name and gender ID, and only after about 3 weeks of knowing. I got that done in literally a month, and it even happened to be the day after my real birthday. Awesome!

I came out to my work (University on campus job, so a bit more open), since I was starting full time much sooner than originally planned, and needed to find out if I had to find a new place or not. Everyone was fine with it. My name still slips, but that's expected.

Starting the new semester as my true self made me really nervous and anxious, but no one really batted an eye at me. People in classes don't say/point me out or anything. Anyone I pass walking through campus hasn't made any rude remarks.

I've been told I pass well (I just never see it), but my voice still doesn't really. Even when I do talk to new, random people...I get nothing negative. Sometimes I get a little confused or curious look, but nothing harmful.

All my family now knows, and most took it way better than I thought they would. A couple of them mentioned that they wouldn't really think twice about having the *girl name* in the family in a few years. (We don't see each other often) They just want me to be happy, along with my parents.

All the friends I have come out to over the years have no problem with it. Even ones I knew long ago, and a couple that I didn't talk to very much. They all just said it's up to me, that I shouldn't feel ashamed about anything, and wish me to be happy. Some of them even knew something was up with me and knew that something wasn't quite right about the guy me. Once I told them they said it made a whole lot more sense to them.

Most recently, I went to the Career Fair for my college, and was quite nervous about showing myself and speaking to them. I got two interviews for an internship, one of which the recruiter said was ""highly competitive."" None of the interviewers I talked to seemed to look at me any different than any other person. 


Well that's my shortened (lol) story. Of course, I still know that there will be someone who doesn't agree with me, and will treat me like shit....but that's why I am careful and have a stun gun on me just in case. I might take this down if I start feeling nervous or if it doesn't do it's purpose.

11ivrq,8,2012-10-15,Positive response from Google but low GPA. Looking for advice.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11ivrq/positive_response_from_google_but_low_gpa_looking/,"First, thank you for reading. I think that my problem is specific enough to warrant a new thread, I couldn't find anything too similar when I searched atleast. 


Here's my situation:

Google arranged an Internship Interview Workshop (obviously to also recruit) for 14 students where I live (Stockholm, Sweden) and they came to our school to urge us to apply.

I sent in my CV (resume) and waited.

I got a response where they said that unfortunately they could not invite me to the workshop, they referenced the fact that the competition was strong and that there were a lot of applicants.

But they also told me that they were impressed with the quality of my application and they asked me to apply at their website (I hope this response wasn't automated). So far so good.


The problem is that I only submitted my CV which contained information on previous employment and personal projects but I did not list my GPA which is around 2.6-2.9.

So what of these should I do?:

* Should I avoid the GPA question at all costs until a potential interview? Though in the link below you will see that there is a field for GPA. 

* Should I write a carefully worded cover letter that explains how I have focused on my projects rather than on getting high grades in my courses? (As university is free I can more easily defend my belief that I should spend my time both learning in school and learning by doing.)

* Should I skip the cover letter altogether? I think I've read a blog post by Steve Yegge regarding this.  

* Something else?


Additionally: This is my second year studying computer science, since I have only completed courses from my first year there was only one programming course, the rest were math and general engineering subjects (Perhaps it's too early to apply?). Even though my grades are low I am very confident in my ability and knowledge.

(On the off chance that anyone replying is from Sweden: how much have your grades mattered when looking for jobs? Currently there isn't even a proper conversion table for GPA, is grade averages ever talked about outside of foreign companies?)


This is what their application site looks like for interns: [Long link](http://www.google.com/jobs/application/application_student?loc=us&amp;action=add&amp;job=2013%20Software%20Engineer%20Intern%20-%20Multiple%20European%20Locations%20Available)

As you can see, they would also like a transcript, though it is optional.


Thanks again for your input. (I do realise that my GPA might hinder me terribly but I'll atleast give this a try.)"

11ib21,7,2012-10-15,"The road from Fine Art  to Graphics Design, some careers input would be great!",shiko098,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/11ib21/the_road_from_fine_art_to_graphics_design_some/,"Greetings /r/graphics_design!

First of all id like to say thank you all for some of your posts on here, i have been following graphics_design for quite some time now and i have picked up so many handy tips, and discovered some nice new resources because of you guys and girls.

First of all i would like to give you all some background as to how i have arrived where i am, 19 years of age i went back to college and started to study for a National Diploma in Art and Design. During the 2 year duration on this college course i remember first sparking my interest in Graphics Design, and i remember learnings the ins and outs, and the basics of graphics design, we started very traditionally using pen and paper techniques, learning basic typography, compositional, and colour do's and donts etc (very basic stuff) as well as being introduced to Adobe Design Suite. I remember at the time i fell sick, and i was sat in a doctors surgery and littered around the room were a couple of large notice boards swamped with posters, and leaflets (im sure all you designers out there know where this is going) but yes, i sat there and i remember wanting to gouge my own eyeballs out, id never seen such a large array of terribly designed posters, and literature, with hideous font choices, and gradients that made you feel like you just had acid thrown into your eyes. This is when i decided to ponder a journey into the world of graphics design, the Art and Design course i was doing however, was very diverse, it wasn't just design based areas, but looking into traditional art skills such as painting, ceramics, photography, printmaking, 3d design, and pretty much every area in between. At the age of 19 and being as enthusiastic about all the subjects i was doing, when it came to deciding what i wanted to do at university was a really tricky decision for me. I went through college adoring every aspect of the course to the case i pushed every subject and left with a straight set of 'Distinctions' which for everyone outside the UK, is the highest attainable grade for the course.

So back then at the end of that course i was 20, utterly engrossed in every subject i was doing at college, and of course when moving to university i wanted to choose something a little bit diverse, something that would allow me to try just about anything i wanted to do because at the time i had little focus on a set career path. This lead me to choosing 'Fine Art', i made this decision due to the nature of the course being very explorative, it was a three year degree that allowed me to create my own work, using whatever mediums i desired, whether it was painting, sculpture, video, installation, printmaking, the lot. Whilst some people found being kicked into a studio and told to just work without any kind of brief scary, i found that concept so exciting in my earlier years cause it allowed me to expand into areas i hadn't tried before. But to cut a long story short, during the duration of my degree, i tried pretty much everything, but fairly early on in the course i soon began to realise my roots and my calling. It seemed like my work had naturally progressed into the digital illustration side of things, and to finish my degree, my exhibition consisted of a huge poster display of very silly and pun ridden work, often taken inspiration from advertising, internet culture, world news, in essence it was a cocktail of bright colours, silly cartoons, and a bit of fun. The reception of the display was very warm, i had a lot of people enjoy the display, laughing at the puns, and i even went on to sell quite a large deal of the posters to viewers. 

So i finished my degree with a 2.1, which while is not a first class, i was happy enough with considering the demographic of tutors at my art school, who favoured the more over pretentious style (yes i saw a lot of lone bricks on plinths) I am now sat here looking back at my path, and treasuring everything i learnt, but i cannot help but be a little frustrated that i did not specialise and choose a degree a little more focused. But none the less, my learning has taught me this one fact - Graphics Design, and Illustration have been my two greatest allies along the way, i am now 24, and it is time for me to get serious and put my skills into action. 

At the moment i am currently seeking for internships, and junior roles that might be suitable for someone with my skill sets, in order for me to learn the ropes of the trade correctly. However jumping onto that first step is something i could do with a little advice on, positions for these types of posts are horrendously difficult to attain in my area at the moment, with even the really junior, and internship roles requiring previous experience and extensive knowledge.

This has lead me to believe unpaid work experience could be the best and only way for me to progress, since going back to university is just not an option due to the expense the question is, what do you suggest would be the best way to go about approaching an employer for a bit of work experience?

I assume a good portfolio would also be a very good idea before approaching these job roles, what kind of content, and how much would you like to see in a portfolio for someone looking for a trainee role? 

I would love any kind of advice or input on the matter, because so far i have had a lot of sleepless nights trying to figure out where to start with things to get me on the road.

Thanks for your time folks, i really appreciate it!"
11iaqz,0,2012-10-15,"Most important decision of my academic/professional life: Master of Public Affairs, MBA, or PhD?",MPAorMBAorPHD,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/11iaqz/most_important_decision_of_my/,"Not sure if this is the right place... but I need some advice please.

I'm an American, 26-year-old male, happily married and gainfully employed, but heavily in debt and *lost* career-wise.

For various reasons 3 years ago I made a choice to get an M.Phil. in Religious Dialogue from a major European University.  I got good grades, made great connections -- it was the best experience of my life and I would do it again in a heartbeat.

My American public school humanities BA was also funded with debt, and lots of it.  But the debt never seemed like a problem because I was always good at building websites.  I am employed at present in a role which borders on web development and marketing, making a salary which (barely) can support my wife and myself, while she goes back to professional graduate school in the health sciences.  I have worked since my college internship in the same small company, and I could see myself leaving in a year to try to build a career in either client management or internet marketing... if I weren't so bored with it.

Long story short, I have always been interested in religious dialogue and conflict.  (In my mind, this is the most important question of our age.)  For years I assumed I would get a **PhD**, but the jobs for religious studies professors are few and far between, and tenure-track positions seem to be incredibly rare.  Plus, a PhD is a 6-year process probably.  My wife and I are close to our family, and after graduation I don't want us to end up in a tiny college in the middle of nowhere, where I'm lucky to have an adjunct position.  Even still, this admissions cycle I have reached out to a number of top-tier religious studies programs and professors in the US, and they seem interested in my proposed thesis topic.

In recent months though I've had the idea to pursue another Masters, this time in a **Master of Public Affairs**, focusing on International Affairs.  This way I could study international geopolitical (and religious) conflicts throughout the world, perhaps focusing on Eastern European/Caucasian conflict centers.  I'm very excited about 2 years of studying such a topic, but very anxious about the career placement.  MPAs by definition usually get jobs in government, and again, my wife and I want to remain relatively local, and aren't thrilled about moving to DC forever.  Some MPAs do find work in the private sector, but I'm not sure if they do so in international affairs.  And if I'm just going to get a job in marketing, I might as well continue as an internet marketer, without going back to school!

Finally, there's the **MBA**, which offers a chance to stay local in my city of choice, studying in a couple of ranked national programs; both provide a part-time option, which might allow us to pay for it as I go.  The financial benefits are obvious, but it seems completely contrary to my childhood dreams of being involved in religious studies, or my adult dreams of working towards achieving religious dialogue.  BUT, if I got my MBA in International Business, maybe I could jump on board with a multinational company and focus on international development, or work as a consultant with expertise in European conflict zones, etc.  Sure -- but how many MBAs are in it for the altruism?  I can't pretend to kid myself that I *also* would be doing it for the money.

What degree, if any, should I pursue?  It's already October and I'm falling apart.

**tl;dr: I love religious dialogue and have a major interest in international geopolitical conflict zones, but I need a lucrative career because of debt load, my wife and I don't want to move permanently for work, and I want to make an impact on the world.  I can't decide whether a PhD, MPA or MBA is right for me.**"
11iapv,2,2012-10-15,I recently found out that something that had been driving me crazy at work was a prank by my coworkers.  How can I get them back with a vengeance?,Cupcakes_4_All,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11iapv/i_recently_found_out_that_something_that_had_been/,"For the last two weeks I have had a program open at random intervals, and when I would close it, it would simply open up again a few minutes later.  Now I'm a co-op student (basically a college student doing repeating internships) so my work is pretty awful and mundane already, and this program constantly opening up was driving me off the wall!  Finally a friend heard me complaining because I couldn't figure out what was wrong, and realized that it had been a prank from some of the other co-ops.  They had set up a rule in my email that when they sent me a certain email would open the program and then immediately delete the email.  Because it was not a problem with the program, I couldn't figure out what was wrong.  There were also a few other minor and easy to figure out pranks.

Anyway, I want to get the most evil vengeance I can on these two coworkers.  They sit on the same row, but also close to me so I can't do anything smelly or I will suffer as well.  I want something that they can't easily look up a fix for (like I couldn't because the program opening wasn't the problem) and something that will drive them off the wall.

Oh, and they don't know that I learned about their prank.

Also, please don't upvote because these guys are redditors and I can't have them knowing my evil schemes.

TL;DR: Coworkers drove me crazy with a prank.  Want to get them back so well that they will know better than to invoke my wrath again."

I don't know what will happen if I get rejected everywhere. I'll be heartbroken and utterly depressed. I don't want to think about failure though, I can't imagine what will happen or what I will do.

My friends and family constantly tell me how smart and hard working I am, but I don't believe it. I acknowledge my work ethic, but I feel like a big fat phony idiot who's just waiting to be discovered, waiting for people to realize I'm not actually that smart. On the outside I appear like I have my shit together, but people don't realize how much I struggle with my life.

So I'm looking at a few internships. I have the qualifications, but I'm afraid of applying. I'm afraid of failing, having my ego destroyed even further. I'm afraid of my parents being disappointing in me. I'm afraid of my friends giving me shit for being an underachiever.

I guess the biggest problem is that I'm afraid of failing. I've been through a lot of hardships, but I've always surpassed those obstacles. But in the process my self-esteem took a massive hit to the point where I'm not sure if I can continue pushing in my current direction. The safety of mediocrity feels good for now. I WANT to succeed in life, I truly do, I'm just afraid I might not follow through with what needs to be done."
11hyyg,7,2012-10-15,"3 weeks in. Reading everyone's stories on here have helped me in the past weeks, but I want to let out everything I have built in.",[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/11hyyg/3_weeks_in_reading_everyones_stories_on_here_have/,"First off, I would just like to thank everyone in this subreddit for all the support that they give other people. Hearing other people's stories that are similar to mine, really helped me put into my own perspective and envision what to do in my own situation.

So 3 weeks ago, she broke up with me. Weeks leading up to her doing it, she was acting extremely weird. Short texts, not being her usual sweet and talkative self that she usually is. I would continually ask whats wrong, and she would just say that she was stressed from work or she was tired. I go to school 5 hours away, but usually make it back home every other weekend to see her. So I get back for my fall break, go to see her, and she is just completely distant. It was absolutely crushing me. I did everything for her. I treated her like a princess. I never did anything to hurt her and she always used to tell me that I was the best boyfriend in the world and that she was the luckiest girl in the world to have me. She told me this a week before she ended it. 

The days leading up to her breaking up with me, she told me that she wanted to make things work and that she doesn't know whats wrong with her and that she just isn't happy. Her text said something along the lines of ""I am just not happy, I have the best guy in the world, I should be happy, but I am not and it's tearing us apart."" Yeah, well after that she told me that she didn't feel the spark any more. 

I loved her. I called her beautiful everyday. I never missed a day. It tears me apart to know that I gave her everything, she admits that I am the best thing that has ever happened to her and then she does this. It hurts. 

I am completely dead, yet, I have relief as well. It's mixed feelings. I love being able to go out and do whatever the fuck I want, but I miss her to the point where its almost unbearable. I have respected the No Contact rule. Deleted her on facebook, don't text or call her, nothing. She has texted me a couple times asking questions like ""Why did you delete me off facebook?"" type shit, but I ignore it and move on with my day.

I have so much to be thankful for that I might not have if I was still with her. My entire life practically changed in these 3 weeks. I had my internship at a design firm and before I left, they offered me the lead graphic design position. That's something that wouldn't have happened because I planned on getting a place back home and working in house at Cabela's as a designer. I have a month and half of school left and I am graduated. I have amazing friends, great education, and an all around great life. I realize that I can't let this little pebble stop me from climbing to the top of the mountain. It hurts, but life goes on. 

I know my post was in a wild order. Sadness, happiness, relief. I don't fucking know, it's late and I am blabbing. But I want to let everyone on this subreddit know that I love you and thank you for all of your words of wisdom to everyone and thanks to everyone who has told their story. It will get better. 

I leave everyone with a quote that has really made me think about everything that has been going on in my life. It comes from the song ""Vipassana"" by Macklemore. 

""Take all ugly shit inside and try to make it beautiful.
Use the cement from rock bottom and make it musical."" 

It might not have any significance to some people, but to me, it has really helped.

If anyone ever needs someone to talk to, I am a great listener and will do anything to help you. I know what it's like to never have anyone to go to about this kind of stuff. I am here. I will do anything to help you. "

Im not a pro in programming but i do like it. Recently, my manager talked to me saying that i was slow and i need to speed up. I totally agree but i have some concerns. 

1- people rarely talk to each other for help so i feel like a nagging person if i keep asking question. 
2- im an electrical engineer not a programmer and its my first internship, so i thought it would be normal for me to be slow
3- when i was programming, i knew i was slow but i was afraid to bother them with a quick question  and i thought that , since im an intern, they would monitor my work and regularly tell me to speed up. But i guess i was wrong and this is the real world and i need to act as an adult now. 

Also, my friends got jobs too but not as programmers. They waste their time sitting in front of a PC. Was I lucky to get this job or did they hire the wrong person . I mean,  did they want a computer science or software guy?

I dont want to sound like i dont like the job. I love it ! But i want to know how should i feel about this situation? Right now i feel confused but ill still do anything to speed up."

I am going to be graduating in the spring with a degree in EE from a university not really well known outside of the local companies around here. My original plan was to apply for graduate school, but since I have not made up my mind on what I would really like to focus on (power or energy engineering, biomedical with emphasis on neuroscience or bio electricity, and nanotechnology are my most desired areas to do research in) I decided I would work first until I really knew what I wanted to do. 

This brings me to my problem. I've only had experience doing academic internships and REUs. Does anyone know how the industry views this type of experience (unfortunately my gut tells me not so favorably). I'll be trying to work outside of the local area because I'm moving, so any tips for how to land a job this way?

The combination of super heady art, and the functionality of percs, and cosmetics of the smoke's travel through tubes, it all amazes me. It inspires me. I am very keen on progressing, and am looking into taking a gap year, working, and getting a glass internship. The internship is crucial in whether i take a gap year or not. It must only be for glass. 

So my question is, does anybody know quality glass programs offering internships, or apprenticeships (ill find the $, somehow.)? I am doing my own internet searching....but would really appreciate any help, any link to any school, program, or related forum. 

This is what i want to do with my life. I know, im 17, alot of life to live, but i think i need an aspiration. My will will get me there, i just need the goal. And this is it. Anyone reading this still, i will be big, i just need the chance. "

where i live now, i can take community college classes and/or get an A.S. in accounting. there's a university which offers the bachelor's and a certificate (with online and on campus options.) i have not yet contacted them but a second bachelor's may be very doable. then there are master's programs; there are not any in my area that meet in person. new england college has what appears to be an amazing online master's program with a new specialization in forensic accounting, but i'm concerned that an online degree won't afford me the internship and networking opportunities that seem really important. on the other hand, online accounting programs are not rare so students are managing somehow. 

i could also apply to other master's programs in the country for non-accounting graduates and shell out a ton of money to move and live there, but the school debt (which i have plenty of already) would likely be outrageous. it sounds like some people do okay if they just take the necessary accounting courses and get their CPA. but having no accounting degree seems a bit risky to me (correct me if i'm wrong - i just worry how this would look on my resume.) i also don't have any work experience which is needed for the CPA anyway.

At one of my current jobs however, I've managed to turn that around and have made excellent connections with everyone there. However, I am applying for a new job which requires 3 references, and 2 of the 3 I used are from my current job, and one from an internship I had 3 years ago where I was pretty close to someone above me, though not a manager, and who no longer actually works there. She agreed to be my third reference, but now when it's time to be contacted, she can't be found anywhere and I'm at a loss to find a third professional reference. 

I should note I have a second job (I currently work part-time at two jobs, trying to get just a full-time job) and although this second job would be ideal as a reference (related field) it is not an environment conducive to talking to anyone, let alone management, and I feel they know little about me in general let alone enough to praise me to someone else. 

My boyfriend is suggesting I just ask a friend to pose as the third reference, but I'm worried how extensive the background checks are as this is quite a major company I do not want to risk it. I am contemplating just asking a third person at my current part-time job #1, but am not sure if it reflects poorly on me to have references all from the same job, even if the person has moved on to work somewhere else now.

11hls0,1,2012-10-14,"Fired from internship, read/been given conflicting advice on how to handle at future interviews. Please advise.",temp6202,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/11hls0/fired_from_internship_readbeen_given_conflicting/,"Second post on this topic in this throwaway account. Fired last week from my first job out of college, a paid internship originally set for 6 months. I made some mistakes, tried to work on my weak spots, but didn't figure it out fast enough, and was let go somewhat unexpectedly. I'm not sure how to go about explaining this (or if I even should) to future employers. I've applied for lots of jobs over the last week, and I've found one that fits exactly what I want to do with a company I interviewed with before I took the internship I was terminated from (turned them down because a) they wanted an in-person interview and I wasn't relocated yet as I was finishing school and b) it was for a temp spot that was even shorter than the 6 months my internship was supposed to be). It's seriously the perfect position for me, and I have tons of experience in that area and have reached out to the woman who interviewed me before, so I want to make sure that if I'm given a shot, I don't mess it up.

Here's some of the advice I've been given so far, some Reddit-sourced, some from the web, some from friends:
-say it was an internship, and it ended.
-say I was let go, I learned from my mistakes and hope for the best.
-if they don't ask, don't say anything (what I'm hoping for)
-I have another PT position in another field entirely and I start in a few weeks, but it's not enough to pay the bills/fill my time. Some have suggested saying I currently am employed with that, and not mentioning the internship except for on my resume
-taking it off my resume entirely (which doesn't work: a simple google of my name pulls up EVERYTHING I did for that internship, and it's the FIRST result. Plus I did some good work there and I want to use it)

I've also heard not to worry about future employers calling my old job about references because they have to stay within certain legal parameters and usually only confirm job title and dates of employment. Others have said they can ask about termination. I'd love to hear from a lawyer/HR manager about which is the truth/other possibilities (I'm in cali, for legal reference).

Reddit, I'm not a mistake-prone person and this is all foreign to me. I'm pretty lost in all of this and go back and forth between thinking everything will be ok to moments of incredible doubt about my skills and which jobs I'm actually qualified for now that I've been terminated. I've never been fired from anything before. In fact, I was promoted in my on-campus job during college three times, until I was top dog. I've received glowing rec's everywhere I've been/worked/interned before. I know I really fucked this one up and I'm really disappointed in myself. I just want, to put it metaphorically and dramatically, rise from the ashes and come back swinging.

TLDR; Fired from my internship, applying for new jobs in the same field, need advice on how to handle interviews/the depression&amp;disappointment that comes with being fired, particularly from an internship.

**EDIT:** I was fired the same week I signed a 1-year lease on an apartment with my BF. Level of shittyness: expert.

***EDIT 2*** I found a job! Thanks for everyone that provided advice. I'm super grateful for it. Happy to say, the ""why I left my last job"" question never came up (probably to do that handy little ""intern"" in my previous title. I've been working for a week at my two new jobs, both in my field, and I'm loving every minute! I'm definitely not religious, but I think karma works outside of Reddit too. If I hadn't of been fired, I wouldn't have found these two fantastic jobs (doing the same thing, for two different people) where I'm not only paid more, I enjoy it more. I definitely learned from the experience and I'm humbled to say it's made me a better employee. I know that mistakes can happen, and that they WILL happen at some point (nobody is perfect, especially me), but that I will give 110%, even when I don't want to, to try to prevent any mistakes. Things are really looking up :]

As for financial aid, I was in foster care so I qualify for enough grants/scholarships + Work Study to get by in addition to working part time during the school year. I was simply stupid and saw the extra loans as a blank check (I know, I know, I'm an Econ major--I should be smarter than this).

Any other tips? I lived off-campus last year and my grades suffered due to the time lost between working full-time and the long commute (as I said, the transportation is shitty).

EDIT: I will not be working my current job this summer (only on an as-needed basis), just to clarify. There are several full-time job opportunities on campus I can tap into, and by full time, I mean 50-60 hours a week for the most part. There is one I hope to get that offers free housing and a $320/wk stipend. Someone suggested doing internships, but I will not be qualified for those until next year."

How and when do I do this?,Mofaux11,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11le3x/i_m23_am_heavily_considering_breaking_up_with_my/,"So this wound up kinda being a rambling wall of text! Feel free to just read the tl;dr at the bottom, but any advice would be great.

Background: we met our freshman year in college, talked a lot and became good friends. Come fall of our sophomore year, we started dating. I found out she had never dated anyone before, never kissed anyone before, nothing. She always seemed a little timid and shy but I made it my goal to bring her out of her shell as much as possible, make her stronger, and build up her confidence. Our relationship throughout college was amazing. Our relationship grew from an extremely strong emotional connection and friendship, and I have become closer with her than I have with anyone else in my life. We always took the physical aspect of our relationship slow. This was ok with me for a little, but when I was ready for sex (about 6 months into the relationship), she wasn’t. We waited 3 years to have sex. When we finally decided to (this past March), it was because I constantly brought it up with her and how hard it was for me to have an emotional, but not fully physical relationship (we still got intimate but nothing past 3rd base). She did it for me, but if it were up to her I’m sure she would have wanted to wait even longer. Since graduating in May of 2011, we’ve been in a long distance relationship. She went abroad to Europe our junior year, and I was able to handle the 4 month long LDR pretty maturely. This made me think I would be able to handle it post-graduation.

Since then, however, it has become harder and harder for me to be an emotionally supportive boyfriend with the distance. When we first started off the LDR, there were always little milestones I could shoot for: I knew when I was going to see her again. Last fall, I took an internship in the Florida Keys and didn’t get to see her for 3 months. That was really hard, but I knew I was gonna see her after the new year. I got to see her about once a month after that, as I was unemployed and free to travel to see her. Now, I’m working a new job that is very aligned with my long-term career goals, and I’m signed up for at least a year. I’m loving it immensely, and I have the option to stay an additional year if I want. I’m heavily considering this. 

When I first got this new job, I encouraged her to look for work in the area. One of her best friends also just moved very close to where I am. She is currently living at home, working a receptionist/desk job 9-5. I told her, since her current employment situation wasn’t career-oriented, to think about looking at similar jobs around me, so we could be together, and she could be closer to her friend. She kind of refused. She wants to move out to the west coast at the end of next year, and she told me it wasn’t practical in her mind to pack up and move to find a new job if she would only be quitting and moving west at the end of next year. 

I’m starting to realize that I don’t necessarily see our futures lining up. With the nature of my current job and career path, it would be difficult to pick and choose exactly where I end up next. I kinda have to be available to different opportunities and relocations. Plus, I’m considering grad school, and with the programs I’d be interested in, I can’t exactly select whatever school is closest to her. 

With this distance, and the nature of what I want to end up doing, seeing her and being with her is going to be very inconsistent. It pretty much means I’d have to continue maintaining this long distance relationship. She kinda expects me to follow her out to the west coast come next year, but I’m hesitant to do so, and part of that is because she refused to relocate when I got this job. 

On top of this, there are a few other things that I wish I could change, but I don’t believe will. Like I said earlier, she is pretty shy and timid. I’m a bit more socially outgoing and adventurous, and I’ve tried to get her to be more willing to open up and converse with people, but that’s hard. There have been times when we’ve gone out together, and the entire time she doesn’t really talk to anyone else besides myself. When she’s upset or sad, she oftentimes goes inside herself and shuts off. Getting her to talk about it is very hard, and I have to pretty much just guess what’s wrong or how she’s feeling. She’ll open up, but it sometimes takes a lot of emotional effort on my end. When she comes over to my house and visits my family, she rarely engages in conversation with them. They will try and talk to her, and she’ll make small-talk for a while, but then that will be it. It’s hard for me to watch her be quietly awkward as a conversation someone tried to make with her dies. 

Also, our libidos aren’t really synched up. I’m the kind of person who wants to have lots of sex, and I’m sure she would be content doing it much less frequently. Whenever we have sex (or even just make out), I feel like I’m always the one who’s initiating it. I’d love for her to just once grab ahold of me and fuck the shit out of me, but I don’t really see that happening. The only time she really initiates this is when we’re drunk, and that doesn’t exactly sit well with me. I also always want to try new and exciting things in the bedroom, and she’d rather stick to what she knows (which isn’t very much). 

Long story short, I’m seriously considering ending our relationship. It’s been amazing and fulfilling, but it’s not really where I thought it would be at this stage. The thing is, she has no idea I’ve been having these thoughts/doubts (because of the distance). Breaking up with her would totally destroy her. She has told me repeatedly that I’m the one good thing left in her life, and that when she’s sad I’m what cheers her up. 

She’s coming to visit me in a little over a week, and we’re going to celebrate our 4 year anniversary together. I really want it to be an amazing, romantic weekend, and I’m hoping that it rekindles our relationship and reignites our fire. But I honestly don’t really see that happening. Should I end it with her, face to face, when she flies down here? Or wait, feel it out, and ease her into it step by step? I’ve never had to break up with anyone before and I’m not sure how to do it. I still want to be close friends with her. The last 4 years of our lives have been amazing in so many ways, and we’ve shared so much that has really enriched my appreciation of life. I don’t want her to forget that and have her hate me, but I’m not sure how.

Sorry for all of this rambling, I hope this makes sense and I hope you guys can give me some good advice.

Tl;dr in an LDR with gf of 4 years. Seeing her in a week, but not sure when after that. No tangible end in sight to distance. Because of distance, along with other smaller issues that I don’t think can be fixed, considering ending relationship. How should I do it?

11laks,3,2012-10-16,Is this depression?,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11laks/is_this_depression/,"Hi everyone. I've been reading many many posts on /depression and I'm starting to think that perhaps I may be suffering from some sort of depression. I understand, BS in psychology, that there are many different levels of depression and people may have different coping mechanisms, but I never identified myself as being depressive as the label almost always (even in college courses) dealt with severe depression.

I will give you a little background which is relevant to my situation. I'm a 36 year old married father of two teenage girls. I became a father at a very young age (17) which I believe contributed to some self-esteem issues, along with concerns about height and looks. For the longest time I've been way too concerned with how people perceived me which has led to what I would consider mild to medium social anxiety. 

 I've also dealt with what I felt was seasonal depression (SAD), every fall and winter I would get very down and sleep for 10-12 hours at times. I always believed that spring and summer would cure me, and it would for a bit and then I would plunge into another form of mild depression. The entire time I felt like I was waiting for something new to enter my life so that I could feel mild joy. For 18 years I've blamed this behavior on my job. I work nights and hate it, yet i paid the bills and kept us afloat. I always thought that not being at my job and having an education would cure many of my ills. Again, it was like I'm always searching for the next thing that will make this feeling anxiety go away. In fact one of the most pervasive emotions I can describe in my life is that feeling of always waiting until situations are better to ACT. I don't invite friends over because I'm waiting for the trim in the hallway to painted. I tell myself I'll invite people over, when everything is perfect. Or I'll start hiking when I get those perfect shoes...etc. I hope this makes sense. I've never been able to get anyone else to understand this emotion. 

This takes me to today. I graduated from college this May, a huge boost to my esteem. I've also been away from my job for months on a leave. Which means I've been home every day, sleeping like a normal person and spending quality time with my wife and children. You'd think I'd be happy as a clam. Everything I've always wanted.....yet I still feel down. I had a ton of things planned during this leave and have been unable to find the ""activating"" energy to do them. I was going to start a blog, but didn't. I was going to do volunteer work or an internship I haven't (the thought of having an interview scares the crap out of me, as keep in mind I've been employed for 18 years). I haven't even written my resume! I sit in front of my computer and either browser Reddit or fantasy football. I spend hardly any time just thinking. I'm on my phone playing a game, staying up watching a tv show, or trying to put energy into conquering some game. 

I've also been dealing with a lot of stress with our mortgage, my work, and what feels like personal failings. I'm afraid that I made this HUGE life decisions and now the stress is going to cripple me and lead to failure. A failure that not only affects me, but my entire family. I know this is a lot to read, and I feel like I didn't even come close to completely explaining myself, but any help is very much appreciated.

TL;DR I'm a 36 year old guy who doesn't know if this is depression that I'm feeling right now. "

I am an avid lol player and a student in college and a dream I have is to intern at Riot.  I have a less than impressive resume so I decided to make a post that gets the league community talking so I can ""spice"" up my resume a bit :p.  Earlier today, a thread was posted by teeso about Pros and ranked 5's so I decided now would be the perfect time to post it.  One of things I want to start would hopefully increase the popularity of ranked 5's teams, strengthen the competitive scene for NA, and bring the community closer together.  Any comments, karma,views on this post would be greatly appreciated.




What I want to do:

*Host regular tournaments with prizes where ranked 5's elo would be the qualifications to participate in the tournament. 

*The ranked 5's elo would be have quite high to keep it as competitive as possible

*The ranked 5's teams that want to participate must be newly created and must play X amount of games a week to be allowed to participate.

*The higher the ranked 5's elo, the higher seeded the team will be.


After a while I want to:

*Contact professional teams and request them to que up for ranked 5's on certain dates/times so amateurs can have experience against teams better than them once in a while.

-this would increase amount of teams queuing up at this time.

-pro streamers would turn off stream until they are in load screen to avoid que dodges.

-this would also help out the prs of the professional teams that do this



Tldr. Pro scene for NA has no incentive to ranked 5's ladder.  Only way to strengthen the competitive ladder is to bring up new teams.

So I was wondering if there were any good programs you guys know of that I could look into, or if anyone has any helpful advice in regards to any of the above things I mentioned (good school/places to live or work etc).

Also, I haven't done very much traveling, and I don't know too much about how to get the different types of Visas or which one to get, or about getting a passport either.

I'm finishing my Masters in ME, but the truth is I haven't done any real mechanical design since my internship in undergrad. I have a good foundation in mechanical design from Solid Mechanics specialization, and some hands on experience designing plastic enclosures for electronics manufacturing.

The last few years I've picked up a lot of embedded programming (started with Arduino, graduated to AVR C/C++), and software design during my masters (C++/MATLAB/Java, mostly robotics planning and navigation, low-level control/communication, some vision/mapping and machine learning). My next goal is to get familiar with PCB layout for a personal open-source project I did.

The truth is I wouldn't consider myself a real 'Expert' in anything, and I'm worried about applying for work when I graduate in August.

I live on a border town in Mexico, so I've grown up ""living"" in Mex/USA. Even tough I was born in the US, I've lived all my life in Mexico and I've never worked in the US before. My college degree is Mexican too (Computer Science)

Graduated on Dec '11. After a really bad internship and social work (required by the school) I set out to get a job. To my surprise it took me 9 months (Aug '12) to get an internship (not even a real job!) at a big-name company here in Mexico. Whenever I looked up jobs in the US I only came up with retail or jobs that required experience or knowledge I didn't have. 

Fast-forward today, my internship is almost done (Nov 1st) and my supervisor just told me that I might get a one month extension on my internship, but couldn't tell me if I would get a full time position after that. Today, my boyfriend also told me that I could get an entry-job on the place he is working at,  doing high school level coding. It's also holiday season, so I know getting a job (USA) in retail wouldn't (shouldn't!) be that hard.

My question is:

1) Should I ditch the big-name company or stay with them one more month hoping to get a full-time position? The full-time positions are well payed, and have tons of benefits. 

2) Should I take the entry-level job with the company my boyfriend works at? I would make a little more than what I'm making right now, it's closer than big-name company and supposedly there's a chance to get a better payed position in the future. 

or

3) Cross the border every day and get a job at retail (USA) to make it trough the holidays. I would make more money than the average manager in Mexico and might get some cash to get a car (which might help me get jobs in the US)

Other info: Live with parents, have some monthly payments (phone, internet, gym bills)

I'm currently employed as an engineer for a privately held firm, but am looking to change careers within the next two years. 

My biggest concern from what I've seen while browsing through these posts is what it takes in order to land a career within the field. Passing tests and all that jazz, that's all fine and dandy (with the exception that the stats I took in college did not prepare me for this...), but generally I see a lot of people recommend internships in order to land jobs. I guess, what would be the ideal amount of tests someone needs to take in order to get out of the need for an internship? 

I already hold a decent job and would really like to just transition into a different one. However, if absolutely necessary, I do have the ability to be supported while taking an internship with the hope that it lands me a job somewhere for a little while. 

Long story short, most of the advice that I see here seems to be for people who are going to school and who are going to move directly into the profession with little in relation to those who are looking to change careers. Advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance everyone!"

I'm a 24 male. I don't know if anyone can help, and while this is mainly about my girlfriend, it's because my girlfriend has pretty much been my life. This isn't a relationship post, as I need the help from what I can tell.

I have also been diagnosed with OCD in the past.

My relationship with my girlfriend is in the shitter right now, and I'm almost 6000 miles away from her.

Prior to June, my relationship with my girlfriend was AMAZING. We started dating around the beginning of October 2011, and everything was great, we went on trips together, loved each other, we became best friends. Sigh I'm already crying. So, a month into it, she abruptly broke up with me, I was heartbroken. While I know it sounds stupid to get heartbroken over a one month relationship, I was. She called me, crying, and told me that she just wasn't ready for this relationship to get that serious and was sorry. She was balling over the phone. This made sense as she had just gotten out of an engagement four months prior. I told her calmly that while it didn't make sense to me, I respected her decision, and bid her adieu. We talked a bit afterwards and she said she would sleep on the decision. Well the next day she texted me, and said she wanted to to talk. Ok, so we met at the docks, and she told me some fucked up shit. I'll get to what this fucked up stuff was later, but I told her I didn't care and I was going to be there for her no matter what. We ended up kissing and watching the water on that cold November night. cuddled together for warmth on a metal bench, and to be honest, as someone who felt completely alone for so many years, it felt like heaven to me.

Fast forward a couple months and I develop a hatred for her best friend (I use the term lightly) because he has a) wanted to fuck her since the beginning of time and b) didn't respect her at all. He had made her cry on countless occasions by simply calling her a cunt or stuff like that because she was too busy to hang out. She had also went to a birthday get together at a cigar bar for an ex boyfriend that made me feel extremely uncomfortable because he specifically didn't want me there. I felt hurt that she wouldn't, but she went for maybe an hour, if that, just so she could get to my place. Our relationship wasn't really damaged. She also did trivial stuff, like she did her makeup a way I liked for the first time, but it was for when she went to hang out with her friend (he was morbidly obese and calling her a cunt in the past for not putting out so I know she wasn't cheating on me) I also caught her talking to her ex fiance who also physically abused her, and that made me mad too because she told me when we first started dating that they weren't facebook friends and she didn't talk to him, yet here she was talking to him openly on facebook once I learned his last name. I almost cut it off because of this, but I didn't. 

Well fast forward a couple more months and she is staying with me every night at my place. Enough that my roommates are charging me utilities for her. I'm happy. She also cuts off relationships with her dick friend because I told her friends don't make friends cry. Oh the irony in this now.

Well, in April we make the decision to move in together because I will be leaving in the late summer for an internship in Europe, and want to make sure she has a stable roof over her head. We move in, and everything is good, but only for the first month. I start getting controlling and telling her she can't even look at the reddit pages of her ex friend or ex fiance, even though she has blocked them on facebook to appease me. I catch her looking at an ex through a other friends facebook account and I freak. I know I'm not right. But she kept doing it, and kept denying it until I provided evidence. This continued for a while, damaging my trust in her, until I found out a bombshell.

Well, the secret she told me was that she was a stripper. She abruptly left her parents place and her boyfriend (he wasn't physically abusive at the time) pretty much told her she had two weeks to get a job. Mind you, this was winter of 2010 in the midwest, so I can believe her when she said this was difficult. She had a part time job, but it only gave her the equivalent of 50-70 bucks every 2 weeks. She supposedly applied everywhere, and finally gave up and joked about a craigslist ad for stripping to her boyfriend, who pretty much said ""do what you gotta do."" So she tried out, and was hired. From the moment on she was humiliated, obliging to a command to ""show us some titties"" during the try out. She continued as a part time stripper to help cover the bills, with some paper deliveries thrown in to balance everything out. She did this for three months, and even did a private gig.... a huge classy swingers party. Ugh. She used me as an outlet, someone who she could share the horrors with without getting thrown out into the cold like her previous boyfriend had.

I had no problem with this for a while, she would tell me everything, about how she was finger raped twice, to how the scar on her stomach was from where a guy ripped her bellybutton out, all the way to how a guy started jerking off in a vip room. She said she wasn't fully nude, and was low contact to her best abilities without getting fired (as in she couldn't just take ones off the floor without giving the guy a cleavage hug) and stuff like that.

After being cool with this for so long, I simply snapped in June. I remember it, we were driving to get ice cream and she was talking about how some guy just gave her money because he felt too guilty asking for a dance from her because she was so non stripper like, and how the bouncer told her she wasn't the kind of person that should be doing that.... and I just snapped. I stopped the car, told her to just shut the fuck up and stop fucking talking about it, and to fucking drop it. I turned the car around, drove home, dropped her off, and just drove on the highway for 2 hours. I don't know what happened, I just fucking lost it.

So, I come back, and I was just different. I had a HUGE problem with this all of a sudden. I mean out of nowhere, I'm flipping out about this. I've gone from talking about marriage (I know how early it was) to talking about breaking up, over something I already knew, in less than 24 hours! 

I end up telling my parents, who after talking to her, told me that shes a good girl inside and was just in a bad place at a bad time. And I wanted to believe it, but I just..... couldn't. I dunno what happened, but I hated this new change.

Then the bombshell..... She left her phone at the apartment by accident one day, and some random guy (who called her 2 days prior and she answered and hung up saying it was the wrong number) texted her about coming on a boat. I was in a stage of just hating everything and everyone, and had lost all trust I had in anyone, so I was determined to figure out who it was. Long story short, she had stripped a SECOND time in May of 2011, at a different club (after she told me she only stripped once and quit once she got her job.) This guy was someone who she gave her number to while she was stripping (this was at the almost end of her engagement with the dick bf) and supposidly ignored once he became explicit in the texts. She said she only went back one day, because she needed money for new tires because she was on spares and scared they would blow. She said she hit the floor twice, and just sat at the bar in between, hence when she started talking to this guy. She said it was because he seemed nice, and someone to hang out with. But I know it was because she wanted attention that her (now cheating) boyfriend wasn't giving her. Nonetheless, nothing came from it, and I know so because when I texted him from her phone, it was clear he only knew her as a ""stripper"" from a year and a half before and didn't know her name or anything else like that.

I, again, freak. My OCD has came back into full swing, and I become an emotionless monster. I mean, I hate what I have become. I make her cry, I berate her, I call her names like a ""whore"" for what she did, I tell her she was a slut.... I'm a monster. I'm a monster to the person I once KNEW I wanted to spend my life with. I made her cry almost weekly, and didn't back down. I was purely emotionless, I would keep going, even when she was on the floor crying, just beating her down with more words. She finally just snapped (she was depressed and had anxiety issues) and started beating me. I deserved it. I'll never say this to her, but I was a monster. But in my mind, I was speaking the truth and I had no reason to feel emotion. I was making my own girlfriend burst into tears, and I cared less for her crying than I would a stranger. Now, I'm 6000 miles away, and I'm STILL doing it. I'm alone. There's nobody here. Nobody has sent me a post card. I eat lunch alone. I stay in my empty apartment when I'm not at work. And I stay in my office when I am.

I cry, alot. And when things don't go right and finally push me off the edge, I take it out on her. Today we were supposed to skype when I got off, but she got called into work. I proceeded to slut shame her over stripping and accused her of being a prostitute. This all after I told her I wanted to spend my life with her yesterday.

What's wrong with me? Why don't I feel emotion? Why am I so cold?
Mainly, how did I change like this towards her in a second. She won't break up with me because she loves me and thinks that the old Idontknow8888 is still inside, and is just trapped by the new me. I miss my old me too. I'm simply.... not happy any more. I'm sad. Lethargic. I live in seclusion now and it has gotten worse. One moment I'm supposidley happy, and then the next I see something that reminds me of the stripping (a mask or something that she used at the party for the theme) and I just go from a 7 to a 2. I just feel miserable.

I can't take it. I want my old self back. I miss him =(

Can I get him back? Or am I doomed to be this emotionless asshole for the rest of my miserable life? God, this girl invested in me, and this is how I'm repaying her. She's so amazing other than the stripping. She loves art, has the voice of an angel (has done opera and musicals in the past), and is an AMAZING cook. She itches my back when I lay next to her, and holds me when I'm cold. Shes the best damn thing to ever happen to me, and I'm not only letting her slip away, but pushing her to that line.

I need help, but I don't even know with what. ='(

Tl;Dr: I need help and have become a monster over something, while terrible, I had no problem with for over 6 months.

When I first started dating him it was the summer, he seemed very driven, he had this fancy internship at this huge company. I was the first girlfriend of his to: graduate high school, not go to jail, and not cheat on him/fuck him over in some way. I was the first girlfriend his mom even tolerated, and she loved me. We seemed like the ""perfect"" couple. We both were smart, attractive kids who were pretty well liked and had similar values. He broke up with me once school started up again because he didn't have the ""drive"" to make it work with me any longer. It was around the time he seems to have lost the drive for a lot of things. He drinks a lot now for stress relief even though both of his parents are alcoholic. He quit smoking when we were together but now he is again. He's still friends with an ex-girlfriend who he dated for 2 years, she cheated on him twice, and she's fucked him over plenty of times as his ""friend"". He's friends with a lot of people who are drug dealers or just drop outs in general. He lost his job at the internship. 

Anyway, the night we broke up I was pretty fucking upset. I was blindsided by the whole thing. The night before we went to a party and he was telling all of his friends about how I was the best thing that had ever happened to him and I made him happier than anyone ever had, blah blah blah. So he has 2 paperback books of mine and a sweater. I told him if I ended up wanting my stuff back I'd contact him, otherwise he could keep them (he has PLENTY of shit from his exes). I've been doing the no-contact rule and trying to ignore him.

Rewind to last thursday night. It's 11pm and I get a text. ""Hey, do you want your things back? I have 2 books and a sweater."" I wrote back ""Yeah, sure. If it's urgent you can just stick them in my mailbox and I'll get them in the morning. No biggie.""

Him: ""Well I'm carless at the moment but I'll drop them off tomorrow day if that's okay. I just expected to hear from you by now.""

Me: ""That's fine. I won't be home from noon to around 3 though. I didn't expect to hear about this at 11 on a thursday night.""

Almost 2 hours later I get a response:
Him: ""Well it's been on my to-do list. This semester's been absolutely crazy. Also: 11 is the best time. I know you're still up anyway :P""

And then here's the kicker: THE FUCKER NEVER GAVE BACK MY SHIT.

What was the point of him contacting me?

So any other managers finding in this time of when there are supposed to be lots of good people out of work that its hard to find anyone good?

Edit: Why do some people assume that because I want some senior people that we dont hire interns, we have a great intern program here and one of them is in my team and is a star, has been promoted last year and will be again this year. Do you people realise you cant have a team full of juniors and interns or does this somehow escape you?
Secondly, my background is QA, I have been doing Agile for 5+ years now.
I need seniors with experience of things like TDD and basically other good quality development practices because one of the teams Im taking over as a team that barely does any unit testing and needs that from within the team and have the mindset changed, plus someone who already works in that way, that works a lot better than trying to train them up from scratch, also looking at contractors as current project is in a bit of a rut.
I also have another great team, great with TDD, great with thinking about testing etc and really happy with them.
So before making wild assumptions how about you think a little bit :)

EDIT 2:
We have also had people apply with 20 years experience but thats in purely waterfall, doesnt know about unit tests etc, so thats experience but the wrong kind so also didnt pass.

Experience doesnt alsways equal work space, surely if you are really into coding you have been doing it for years and have some past projects? side work etc?"

So me and this girl have been dating for about a month now. We met eachother in a bar... Started out as a one night-stand. From then on it's been really great. We go out for drinks every weekend, we go on small hikes, we meet eachother's friends, I've met her dad and she's met my parents. We only see eachother during weekends because she is on an internship in my hometown, but we study at the same university.

Right now we are pretty exclusive, but after some thought I'd like to be in a relationship with this girl. People think we are together when we're in public, but I can't quite grasp what she really wants. I feel like our relationship is based solely on sex, it's pretty much all we do unless we're out with friends.

The subject of relationship has been brought up, but we decided not to discuss it too much so we don't ruin what we have right now. She did say that she could see herself with me. Thing is my ex-girlfriend broke up with me 3 months ago, and it seems like she thinks it's too recent. However I've come to the conclusion that I'm over her, and that she was treating me terribly. I havn't spoeken to her in over 2 months.

We're going camping just me and her in some cabin near her parent's cottage next Friday, and I want to bring up the relationship topic again, but at the same time I don't want to seem too desprate and clingy.

I can't really explain why I want us to be official.. Just seems right to me, even if it won't make that much of a difference from what we have now.

Is it too early to start a relationship after about a month and a half of dating exclusively? "

The thing that really got people talking was how good they felt.  How they only slept for a few hours and still felt wonderful.  Then it started to go all so wrong.  Anyone that was sick got really sick.  Hospitals were over run, but they seemed to have room upstairs because anyone already there died within a few days.  There was another flash yesterday and things seem to calm down a bit,  the gas gauge started moving again and the AC didn't work as well.  Then just at suddenly as it had changed, it was all gone.

So I've been reading this sub for some time, and for the most part it's full of great advice:  do well on exams, be social, pickup internships, master excel, etc.  All this seems great, but doesn't seem to be helping in my situation.

I have a BA and MA in mathematics, and just recently left a PhD program at the end of my second year.  I just didn't like it.  Research math is not for me.  I've considered becoming an actuary for some time, but my education was all paid for via NSF grants and TAships, so I couldn't turn down the opportunity to get a PhD.

Now I'm in a situation where I'm over-educated and under-experienced.  I've maintained a 3.69 GPA (I should really start rounding), passed the P/1 Exam on the first go last month, will be sitting for the FM/2 in December, and will be taking the MFE or MLC (whichever is offered soonest) directly after that.  I also have several years of teaching experience (so I can communicate clearly, as well as be social), programming experience, and have reasonable knowledge of excel (pivot table, lookups, index/match).

So the question becomes:  how do I, as a current degree holder, get hired as soon as possible?  I can't get internships, since most of them require the intern to be in school at the time of hire (how firms only have extra work over summer is beyond me as well...). 

I've considered the cold emailing approach...should I wait until I have that second exam passed?  Do I find a menial job (I can't imagine the average menial job will help my resume much), or focus on exams?

I'm pretty discouraged lately, so any help is appreciated."

I really don't like where the new season is going.",[deleted],Dexter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/11jwvn/ok_i_need_to_rant_a_little_bit_about_the_last/,"These are the reasons from the last episode that caused by reaction. *Spoilers*

1. The way they killed the intern guy, Louis. I actually thought he was an interesting character with deviant properties (like ruining people's lives and frequenting prostitutes) and also money, that they could have easily used to their advantage in the season. He had so much going for him and then they just kill him because he was being an annoyance to the main character and so that they could use him as a set-up for something in the future. 
And yea, that set-up was so idiotic. OH HERE, LET ME PAN TO THIS POOLING OF BLOOD SO THAT THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL YOU MISS IT BECAUSE I'M GOING TO USE IT IN THE FUTURE TO IMPLICATE DEXTER IN HIS MURDER. This is such a stupid gimmick. And then on top of that they use the lazy and incompetent gangster because you know he's not going to clean it up.

2. The villain for this season is a sociopathic British-educated Ukranian gangster. Seriously? Also, he has no feelings other than his love of Opera. I can't believe they actually added that to his traits. 

3. This is the main one. Let's assume that Debra's initial and secondary reaction to finding out about Dexter were plausible. But within three episodes, they have made her 'understand' her brother. This is what they did:
i) First episode: Initial reaction of confusion and revulsion.

ii) Second episode: Feelings of denial which led her to try to 'cure' Dexter.

iii) Third episode: She goes through a near-death experience and all of a sudden 'understands' him and her punishment for him is probably going to be expulsion from her life. That makes sense.

First of all, they made her go through through the [stages of grief](http://psychcentral.com/lib/2006/the-5-stages-of-loss-and-grief/
), which is stupid enough because they have been proven to be untrue. Secondly, they have been setting up this event for seven whole seasons but instead of taking advantage of it and going deeper into to it, they're just giving viewers a superficial glance using only three episodes. And now all we're going to get is anger and hostility? 

Is this good writing on their part?"

Started new job today. Fucking hate it.I know i should be happy that i am at least earning *some* money, but for a full time job doing twice as much work as my last full time position and earning $3 an hour less. Hell i made a buck more an hour at my internship and barely broke even. 

Add insult to injury, finally got a reply from a job i had interviewed at two weeks ago, which would be an awesome freaking job. Full benefits, 401k, the works. Yeah, they are going with someone else.

Got a text from my friend who works there, he set me up with the interview. Said the interviewer felt i ""lacked ambition and goals"". Fuck dude, i am so emotionally drained after these last three years the only ambition i have is to climb out of the hole im in, my goal is to eat something besides rice and ramen for once and not get my car repo'd and evicted from my apartment. 

Last three years have seen me finally get a girlfriend for the first time since 2002, only to have her cheat on me, then beg me to take her back, then have her move in with me and break up so she can be with some other guy who is the poster child for the YOU WAN SUM FUCK mentality. I slept in my car the other night because id rather freeze than listen to them fuck.

 I got fired from my last good job in july 2011, had to turn down another position so i could finish school, my grades went to hell since i was doing whatever temp jobs i could find to have rent money since no decent place would hire me because i was still in school. 

Oh the reason i was fired was because the assistant manager was shtupping the manager, and she hated me because i wouldnt put up with her bullshit. Its ok tho, last i heard her and her granola smoking boyfriend were living in a tent in the woods to prepare for the end of the world this december. 

So i applied to another three jobs tonight. Had to use the schools computers because my home internet is shut off. (Typing this on my phone, at least it isnt shut off yet) 

Im not even frustrated any more. Im sure my current predicament is coloring my perception, but it seems like anything i do ends in failure. I think the last time i truely felt happy was 4 years ago on my birthday. My friend went and brought a cake to the bar, and it feels like the last time anyone gave a shit about me.

I told the exgf-current roomate the other day im at the point where i would like to just burn the fucking house down and live in the woods myself. I was laying in bed last night, and all i kept thinking was that i *never* thought, at 37 years old, my life would be this totally fucked up. 

The one consolation is that, when i started dating this girl, my big plan was that i was going to propose after i graduated. Stupid me still thinking of being married and shit. So glad she showed her true colors before i married this person. Dodged a 230lb bipolar bullet.

Sorry for the rant, im just fucking miserable and have no one to complain to."

Hi guys. Been a long time lurker and finally decided to jump in.  Lots of posts I read really help me out, and I appreciate all you guys
	around here and giving the younger folk some good wisdom.

	Perhaps this may be one of the many ""help im an engineering student and i feel like i failz""  
	But currently, things seem dark to me and I can't help but think this way.

	I am an EE major in a school reputable for their internship program.  I finished my Freshman year on June 2012 and am currently attending
	my internship job.  My freshman year was pretty shitty, and I feel like I did less than mediocore.  I know (or do I?) I could've done better... but my
	high-school habits have finally revealed it's ugly and destructive effects.   I really discovered 
	my personality and characterstics.  I learned I'm horrible at realizing what's important and what's not.  For instance, it's Monday night
	and you have an exam on Wednesday.  I would've somehow found myself at a friends house being completely unproductive.  ANd come exam-time,
	I'll be cursing myself and promising myself I'll never make a similar mistake, only I'll repeat the same habit over and over again.

	Another huge topic focuses on being an EE major.  ONe of my freshman projects involved using the LEGO NXT Kit and creating a robot with
	the lego parts, programming it (using the Lego Nxt specific compiler), and hoping your robot follows at least half the tasks the prompt
	asks you to do.  I saw many outstanding EE students, somehow hacking their way and using C++ to program the robot to perform tasks much
	more complicated than what the Lego NXT compiler can actually do.  OUtside of that, I see EE students involved with other projects,
	using resistors to OP amps like second nature, where I barely understood Ohm's Law.

	It was not only the Lego NXT project, but various others that led me to believe, ""Did I choose the wrong major?""  Surely I'm interested,
	and I've learned the basic-of-the-basics, but I just feel so underprepared, and so unworthy of all the other EE students out there
	who entered the major with loads more of background information, history, and projects.  I just feel like I can't keep up some how.

	========

	My internship I'm currently in also seems very very dark and hopeless for me.  I was ecstatic that they hired me, because it was my first choice
	place I wanted to intern at. They do projects involving motor control to actuators, to programming them, and producing magic. I love being in the environment
	everyday, yet I feel extremely ashamed as the days go by.  The longer I stay, the more I feel like I'm being revealed, that somehow I over exagerrated during my interviews
	and now my boss really knows the unknowledgeable person I really am.  Somehow I fooled my boss and now I'm sure he regrets the choice.
	Personally I'm an extremely shy and unconfident person, (except around friends/family) so 
	being the absolute useless noob makes me believe I'm just not cut out to be the engineer I'm aspiring to be.  It just mkes me feel worse and worse overall.

	I'm scared to lift my head to the other engineers around my lab and ask some questions in fear that I'll be revealed even more.

	I know I know.  I'm just a Freshman. But still, an EE student should still have decent abilities, like reading a schematic, and making sure a circuit works.


	I have no belief in myself. I'm also taking an online Math class because I dropped out of Multi.Var.Calc during my Freshman year and now I have to make it up. That SINGLe
	class itself is leaving my struggling.  I just don't know how to juggle it all... 
	
	Not afraid for harsh criticm. I""m just seeking some truth and wisdom...
	Thanks for any future feedback guys. Glad to finally join the boat.

Because the Spanish has to be taken consecutively, I won't be walking until Aug or Dec 2013. (Four classes stand between me and my degree.)

Do I start applying for jobs now and explain whats up with the Spanish requirement in hopes they'll hire me based on experience or just tough it out another year?

I started in August, and it has been one problem after another.  I only have 3 clients because my supervisor does not believe individual counseling is beneficial with substance abusers.  I can only see these clients at very specific times because there is no room for individual counseling until people leave the office for the day.  My supervisor also expects me to see each client for only 15-20 minutes once a week.

Another big issue is that I recently found out that my supervisor is not licensed and has never been licensed.  I'm afraid this may affect my ability to be licensed later.  My university supervisor assures me that it is okay, because ""the university meets most CACREP standards and can choose to not meet some standards"".  Does that sound right?  

Also, my supervisor has decided to take the rest of the year off.  He said that site supervision was unnecessary and that I do not get a replacement supervisor.

What should I do?

**Edit**: I called the licensing boards of the states I may move to after graduation.  Every representative I talked to said it was not okay.  There are some steps I can take to see if it gets approved (such as hiring an independent supervisor), but it won't work as is.  Time to make some calls to the university.

11nk3a,1,2012-10-17,"What I've been learning at the chemical industry luncheons and conferences for lawyers, wall-street types, industry heads, etc.",[deleted],wallstreet,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreet/comments/11nk3a/what_ive_been_learning_at_the_chemical_industry/,"I work for a science magazine and they make me go to these luncheons/conferences since I am new to the chemical industry and solely have a journalism background. I am writing this to confirm to those who wonder if the Wall Street crowd really are the jerky/arrogant types of people that you think they are when you are Occupying Wall Street, etc. My short answer? Yes and then some. 

As a recent college graduate (and a female), I feel quite out of place at these things and their searing stares don't make me feel any better about it. So here is a quick list of what I've learned:

1) They hate journalists of any type, no matter how innocent looking you are. In their defense, in some cases I would hate journalists too for our sneaky nature of gathering information not made for the public ear. However, practically running away from me like I have the plague as soon as they see my name tag and the word ""magazine"" on it is a little extreme. Do you think I really care about your opinion on the Yankees? Quick let me grab my recorder and shame you across the country. Please. I don't care and it's so rude that they give me these snarky looks all the time. How can you hate me when you don't even know me?

2) They especially hate poor people. Seriously, it just complicates things for their pensions. The jokes at those who are unfortunate's expense? Numerous and (no pun intended) very poor in taste. In fact, just today at one of these luncheons, someone who holds a prominent position in a chemical company that easily makes 6 figures (this information is readily available to anyone on the US's SEC web site) that was making a presentation about a recent acquisition said, and I quote ""We gave presentations to all of our locations about the acquisition, except for Fiji because there are just poor people there."" ::insert pretentious laugh and cigar flick::

2) They would rather hold conversations with their ipads, blackberries, iphones, virtual bank accounts, robot ball-scratchers, etc. than any human being. Seriously, even during presentations carefully planned out and worked hard on by unpaid interns these people would be texting, typing, even talking on the phone during it! At least leave the room jeeze. 

3) Women either have no interest in chemicals, or they just aren't getting the higher paid positions. Seriously at 90% of these things I am either the only woman there or 1 of very few. And the youngest by at least 20 years. Out of the 150 highest grossing chemical companies in the world, there is 1 female CEO. 1!!! Makes me sick.

4) I won't even go into the nitty gritty details of what companies like Monsanto are putting in your food. I'm telling you, you don't want to know. Oh and don't drink Snapple. The ""best stuff on earth"" is not the best, but it most certainly is ""stuff.""

So, in conclusion, Wall Street really doesn't care about you and the chemical industry is destroying the world. I hope you make the right choice this November and vote for someone who actually gives a crap about us 20-somethings, because I can tell you first hand who doesn't.

I'm guessing that he'd be up for paying about $300 per part but the catch is that I can only get each part 1 at a time. So maybe a new graphics card now, a new CPU some other day, etc. He says he would have to buy them all at once because everything is so out dated that none of it would be compatible. If I'm able, I'd like to keep the new parts compatible with old parts so I can upgrade one item at a time otherwise anything I'd be able to get would be way below my current specs because he likes to be a cheapass.

He had every reason to break up with me. I am extremely depressed most of the time, I have a sketchy background that involves stripping (had to pay the bills somehow, although this was awhile before I met him, and I am in a much more stable job), and... he just found out that I cheated on him. It was inexcusable of me to do. I did it 2 months into our relationship, kissed a guy friend of mine. Exchanged a few explicit emails. One year later, my boyfriend finds out. 

I know what I did was wrong, believe me. I don't need more people to tell me that I'm a fucked up bitch, or something other than that. Because I've heard it enough in the past 24 hours. I've been crying nonstop, bashing my head into a wall, and clawing at myself. I am so overcome with guilt. I did everything wrong that I could have done wrong, and now my boyfriend is suffering too. 

We live together, although he is currently overseas until December for an internship. He gave me instructions that I am to move out before he gets home, because he doesn't want to see me ever again. I was supposed to visit him as a christmas present from my parents, as I have never been to Europe, but as soon as I told my mom about what happened, she called me ""disgusting"" and said that they would immediately cancel my trip plans. 

I'm about to lose my home. I can't live at my parents house, nor do I have any friends. I think I may become homeless because I was barely scraping by to begin with, but now I can't possibly afford to move into somewhere new. My credit rating is so bad, I can't even get approved for anything. My boyfriend was going to propose to me in the spring, but that's all gone now. 

I just want to disappear. We were supposed to have a nice, warm Christmas together, and now it's gone. I have no one. I'm not in school, I work a low paying, dead end job. My life is worthless. And now I'm never going to have a future with this guy ever again. I've seen him talking about it online all over the place, and every person has called me a bitch or a slut. :( 

I don't care if anyone responds to this. I just really hate my life. 

EDIT: Thanks to everyone with helpful advice. I really just needed to let it all out, because I don't really have anyone to talk to. I know that my ex boyfriend's reactions are harsh, but I do not blame him, as I am the one who lied and went behind his back. I guess I just am really grateful for the support, because it is hard for me to see past this right now.

Need some advice from experienced engineers.,eng348,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/11msdp/got_fired_from_first_job_out_of_school_need_some/,"**TL;DR got fired from first engineering job out of college, can't find another job because I will not put it on my resume in fear potential employers will not like that I got fired.**

I graduated from a good school with my BS in Aerospace Engineering back in 2011.  Also, I have no internship experiences and a sub par GPA of 2.7 (I was 2.7 told was average for my school).  Foolish me did not begin applying for aerospace jobs until the June *after* I graduated, so, I am assuming these companies thought something was wrong with me and did not want me.

After giving up hope for a while, I worked an odd job for about six months until I began working as a Quality Assurance Engineer in manufacturing.  I would like to note that I had no previous experience in QA or manufacturing, so I am no entirely sure why they hired me. 

About 95% of the factory workers, people I was required to interact with to do my duties, did not speak English.  I was hired under the pretense that I knew *some* Spanish, but I am quite confident that I made it clear that I was *close* to conversational.  Additionally, my boss was not an engineer and was extremely difficult to communicate with - she was irrational.  One of the top bosses would call me into his office and teach me manufacturing statistics and other similar stuff, but again, I had no experience with this and he was a pretty terrible teacher.  He would play a bongo drum - I kid you not - while asking me questions.  Who does that?!

After two months, I was called into a persons office whom I did not know and I was let go, them saying, ""it is not working out.""

It has been 6 months since this has happened and I am currently underemployed working another odd job to pay the bills.  So here comes the advice part:

* Should I include the QA job on my resume? I am worried employers will not like that I was ""fired"" even though it was in a field that I had no experience in.

* If I do not include it on my resume, will a potential employer somehow be able to find out I did in fact work the job I was let go from? Thus, making it even worse than not including it.

* Should I try to find internships instead of full time jobs?  The thing is, I need to pay bills and I can not really afford not being paid/I feel those are only for students, not graduates.

* Should I include my GPA on my resume?  I feel this is sort of holding me back in a way because they may think it is lower than it actually is.  I was told back in college not to include it unless it is above a 3.0.

* Anyone know of any good sites for entry level jobs in New York?

Thanks for anyone who can give me some advice/feedback.  I am in a pretty bad position and could use the help."
11mqxd,5,2012-10-17,"Mid-semester internships: ""The ideal candidate will be able to work about 15 hours per week as an intern during the school year and then work full-time upon graduation""",a_redditor,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11mqxd/midsemester_internships_the_ideal_candidate_will/,"Hey everybody.  I am currently a CS major, projected to graduate in Fall of 2013, and I'm a bit broke, so I'm looking for work during the semester.

I happen to attend a university with a great career center for their technical majors.  They host a large job fair twice a year, and e-mail us almost weekly with at least one position at a local company targeted for students in technical majors from our university.

**Company A**: I have worked a summer internship with company A for the past 4 summers.  I really like company A.  I know everyone there, they pay well, and they want to hire me when I graduate.  Unfortunately, company A is an hour and 20 minute drive away from where I live, and I've been subletting an apartment every summer to work there.  This is why I want to find something during the semester, and *possibly* during the summer in the city where I do live.

**The Problem**: While there are many job offers for companies in the city I live in, most companies are looking for interns during the semester, who can then slide right into a full time position upon graduating a semester or two later.  My suspicion is that they see 4 years with one company on my resume, and they assume I'm not a candidate for hire upon graduation.  And to be honest, they're probably right.

It's not even that I'll definitely go with company A, it's that I want to spend a significant amount of time checking out all of my options when I graduate.  I have more experience than most of my peers, so I'm not going to waste that by just going with the company whom I happen to have worked for most recently.

**The Actual Question**: My question, I guess, is how do I convince these people to hire me for a mid-semester internship without giving off the idea that I'm going to cut and run as soon as something better comes along?  Because I most definitely will do that.

EDIT: The quote from the title is from an actual job description at a local company."
11mp4y,0,2012-10-17,Does anyone have input about interning with large vs. small companies? (x-post from r/EngineeringStudents),[deleted],AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/11mp4y/does_anyone_have_input_about_interning_with_large/,"I am considering offers from two companies (A and B), and would like to hear what anyone has to say about working with large or small companies. That's the primary difference between them, because:

* They do the same type of work (related to national security)

* They are located in the same area

* I don't want to choose based on money unless it's really dead even otherwise (company fit is more important.) That said, the large company (Company B) did offer about $6/hour more and a week of vacation.

For what it's worth, the small company (Company A) is ~30 people, has been very successful thus far, and is growing quickly. The large company is &gt;1000 people and is a subsidiary of a &gt;100,000 person company.

Other information influencing my decision:

* I visited Company A and it seemed like a great fit (but B could be as well for all I know - I interviewed with the guy I whose team I would join and he seemed like a good person to work for.)

* About 20 out of the 30 people from Company A came from Company B because they had issues with its growth and acquisition by the super large company. That said, most also joined when Company B was 100 people, so they are 'small-company people.'

* Company B could provide opportunity to move geographically in the future if I end up with them.

* Company A would provide stock options if I end up with them.

It's hard to ignore the money difference since it adds up to &gt;$2000 for the summer and I'm paying for school through scholarships, my own savings, and loans. However I don't want to decide based on that. Is it kosher to try to negotiate with Company A to see if they could raise their offer? Also, what else should I take into account while deciding?
Thanks for reading and for any input!

**TL;DR:** Should I intern with a tiny company or a large one? I'm torn and have seven days to decide.

EDIT: I've decided to go with the small company! It's hard to turn down an extra several dollars per hour, but I was leaning toward the small company before money became an issue, and I don't want to let that sway my decision. Thanks for all the input!"

I've been saving up money for a while to start up so i can look for a job when we get there. The reason we are going to argentina, is because he's getting a really good geology internship/job there for a year. I had never studied abroad and I love him, so i decided to save up the money and go along with him. I never had an issue with going, that's not the problem, my feelings for him are more than enough to warrant going. But I just recently found out that jobs for my field of study (graphic design) may not be as high paying there as they would be in the US. (We are talking earning less than I would on my state's minimum wage of 7.25) Essentially, I would be earning anywhere between 1/4 to 1/5 of what I would be earning in the US. This hasn't changed my opinion on going, but, should I be feeling like I haven't accomplished much since graduation bc of earning so little (even if we are only going to be living there for a year/ im really just looking for an internship there) My boyfriend said not to worry about the $, that he'd be able to more than help out the both of us, but it is still something that bothers me a bit. It's not comforting to know you'd be earning so little post college. I dunno, maybe im crazy but i just had to get this off my chest since last night. "

i recently got into my major, EE. I was always interested in robotics/autonomous vehicles so naturally I began looking into controls. After looking it up on google, however, I saw some alarming statements regarding the field of controls.

1. You have to go to grad school
2. There are no internships available for controls
3. It's all math
4. It is a dying field

I would very much like to know how true all these statements are. I dont plan on going to grad school so 1, 2, and 4 are pretty huge factors for me. As for math, lets just say thay im not exactly the best mathematician at my school.

Is controls right for me? Any ideas are welcome."

However, I'm from a tropical country, it's hot and humid here 8 months of the year and it's raining the other 4 months. I have no clue how to dress for Germany. 

This is what I think I need to buy:
- 1 long overcoat
- 1 or 2 jackets 
- a few cardigans and sweater tops
- 1 hoodie
- thermal underwear (?)
- lots of thick socks
- one casual bag
- one fancy bag
- scarves (?) 

Fancy bag is the only item I currently have, I would have to buy everything else, it's a lot of stuff - so I want to start by buying a few items per week. 

Suggestions and additions to my list would be very helpful.

I can support myself so I don't need to be paid or anything (i'm guessing this will help). And London would be the best place for me, as my parents live just outside in Guildford. I don't really have a clue about how to go about this. I see lots of websites offering internships but they seem to say different things, and some require tests, and months of interviews etc etc. I'm not really sure what I'm doing. All my careers department seems to do is give you a list of websites and sends you on your way. Any help would be much appreciated, or an internship if you happen to have one free ;) "

Willing to work for free ITP,autechone,Atlanta,https://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/11mdj8/would_anyone_consider_taking_on_an_intern_who/,"I'm aware that we have a /jobs section. It doesn't get any traffic and I haven't had much luck there. 

As the title says, I am a senior studying Comm/English. I am in my late 20's and recently returned to school after a moderately successful foray in art and music. I have been an internationally touring musician for almost a decade, but I have no desire to toil away in that industry as I now have a family to think of. 

Speaking to my qualifications based on work experience: For the past several years, to remain flexible for my musical endeavors, I have found myself in hospitality management working for several well-regarded establishments. Before relocating to Georgia, I was the assistant manager at one of central Florida's largest nightclubs, booking and promoting large concerts and events. 

I also have limited but relevant experience and education in b2b marketing copy, technical writing, editing, social media, journalism,  advertising and graphic design. 

Honestly, I'm looking for some experience to better equip me for the decisions ahead. I have taken my LSAT (scoring in the uppermost percentile), I am studying for my GRE and I'm examining top-level graduate programs. Before I make these decisions, I feel that i need some additional work experience to properly evaluate my interests and goals. 

I am interested in any and all options, particularly law or journalism related. I have an incredible work ethic and merely need a lucky break to succeed. 

EDIT: Thank you for all of the encouragement and advice. I understand most people are hesitant to consider non-paying positions, but I've been searching for months and I need some more experience before I make a decision in terms of graduate school.

I have found it difficult to land internships, likely because of my background in hospitality and music combined with my age. I think that I appear overqualified due to my work experience but that work experience is not in line with my long term goals. Once I get into an interview situation I'm normally able to show my value. Perhaps I need to rethink my strategy for cover letters. "

I'm thinking about staying here after the semester ends and trying to find some corporate work that'll extend my visa. At least in the mean time I'd like to start doing some freelance work off of mandy to help pad out my cv. 

Anyway do you guys think its worth the effort to try and stay here? From what I've gathered from others in the industry, the English film/tv job market isn't very hot right now. Even so in the last couple months I've gotten the opportunity to do a lot of amazing things here. I feel like I could make it work, but my visa is a bit of an issue. 

Anyway my other option is to move back to Philly and attempt to find a job there. If that fails after 6 months then I'll head to NYC to find work, and if that doesn't work out then out to LA I suppose. 

So basically what I am saying is my odds of finding camera assist/running/pa/ type work much, much higher in NYC than it is in London?

I know you try and hide it, but smoking in your car that I had completely clean for two months was the dead giveaway. 

Do you not remember how you spent half of the summer in ICU with a pneumonia that should have killed you? It was a miracle that you survived, and the doctors (all 8 of them that were in charge of you) commented to me and dad just how lucky we were to have you come out of that alive, especially being a smoker of 30+ years. There is no doubt in my mind that your pneumonia wouldn't have been as bad if you had quit smoking one of the hundreds of times you said you would. You spent 28 days straight in a coma, went through a month of rehab, and had your mother, sister, son, and husband by you every step of the way. I remember helping you recover from the brain damage that was caused by your severe oxygen deprivation, helping you remember who I was, who dad was, and where you were and what you did for a living. I taught you how to drive again, how to eat, how to do household tasks, everything. Everything about your life had to be relearned. You stopped smoking through necessity for that entire time, but as soon as you came back around, you went back to your old habits.

I don't want to go through that shit again. I've shed way too many tears over you.

The way I see it now, you ruined my whole summer. A summer where I was supposed to get that amazing internship that I had to turn down because you were sick. A summer where I was supposed to start off in the real world for the first time. A summer where I was supposed to finally catch up with my credits and get back on track to graduate in the next 2 years. All of that is gone, and it's because you wouldn't stop smoking. I'd have traded all of my opportunities and obligations for the summer if it meant you came out of the summer not smoking, but you let me down.

Dad told me last weekend when I was home that if you kept buying cigarettes, he wouldn't be able to afford your health insurance anymore. When he told me that, for the first time in my life, I saw dad show fear.

If you want to see me for Thanksgiving, Christmas, and the like, you will stop smoking. If you keep smoking through next year, I'll stop responding to your calls, emails, and texts. It's going to hurt you, but not anymore than how much you're hurting me and your fragile body right now."

I also don't have any money. My parents have no financial stability, and the only thing they can offer me is a place to sleep. I max out my federal loans and pay a little more out of pocket just to cover tuition. I don't own a car. I cannot feasibly visit the Googleplex until I save up a goodly amount of my workstudy funds, or *maybe* if I ask my half-grandfather for money, but there are a few medical problems with that idea.

I know things could be a lot worse and I'm not the only one dealing with these issues, so maybe this isn't the least appropriate place either? Anyways, I'm in a bad situation. 

Two years ago I was happy. I had a few close friends, a fair paying job, independence, confidence, hope, the works. It was two years ago when my father moved in with me, and when my life started degrading fast. Now I'm not blaming the degradation of my life on my dad; I should have known better than to think we could ever live together. But with an eviction on his record, no one would rent to him and he had no where to go and I wasn't just going to let him rot. For the first eight months I [barely] supported us both, all the while getting more and more depressed as every cent I made went towards our survival. Even then I still had to borrow money from friends for food after my whole check usually went to rent and bills. Work became drudgery and I am ashamed to admit that my performance plummeted. It wasn't just the daily struggle that was dragging me down, but my father isn't exactly the easiest person to live with. I know, who's father *is* easy to live with right? Well, as a son of a single mother with [borderline personality disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder), he has learned from a true master how to be extremely emotionally unstable, irrational, manipulative, and sometimes violent. (Ex. breaking through my locked door while I'm trying to remove myself from a fight, pushing passed me as I'm trying to block him from coming into my room, pinning me on my bed and screaming insults right in my face). Over time I've become so worn down, I've lost all energy for life. I've tried reaching out to ""friends"" for some kind of support, but they're caught up in their own lives and drama and don't sympathize. Through this whole experience I've lost my job, my friends, all sense of self-worth. 

I know what you all must be thinking, just gtfo of there asap! It's just not that simple. Believe me, I would have been long gone if I had the means. Being jobless I can't move out, and there's no one I can stay with. I know the next step is to get a new job and start moving. But I find myself in such a state of despair and hopelessness. I've struggled with depression before, but nothing like this. Everything is painful. Getting out of bed has become a daily challenge that I often lose. I cry all the time about everything and nothing, will just burst into tears and start bawling and can't stop. I've even started compulsively picking at my skin and face and am embarrassed to leave the house because of the red marks on my face and arms and chest. I don't know what to do, I feel like I'm going crazy and no one could care less. I've never felt so alone.

I know, I need counseling right? Well I have no means to pay for a counselor right now. In desperation I was able to find a victim counseling internship paid for by the county, and I did see the lady a few times. But I kept leaving her office feeling worse and worse and realized that she probably wasn't the best counselor for me. That doesn't mean I've given up on the idea, I just can't afford it. 

Anyways, sorry for the sloppy rant.. The few times I've tried talking about this stuff it (surprise) immediately turns people off. So I usually just keep my mouth shut and continue to rot from the inside. 
Have any of you ever dealt with a similar situation and could spare some advice? I would love to hear it, thanks."

First I'll introduce myself. I'm from Barcelona, 30, and will be -again- unemployed at the end of this current month (october). You probably know how things are fucked up here and since I've always had an adventurer spirit, I'd like to go abroad to see if I can build up some kind of ""future"" for myself, as ""future"" itself has become an unbearable thing to plan here where I live.

I have a degree (media =&gt; TV &amp; cinema) and years of experience in many fields. When I was a high school and uni student I worked as a waiter, warehouse worker, clerk, intern, computer repairing... When I got my degree I have been working in a TV station as a 'guy for everything' (such as CCU control, autocue operator, video editor), then as cameraman, photographer, web developer, motion graphic designer and a lot of many temporary works that take long time as it's usual on this field. CON: I'm not fully experienced on anything. PRO: Fast learning, hard work and good results on any subject.

My last work on the last six months has being as a check-in agent in Barcelona Airport. I've been able to save about €2000 for my chance abroad. (That's about £1500, yay, tight budget).

I've read lots of others' experiences on the UK. How to get a NIN, how to open a bank account, how to find somewhere to live, etcetera. But it's the experience of others and things take other directions when you try by yourself. I really don't want to go abroad as I'm sticked too mcuh to my country but the situation forced me to: no opportunities. No chance, no future. Then let's try elsewhere. Now what to do?

· I've read lots of people commenting and saying London is an expensive place to go. Some buddies told me to try Scotland. My own life experiences bring me to Bristol and Bath (got an ex-bf there). What about Midlands? Scotland? Wales? Pros and cons are more than welcome.

· I know I have to start from zero. Not a big deal, just a bit afraid from rolling dice. I'm able to adapt on any field, but I'd like to work on something my degree can help. Anyway I'll be happy cleaning dishes for a while whilst I find something that suits more my profile.

· I know as well this question may be asked thousands of times but I'd really like to hear some opinions, backup, anything. 

Well, I'd like to hear some comments about this. 

Cheers.

**TL;DR:** Spaniard graduated 2 years ago. No luck, just non skilled or unpaid jobs. Want to try going abroad. UK is my target. Have some HTML, CSS, PHP notions. Some graphic design notions as well. I can handle pro-grade cameras, editing in RT and NLE platforms and do some motion graphics. Any chance?"

Initially, I was excited.  But when I shared the news with family and friends, they were puzzled at why I'd be applying to an internship instead of entry level helpdesk jobs.  Their reasoning is that future employers wouldn't take my internship seriously.

It looks like my internship is going to turn into a full time position in yet another state [800 miles away from home].

It is a top 20 fortune 500 company and is my absolute dream job. 

My girlfriend has a job back home, and her company has a branch in the city my [possible] future job is. She could very easily transfer to this branch.

It is still really early, but she refuses to talk about it. Basically put her foot down and says she will not move. 

I see where she is coming from, but it is frustrating because I know if the roles were switched I would move for her in a heart beat. 

If it matters: we are both 22 years old. 

What would you do in my situation? Anyone on here have a similar situation?

Flash forward a year, he looks through my facebook messages, and finds the bad ones. And we're over. He's deleted me off facebook, told everyone what I did. I totally deserve it. I hurt him so bad, and now I wish I could just curl up in a ball and disappear. 

I have no friends, no family members who care about me. We currently live together (he is overseas for an internship, but will come back in December), and own a cat. He told me to get out before he comes home, because he never wants to see me again.

I hate myself. I feel like I should be the one being put through this, not him. But now I'm completely broke, and have nowhere to go. I told my parents what happened, and they hung up the phone before telling me ""there's nowhere for you to stay here"". I have no other family members in town that would help. My credit is so bad, I can't afford to get approved for an apartment. Not to mention that I have NO furniture, pots and pans, nothing. 

I know that I'm the one in the wrong, but can someone please give advice? I don't plan on instigating anything on us getting back together, I know better than that. Just please, I need advice, I'm seriously blacking out because I've been crying so hard, and I have no one else to turn to. :("

I've really taken an interest in old japanese culture after I read 'Shogun' by James Clavell (I recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fictionized novels). 

However, when it comes down to it, I don't really know that much about modern Japan. I don't speak a word Japanese.
I've heard mixed messages: some say Japan is the best country on earth, other's describe it as unwelcoming to Western people.
How will I thrive with just English? How hard is it to get to a personal level and actually make friends?

Now, I realize some of these questions might sound stupid, so I'd like to apologize if they do. Just see me as someone really wanting to go to Japan, but not knowing what to expect.
Thanks for any answers! :D

11pssq,22,2012-10-18,Heartbroken [30m] 7 months after breaking up with the love of my life [27f],[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11pssq/heartbroken_30m_7_months_after_breaking_up_with/,"Last year I was a graduate student at a good school. Toward the end of the spring semester I met two really wonderful women, both 26 at the time. I dated them both very briefly before deciding on the one that I felt serious feelings for. She was the most incredible woman I have ever met: brilliant, beautiful, multilingual, foreign (just a bonus), and the best part was that I she loved me.

At the time I met her, she had a boyfriend. When we began seeing each other, she told me it was already over. I would not have started a relationship with her had she said it wasn't. Because I would never want that to happen to me. It turned out that after a month of dating she had finally told him it was over. Go figure.

A few weeks later, she went out of the country for an internship. We kept in contact through Skype, barring power outages where she was. We spoke daily, and by the end of summer had mutually declared our love for one another and decided to move in together when she returned home. As a surprise, I planned an incredible vacation and met her for 10 days where she was before coming back.

This was the first sign of trouble. When we returned, her ex had decided to wait for her at the airport. I was on a separate flight, so he had no idea I even existed. They talked for several hours until she sent him back home and we spent the night together. He showed up the next day knocking on the door as we pretended not to be there. A few weeks later we moved in together.

Things were incredible for the first month or so. Then she felt the need to call her ex on his birthday against my advice that it would only cause trouble. It caused trouble. It started three months of insecurity, anxiety, anger, and frustration for me while she worked out her issues talking to him on a daily basis. My relationship all but disappeared. The affection was gone, the conversation was gone, the sex was gone. Everything disappeared while she would fight with him at all hours of the day and night. She would tell me it was acceptable to do and that ""the right thing to do is to give him a second chance,"" or ""feelings don't go away overnight."" This was after six months without him and with me.

Naturally, as I thought my relationship was over I reached out to someone to express my frustrations and anger and insecurity. It happened to be the other woman that I had briefly dated and who had become a good platonic friend. She was there for me while my girlfriend was spending the night ""arguing"" with her ex in a hotel room (it happened twice, I still can't prove anything occurred), and through the interspersed physical altercations where she would hit me and throw things at me. I developed a bond with this woman and told her at one point I thought I had made a mistake and had feelings for her. She told me I was just confused and hurting, eventually I agreed with her.

My girlfriend found out what I had said and commenced months of browbeating (physical and mental). I'm not a small man, but I would never hit a woman. So I took it, because calling the police would have ended with her losing her student visa. Something I wouldn't take away from her no matter what she does.

For months she passive-aggressively attacked me for what I had said, taking little or no responsibility for her actions or how they made me feel. All while I apologized profusely and did anything I could think of to make it right. Even when we went on vacation she said ""it's a good thing you're here, something might have happened with so-and-so if you weren't."" I was completely astonished that she could even imagine that, but I was too in love to see the warning signs.

In mid-March of this year I sent her to spend a week with her best friend as a gift. It gave us some time apart to relax and stop fighting. Yet she called me and picked a fight about forgetting to DVR a tv show and that was the end for me. I called it off. After just under a year with a woman I had lived with and almost married, I ended it, and I regretted it immediately.

Within a week of coming back there was already someone else (this is apparently a pattern that has a 10 year history). At this point I was ready to move on, and I did. I went out with friends and began dating after about a month and a half. I was happy and excited to be on my own and feel alive and attractive to someone else.

Then my ex got a hint that someone else was interested and laid a perfectly fashioned guilt trip on me that ended with her ""coming back"" for the months of May and June (and once in July) while she was already in a new relationship that I was unaware of. She kept me under her thumb for six months, up until late September when I finally stopped responding to her emails.

I recently found out from a friend that he had gone through something remarkably similar years ago and told me that the woman he was with had been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I have no doubt the same exists here. I've done the research and every metric for diagnosis fits my ex perfectly. You would think a guy would learn his lesson and run far far away, right? Me too.

As it is, her issues are difficult enough to handle. Insecurity, self-loathing, obsession with physical beauty (I swear on my mother, this girl was a 9 only because no one is perfect), jealousy, low self-esteem, neurosis, and an extreme inability to trust people close to her. It all made sense in the context of this disorder.

My problem is this: It has now been seven months since I ended things. She's in a serious relationship (or as serious as she can get with someone she has an affair with and later cheats on with me) and I feel like I've hit a wall. She did everything she could post-breakup to pull me back in and keep me from going forward until she was able to. It worked. Despite everything that she did (and I'm not perfect either, but I never cheated on her and never laid a hand on her. I yelled a lot because she never gave me time to speak), I still love her. 

I can't seem to get past this. When I met her I fell head-over-heels instantly. I've had serious relationships before that headed toward marriage, but never one that felt like this. How have those of you in serious relationship overcome the heartbreak that comes with losing someone who has changed your life? I've tried everything and I'm out of ideas.


TL;DR: Fell in love with a girl. She was great then treated me terribly. I ended it, I regret it. I'm failing to move on when I know I need to after 7 months without her and a month without speaking to her. Don't know what to do anymore because I feel like I hit a wall."

Recently, for example, a friend pointed out to me that one of my dress shirts is way oversized -- and that was a shirt I've been wearing for two years. I simply have no idea how to tell if my clothes fit well (I've Googled a bit on this matter, and it hasn't helped -- it all still comes down to a matter of judgment -- judgment that I don't seem to possess!). Also, my wardrobe basically consists entirely of two-piece outfits (blouse + dress pants) because I have no clue how to layer or accessorize (no belts!). 

I  recognize that appearance is important, and I'd like to seem put-together and moderately stylish as I embark on my first career. I'm open to hiring a personal shopper (I'd consider it a one-time investment), but I don't know how to go about finding a good, reliable one.

11pj31,4,2012-10-18,Just landed a ridiculous paying job...need to get back to financial planning (USA),PetiePal,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/11pj31/just_landed_a_ridiculous_paying_jobneed_to_get/,"I'll try to be as brief as I can!

I work in the IT industry now down about 8-10 years. (8 if you count my summer internships while still in college). I had 3 full time jobs since graduating and then 3-4 contracting jobs that lasted anywhere from 4 months to over a year. I was laid off last spring from my just-shy-of-5-year-job and spent the summer unemployed. I planned for this with an emergency fund and that coupled with unemployment plus severance I was just fine.

Fast forward to today, I've just started a management position where I'll be pulling in 90k before taxes. I'm about a week into the job and getting all the direct deposit set up and all that. What I was doing prior to June was having my paychecks direct deposited to a checking account, monthly transfers to an ING Direct account and sub accounts for difference uses. I had to transfer over 4k from my 15-20k slowly accruing account for an index fund simply because I needed the amount to float me for a 2 month business trip I'll be taking until I start getting paid in November etc. 

**My Savings**

ING: About 12k across all my ING accounts (Ring savings, investment House Down payment, IEmergency fund, Christmas Gift fund, a separate checking account and a frivolous spending account)

Main Bank: About 10k, I usually keep 5-8k in here ideally or checking, bill auto-pays, checks and debit card and emergency $. My bills are all set to come in in the same week, I have about 7-14 days to review them, then I let them auto-billpay. No late payments ever. (maybe 1-2 car payments way early on, but I've set it all so it never happens again)

Investments: I have 65k in a 401k from my previous employer. Since I really didn't do much with 401ks since graduation, I was really super nervous at 27/28 and tried to ""catch up"" at that job. I deducted 16% from every paycheck for the past near 5 years and put it into a Fidelity account. 

My Debts:

I have no credit card debt. Zero. I rarely use them and I'm really good about only using a card if I can pay it off immediately. My credit score is fairly high too.

Home: I don't own a home, I still live at home but I'm saving up for one. Got a gf, marriage probably within a few years.

Student Loans: About $6600 left. I pay off about $200 a month, until car is paid off. (See next)

Car: I only owe something like 3k on my car left. When my paychecks start coming in, instead of paying the $500 I have been, (more than the minimum), I'm likely going to pay off 1-2k a month and be done with it before years end.

I've come here looking for some advice on how to invest further. 

1. Should I roll over my previous employer 401k to something different like a Roth IRA?
2. I'll be enrolling in the 401k here at my company soon, but I also want to keep saving up to 15k for a Roth IRA account as well as an index fund. Wise? Anything else I should invest in as even with saving I'll have a lot of dispensable income. Property maybe?

I don't spend like a banshee and was making about 60k at my previous job, but with overtime it pushed up into like 75-85 depending on the year. I plan to keep at my same cost of living and use the excess earnings to invest/save instead of upping living expenses etc.

Appreciate all opinions and advice!"

I left that part completely blank. My faxing machine is somewhat unreliable and it took 6 attempts to send to over; and after that, I called to see if they'd received it, had a small chat, etc.

Would it be inappropriate of me to resend the missing elements? This is for an internship with a relatively well known company. My father says that, ""If I'm really concerned, I should just call them up and ask if they really need it"" otherwise leave the situation as is. 

He also told me that if they really wanted to know more, they'd find out by calling me instead.

So, leave it or resend? I believe my resume is strong enough as is, just that tiny part left out."

11pa8x,1,2012-10-18,"Which is more important, money or happiness?",addedpulp,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11pa8x/which_is_more_important_money_or_happiness/,"My girlfriend and I have been having some trouble... so maybe my defensiveness comes from that. I'm also in a fairly crappy position in life; I am a videographer by trade. I got my degree in digital video and film and wanted to make movies, but that's obviously unrealistic, so I used the same equipment and shoot freelance. It sucks. Clients are idiots, everyone wants something for free, and getting paid is like pulling teeth, even with a contract (a wealthy client isn't concerned that a 20-something is going to sue them for under $1000). I am on food benefits at this point. I've been rethinking my goals lately, and since suicide would really bum my family out (a joke... but not really), I'm trying to push my old projects onto the market and put the new films I'd like to do into the fundraising stage so I can get by while making them.

She is a few years younger, just graduated, and can't find a job, paying internship, or afford to apply to grad schools (or has not been accepted to those she's applied to). The schools she applies to would be for jobs she doesn't really care about, but would be reliable and make money (medical field). When her current internship is done in a few months, she'll be back with her family, who won't let her return to retail work until she gets accepted into a school... I guess they think it'll motivate her?

Anyway, she was panicing and I tried to pull the Office Space advice, ""if you could do anything right now, what would it be?"" She told me I was being unrealistic. I told her that's the point, find what makes you happy and then try to make a living doing that. She said money is more important; if she had money, she could take vacations more often. That is how her parents live. I told her I think happiness is more important, and her pushing me to get my shit together is exactly why I'm trying to put some worthwhile projects into production, ones that I feel could sell commercially. Do what makes you happy and make it profitable, not the other way around.

She said ""fine, you chase your dreams, I'll be realistic.""

Is this a reasonable way of thinking?"
11p9y1,10,2012-10-18,"I'm [31M] in a Long-Distance Relationship, and considering moving in with her [22F]",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11p9y1/im_31m_in_a_longdistance_relationship_and/,"**What I want to know is:** On the basis of future chance of success, that being relationship longevity and happiness in same, should I move in with her or not?

**Backstory:** We met this summer, she was on vacation in my country. In total, physically, we have spent about 35 days together since our first meet. This should have increased to ~55 after the new year. Communication happens daily, chat, skype, etc. There have been a few snags, but we are both reasonable people and have worked out the issues as they arose.

She recently finished her education and started a very good, secure, well-paid job in her field.
I only realised relatively late that it was a good idea to have an actual education, so I'll be finishing that up in 2013. In this context, I need an internship in the spring. It would be ideal if I could do this near her, which fortunately has a fair number of businesses relevant to my field.

Working on the presumption that I get an internship in her area, I am considering whether or not to move in with her.

**Upsides:**

* We would most likely spend the majority of free time at either my place or hers anyway.

* I'll be moving thousands of miles and cannot easily bring anything that won't fit in a plane. Seems stupid to start from scratch when she has almost everything (Note that she moved for the job, so much is new.)

* Better diet for both of us.

* Cuddling anytime.

**Potential issues:**

* I don't want to rush the relationship forward excessively. Going from intermittent meets to full-on live-in is a Big Deal.

* She has not tried living in a shared space since her freshman year. I have lived with girlfriends before.

**I am not worried about:**

* Our ages - I guess I may seem a bit younger than the number reflects, and she is definitely a lot more mature/sensible than any locally-sourced 22-year old.

* Money - we are both reasonably well off. I *could* rent my own place without adverse effects.

* Guests - neither of us are big on having friends over.

**TL;DR:** I am considering moving in with the long-distance girlfriend. I want to do what will be best for the relationship. What should I do?"

11p3gc,16,2012-10-18,Depressed... or just plain lazy?,PBNkapamilya,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11p3gc/depressed_or_just_plain_lazy/,"Sorry if this turns out to be quite long, but please do hear me out. Also, all mentions of me being ""depressed"" here are not diagnosed by a professional, but are self-diagnosed (I know the symptoms since I took Basic Psych in my second year, but I might be wrong somewhere). Besides, we're not wealthy enough for me to see a therapist.

I'm studying for a Journalism degree in our country's top university. I almost didn't even make it in: I was put on the Pending list, and I eventually ended up enrolling for the degree I wouldn't even wish on anyone: Mathematics.

I had to take the first major Math subject twice, and failed both instances. (The choice of dropping a subject didn't creep into my mind at the time.) I finally got the message and shifted to Journalism, but not without riding an intensely emotional roller-coaster. I often cried in my summer term because of the guilt I had in trying to hide my failed grades to my parents.

Since then, I have this pattern every semester: excited to meet my new professors and classmates, initially interested in the courses, occasionally procrastinates on school requirements, gets stressed by the things I need to do, procrastinates further, feels nervously depressed with how the grades turn out because I feel that I didn't give it my all, feel a bit relieved that they're not as bad was I thought.

I always fall in this cycle, only that the procrastination and the depression gets worse every semester. The worst bout of depression I had was last summer, when I decided not to take any summer courses. The doom and gloom that I felt was so bad that I felt that taking on classes at the time won't do me any good.

In the semesters after that, it was procrastination that got worse. I got two ""Incomplete"" grades in just one semester. I felt like I haven't got enough motivation to do my school stuff (except when it comes to broadcast journalism, which is my planned career track, but even then, I still need that ""one little push"" to get me moving). I still had my ""down"" moments, but they have slowly lessened in severity each semester. In fact, I was able to go through my summer internship without any major problems. But at times, those ""moments"" also prevent me from doing anything productive.

But here I am, in the last days of my last semester, only taking 14 units of classes (including senior thesis), but still have a fuckton of things to do. In fact, I am barely finished with my data collection for the thesis, and there are still things to be revised with the other sections. My motivation level to finish these things right now is practically zero.

Now don't get me wrong: I do want to graduate and have a steady career in broadcast journalism. I've always pictured myself as a broadcast news reporter and eventually a TV anchor and news opinion host for radio. But right now, I'm afraid that I might not even get to the first steps in getting there.

I'm also having ""micro-bouts"" of depression which rattle my thoughts for at most a minute, but then I'm able to distract my mind to think about something else, but the thoughts that I have during those ""micro-bouts"" are real: am I going to finish this thesis? My other requirements? Am I even going to graduate in peace? These thoughts are going to make me crazy if this keeps up.

So please tell me: **Was and am I really experiencing depressive episodes or am I only making it an excuse for me to procrastinate, especially during this semester?** Am I really depressed, or am I just your regular non-committal college kid? Words of advice, encouragement, and motivation are very much appreciated.

You can be frank with your answers if you need to, but still keep it within this subreddit's guidelines (read them on the sidebar).

Many thanks in advance to those who took their time to read and comment on this.

**TL;DR** I'm a college student who go through cycles of depression and procrastination, and they get worse each semester. I haven't finished my senior thesis and other requirements for my last semester, and thinking about them almost drives me nuts. Am I depressed or just a lazy college kid? Words of advice, encouragement and motivation are very much appreciated.

**Addendum** Just to be clear, I'm not taking any drugs, legal or otherwise, and I don't drink nor smoke. Perhaps my only vice is procrastination by Internet.

Also, I don't experience having suicidal thoughts, but there was one time that I got incredibly close to that point."
11p2er,6,2012-10-18,DAFUQ,gftoofhere,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/11p2er/dafuq/,"So my ex decided it was over and I'm all alone is the simple version. It would have been four years come next month. It started out the same way all good relationships do.. she semi stalked me and I ignored her. Then on a whim I invited her to get dinner. I enjoyed it so much that I asked her to be my girlfriend. We had a wonderful time. Any chance I had to do something for her I would. Also, tons of sex. She was in a sorority and I went to a different school in the area. She would go to frat parties without me and I would worry and get jealous... I would wonder why she wouldn't blow them off and hang with me. She never cheated on me.. I never even had a girlfriend cheat on me, but still I had doubts. All the stories I hear just get to me. Anyways, I would get upset, but do nothing. When we were together I could care less what we were doing. I enjoyed being together. Fast forward a few years. She decides to go to Australia for a semester abroad. I think aw damn if she's going then I wanna go to... but Australia isn't within my budget. Instead I find a program for Panama. My sister had gone to Costa Rica a few years before and loved it, so I figured they are similar and that I should expect the same results. Unfortunately I did not. After a month of being home sick and going mad, I had decided to leave. Everyone had begun taking drugs like cocain, ritalin, etc. I had missed home, I couldnt and still can't speak spanish, and to top it off I felt like I was the only one who couldnt have a good time no matter what. One night I got so angry at this realization that I 1. would have killed myself had a car been driving down the road as I was walking home. and 2. out of a fit of rage I punched my (or rather my [ex]girlfriends) laptop. I shattered the screen and lost all contact with the only people that made me happy. That was when I decided I NEEDED to be on the next plane out. I got back 5 days after my girlfriend had boarded her plane to Australia. During the next 5 months I was out of school alone. The job I left did not take me back like I had been promised. So without work or school I was bored and still depressed from what was left of Panama. I had spend over $10,000 for a month of depression when my family has a lot of debt. This thought kept running through my mind. As I log onto facebook I find that I rarely see a message for me from my girlfriend and she is having the most amazing time. I become angry and jealous. Eventually I end up doing something I am not proud of. I begin to manipulate everything I say to bring her down to my level... So of course we end up fighting. We almost end it there, but I fight for our relationship. I tell her it wont happen again. Unfortunately, my depression decided to block that from my memory and a few weeks later I do it again. This time I admit my faults and try to get past them. She finally comes back. Doesn't seem that grateful to see me. Her father... having payed for her to go out and enjoy herself to the fullest.. hates me for bringing her down. He is not one to let a grudge go. For a good while after that he and I have a palpable tension when together. He would say almost nothing to me. Enough time passes and finally things are back to the way they were. Then one day I go to a dance with her for her sorority. Unfortunately once I get there I start to feel bad. I then say I don't want to go lets just go to the room I don't feel well. (a few times before I would avoid going to the parties once on campus with her because they were full of drunk asses who I couldnt connect with because they had money and were in a much better school and would always look down on me) This time.. on the other hand, I had actually contracted a stomach flu from a recent visitor. I had no idea and neither did she. She began yelling at me saying that I always did ""this"" and that I hate her friends and she wanted to have fun, but I wouldnt let her. I admitted that was partially true, but that this time I had actually wanted to enjoy myself and have fun and that this wasn't ""In my head."" After lying in bed for an hour after this argument I saw my pizza from dinner again... All over my new shoes. Having concrete evidence as to not feeling well she began to apologize for giving me a hard time. She ""didn't mean it."" I am an understanding guy so I said, ""Look its not your fault you didn't know and you had reasons to doubt me."" Still after all that was said and done, I felt that what she said was right and it hurt. The next weeks were tense. I had given it a lot of thought and brought up how upset I was that she had assumed I didn't want to have fun or be with her friends. blah blah blah all the shit she said that hurt me from the conversation. After acknowledging this she and I had wondered if this was where we would end. But again I said no! I will not lose my best friend and love over misunderstanding and petty arguments. A short while after this her father was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. I began to do anything I could to get her mind off it and support her when she was thinking about it. At some point for some reason I cant remember right now, I had wanted to end it. It could have been because I was trying so hard and was getting nothing in return (which I later realized was actually happening through all of this relationship). In any case I wasn't happy. Instead I swallowed my emotions and stuck it through for her so she could have something solid to hold her up at the time. Eventually I had forgotten why I wanted to end it and we were both happy again.. kind of. How happy can one be when one's dad is given a death certificate. Well as time goes on she goes out with her friends and gets drunk past her limits whenever I am with her (fyi every time we get drinks she has gone past her limits and her mothers side is full of alcoholics) So I worry. Then to top it off her anxiety has her taking zquill to knock herself out for sleep. This causes me to be completely turned off and so the sex comes to a halt and at her birthday she gets too drunk kisses another girl in front of me literally inches away from me.. I'm like DAFUQ I'm right here kiss me! I end up taking care of her that night and all I can think is I go out with her to enjoy myself and every time theres alcohol its this... After a few weeks with no sex drive and a lack of conversation because all I want to do is ""bring her down"" by saying im scared for her and hate what she is doing to herself. She decides to end it. She got into premed and this is how the whole break up worked out:

""We need to talk. (fuck).. I dont feel like we talk anymore. (now I let her proceed because I dont want to flat out tell her I don't like your alcoholic behavior and your drug dependency fucking sounds harsh) You just sit there next to me and when we get in bed you just turn away. You havent kissed me lately. (Which is complete BULL SHIT but when I did kiss her it was met with soft lips no pressure no feel)""

So then I get ready my rebuttal, but before I start she adds in.

""Besides this was going to end come January."" (premed starts)

FUCKING KNIFE IN MY EARS!

this resonates infinitely to this day.
All I can think is WHY? I love this girl and she gets into a program that she brought up has an 80% relationship failure rate.
She knew if she got in it was over! She was accepting defeat before we had a chance to challenge the statistic.

At that point I decided to give up the fight and let her go.

I begin to run the playback reel. Where did I go wrong? Every time I come to the conclusion that it was her. In the end it was her. I wanted to bring her up when she was down I wanted to throw my life away to keep her happy. I lost almost all my friends and did almost nothing during those 4ish years for myself. Yet I still feel like I was an ass.. Like I should have done more or fought for her. I cry from time to time. It was a few weeks ago. And I know it will take more time than a few weeks, but in the mean time I just need some verification that I am not going insane. I need to know how I can move on, find new people, get my life back. I began to look for internships abroad and I am trying to get motivated, but to lose my best friend and the one person I would talk to after everything I did. End class, work, anything and I would call her. Now I have nobody and still get the feeling to call her and share my day, joke, be happy again. What should I do? What more can I do"

In fact, I've had several recruiters (from Apple to SpaceX) outright say that they don't care about GPA. They have said that they look for previous internship experience and, lacking that, extracurriculars such as vehicle teams and research.

We've all heard about extracurriculars being important, but this is the first time I've heard recruiters say they legitimately don't care about GPA. This doesn't mean go out and get yourself a 2.0, but don't work yourself into an early grave via problem sets, midterms and finals trying to get a 3.8+ while not being involved in other areas.
 
**Moral of the story**: If you're not interested in grad school, do something other than coursework (research, vehicle teams) so you get hands-on experience."
11ox6n,17,2012-10-18,I saw my baby! / First Doc Appointment,sallydreams,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/11ox6n/i_saw_my_baby_first_doc_appointment/,"My appointment was at 8:15am. I whined all week about how early it was but was grateful to be able to to be seen and have insurance cover it. I wake up at 6:30am (I was so nervous it was hard to sleep anyway) and magically made it to the appointment EARLY! I have been having nightmares that the ultrasound tech would say I'm just getting fat, tell me to eat less and send me home.

I peed in a cup before the doctor would even see me after filling out some paperwork. I get shuffled down to ultrasound and they have a huge tv set up on the wall so I could see. I laid down and she warned me the goo would be warm. I was glad it wasn't icy cold like I always hear about. Well, she put the wand on my stomach at first and for a few seconds I didn't see anything so I started to get nervous that my dreams were true and then she pushed a bit more and there was a little skeleton burping up bubbles. ""Ah, there is the little baby."" She said. 

My jaw dropped. I mean, I *knew* I was pregnant but since my morning sickness had pretty much gone away and I don't feel like death at the start of each day I thought that maybe I was making it up? That maybe I wasn't pregnant? ""Did you not know you were pregnant?"" she asked. I told her I had been having those dreams about being fat and she let out a belly laugh and her two interns laughed too. They all chimed in talking about the cute little skeleton bobbing around in my belly.

The ultrasound tech applied a lot of pressure poking and prodding the infant to turn towards us or atleast loosen up. Poor little thing was in a tight fetal position as soon as it realized we were peeping in on 'em. So no gender yet. :( But it's okay, my Hubby doesn't want to know and I really do... so I said the baby must have heard that the dad doesn't want to know. They're already plotting against me! That doesn't seem fair. hah. Well, the ultrasound tech just let me stare at the very busy body inside of me (when this baby gains some weight I'm going to be in misery. Kicking, doing flips, shadow boxing and having fun while doing so.) I was amazed I couldn't feel ANY of it. The tech said that the jabbing pelvic pains are most likely the baby stretching out because of how low s/he is. She said that everything is looking good, week 16 (my guesstamation was correct) and my due date is April 1st.

I then saw the doctor and she did a pap smear and I TOTALLY forgot all the questions that I had for her. Ladies-- all of those books and blogs and websites say make a list of questions and DO IT! I wish I had. I ended up asking my mom after the visit and she lectured me on making a list for the next visit. After the pap smear the doctor said that I would experience some ""light bleeding"" and not to worry about it and that bleeding after sex is common because I have a soft cervix. Well, after the doctor left I stood up to get dressed and blood ran down my leg. 

I was so embarrassed and I was by myself. I cleaned myself up and ran to the bathroom between the ultrasound tech pushing on my lower pelvic area and the doctor propping me open I had to pee so bad. Then they took I swear a pint of blood for lab work. 

O yeah! Everyone I saw asked me if I had some spotting my first trimester. Apparently it's very, very common. I was freaked out and I told the Doctor that I googled it to death and basically bleeding is normal or a miscarriage. She agreed with that. She said, ""Bleeding in the first trimester is very common. Sadly, if it's the start of a miscarrage running to me won't make it stop. There isn't much we can do."" So ladies-- light spotting during the first trimester is common. Light as in **not** like a period and **not** lasting for days at a time. That was my major worry when I didn't go to the doctor. This is my first pregnancy. This is completely new to me. I just wanted to pass that along. But again, I'm not a doctor and she did say bleeding is either completely fine or absolutely not but only time will tell. So honestly, I say no need to stress about it because however it's going to end up will be but I know I was worried until I just decided I was only hurting myself with the guilt. Stay strong ladies! We're all in this battle together!!

**Class**: Gym Leader (Scientist)

**Gender**: Female

**Age**: 27

**Hometown**: Cinnabar Island, Kanto

**Team**:

**Vita-001 - Porygon-Z**

*Level 65*

Initially obtained as a Porygon given to her while she was still a researching intern, Vita was her first Pokemon. Dyna optimized everything that she possibly could, and as a result of maybe spending too many hours on the computer, they more or less have an inseparable bond.

**Frost - Castform**

*Male, Level 47*

Donated to the laboratory for a weather research project, Dyna was able to keep Frost after the project concluded. Rather mischievous in nature, he would occasionally zap Dyna to let her know that she's been working on something for too long.

**Reno - Muk**

*Male, Level 53*

Reno was caught as a Grimer, who at the time, was feeding off of the sludge coming out of the lab's exhaust pipes. He's generally laid-back, and will often fight defensively during battles, simply tanking hits until the time is right.

**Tesla - Magnezone**

*Level 58*

Tesla was originally caught as a Magneton wandering around the Kanto Power Plant. Incredibly loyal, he's Dyna's main mode of transport. If she ever has to go somewhere far, she just sits on top and away they go.

**Bio**:

Growing up on Cinnabar Island, Dyna always had an interest in science. In her mind, it didn't even matter what kind. Just the interest in experimenting and discovering was good enough for her. Wanting to enter the scientific field, she became a researching intern at the Pokemon Laboratory while attending university. It was at this time that Vita was given to her, and not too long afterwards, she graduated, and began to research at the lab full-time.

When the volcano erupted, however, her firm within the lab, Tachyon Research, relocated to a building right by the Kanto Power Plant. It was there that she and the other scientists began to have Pokemon battles when they were getting bored of researching. Eventually, they organized themselves and set up the Science Gym, a gym not devoted to a single Pokemon type, but rather, a gym that assists Pokemon's abilities through the power of science. Some say that due to the prevalence of the scientists here using research-based Pokemon such as Porygon, it is associated with Pokemon that convert or transform. Dyna was selected as the Gym Leader, as she had a bit more experience with battling and its mechanics than the rest of the scientists there.

Currently, when Dyna isn't enveloped in her various research projects, she accepts new challengers all the time, and on occasion, she would travel around, because let's face it, there's a whole world of science out there.

**Appearance**:

Standing at about 5'9"", she has pale skin, long straight dark-blue hair, and eyes with the same shade of blue. Having a very thin build, she always wears a lab coat. Always. Science never stops, so the lab coat stays on, but she keeps it open, revealing a button-down white shirt, a loose-fitting red necktie, and formal-looking black pants.

**Personality**:

Beyond all else, she's one hell of an introvert. You would be lucky to get more than five words out of her during the course of going for her badge, and you would get maybe five more words even if you knew her already. She may even come off as cold or uncaring, but in reality, she really does care about those she's close to, especially her Pokemon.

((OOC Notes: Yup, it's a new gym. If you don't like the idea of a new gym, no one's telling you to acknowledge it. But it is my hope that you do like it. :3))"

11oli1,0,2012-10-18,I am a 6th year college student who is paying for everything himself and have absolutely no pity for those who are saddled under debt. AMA,[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11oli1/i_am_a_6th_year_college_student_who_is_paying_for/,"**TL;DR at the bottom**

I'll prove it however you guys would like, just ask.

Title is not to be taken as fighting words with those of you who have taken on debt; you made a financial decision (and should have done so after weighing the risks and benefits) and you are going to enjoy the benefits and suffer the drawbacks of that decision for a long time.

About me: I moved out of my parents house two weeks into my senior year of high school (I've always been really independent I guess) and supported myself with only a small loan from a family member to get on my feet (which I promptly repaid) while maintaining a 4.0 GPA in HS, working two jobs, and driving 45 miles each way to a College three mornings a week to take college classes, where I earned 12 hours of 4.0 credit that I had already checked would transfer to my university. I'm in my 6th academic year of College (took what would have been my 6th and 9th semesters off to work and it's the first semester of the year, so really I'm in my 9th semester now) and I have 3-5 semesters left after this one depending on how quickly I finish out my classes.

I'm taking a degree in Engineering with a minor in Arabic (could come in useful, amazing language to learn and ties into many great cultural revelations), so let's assume that when I get out of school getting a job won't be *too* difficult. Furthermore, with my projected salary right out of school, 5 years, and 10 years down the road I would have likely been able to pay back my loans if I had taken some out, but I chose to remain debt free and not saddle my parents, a bank, or the government with the cost of my education if I didn't complete it. 

I also currently receive next to nothing in Financial Aid because I am a white male with middle class parents (one of which has left me unable to file a FAFSA for years, this coming year will be my first as I'm old enough to be able to declare myself independent according to the government). I do not want the white male thing to be a fighting point, I'm over it, and I don't blame people for taking advantage of programs they qualify for, I just think those programs should be evenly distributed. 

My first 5 semesters of school were completely paid for (including most of my living expenses) by a combination of state scholarships I received for my ACT score (34 on a max 36 scale, my graduating year of HS that was top 99.4% in my state) and working in the University Dorms (paid for my living expenses minus food and car-related things). One semester I even received a $2,400 rebate from the unused cash portion of my scholarship. I invested half of that into a 15 year old motorcycle (nothing flashy or loud, completely stock, no upgrades made either) as I calculated that with the 400 mile a week commute I was getting ready to make in the 8 month internships I was preparing to take it would pay for itself in gas savings (it did, and then some. I came out about $100 on top and owning a motorcycle after factoring in insurance, registration, gear, etc).

The thing that drives me crazy is that people who took on $50k+ of debt (and this is at my state school) to do a liberal arts degree or something similar are surprised that they are having trouble paying their loans back (loans that they should have known the terms of, ignorance is no excuse). My best friend got his bachelors in Sociology over a year ago and has yet to find work in his field. He knew that his degree wasn't worth much but did Sociology because it was easy and he didn't know what else to do (and didn't take time off to think it over). He's my bro, but I'm not really all that sympathetic that he's working at a sports camp getting $11/hour, I saw how easy his experience was compared to mine, and he was lucky enough to have parents who built a college fund that paid for everything.

I have friends in Engineering who have left school with $80k in debt because they put their entire education on loans, including living and recreational expenses. They're making $50-$60k a year and I watch them barely chip away at their debt and it astounds me.

I've learned to live completely within my means. I have had a credit card for years and I have never carried a balance on it. If I do not have the money for something (or don't know I will quickly) I do not purchase things. I use cash for 95% of the things I do because you really feel it when you're handing over notes that you remember getting a few days or weeks earlier at the end of a long day of hard work. I live in a converted (by me) garage that is cordoned into a large workshop and a small bedroom, in a house of four room mates. Instead of spending $700-$1,000 a month on rent, bills, cable, etc like some of my friends do, I pay about $400 a month for rent, electricity, water, gas, and internet, all because I'm willing to put up with a less glamorous home that I can afford. I drive a beat up truck that doubles as my work truck that I paid cash for (just like the two vehicles before it) and that I spend a few hours a month maintaining myself so the dollars I put into it will go farther. I've calculated the monthly non-gas cost of my vehicles over the 8 years I've been driving to have been less than $100 including maintenance. I also meticulously budget everything I do so that I know where I can save money.

I started my own business building furniture, gardens, greenhouses, etc with just a Power drill and an old $20 corded saw. In the less than two years I've been at it I've built up a workshop full of tools valued (and insured) at over $20k. I netted about $25k last year and am on track to get close to or exceed $40k this year. I work for myself precisely because I need a job that pays well (you reap what you sow) and works around my school schedule.

I also only take as many classes as I can afford any semester. If I do not have at least 2/3 of the tuition charge before classes start, I do not sign up for them. Period. (The look on a Bursars Office clerk when you come in and pay your entire bill in $100 bills is pretty entertaining). This has delayed me as some classes are only offered once a year, but I've come to terms with that. Before I started working for myself I also planned my classes out based on my projected budget and took two semesters off where I could to intern or work. In one internship I was paid almost $20k over 8 months (spring semester and the summer). I managed to bring over $9k of that back to school with me and pay for a lot of tuition with it, something few my age have the self-control to do.

I feel like the entire experience the last 6 years has given me a HUGE boost in self confidence and the knowledge that I **can** do anything I set my mind to. I also feel very proud when I am telling my story to someone from a previous generation and earn their respect for my hard work (I was raised and believe greatly in deep respect for elders).

Please AMA, share experiences, lessons learned (especially you older redditors), and I'd love to hear from people who are voluntarily in a similar situation as myself.

**TL;DR: My college experience will take 3-4 years more than it otherwise would have, but I'm 100% debt free, self supporting, and am self employed making close to $40k a year while in school.**"

I am a senior in college concentrating in accounting and minoring in finance.

I graduate in the spring and I will have my 150 hours required to sit for the CPA exam. 

My culmulative gpa is 2.6 (switched from engineering, really messed me up), my major gpa is 3.2 (this is the gpa I put on my resume labeled 'major gpa').

I have nothing else of particular interest on my resume other than a little bit of work I did myself for people related to computers, etc.. 

i.e. I have no professional internship experience.

Recently went to the career fair aimed at accounting and finance students a couple of weeks ago, I talked it up with everyone, I thought I did pretty well there. I also talked to them weeks leading up to the career fair at the accounting club meetings we have. I knew I would have to get my name out there as much as I could considering my piss poor resume.

All to no avail I suppose, I got no replies back, probably my low GPA keeping me out coupled with my lack of experience. This is also a school where all the big guys along with small heavily recruit at, so things are looking pretty grim if I can't even get a bite..

So now I'm asking you guys, what are my other options? I'm constantly applying for every posting I see related to the accounting field, specifically audit when I can but general accounting/finance positions as well. I'm looking at all companies big, small, accounting firms, corporate positions. 

I just want to get my foot in the door. I'm willing to work for free as long as it may lead up to a full time position by fall. Should I e-mail companies offering to work for free to gain experience in the field, attached with my resume? If so, how should I go about it? "

They wanted me to become a lawyer, and told me I should major in political science in order to go to law school. I was the first person in my family to go to college (parents were immigrants who didn't complete high school), and so I didn't have any mentors or people who could give me advice on majors or career fields. It wasn't what I wanted to do, but I stuck with it. My senior year though, I finished the major courses early so I took other classes I felt were fun such as CS courses. I had taken the LSAT and gotten ready to apply to law school, but I decided that it just wasn't prudent to bring myself further into debt for a career that I knew I was going to hate. I fought with my parents, and got them to see things my way. Except now I was stuck with a degree that had no utility for the kind of work I wanted to do. Most of my internships and experience were political science related. 

I'm having a hard time finding a job, so I've started to slowly teach myself more programming through various online resources in my spare time. But I talked to a friend, and he suggested that I just take a few courses at a local community college and apply for a Masters program in CS. It seems like a good idea, but I wanted to get more people's opinion. Is it common/possible for someone like me with a minimal background in CS to obtain a MS in CS? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

About a month ago, my boyfriend of 6 years and I broke up. It was mutual and amicable and fine, and nothing really happened to cause it; it just ran its course, and we both agreed that it had, so we broke up. It was the first relationship each of us had ever had.
It's really kind of a shame we couldn't work it out; we tried so hard, and we're both quite stubborn and goal-oriented people, so we really thought we could hack it. But I think we just discovered that we aren't the same people we were at 15, when we started dating. Not that we don't still admire each other, and enjoy each other's company--I still think he's amazing, and probably one of the best and most intelligent and good-hearted people I know--but it was just a case of priorities and life circumstances diverging irreparably. We grew up, but we didn't really grow together. Probably to be expected, but still regrettable. After 6 years of a really amazing friendship and wonderful relationship, if we couldn't make that work, how do you know you can make anything work? If that wasn't It, with a capital I, will I know It when I see it?
I think one of my fundamental weaknesses (or perhaps it's a strength? Or can be, sometimes?) is that I don't really want to start something unless I know, absolutely, that I can pull it off better than anyone in the world. I stick to the field where I know I can succeed. I don't want to step into the editorial field unless I can get NYC internships and articles written about my work and glowing letters of recommendation and a better job next time; I don't want to write unless I can get published in journals, in the New York Times, etc. So to fail at something that I thought I could force into working--I thought we had it figured out--it's unsettling. It makes me feel like it's the one area where I can't really avoid failure. Which is terrifying. It means, basically, that I have to get used to failing many, many times, or I will be alone. Unlike editing, or writing essays, this is not a talent-based skill set. Or a skill-based skill set. It's trial and error, and sometimes it's nobody's fault when it doesn't work out. I don't quite know what to do with that.
I don't mean to intellectualize this, or over-think it, and it occurs to me that it probably sounds like I'm drunk or on amphetamines or something. :) I'm not. It's just the first time I've really thought about it. I'm 21 and I'm about to have to start dating again, after what feels kind of like a marriage falling apart. I have to get used to the idea that I can't get everything right the first time.
So that's where things are, I guess; it's all fine, and I'm so glad that he and I are still on great terms and speak regularly and it was a very very amicable split. I'm just freaked out that this is the first thing I've encountered that I can't negotiate or intellectualize or rationalize my way into success.
Is this something I can get used to? Is there a way to be successful at this, other than random luck? I don't know how to even begin to try."

I don't want to step into the editorial field unless I can get NYC internships and articles written about my work and glowing letters of recommendation and a better job next time; I don't want to write unless I can get published in journals, in the New York Times, etc. So to fail at something that I thought I could force into working--I thought we had it figured out--it's unsettling. It makes me feel like it's the one area where I can't really avoid failure. Which is terrifying. It means, basically, that I have to get used to failing many, many times, or I will be alone. Unlike editing, or writing essays, this is not a talent-based skill set. Or a skill-based skill set. It's trial and error, and sometimes it's nobody's fault when it doesn't work out. I don't quite know what to do with that. 

I don't mean to intellectualize this, or over-think it, and it occurs to me that it probably sounds like I'm drunk or on amphetamines or something. :) I'm not. It's just the first time I've really thought about it. I'm 21 and I'm about to have to start dating again, after what feels kind of like a marriage falling apart. I have to get used to the idea that I can't get everything right the first time. 

So that's where things are, I guess; it's all fine, and I'm so glad that he and I are still on great terms and speak regularly and it was a very very amicable split. I'm just freaked out that this is the first thing I've encountered that I can't negotiate or intellectualize or rationalize my way into success. 

Is this something I can get used to? Is there a way to be successful at this, other than random luck? I don't know how to even begin to try. "

Hi everyone. I've been an intern at the NFL Network for a bit now, and the previous 6 or so years before that (Starting in high school) I began working as a PA/Utility in live sports broadcasting with odd (and unpaid) jobs with FOX Sports and ESPN here and there. I'm by no means a seasoned expert on how the TV business works compared to the rest of my coworkers (some of them have been working together since ""In Living Color"" was around), but I feel like I've got a decent enough handle on the culture of the industry that I can answer some questions about what it's like to work both at NFLN and in the business as a whole."

So not explicitly my field, but was the best I could find at the time and now I enjoy it.  I'm not making a great hourly wage, but was just instrumental in designing a .5 million dollar job that is between 25-50% profit.

I've been best friends with her for over two years.  We spend time together at least five days a week on average.  When we do spend time together it is for hours.  Almost everyone that doesn't know us well thinks we are dating, my father thought we were.  The ""really good relationship"" and ""Best couple"" comments come regularly.  We actually openly express our love for each other, which really makes it worse.  I've probably fallen for her four or five times and ""fixed"", aka buried, the problem knowing it is too risky and likely would only destroy what we have.

She was acting strange the days leading up to this past New Years and finally told me that it was because she wanted to be with me.  I of course respond that with something along the lines of ""about time.""  We become a couple which really changes nothing except for the physical affection, which she does and tolerates despite never being that kind of girl.  After a couple of days we spend the night together once, didn't do anything other than make out.  Other than the kissing this wouldn't be out of the ordinary for us.  The next morning I know her well enough to tell immediately that her opinion on the subject of ""us"" has changed.  She wants to go back to being friends.  I'm hurt but honestly not surprised.  She has never been big into relationships.  

Time passes shit is basically normal.
This past summer I had an internship and had to leave for six weeks and couldn't communicate regularly, sometimes only via email.  I've never missed another human being so much in my entire life. She told me how much she missed me also, not to mention She cried when I left and when I came back.  This girl is proud as fuck and does not cry so that's a big deal.  

I'll be graduating college in a few months and have a few prospects that will take me away from here and her.  I've lost too much sleep over this.  Telling her how I feel will change our relationship one way or another.  She isn't very girly, no she isn't a lesbian, and so we don't do feelings talk very often.  The feelings conversations make her more uncomfortable than me.  I know she wouldn't just be able to pull a ""ehhh I don't think of you that way"" back to watching TV kind of rejection.  It would be awkward city for weeks.  
Blarrrggg! Stupid feelings.  I dunno.

I am writing this to confirm to those who wonder if the Wall Street crowd really are the jerky/arrogant types of people that you think they are when you are Occupying Wall Street, etc. My short answer? Yes and then some. As a recent college graduate (and a female), I feel quite out of place at these things and their searing stares don't make me feel any better about it. So here is a quick list of what I've learned:

1) They hate journalists of any type, no matter how innocent looking you are. In their defense, in some cases I would hate journalists too for our sneaky nature of gathering information not made for the public ear. However, practically running away from me like I have the plague as soon as they see my name tag and the word ""magazine"" on it is a little extreme. Do you think I really care about your opinion on the Yankees? Quick let me grab my recorder and shame you across the country. Please. I don't care and it's so rude that they give me these snarky looks all the time. How can you hate me when you don't even know me?

2) They especially hate poor people. Seriously, it just complicates things for their pensions. The jokes at those who are unfortunate's expense? Numerous and (no pun intended) very poor in taste. In fact, just today at one of these luncheons, someone who holds a prominent position in a chemical company that easily makes 6 figures (this information is readily available to anyone on the US's SEC web site) that was making a presentation about a recent acquisition said, and I quote ""We gave presentations to all of our locations about the acquisition, except for Fiji because there are just poor people there."" ::insert pretentious laugh and cigar flick::

2) They would rather hold conversations with their ipads, blackberries, iphones, virtual bank accounts, robot ball-scratchers, etc. than any human being. Seriously, even during presentations carefully planned out and worked hard on by unpaid interns these people would be texting, typing, even talking on the phone during it! At least leave the room jeeze. (I love my technology too don't get me wrong but this isn't a Biology 101 class although you are probably going to hook up with a 20 year old later.)

3) Women either have no interest in chemicals, or they just aren't getting the higher paid positions. Seriously at 90% of these things I am either the only woman there or 1 of very few. And the youngest by at least 20 years. Out of the 150 highest grossing chemical companies in the world, there is 1 female CEO. 1!!! Makes me sick.

4) I won't even go into the nitty gritty details of what companies like Monsanto are putting in your food. I'm telling you, you don't want to know. Oh and don't drink Snapple. The ""best stuff on earth"" is not the best, but it most certainly is ""stuff.""

I am sure you spend a great deal of your time pouring through letters written to you by your constituents. However I would like to pick your brain on a few issues that are very close to my heart, if you could please spare the time.

Right now I do not live in Colorado but for quite sometime I have wanted to move to your great state for quite sometime. 
The reason I am contacting you is because of your specific specialization(s) and knowledge of areas involving mental health. 

Senator I have been diagnosed basically since I could talk as having OCD. This meant things like washing my hands until they bled, checking, re-checking and checking things again and again. 

However as the years ticked by my diagnosis grew to also accompany Bipolar/GAD I also happened to develop Ulcerative Colitis the red headed step child to Crohn's disease. I can give you a list of prescription medications that my doctors have tried and kept me on which is a mile long. 

But here is the kicker Senator - Out of all these pills that these pharmacies are pushing down my throat. Do you want to know what really works the best to help alleviate my anxiety, balance out my mood and relieve my achy gut? Cannabis has. Cannabis has worked for me where modern medicine has failed.

Senator I think before I go on it is very important to note that I have a very solid educational background, I currently hold a Bachelor's in Behavioral and Community sciences. I graduated on the dean's list with a 4.0 GPA my last two semesters in college. I did a law enforcement internship that focused on the regulation of Alcohol and Tobacco on the state level. I have even passed the several federal leo test. 

Senator I would like to point out that because I have always wanted to work in law enforcement I steered clear of illicit drugs my entire life. That however does not mean I have not consumed vast quantities of alcohol. I am irritated to NO END that alcohol is legal and cannabis is not. I mean look I am a nerd, I would much rather smoke some cannabis and listen to Carl Sagan lecture about the universe than sit in a bar and cheer on a sports team while pounding brews. But in my current state that makes me a ""BAD GUY"".

Sir when I was growing up I was taught that America is a land of opportunity and right now I am seeing the chance of a big opportunity in Colorado. Right now I am a college educated kid working a low skill low wage job. The opportunity to move to Colorado and be part of an expanding enterprise that I am a passionate advocate of would be a dream come true. 

What are your thoughts?

Sincerely    ,

Which I need as I plan on graduating Fall 2013

I joined our school's racing team sophmore year to try and gain some experience but the communication among the operations team members and team leader was so atrociously bad.  I only wound up ordering one part for them before I stopped getting emails and just quit.  I'd like incorporate that as a learning experience of the value of communication but I'm not sure how I would work that in.  I don't want to just say yeah I was part of this one club I ordered 1 part.

I did a study abroad last summer in London which was fantastic. I learned much about English culture along with other European cultures.

I'm currently in my school's econ club as a team member but we don't really do anything there other than go to seminars (at least so far).

I've tried to contact professors who I went on study abroad with if they know of any research opportunities but they never got back to me.

I'm not sure where I could go to find some relevant extracurricular things.  Any suggestions?"

-Intro to the Mental Health Field
-Psych Statistics
-Experimental Methods
-Seminar in Psychological Counseling 
-Neuroscience
-Topics in Developmental Psychology

I will be continuing my studies next semester, with a minor in Forensic Science. I'm very interested in Clinical, but also Forensic Psychology. My advisor recommend that I look into Clinical Forensic Psychology PhD programs.

But I know these are competitive. My overall GPA is a 3.6, but my psych GPA is a 3.9. I know that most programs look for around a 3.6/3.7 as their average score for the applicants they choose, so this worries me. What can I do to really make my application stand out??

In the late winter of 2012-winter 2013, I will be working on a research internship with a professor (possibly 2 different research internships). I will be doing 2 clinical internships. One will be with the National Alliance of Mental Illness. I will be shadowing several people, as well as working with staff to put together a convention in the Fall (amongst other various tasks). I have this internship. I'm unsure as to what the other would be, as that is further in the future. 

I'm also going to be writing a thesis my senior year. What else can I do to make my application stand out for grad schools? I also work 2 unrelated jobs (Manage a radio station, and intern as an analyst for a financial consulting company). I don't know if that will help my application.

ONE LAST QUESTION: I was also looking into the Masters route. I feel as though that would be settling, but that it may be the more sensible option. If anyone can recommend any great schools (that I may be able to get into) in the North East, that'd be great. I'm currently looking into:

-John Jay

As would be expected after an evening of such excess,  my mind found itself slowly reassembling the night’s events with terrible difficulty.   I decided to start at the beginning because my memory was draped in the heavy fog  of a mountaintop sunrise.
 
Yesterday began as so many days do, with an alarm, a tap of the snooze button, a warm morning cuddle with my sweet man, Ryan, and finally, a reluctant ramble to the shower to wash away the last of lingering sleep.   As I stepped over the clawfoot tub to reach for a towel, Ryan came into the bathroom, grabbed me, pressed my body, face first, into the wall and began to rub his crowing cock against my hind end.  This was an unusually gruff gesture on his part, but we had not seen much of one another lately;  the time we did spend together was dedicated almost entirely to sleeping or studying.  We are both interns in our third year of residency, and our sex life had consequently suffered.  I was late but also much too physically unrequited to stop him.  His mouth pressed to my neck and, my hands groping at the wall, we fell into rhythm with one another.  I gasped, moaned and found myself exploding with pleasure in moments.  As my eyes refocused I saw that my legs and the basin of the tub were decorated with carmine rivulets of blood  but abstained from commenting;  we were long overdue and I was not going to stop a much needed fix simply because my period had arrived at a most inopportune moment.

“You’re bleeding.”

Ryan rasped with a tinge of excitement and his thrusting grew in urgency.  I began to ache in my lower abdomen until sharp pains began to accompany each inward stroke.  I wanted him to finish and tried to stick it out.  His hand was pushing my head into the wall and downward, I could see that  his movements were so  harsh that the blood began to spatter in grotesque protest against the wall and the shower curtain.  The measure of Ryan’s breathing changed, deepened and slowed in awkward  and unexpected juxtaposition to his evermore frantic and quickening  plunges.  His elbow was now jabbing my spine and my cheekbone was smacking against the wall each time he pressed against me.  I began to feel fear.  My eyes wetted and I could not make myself want him anymore.

“Ryan. You’re hurting me, please stop for a second…”

“You’re bleeding.”

Only this time the words were spoken in an ominous tone and, strangely, echoed.  Ryan’s voice was heavy and inhuman – too deep to come from a man’s lungs and voicebox – those vibrations just don’t happen without a more resonant instrument.  His left hand moved to my neck.  I instinctively arched away from his tracheal compression and my neck found itself in his mouth.  

“Ryan…”  

It was a plea delivered as a hoarse squeak.  He bit my trapezius as if tearing into a steak when ravenously hungry and I knew from the sudden rush of heat that he had cleaved the skin.  I was becoming disoriented and oxygen deprived, my vision became filled with the bright floating lights of brain death.  I could no longer hold myself up, much less struggle against him.  Just before my asphyxiated body succumbed to sleep, he turned me toward him, allowing me to gasp.  My throat felt jagged and the intake of air was painful, as if each molecule were slicing my windpipe.  The lights on my eyelids danced away, jubilant to escape I am sure, and I saw him.  His mouth was rimmed in blood.  MY blood. His lips were set in a malignant smile.  His skin was so pale he appeared dead and his eyes were no longer the gray blue peepers that reminded of beach days in Maine but instead, vacuous caves, wet, too large and greedy.  He breathed on my mouth and I realized I was tasting the smell of my own flesh.  He grasped me by the throat again and I blacked out with a mind void of any thought except acknowledgement that my death was imminent. 
 
And now it’s tomorrow.

Boyfriend left me to move to San Francisco for his internship.. then I got kicked out from my house by my dad for being gay. Then a week later my dad passed away unexpectedly without any kind of sign. This all followed by financial crisis and severe depression lasting couple months, and ex cuts off all communication. I don't live with my mom, just my sisters, so we had to pick ourselves up even though we didn't know what to do.

I am glad to say that I am finally doing a lot better, but I am still recovering. My dad and my ex are the first things I wake up to think about and the last things I think about before going to sleep... too bad they don't think about me, I have to accept this and move on.

How about you?,tmag14,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/11qxkq/i_think_i_worked_in_the_best_worst_field_for/,"Recently at a Young Peoples meeting we were reading To the Employer and it made me think about my past.  I'm very young at age 21 so all my work has been internships or part-time jobs. 

I interned/worked in a field for 2 years that tolerated lying, encouraged manipulation, provided free alcohol (often) to anyone regardless of age, surrounded by big egos, surrounded by many other alcoholics, able to get out of trouble if caught, and just a huge **work hard, play hard attitude**.  That field is politics.

Working in politics as a campaign staffer and Capitol Hill intern definitely enabled and progressed my alcoholism.  While working on the campaign we would end every day by getting drunk in the office off of beer paid for by donors.  My boss (current Congressman) would drink a whole bottle of liquor when he drank.  His boss (a political boss) would get drunk every night at parties or by himself and drive around drunk.  Anytime he got caught by police he would just tell them who he is and get out of everything.  Additionally, working for the campaign made me feel like it's okay to get wasted like that because I'm doing something ""prestigious"" and working with powerful people.

It got worse on Capitol Hill.  Everyday as an intern I would get invited to attend all you can drink happy hours or receptions that were free.  One the first day of work my boss on Capitol Hill told me if I'm ever too hungover and need to come in late to just email him and that it's no problem.  We drank in the office and drinking at lunch was completely normal for Congressman, Staffers, and Interns.  When I would do stupid stuff the night before I would justify it by saying ""I work for a fucking Congressman in DC, I'm doing pretty good in life."" or ""It's ok to get wasted everyday, because I'm wearing a suit."".  Of course, one day I woke up on a bench in downtown DC after a Thursday night spent clubbing.  

Glad I'm not involved in politics anymore.

Anyone else have stories of jobs that were enabling? "

Other Info:

History: 

Starting off in his hometown of Hoenn Alec always knew he wanted to be a trainer, and more than that, a master. So the day he turned 12 he convinced his parents to send him to Littleroot to meet professor Birch. On the way there he stopped in Petalburg and ran into Steven (at the time Alec wasn’t aware he was champion). He stayed with Steven for a few days and talked and befriended him. Steven taught him a few tricks for training. After receiving a call he informed Alec he had to leave and wished him luck and Alec continued to Littleroot, arriving later that day. Birch was waiting for Alec and accepted him as an intern to work with him. Alec worked under Birch for 3 years, learning all about Pokémon and their strengths and weaknesses. He also befriended a kind little Mudkip during his internship. At 16 Birch gave Alec the Mudkip as a parting gift, and Alec set out on his adventure to become a master. After 3 years traveling quite a way around the lands Alec has acquired an powerful team each of which he has an strong emotional bond with. (Has other pokemon in his PC, but these 6 are his favorite). Also while in the Sinnoh region Alec ran into a beautiful Pokémon coordinator named Kriss they quickly hit it off. He is a fierce fighter being very analytical of every move made. Very strong offensive team and strategy.

Appearance: 

Alec is about 5’10”-11” with a medium build. He has dark brown hair that comes to right above his eyes. He generally wears jeans, with a white shirt, usually a light jacket over that. He keeps a plain appearance to avoid attraction. He has dark brown eyes with a ring of light green on the outside.

More OOC: So I think I've covered all my bases in the Newbie guide. Hope I can be a good member to the community. "
11qpi4,5,2012-10-19,Just clearing my head,[deleted],freeposting,https://www.reddit.com/r/freeposting/comments/11qpi4/just_clearing_my_head/,"I have wanted to voice this for so long but had no avenue.

I always wanted to do something to make the world a better place and in my last three years of high school, found friends that were the same.  We didn't want to just accumulate wealth, but to use what we had to help others.


Out of our group of 8, one teaches troubled youth to rock climb/kayak/abseil/etc, one is completing midwifery studies and is set to go to developing countries and help in this way, another is an occupational therapist in mental health.  Most of us have done something.  I went into youth work.  One of us went to study architecture, but also volunteered with some other charities.

The architect ended up putting his studies on hold to intern with the same organisation I was with, but in a different city.
We talked briefly about this, but both of us got too busy and didn't talk for a couple of years.

While this went on, I got to know the head of our branch a little better, and it became evident that the stuff he was doing was no longer about the kids, and had became about making a name for himself.  It was clouding his judgement and I was distraught.  Money we didn't really have was being spent on running big events &amp; the kids we were meant to be looking after were coming second to doing cool shit.  

I left the organisation because it all got too much.  I won't go into detail because this story is not about that.

I wondered what things were like for the architect.  I kept saying ""next time I see him, we'll talk to him about this.""  
I said it for two years and never saw him.
I never got to see him, ever again.

At the start of this year, he died.  He died young in an absolutely horrific accident.  

I flew down to the funeral and they all talked about the great things he had been doing within the organisation.  All the hours he put in.  I had always said he was one of the most passionate, caring people I had ever met.  That was just him.  But they painted him as though it had started for him with all these jobs he was doing and all these events he was running.  

I didn't say anything bad of it, because my experiences are not necessarily his.  But in the back of my mind, I can't help but wonder how he was doing before he died.  I want to ask him if he was ever as worn down as I got.  I want to ask him if he could come back if he would choose to do it again.  I want to ask him if he thinks I was wrong to turn my back on it.  I want to tell him I'm sorry for not staying in touch and for not getting him a birthday present that year he got me one.  I want to tell him that I think about him every single day because of all of us, he was the strongest in every way, and the least selfish.  It's been a while, but it still doesn't seem real.


But he's gone, so I can't.
And I can't talk to anyone about this,  because so many of the things I struggle with about all this are the same things that are his legacy.  They're the same things that make him a hero in the eyes of his family, our friends and the hundreds of people in that funeral, and I can't take that away from them.  It's the only hope they have. 

I don't really know how this reads to the outside world, and it doesn't really matter.  I just don't think I can hold it inside any longer.

11qo1m,1,2012-10-19,Do I really love her? Or am I hanging on? [24/M],3rdcultureboyfriend,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/11qo1m/do_i_really_love_her_or_am_i_hanging_on_24m/,"This is a throwaway, for obvious reasons. Also, she goes on r/aww once in a while.

So I'm not sure if I love my gf or hanging on.

The deeper context:
I'm a third culture kid. My ethnicity doesn't really matter, but if it helps I'm Asian. I've lived in Korea, Japan, Amsterdam, Beijing, LA, Honolulu, Ohio, and Madrid (dad is a missionary). Translation: I don't click with most people. Sure, I have interesting stories, but in literally every culture I've been to girls neglect me as a foreigner.

I came to UC Berkeley in San Francisco, and here I met the perfect girlfriend. In fact, I just celebrated our 1000th day of dating (yeah, that's an Asian thing)– it was great! She's also a third-culture kid: lived in Russia, Korea, and other parts of the USSR. Her parents now live in Europe. She understands the sort of cultural neglect us TCK's go through sometime, and we've struggled together in the process of college, finding an internship, and now a full-time job (I'm working, she's a senior).

But recently we've had moments where I've thought that the relationship isn't going the way I thought I would. There's moments when she gets angry for small things. A common scenario is when I play the devil's advocate to try and help her understand a situation (e.g. when she's pissed at someone after a bad day at work), but that backfires and she doesn't say a single word to me even after I've said a sincere sorry. I've gotten *this* close to yelling at her once, as she told me meeting new people tires her (she's also introverted, like me- she's in accounting, go figure), and wants to do this thanksgiving just by ourselves without inviting anybody. And not in a romantic ""just us two"" way, but literally in a ""it would be more convenient and more frugal"" way. I sure as hell won't go clubbing (it's loud, got boring after college), but I think it's right to spend thanksgiving with a couple of really close friends.

I really love her, she's cute and intellectual, but I've begun seeing her faults and sometimes I can't stand it: extremely messy room, her short temper, her neglect of her skin health, her ""bottling up"" in her silent anger, her loathing of exercise which I'm scared about, since I want her to be healthy (I'm thinking long-term: really serious about this relationship.) I love sports and exercise but I'm willing to make that sacrifice. I also cook and clean for her because she has some intense studies going on, but I have a feeling she uses the excuse that she can't cook for sh*t (a joke between us) a little too often, leading me to cook at least 9 out of 10 meals. It's fine now with her studies, but I have a feeling it'll continue even after she starts working. She also has severe mood swings– I know it's not PMS because it gets even worse during those periods.

Also a confession: I am afraid I won't find anyone who understands me like her. I've heard it's an innate fear in all TCK's, but I don't intend to make that an excuse. I hope I'm not that pathetic.

The best part: my gf's parents once officially told me it was over, 1 year ago. That's right: we're dating in secret. Her, and thus her parents, being Korean, they see me as a threat to the integrity of her family. They apply Korean standards to our relationship, and her slightly overanxious mom labelled me as a negative influence to my gf for detracting her from her studies. I also felt that she strongly disliked my poor Korean. In reality, my gf and her parents have fought countless times because they want her to come back to Korea and work in a Korean firm, until becoming a proper Korean wife– which she has no intention of doing (she's got a great career at JP morgan). After ""breaking up,"" my gf told me her mom had called me a coward for just leaving her (which I really didn't, as far as she knows). We intend to break it to them some day when I can see them in person with their daughter, and explain that she is self-sufficient. But even though I try to hold my faith steady, I have nightmares of my meeting them at least once a week. That's when I realize I don't really have a plan of what I'll do once I meet them. I don't know if I can keep this up.

Sorry it got long. If you've stuck with me this long, you now realize how complicated this relationship is. It's like a Korean drama for fucking sake. What I need now is real advice– ""make me feel betters"" would do that but that's not what I need right now.

**What should I do? What am I feeling? Is there anyone out there who can throw me a compass? I don't need a definitive answer, even– help me walk steadier... I don't know what I'll do.**

**TL;DR** 3rd culture kid meets 3rd culture girl, happy relationship complicated by gf's degenerating habits/lifestyle and me being a bit slow + freaked out parents. Not sure what I should do to maintain relationship, or not. Not sure what it is I'm feeling– except lost.

EDIT: Yes, we do have a sex life. In fact, it may be the only thing I'm getting right. We both end feeling good after, but soon goes back to her mood swings."

11qko3,5,2012-10-19,Computer Science majors - do you work in groups to create interesting projects outside of class? A few questions from a transfer student.,[deleted],UCSC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/11qko3/computer_science_majors_do_you_work_in_groups_to/,"Hello everybody. I'm finishing my last year at a Bay Area community college and I'm HOPING to transfer here next Fall. I submitted a TAG application, so hopefully everything works out. 

Anyway. The Computer Science crowd at my school sucks. People go to lecture, then go home and do the labs themselves. No one wants to collaborate or help each other out, which I think is terrible because we all have a lot to learn from each other. I personally love working with other people especially on programming assignments, because it helps get the work done much faster. If I'm lucky to find a partner, we can bounce off ideas and gain tremendous amounts of insight on various topics.

Even the guys in our CompSci club don't do shit. People talk about tech related news, but no one does any actually coding. Here, I am entirely on my own.

So here are a  few questions. How willing are you guys to work with other people on class assignments? Are you like me, or are you a rockstar loner cowboy coder who does things in your own?

If you found out I was a transfer student, would you be less willing to work with me? We get a bad rep for being stupid, and I hear people in other UC's try to distance themselves from transfer students. (I promise not all of us are slackers)

Finally, would you be down to code shit outside of class? I'm extremely serious about improving my programming skills. I wanna land some awesome internships while in college and get a killer job after graduating. I'd like to work with motivated students and produce some quality projects during my stay here.

I'd just like to get an idea of what to expect from my fellow CS students in the future.Thanks for your time.

I'm a fairly good looking guy who has his academics in order, I'm physically fit, I eat well, and I have good friends. About the only things I can complain about are a little school stress and some financial woes, IE, massive student loans. I do kind of obsess about being single/lonely though. I'm working on that. The main issue I'm facing right now are these overwhelming feelings of sadness, loneliness, and despair. They're growing worse and worse in my mind, and now I can feel them in a literal sense by way of kind of a sickening tingling, mostly in my wrists. I can't, at all, seek non-anonymous professional help or become medicated. I say this because I am planning on applying for some rather sensitive government jobs and internships, and any such medical history would ruin my chances. I want to make these thoughts get more under control. Any ideas, guys?
Edit: I'm a straight male, it seems to have been unclear and kind of important.

We always had the possibility of something and were close friends, but had our own stuff we had to do. We met in college, but he’s in the military and is doing the whole career military thing. And I was finishing law school. Anyway he ended up getting stationed in another state that’s right on the border of the state I was being licensed to practice law in. But the market where I could practice would be VERY small and I have no connections like I do in my big-city hometown. Seemed somewhat like the only opportunity to try us out though, so I took the leap and moved the four hours away after finishing the bar exam. It’s only been three months since I’ve been living with him, but I’m already feeling so resentful towards him and I don’t know how to stop. I knew I was giving up some of my opportunities, I just didn’t think it would affect me so much. And to make things so much worse I didn’t pass part of the exam and have to retake it in February, not getting my results until May. This makes me almost completely unemployable down where we live together, except for the possibility of a shitting unpaid or paid (minimum wage) internship. But in my hometown, I have yet another job opportunity that came up a week ago (I gave another one up to move down with him) that pays a normal salary. I do love him and really want to try things out (we both agree long distance probably would cause us to fizzle out) but I feel so resentful towards him like this is ruining my life. 

I don’t want to feel this way, but part of is it exacerbated by what feels like his complete lack of understanding. All he says is “there’s no way he can understand what I’m going through” or “sorry you can’t get the job you want” but I feel like he should at least try a little harder. Of course his life is great, nothing changed except he got better furniture, home-cooked meals, and a house cleaner. For me, I gave up everything and I feel like he doesn’t really understand that and takes it for granted. I have a lot of money in savings, so it’s not like I need a job, it’s that I worked my ass off to have a legal career, and although not passing the bar sucks, it wouldn’t affect my career if I didn’t move for him. He’s offered to pay for everything, but again it’s not about the money. It’s that he expects everything to be just great because he’s happy and isn’t really acknowledging in meaningful form everything that I’m sacrificing. I do think he’s trying, but it’s just NOT working. How do I communicate this to him so that his reaction isn’t just annoyed that the same thing is being brought up? Do I bail? Or am I being selfish?

TL;DR: Gave up my legal career opportunities to move with my boyfriend to a place where in all reality I have no options right now to get a real job and he’s not acting like he appreciates the sacrifice, which makes me resentful and want to bail.

It was with (I think ) a member of HR, and didn't actually have a technical question regarding coding theory. 

Is it normal for a HR rep to say 'excellent' after I answer some questions? I assume so, since you know, they're in HR. 

I feel like I rambled a bit, and that I wasn't concise enough with some of my answers, and that at some points I was talking too fast.I think I might have missed some testing parameters during the 'How would you test X' type question, though nothing too basic...  

Would these things be MAJOR things that would prevent me from going onto the next round? Or, alternate questions, what things do intern candidates do during the phone screening that hinder themselves, and are major screw-ups?

Other than that I think I did okay, but I'm going to assume the worst for now. 


EDIT:
Actually, another question. What is the importance of the 'What was the largest project you've had in terms of lines of code' type of question?
I can see why they MIGHT ask it, but I don't see why that would be important to gauge a programmer in a phone interview. "

I'm on a bit of leave from school right now (the nonsensical made-dean's-list-and-left-to-explore-career-options kind, not the failed-everything kind or the hello-crazytown kind), and currently in an accounting internship, despite never having taken a class on accounting in my life.  I don't love it.  

I'm seriously considering trying to get a spring or summer programming-related internship.  This is somewhat complicated by the fact that unlike with my present internship, I'd be likely to face an applicant pool significantly larger than one, and not only do I not have much coding experience, I'm not even a CS major, and it's too late to change that.  

What I have is a planned stats major/CS minor, two R-heavy stats courses, and one intro Java course under my belt.  That, and a few months of evenings/weekends.  Right now, I've got a personal project in the form of a stats calculator in the works that I hope to turn into an android app.  Besides that, what should I look into in terms of making myself marketable as an intern?  More personal projects?  Different languages?  Or am I simply not gonna be able to compete with actual CS students, because the ""we like your gumption"" internship only happens in accounting?"

11q6qs,3,2012-10-18,I think I'm depressed (again) and I'm sabotaging my relationships.,freakinouthere,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11q6qs/i_think_im_depressed_again_and_im_sabotaging_my/,"Hi there. 22F.

I've already screwed one relationship over because of this issue, and I'd like for this new one to be just normal and fun and nice. More than 6 months ago, before I broke up with my ex of more than a year, I was a MESS, mentally. I was extremely depressed, cried myself to sleep every night over whatever my ex had or hadn't done (he did nothing out of the ordinary, in reality), generally unmotivated and feeling very isolated and like the world (and my ex's life) would be a be a much better place without me in it. My confidence was at an all-time low and I was a complete doormat and shadow of myself. Didn't feel like my opinion ever mattered, or I ever mattered, and just felt like a constant disappointment to my loved ones due to other things coming up with the end of college and life transitions. After MONTHS of struggling and most likely torturing the ex with my antics (poor kid), I finally broke it off with him and ""set him free"". 

Things started to get better, I started a brand new stage of my life, and there I was, freshly graduated from college, with grad school lined up, an internship, my very own place in a great neighborhood, a good circle of friends, and an amazing trip during the summer. I was glowing. Confidence was waaaay higher. No wonder I found a great new guy - I was happy, independent, content. Attractive, right?

Now, pressure is starting to pile up. Grad school and work are tough, and my usually resistant body is giving in. I try to get my license twice and fail because of stupid mistakes. And it all comes back. Again, I'm crying on a daily basis, sometimes more than a couple of times during the day. I'm feeling worthless and unworthy of love or affection. I try to stop myself from expecting too much from my boyfriend, but can see myself, again, becoming merely a shadow. It's a struggle to smile at him and to be positive around him because I'm constantly gauging the imbalance between both of our emotional investments, or what I perceive it to be. I feel ready to give him everything emotionally, but constantly check for signs of waning affection and prepare myself for rejection at every turn. I am absolutely exhausted by how emotionally invested I am. I'm not fun to be around and we haven't even been together for two months yet - this is meant to be the honeymoon period, where we just can't get enough of each other and everything is amazing and nothing hurts. 

I'm under a lot of pressure and am told I'm too hard on myself, but I don't think I am enough. I am just absolutely losing it mentally and, I believe, destroying this relationship like I did the previous one. I need therapy, for sure, but I don't know what to do in the meantime to stop this from getting worse than it already is. I really want this to work, but maybe I do have to get used to the idea that I can't be in a healthy relationship (see - there it is again.). 

If you have anything to contribute, please do. Thank you.

TL;DR: I'm crumbling under pressure and depression is coming back. I'm overly emotionally invested in my new guy and I already feel like I'm ruining everything due to my depressive and passive attitude, though I try to fake it till I make it most of the time."

One, what are my chances? How will the field look in 5-8 years? I'm a pretty driven person and a good student. I'm transferring to a cheaper college to save some money for grad school at a better university because I'm told this is a wise course of action. I think that this pursuit is a pretty good balance of realism and reaching a goal. I could try to become an author, or a journalist, or a politician but I expect that would be more difficult (Edit: I mean that in the sense that I wouldn't even know where to start for these things).

Two, what should I be doing to improve my chances? What degree should I aim for? How do I get my name out there and get hired? How and where should I search for internships? What helped you get your job?

11q21s,2,2012-10-18,Just broke up with bf after a 2 year relationship most of it long distance. Don't know what to do? :(,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/11q21s/just_broke_up_with_bf_after_a_2_year_relationship/,"So my boyfriend (22/m) and I (19/f) broke up last weekend after a 2 year relationship, most of it was long distance. He studies in Germany and I study in Spain but we're both from the same city and country (Mexico). We used to see each other in vacations (2 weeks in Christmas and 1-2 months in Summer) and also we tried visiting each other every 2 months. 
The thing is 1) he might be going to China for the next year and I would really like to make a 1 year long exchange to Chile. Also, 2) it seems like none of us have the time it requires for us to maintain our relationship the way it was (he is too busy with an internship and I am having a pretty rough and difficult semester) so since we returned to Europe from vacations we haven't talked as much as we did and sincerely I think we both lost a little bit of interest (due to the lack of time). We were as well 3) fighting for every little detail and getting into really big fights for making plans with friends and not ""spending time"" (skypeing) with each other. And finally 4) we both think we weren't enjoying the experience of studying abroad by being stuck to the computer.  
In conclusion, everything was getting more and more complicated and I really thing a part of me lost hope in our future based on the fact that a long distance relationship is pretty difficult to maintain and we would be doing this for 4 more years (until I graduate). 

So last weekend I went to visit him, we talked about everything (we had been discussing our situation the entire week) and came to the conclusion that it was the best decision for us to break up or ""pause"" things until I finish school; we even made a pact (even if it sounds stupid) of meeting each other in three and a half years and I really felt confident and proud of how we handled things (he really made a great job convincing me it was the best decision and seemed really sure and firm about it). But even though a part of me knows this is maybe the ""more mature"" thing to do I have been having a really hard time because I really love him and miss him, I know we are meant to be together because I have never felt the same way with anyone else and I am sure I won't find someone like him (we also had our future planned and we had plans of meeting each other in about two weeks, in Christmas and then in February). We spoke yesterday and told me he thought that maybe we ""rushed things"" and chose the easier or simpler road, but we ended up convincing ourselves why it was better to stay apart than together (we don't want to ruin the possibility of a future together now with senseless fights or eventually become strangers because of the distance). 

I am a total mess, I have no idea of what to do. I thought I felt happy and calm with the decision we made. A part of me thinks it is really for the best and also an opportunity for me and him to grow and learn a lot, but another part is telling me it was maybe a mistake and we should rethink things. 

What should I do?"
11q1iq,230,2012-10-18,Alan's story became a lot more... personal.,Doomshlang,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11q1iq/alans_story_became_a_lot_more_personal/,"Well, to be honest, I don't really want to post this on here, but Alan wants me to share the entire story, so here it is. If you haven't read any of Alan's story, the first part can be found [here](http://redd.it/11fshn) and the second part is [here](http://redd.it/11lxnr).

I walked into Alan's room late yesterday night, since he's the last patient I see when i make my final rounds, to discover him already asleep. That's very not like him, as you all know; not only does he talk to me a lot, but he also can't effectively sleep without medication. I checked the machines, and sure enough, the meds had been administered. Three hours early. I shook my head and sighed; the intern we had recently hired must have messed up. Again. He didn't do anything right, but he was new, and he started only about a week ago, so I was willing to cut him some slack. His name is Eric, for our purposes here.

Well, I cleaned up the room; there were a couple of things on the ground, when I noticed something rather odd. A rubber glove, a blue rubber glove. That's odd, I thought. We must have gotten a new stock of gloves or something; the ones we use are the stereotypical white ones. I picked up the glove, and gasped.

Blood.

My mind reeled back to what Alan had been talking about. ""...he was fired for stealing used medical supplies"" sticks out the most. Gloves. Oh god. He's been in Alan's room. I looked at my desk, which had this laptop on it but the desk is no longer here; it was taken as evidence. Now, don't get me wrong; I still put no stock in hypnosis, but this one seemed to calm Alan down a bit, plus the relation was a bit uncanny. So yeah, maybe it had worked.

There were small blood droplets leading from the glove to my desk. How had I not seen those earlier today? I tentatively walked over and opened the drawer, and lost it.

There was a finger in my desk. On top of a small note, that read:
""Remember Dennis?""

I'd like to say it ended there, but no. Under that piece of paper was another, with the same handwriting. The only reason the police even showed it to me was because it had my name on it. I wish he hadn't showed it to me. I really do. It was a simple note, like its companion, but far, far worse.

""Alan never told you, did he? I used to work with his father, Alyssa. And now I work with you.""

I immediately told them everything I knew about Eric. Everything. it had to be him, how could it not be him? He never visited Alan when he was awake. Never spoke to him. But was always there during Alan's chemically induced sleep. Cleaning up, paying careful attention, but screwing things up; misplacing things, which I assume he was actually just plain stealing, forgetting when certain medications were administered, things like that. But he paid careful care to Alan, above his other patients.

But why didn't he kill him?
Or me?

Maybe that's the point, I tell myself. Maybe he doesn't feel it's time yet. Maybe he really doesn't want to kill. Wants more long-term effects. Surely he got what he wanted, then, with regard to Alan. But if I'm next, well...

I'm not too sure why I decided to come to work today. My boss told me I could have a few days off, because of what happened. I guess I just don't want to spend any of my time alone. He also said that Eric was fired. Big surprise there.

I had a hard time sleeping yesterday, if you can believe that. He mentioned me specifically, but why? Am I next? Is there a next? No, no. He's just trying to freak me out, I tell myself. He doesn't even know where I live. How could he? Has he been following me? I haven't been paying close attention to that.

Of course, I know better than to doubt that.

I also haven't told Alan. I don't think I will, either. I don't want to worry him, worsen his condition if it would come to that. I also don't know what I would tell him. I can't do it.

I won't sleep for a while, I know that much. But I'm ready to defend myself, I just don't think it would be enough."

Some history about myself:

* Went with EE over CE because I was under the impression that there were no jobs for CE's due to outsourcing &amp; other factors. The problem is every field is having trouble, so I should have just went with CE...

* Graduated Magna Cum Laude from non-ivy school with EE degree in 2011

* Did 0 internships during school (was under the impression that my good grades would carry me to victory. Boy was I wrong; get internships kids)* 

* Started applying for jobs (specifically in the defense industry) ***AFTER*** I graduated in 2011. I only received 1 response, but really didn't spam out resumes too hard.

* Ended up taking an off the books job with a local old guy doing IT Support work &amp; work around his house

* Almost a year after graduating, a recruiter from my current company contacted me after seeing my resume on careerbuilder. Went for my ***FIRST*** interview ever, and got an offer the next day. I only make 50k, but it's a lot more than I was making before

Basically the bottom line is enjoy CS/CE concepts (programming, hardware), a lot more than EE concepts. So my goal is to shift into a developer role. The problem is I don't have much programming experience (some c++ &amp; vhdl) at all during college, so I'm looking to figure out how I can make this transition smoothly &amp; efficiently.

Some of the questions I'm looking to get answered:

* What can I do on my own time to make this happen?

* What books / instructional material should I invest in?

* What should I get my Masters in? CE? CS? SE?

* What do I need to do to make myself look good for Google, Intel, etc.?

* Should I give up on trying for these high-end companies? Am I already too far behind?

* Any other career choices? Maybe Network Administrator? Hardware Engineer?

Long story short I was on the path for computer networking about 10 years ago when I got out of high school, but got distracted by being a musical theatre electrician instead. Now I'm looking to go back. Thing is I'm too old (i.e I'm an adult with bills to pay) to intern anywhere, so if I get my CCNA do I have a shot at an entry level job with no previous networking work experience and no college degree? Looking to make at least $35k/year, more would, of course, be fantastic, but I have no illusions of making the big bucks right off the bat and know I'll need to work my way up.  

My dream plan is to get my CCNA, which I can do in a relatively short amount of time, get my foot in the door somewhere working entry level so I can quit my two current jobs for the one job in computer networking. Which frees up time to go back and finish college. In a year or two I'd have a degree, work experience, and still have my CCNA, and I know I could then use all of that to get into a better position. But it all hinges on getting that entry level job to begin with, so the question is, do I have a shot? Is there a better certification to get first? What sort of jobs should I look for?

11t52l,1,2012-10-20,What is the law covering the intellectual property rights of software developed during internship/employment without signed contract/agreement? Whoowns the code by default?,[deleted],ipr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ipr/comments/11t52l/what_is_the_law_covering_the_intellectual/,"I am a software engineer who ""invented"", and developed alone an integrated ERP software solution over the past 2 years. I got the idea and coded much of the software as intern at a furniture company (company A) with which I had a verbal agreement that I could keep the IP rights to the code and the company would have the ""shop rights"" to use ""a copy"" of the software without restrictions.

Recently things started to take a down turn in the company A as the company grew fairly large and new head management was formed, also new partners were brought in. The original owners distanced themselves from the business, and the new group indicated that they want to claim the IP rights to my software, offering me a contract that would split the IP ownership into 50% co-ownership, completely disregarding the initial verbal agreements.

As of now **there was no single written job description and agreement/contract/policy that I signed with the company A**, I signed only I-9 and W-4 forms. I now have an opportunity to leave the company A and form a new business with 2 partners (Company B), obviously using the software as the primary tool. There would be no direct conflict of interest as the company A sells furniture. 

**My core question is: ""am I better off just leaving with the software without anything signed, or should I fight the contract and resolve the issue with lawyers? (FL, US)""** 

**Detailed questions:**

 1. Given the situation, where no signed legal agreement is present, I created the software partially as an intern and no-contract employee, and ""the invention"" is not in direct conflict of interest with the company A, and I always used my personal computer/servers to code/host the files on.. **What is the applicable law governing the copyright and intellectual properties of the software in such case? If nothing is signed and I leave the company A tomorrow, who by default owns the IP/copyright to the code?** I am concerned only with the US law, and local state law in south Florida (District 11)
 2. I am familiar with the ""shop rights"", I don't have any problem leaving a copy of the code in the company for them to use/enhance. What worries me, **Can the company A make any legal claims to the software/code/IP and potential derived profits/interests after I leave and form a company B?**
 3. **Can applying for a patent/registering the software at [http://www.copyright.gov](http://www.copyright.gov) in my name prevent any legal disputes in the future? Can I uset it as evidence for legal defense? Could adding a note specifying the company A as exclusive license holder clarify the arrangements?**
 4. **If I leave and the company A sues me, what evidence would they use against me? On what basis would the sue since their business is in completely different industry (furniture) than software. Every single source file was created/stored on my personal computer with proper documentation including a copyright notice with my credentials (name/email/addres/phone).** It's also worth noting that I develop significant part of the software prior to my involvement with the company A as student.
 5. **If I am forced to sign a contract and the company A doesn't honor the verbal agreement, making claims towards the ownership, what can I do settle the matter legally?** I like to avoid legal process altogether as my budget for court battles is extremely limited at the moment.

Few points for clarification:

 - *I want to clarify that there was never hidden intent on my part, I was very transparent with the company A from the beginning, both parties agreed on the arrangements several times during the 2 years*
 - *The software was not made specifically for the company A, even though they use it for their operations. The software was designed to be as generic as possible so it can be used by other business in virtually any products/services industry, the company A was just a guinea pig as they were the first to use it, they agreed to this before the software was made*
 - *The company was not looking for the software solution when they approached me, I basically brought my old code in, enhanced it and created my job there*
 - *There was no management/guidance that would affect my work, I was ""my own boss"" with no other persons in the company involved in software in any way. There is no know-how of the company A in the software*
 - *No specific procedure/method/secret that would be considered confidential is embed in the software, the company A owns their run-time data and has access to it (databases)*


That's it. Thank you for your time reading my post, this is big deal for me personally as well as professionally. Any useful answers/thoughts/experiences are much appreciated, and for them I thank you in advance. I understand that this is not legal advice/service, I only hope to get some input."

We recently transitioned to a day rate on edits. With hopes it would be a more regular pay, instead of per job. He is currently behind over $4000.

Now, I have talked to him about this. He just says ""money is coming."" or some variation of it. I have no reason to believe he is trying to stiff me. He pays me little bits here and there. And his business would cease without me at the moment. 

I feel like an intern though. I barely made my bills and payments this month. $160 left in my bank account so I won't make it much longer. I do not waste my money on frivolous things either. 

Anyways, what would you do? Should I start billing clients directly for my services? Get some sort of legal document drafted? I'm at a loss here. It's so frustrating. "

[What's the real process for getting yourself on the map to make films like this? Your movie looks like the ones I want to make and I wonder about the inception of this kind of career.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p0rf9?context=5)|Okay, so what I did can be totally repeated.  If anyone out there aspires to make these kinds of films, I cannot stress enough, IT IS POSSIBLE.  I'm proof of that.
 |I went to film school, here in Southern California.  Spent way too much money on my senior film.  It played zero film festivals.
 |When I graduated, I had a normal desk job.  But continued to make short films on nights and weekends.  How I worked it-- I knew people in the theatre program at my school.  If any actor came to me with even the smallest budget (even $50), I would write and direct something for them to put on their reel.
 |I made a lot of very mediocre short films that way, but I was working constantly.  No lie-- I probably made about 25-30 short films after college.
 |Some of my collaborators and I decided we wanted to make a feature.  That it was time.  This rich real estate guy from Arizona had contacted us-- he was going to pay for a horror film.  We wrote and wrote and wrote and eventually came up with a script we really liked.
 |For my job, I was in Utah at a screenwriting workshop (I made copies, and made the coffee), and I was in the back of the room when Stewart Stern spoke.  He wrote Rebel Without A Cause.
 |I remember him very clearly, he said that filmmaking is a real gift.  It's a gift to you and a gift to your audience.  Make sure you have something to say.
 |In that moment I realized that all the work I had created up to that point were merely filmaking exercises.  They weren't ""me.""
 |So when I got back, I told my collaborators this, we threw out the script, and decided that we'd rather make something for no money, than make the wrong movie.  We looked at the resources around us, and on nights and weekends slowly cobbled together our first film.  We shot all the scenes that were ""free"" first, and then raised the little bit of money we needed to finish the film through a generous friend of a friend (30K).
 |In the end, I got very lucky in that the film was accepted into Sundance.  We did a small self-release of the film, and it played other festivals.  I learned a ton.
 |At that point I got involved with Save the Date.  I had read an early draft of the script to Save the Date years earlier, simply because I was a huge huge fan of one of the writers, Jeffrey Brown (you might know him for his graphic novels, including his latest one ""Darth Vader and Son""). I had heard that the director had dropped out, so I just sent a cold email to the producer telling him how huge of a fan I was.
 |Jordan was at Sundance that year with the film The Kids Are All Right. We met up and hit it off, and they all gave me permission to go run with the script.
 |At the time, I had a day job making video content for a record label.  They started giving me actual videos, and so I was able to work on a slightly bigger scale.  All the while writing Save the Date.
 |That job ended (apparently people download music illegally off the internet?) and I then went home to my parents' house in rural Massachusetts, and devoted all my time to working on the script. I had nothing else going on. I vowed to not return to Los Angeles until the script was done. My parents don't have wi-fi, which does wonders for productivity!
 |A few weeks later, I had a decent draft in hand.  But my feature didn't speak to the abilities that I had learned through music videos.  I then made a really low budget short film, was lucky enough to return to Sundance with that.  At the time, The Kids Are All Right had had been nominated for Oscars. Now that the script was done, the timing simply couldn't have been better.
 |So based on that, we were able to get the momentum to get the script in the hands of these actors, some other producers jumped on board, and the money showed up shortly thereafter.
 |The key to all of this is to Just Keep Working.  Don't worry about any of the industry stuff.  They'll eventually chase you.  Opportunities will open up.  But more importantly-- keep it personal.  If any of these films didn't find an audience, I'll sleep well at night knowing that I made them for all the right reasons.
 |But lord knows, if I can do this, you can do it too.
[Are any of these shorts available online?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p1sfl?context=5)|The shorts are not, but my first feature can be streamed [for free on hulu](http://www.hulu.com/onetoomanymornings).
[Hi. Thanks for doing an AMA. I just watched the trailer and this film feels like a throwback to indie romantic comedies from 10 maybe even 15 years ago (which is not a bad thing\). Was this intentional? How are you facing the challenge of marketing a movie like this without some sort of ""high concept?"" Is it leaning more heavily on your cast? Was this an obstacle you faced in just getting the movie made at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p1am5?context=5)|Absolutely.  To me, I think most modern romantic comedies are so dumb.  They feature characters I can't relate to doing things I'd never do.  And the guys always look like the kinds of guys that would beat me up in high school.
 |So while we weren't trying to make a ""throwback"" film, we definitely wanted the film to have the same honesty as films like Singles or Reality Bites.
 |As for marketing the film, my hope is that this honesty will come through, and the word of mouth will carry it.  And these actors!  I mean, even if I didn't direct this movie, I would kill to see a movie with all five of these people as the leads.  They are SO GOOD in the film too.
 |Surprisingly though, we didn't have any huge challenges in getting the movie made, but I also was very lucky to have such good producers at the helm.  They really protected it to make sure we could make the film we wanted to make.
[I swear this is true story. I went to a high school in LA and you crashed our prom after party (Universal Hilton\). You ended up taking the virginity of a girl named Roseanne. You didn't call her afterwards. She cried a lot. Do you remember any of this and can confirm or have you been so knee deep in hollywood pooty for so long that this qualifies as a mere blip? /I'm not kidding.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p2pxl?context=5)|This is the most incredible question I have ever been asked in my entire life.
 |A. I grew up in Massachusetts, so there's no chance I was at your prom afterparty.
 |B. Even then, I did not go to my prom, but instead went to the mall movie theatre to see the movie DEEP IMPACT with the rest of the nerds.
 |Thank you for your interest in Save The Date.
[This is a joke. That was a question asked to Woody Harrelson during his AMA. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p3tid?context=5)|Whoosh.
[If there was a zombie outbreak, what would be your zombie plan?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p1drs?context=5)|I am a wuss.  I would not only join the zombies as fast as possible, I would try to find a zombie baby who doesn't have quite fully developed teeth yet, so the bite wouldn't hurt as much.
[Can you tell NBC to quit being so fucking stupid and let community come back?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p2800?context=5)|SERIOUSLY.
[*Alison Brie.*  To the frontage you go! On a more serious note, what is your favorite type of scene to direct?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p0w9o?context=5)|To me, there's nothing more satisfying than showing two people fall in love, or two people fall out of love.  I can't get enough of that.  Seriously.  Anything where the actors have to be as vulnerable as possible.
[How do you film sex scenes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p1foj?context=5)|Lots and lots of booze.  Just kidding--
 |First thing's first-- you have to make sure that the actors are super comfortable with each other.
 |With Save the Date, I always wanted Mark Webber to play the role he plays.  But I didn't want to cast that role until I knew Lizzy was in.  Just because I wanted her to have a say in it.
 |When we finally met, one of the first things Lizzy said was ""Who's playing this one character, and have you considered Mark Webber?""  I knew then we wouldn't have a problem.
 |For a short I did the year prior there was a really intense sex scene, and I actually had brought the actress I cast into the auditions with all the male candidates.  That way she could weigh in on it, and help make that decision with us.
 |Then, prior to shooting, you have to have a real nuts and bolts chat with the actors beforehand.  With the short film, I went into detail ""we will be doing two shots where we see your left nipple"" etc.  That way everyone knows.  There are no surprises.  And everyone can trust each other.
 |Then in rehearsal, I think it's almost akin to choreographing a dance.  Just showing where each person is going to be.  And with shooting-- honestly, usually the first take is right on the money.  Sometimes a thrust might not be obvious enough, so you have to make them thrust a little bit more exaggeratedly, so it reads on camera.
[That's really interesting. How these guys do not get erections when having fake sex with half naked beautiful actresses is the real question... ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p237z?context=5)|Because they're surrounded by dudes.  All of which are staring at them.
[Where did you get your start filmmaking?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p0su7?context=5)|When I was in college, I went to a school called Chapman University, down in Orange County. They would do a lot of test screenings of films down there, because it was a little bit further out, and there'd be less ""industry types"" there.
 |I was walking around school and got an invitation to see a test screening of a film called Super Troopers. Now, nobody had ever heard of this film and based on the title, it sounded like something from ABBA. Or a kids film.
 |I went home and saw that it had played Sundance, and that Fox Searchlight was releasing it, so I decided to go. I had no industry connections at the time, and really needed an internship. Searchlight was kind of the perfect place to be because they were releasing the kinds of films I had hoped to eventually make.
 |So I got to the theatre early, hoping that I'd be able to talk to someone about applying for an internship. Maybe I could get into one of their focus groups. No luck.
 |The film played, it was hilarious, and on my way out they handed out flyers that said ""if you have any more comments about Super Troopers, email them to so and so.""
 |I now had an email address, so I stayed up all night writing like this massive massive email to this random person at Fox all about how great the film was, and how it could be better, and how they should release it. I was like super confident in the email even though I had no idea what the fuck I was saying.
 |Oddly enough, one of the things I suggested was to have them re-shoot the ending to bring back Geoffrey Arend's character (he's the guy at the beginning that famously says ""the snozzberries taste like snozzberries"").
 |At the bottom of the email I wrote, ""...And by the way, I'm a film student who snuck into your screening, and it is in your best interest to call me tomorrow to offer me an internship.""
 |I went off to class (this was 2000, so I didn't have a cell phone), and when I got home, my roommate was like ""Dude, three people from Fox called you today."" I couldn't believe it.
 |Three weeks later I found myself wandering around the Fox lot. An executive had just started a new program to make short films and put them on the internet (pre-YouTube). Two weeks later, I had a job as her assistant, and I made the commute from Orange County to Los Angeles three days a week until I graduated and it turned full time.
 |Super Troopers came out (with a different ending), and many years later I found myself on set with Geoffrey Arend directing him in Save the Date.
[I love this! I hope you have a lot of success. I'm planning to go into movies too (acting, though, not directing\). How was working with these famous people when you are pretty much unknown (I hope that doesn't sound bad\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p1k97?context=5)|Honestly, there is really no difference between working with an unknown actor and a known actor.  The known actor might have more experience, and therefore their instrument might be more fine-tuned.  But it's all the same: motivations, actions, goals.  The same language.
[Where/when can I see it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p0x4q?context=5)|Right!  The film comes out on VOD November 8th, and in theatres on December 14th.
[When can we see it in Europe ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p74cj?context=5)|For people outside the US-- we are still in the process of presenting the movies to international distributors.  We do know the film will definitely be coming out in Australia and New Zealand, but do not have a date.
 |This is totally random, but if anyone lives in Wroclaw Poland-- I'll be there showing it there at the American Film Festival in just a few weeks.
[What is it like to premier a film? What goes through your head as the lights dim and the film fills out the screen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p0wsn?context=5)|Nothing compares to it.  It is seriously seriously nerve-wracking.  In fact, the Sundance Channel followed me around before the premiere of Save the Date.  You can see me rehearsing what I was going to say in this little video here: [Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8TK8veYf7g)
 |Really, it's not until I hear the audience audibly laugh that I'm able to relax.  I don't know how directors of serious dramas do it.  Just wondering if people are having the correct emotional response.  At least for films with comedy, if you hear them laugh, you know the film's working.
[Do you have any hilarious stories you can share from the set?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p15th?context=5)|So there was one night where we are shooting this really tender, sensitive slow dance scene between Geoffrey and Lizzy.  Just an all out romantic moment between the two of them.
 |We were shooting in a loft space in Downtown LA, which apparently was directly next door to a crack addict.  There were no doors or locks to this place, and he kept just wandering around set yelling ""IT'S GONNA GET LOUD.""
 |Eventually we're halfway through shooting the scene, and we start hearing some of the WORST SOUNDING electric guitar noise from the other side of the wall.  He had moved an amp right up against the adjoining wall, and basically made it his mission to ruin our scene.
 |One of our producers, Jordan Horowitz, just wanted to go over there and punch the guy in the face.  Figured with one good punch he could knock him out.  Instead, one of the other producers, Michael Roiff, went over there and talked calmly to the guy.  He of course wanted money that we did not have, but while Michael talked to him, we would shoot as much as possible.
 |At one point the man said that he wanted $500.  But that if someone got him a beer, it would go down to $400.  Michael offered to get him a full six pack.
 |Long story short, we got the scene.
[Awesome story! Not sure if it was asked (also, not sure if this is taboo to ask...\), but what was the budget for the film? Thanks for the AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p496u?context=5)|Not taboo to ask, but I could get in trouble for saying.  What I will say is that we made it for a fraction of what you think it probably cost.
[What was it like working with Jeffrey Brown?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p13fq?context=5)|So there's an amazing totally true story about working with Jeffrey Brown.
 |So back when I was getting married, I was looking to get the perfect wedding gift for my wife.  So I just wrote to the email address on the back cover of Jeffrey Brown's books.  I didn't know him at the time, but hoped he might draw something of us.  I had no idea if he'd even write back.
 |But he did!  And he drew something that was just super touching.  A moment from the middle of my wife and I's relationship.
 |Cut to the night before our wedding.  The rehearsal dinner.  I was SO excited to give my wife this gift.  And I noticed that her gift to me was the exact same size.
 |And we started opening our gifts-- it was crazy.  I saw Jeffrey's trademark black-on-white drawing peeking out from under the paper.  This is when we realized: the two of us, independent of each other, wrote to an artist WE DID NOT KNOW to commission him to draw us.
 |Her piece to me was from our first date.  So we called Jeffrey on our honeymoon, and he thought we might have been playing a prank on him.  But that since we paid him, he knew it wasn't.  We then asked him to draw a third work of us-- a meta piece-- documenting the moment where we were opening our gifts to each other.
 |But working with Jeffrey was amazing.  He's an amazing artist and an even better human being.  I have learned so much from our collaboration.
[If you could work with any actor/actress, who would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p1dh4?context=5)|Honestly.  There are five: Lizzy Caplan, Alison Brie, Martin Starr, Geoffrey Arend, and Mark Webber.
 |Okay, maybe six: Dustin Hoffman.
[So tell me what are the biggest difficulty's a typical ""indie"" director has working with big blockbuster actors? with this i mean to ask if they don't take you as serious as they take a director that works or is associated with a big company.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p1ec5?context=5)|There was absolutely none.  Especially with these actors, I cannot stress enough how sweet they all are.  Also, I did have a lot of experience directing actors before-- I wasn't a first timer, and the language is exactly the same.
 |My biggest challenge was in my head.  I'm used to working on projects where everybody does a little bit of everything.  On my first film, there were moments where I'd be pushing the dolly and holding the boom mic at the same time.
 |So here, I remember in pre-production, I was asking my AD if I needed to go pick up bottled water for the crew.  She was like ""You don't do that anymore.  You just need to focus on directing.""
[Could you name a couple of your favorite films? Particularly those that  may have inspired your movie (and in what way\). ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p0z6z?context=5)|For this particular film, Nicole Holofcener's WALKING AND TALKING was a huge influence.  Because it's not your typical romantic comedy, it's about people that actually feel like people.
 |REALITY BITES was another one.  Call me crazy, but I think that film totally holds up.  The characters actually feel like they're friends.
 |But visually, the film is shot in this super old school way.  A lot of scenes that are done in one shot.  ANNIE HALL was a big inspiration here too.
[What is it actually like to be a director of a film? Is it terrifying? Exciting? What does it involve and what parts of the process do you enjoy or hate the most?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p1h9z?context=5)|I could write a book on this.  Is it terrifying?  Yes.  Is it exciting?  Absolutely.  It involves everything.
 |My line producer Nate Kelly said it best.  The production of a film is like a giant storm, but the director is in the eye of it.
 |I enjoy working with actors the most though.  That's really where it comes alive. 
[Were you always a director since your days at Chapman? Or did you dabble at first?  How did you fall into the hobby of filmmaking? Was it something you knew you wanted to do from the moment people started pressuring you to 'think of your future,' or did you try a few other things/hobbies out first?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p2fcy?context=5)|Always wanted to be a director, but when I was an undergrad, I learned all the various facets of filmmaking-- editing, shooting, sound design.  There are many days I wish that I did have some other desire, but this is all I can do.
[My apologies for what may seem like intimidating interest on my part. I'm a film production major hoping to get into NYU by next fall and I can't help wanting to learn from your experiences. =\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p2fcy?context=5)|As for the wife.  She's the most understanding woman on the planet.  Always there to bounce ideas off of, or to root me on.  She also has the exact same taste as me in movies, so that helps too.
[Who are some of the directors that inspire you?  What is a film genre you would like to delve into on a future project?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p25ke?context=5)|I'm most inspired by the directors who tell stories that are personal to them, but who can still work in other genres.  Richard Linklater is a perfect example of this.  The fact he can make Before Sunrise and Dazed &amp; Confused, but then still bring a sense of heart to films like School of Rock.  That's exactly what I'm going for.
[Any release/event for LA in Decemeber? Would love to attend.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p17ln?context=5)|We are still figuring this out, but if there is I will let you know!
[Just moved here to LA and am looking to get my foot in the door in the industry would love to have the chance to help you with anything I could for experience or advice/direction where to start would be really helpful! Good luck with the movie, looks like it should be successful!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p17ln?context=5)|For sure-- send me a PM?  Is that how this works?  If any opportunities come up, I will let you know!
[While this isn't necessarily your area of expertise, I'm hoping from being in the industry you can offer some advice. Would you say that it is harder to break out as a filmmaker or as an actor? I have been acting since I was a kid, and there is nothing I love more in life but it's never really gone anywhere. And now I'm at this point in my life where I have to decide what I want to do, and everything people have told me completely discourages me from being an actor. So do you think from what you've seen in the industry that this is probably true?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p1ex0?context=5)|I think acting is the hardest job on the planet.  It's hard work.  And it's even harder to get the work.  At least for me, I can direct whatever I want, whenever I want.  With a budget, or without a budget.
 |I have two pieces of advice for actors working today, and that's that you've really got to create your own work.  Get yourself a camera, even if it's a crappy one.  Learn iMovie, or whatever video editing software that came with your computer.  And start casting yourself in your own movies.  Put them on the internet.  Create the tools that allow people to discover you.
 |The second piece of advice is to involve yourself at the UCB Theatre.  In my opinion, I don't think there's a bigger and better hotbed of new talent than the people involved there. 
[Can you please pass onto Alison Brie that the whole internet wants her to do an AMA? Also, I personally would like to see one from Lizzy Caplan too, I'm a big fan.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p5xmv?context=5)|I was talking to my producers today-- given the response today (I had no idea!) we are definitely going to approach all of our actors to see if they'd like to do AMA's.
[1\) Save The Date seems to have good reviews listed in the trailer, but only a 4.8 rating on IMDB. What do you think/feel about that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p5xmv?context=5)|Bad reviews of any kind suck.  I honestly didn't expect the film to be as polarizing as it is.  The people who love it REALLY love it.  And the people who hate it seem to want me to crawl under a rock forever.  The film is what it is, and whenever I'm feeling down about it, [I read this review right here](http://badassdigest.com/2012/04/26/diff-movie-review-save-the-date-is-something-special/) and I feel totally better.
[2\) Were you at all inspired by 500 Days of Summer? That's the kind of vibe I got from the trailer, the kind of heartbreaking, untraditional but quirkily funny love story kinda thing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p5xmv?context=5)|I really like 500 Days of Summer, specifically Geoffrey Arend's performance in that movie.  But it's totally different.  Our film is not at all quirky, it's actually quite grounded, and the style is more traditional.  But I do really enjoy that film.
[I'm not gonna go see your movie because the trailer made me want to cry because it reminds me of my ex haha, but it does look interesting, so good luck with it! I hope you make millions of dollars from it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p5xmv?context=5)|I hope I make millions of dollars too, but honestly, even if I made $10 that would still buy me a really sweet burrito and I would be happy.
[Are you the same guy that made the short film ""Salt""? Met you once through a mutual friend.  Congrats on the film, looks awesome!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p4pr3?context=5)|WHOA.  ""Salt""?!?  You've seen SALT?
 |For people who don't know-- my very very very first film in film school was a documentary about salt.  That turned into an action film.  About a guy who was half man-half tripod.  It only exists on two vhs copies.  The fact that someone on here has even heard of it is mind-blowing.
[Hi, Michael. CONGRATS on getting your feature made with multiple ways of distribution!! Fellow SoCal indie vilmmaker here. :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p8c7z?context=5)|For Save the Date, we shot on the Arri Alexa.  Primarily with a 25-250mm Angenieux (there are a lot of zooms in the movie), though we did use Ultra Primes for one day.
[Could you give any insight on the equipment you used for your feature? Full frame DSLR? Shot on Red? Film? Lenses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p8c7z?context=5)|I have no idea what our sound mixers used, but I'm pretty sure it was solid state.
[For audio do you/your sound recorders/mixers use solid state recorders or something different? Mix in ProTools?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p8c7z?context=5)|When I worked on the script-- I had Martin Starr in mind for that one role, but for the others, I wasn't thinking about specific actors.  Eventually I saw Party Down the same way most everyone saw it (in one long binge on Netflix) and was like-- Lizzy's it.
[Did you write with Lizzy in mind? If not, how did casting her come about if you didn't hold auditions? Was it a matter of someone who knows someone who knows Lizzy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p8c7z?context=5)|We were able to reach out to Lizzy through her agent and then through her manager.  There was actually one girl who was particularly helpful at her management company, who had been a fan of mine, and she's the one who really stood up for us by vouching for me.  And then we just met for beers and talked about the script.
[Last question - With much easier access these days to editing/post production and special effects programs (After Effects, Premiere, 3D Studio Max, etc\), how much, in your opinion, of an education do you think a modern day independent filmmaker needs to know about these types of programs, as opposed to hiring a freelancer or studio to do this kind of work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p8c7z?context=5)|As for your last question, I think it is important for every filmmaker to know how to shoot and how to edit.  Save the Date was actually the first film in a long time that I didn't edit myself.  And if you're coming up in the no or low budget world, knowing how to edit is so clutch, just because you can make things happen faster.  You don't have to wait on someone else's schedule to put your movie together.  Most of my first feature film was edited at 2 in the morning in my bedroom-- it got done.
[Thanks for taking the time; I look forward to seeing Save the Date. :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p8c7z?context=5)|Similarly, then when you start working with collaborators-- I think having a deeper understanding for their craft really helps you be able to communicate with them in a better way.  I remember working with our awesome sound guys on this (at House Blend sound-- seriously if you ever need post sound work-- use these guys!), and just talking about the ways in which we wanted to EQ the music to sound like it was actually coming out of the club speakers... it was great to be able to talk about it in a more specific way.
[What can you tell us about the soundtrack? All this talk about Singles has piqued my interest.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p1t9c?context=5)|Wilco, Minus the Bear, Daniel Hart, Giorgio Moroder, Houses, Charles Bradley, Nick Waterhouse, Arum Rae, Class Actress, The One AM Radio, The Dears, The Blue Hearts, Mika Miko, Friends.
 |[You can actually stream a whole bunch of the songs in the movie here.](http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/save-the-date-soundtrack-features-wilco-giorgio-moroder-charles-bradley-more-20121016)
[Hey! Thanks for taking the time to do this AMA. As an aspiring director who just submitted his debut feature documentary to Sundance. In the obscenely unlikely scenario that we are selected, is there anything you would've done differently at you first Sundance premiere? Any big regrets? Thanks again!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p7dy1?context=5)|When my first film played Sundance, we had decided going in to the festival to self-release our film.  We had looked at all the other films that were made on our scale (30K with unknown faces) in recent years, and none of them had really come out.  So we built a website where people could buy the movie, we sold dvds, we did everything we could so that Sundance would be our big press push.
 |Looking back, I'll never know if this was the right decision.  Part of me thinks we should have waited until the end of the festival just to see if there was any interest from distributors.  Because ultimately, just putting the Sundance logo on your dvd cover doesn't necessarily mean that people are going to instantly buy it.  But given that it was a black and white comedic drama about a young alcoholic -nothing against the film- but the audience for that kind of film is also only so big.
[1.\) Do I need to move to LA to properly shop these?  2.\) Is it really a ""miracle"" that your movie got made? After watching a documentary on the guy who made ""Broken Kingdom"" showcase how difficult it was to make his movie, do you feel that you're part of some impossible to imagine project?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p1ygc?context=5)|As for whether or not you need to move to LA-- I can only speak from my own experience.  I moved here, and it worked out.  I don't think I'd have had the same opportunities anywhere else.  But that's not to say it's impossible.
 |I don't think it's a ""miracle"" that it got made.  That's a bit hyperbolic.  What I did, pretty much any human being can do-- it just takes time and energy and hard work and luck.
[So how did you end up working with Alison Brie? Have you seen her on community?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p1s63?context=5)|Absolutely.  Alison was the last person to come on board, simply because we needed to make sure Lizzy was locked in before finding someone that somewhat resembled them.  It all happened quite traditionally, we sent her the script-- I then skyped with her while she was in Michigan shooting Five Year Engagement.  And we really lucked out that our shoot was exactly between when Five Year wrapped, and when Community started.  There was this two week period that was free, that our shoot happened to coincide with.
[Two weeks to shoot a feature?? Did I read that correctly? Or was that all Allison was needed for?  Also, the trailer looks awesome - love Martin Starr &amp; Allison Brie. Congrats! :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p47el?context=5)|We shot the whole film over 20 days.  But weaved our actors in and out depending on their schedules.  We lucked out with Geoffrey too, as he started work on the following season of Body Of Proof halfway through our shoot as well.  It was a puzzle, but the pieces fit miraculously perfectly.
[Do you work closely with the editor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p12v4?context=5)|The editor of the film, also a friend from college.  Christian Masini.  He actually makes a living as a trailer editor-- working on campaigns for Avatar and Green Lantern and such.
 |But for the five weeks we had to work on this thing, he and I would just sit next to each other in his apartment, and just keep going through the scenes over and over again.  Pretty much everyone on the crew was a personal friend of mine, and I think that makes it easier.
[Why did I feel so depressed after watching the trailer? :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p1x8d?context=5)|Because you have to wait three more weeks before the film comes out?  :)
[Thanks for doing this. Ever since I was a kid, I've wanted to be involved in films, and recently I've decided that I would like to pursue a career in film production. But I really have no idea how to break into the film industry. Any advice for someone aspiring to get involved? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p1u6r?context=5)|I listed up above some of the stories from when I first started.  I think the best thing you can do is to just stop thinking about making movies and just Start Making Movies.  If you don't have an awesome camera-- that's totally fine.  Shoot on a flip cam if you have to.  Just start doing it.
[Do the archetypal ""casting couches"" exist in Hollywood?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p1bx0?context=5)|For the five leads, we didn't even audition them.  There was no need to.  You look at any of the performances these actors give in their prior films, and it's so full of nuance.
 |Lizzy and Alison especially.  Yeah, I know that most people are like ""what was it like working with two hotties"", but they are ACTORS with a capital A.  All of the characters they've created, from Mean Girls to Party Down to Community to Mad Men-- it's all so mannered, and they make such precise decisions.  It was really just so wonderful being able to work with such talented artists.
[Haha actually this isn't Joel, it's his roommate, but I loved the film and can't wait to see what you do next! In fact, do you have anything in the works? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11rs18/i_am_michael_mohan_director_of_the_upcoming_film/c6p261d?context=5)|Thanks so much man.  Yes, I do, but I can't quite speak of it yet.

[What programming methodologies does your team use? ie. agile, scrum, etc.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nuowh?context=5)|This depends on the phase of the project which we're in - during ""normal"" development (like now!) we use a customized scrum-based project. When we're finalling we tend to go back to a traditional team-based just-fix-the-bugs process.
[What do you use for source control and how do you handle refactoring code for optimization? Or do you try for best optimization on the first pass?](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nuowh?context=5)|We use perforce for source control. We have a few branches which we can work in to do refactoring (for optimization or any reason) so we can roll things out when they're ready.
[What standards and practices do you use?](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nuowh?context=5)|Game development is actually pretty normal software development - we use technical design documents, coding standards, code reviews, etc, etc.
[How does someone that is a new graduate get into the game programming job market when most jobs require being part of a published title already?](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nuowh?context=5)|Write games in your spare time! They don't have to be massive, just small polished games. People who are passionate about game development can't help themselves - they write games no matter what. That's how I got into the industry - I wrote a Game Boy emulator.
[What is your engine written in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nuowh?context=5)|It's mostly in C++
[How often to you dive down to the bit level of data manipulation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nuowh?context=5)|Very often :-)
[Ever have to write Assembly code?](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nuowh?context=5)|Sometimes, although these days it's fairly rare.
[Are you guys looking to eventually move to git/mercurial, since Perforce appears to now have Git integration?  When you ""scrum"" what tools do you use to help with the process (ex. Pivotal\)? Are you tasking with hours, story points, sprints, stories, epics, business value, etc.?](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nv7cd?context=5)|As a company, no we won't be moving away from perforce. Git doesn't handle large, binary assets well and that's a problem for us. However, I personally use Git constantly on top of Perforce on my local machine for code. I find having a personal source control solution to manage my many different concurrent tasks and projects an indispensable part of my work process.
[Any especially salient reason for settling on C++?](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nvl94?context=5)|Mostly performance.
[Is your emulator widely used? Or just your personal one.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nv3ba?context=5)|I never released it, sadly - it was really a personal project to see whether I could do it. There were much better ones out at the time :-)
[Can you explain a little more about your personal source control setup? This is really intriguing to me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nwez9?context=5)|Briefly as I need to get back to work =P. I use a git repository that ignores everything except code (so things like *.cpp, *.h, .vcproj, etc. make it in). My master branch is always clean and is what I am in when I sync perforce. Then I have branches for everything I'm working on and just rebase them onto master as I update master. When I'm satisfied with my work, I have a powershell script that takes the differences between my current branch and master, and creates a new perforce changelist with these files in it. I then merge the branch into master then submit the generated changelist (after writing the appropriate description of course =P).
 |I also have a backup repository on another computer that I constantly push to so if I ever have to change machines, experience hard drive corruption or some other catastrophic failure, I still have all my work.
[I'm assuming you took some design steps early on to port it to other platforms easily too, which makes C++ a great choice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nwr9t?context=5)|That's a great point - C++ is pretty portable, which is important for us.
[What do you mean when you say 'mostly C++'? Is it written in other languages as well? How would that even work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nyddk?context=5)|We have a *lot* of different systems - the game client is only one of them (lots of different servers and tools and other backend services). We use a variety of languages depending on the needs of the system.
[Thank you for answering! This was one of those glass shattering as you realize your life could be so much easier moments for me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nz7pr?context=5)|Glad I could help! It took me a weekend of time to get it set up in a useful way. Then that Monday, first time I started using it, I wondered how I ever survived without it!
[ your colleagues aren't complaining about missing commits because you commit entire branches as one patch? (unless I misunderstood this\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6o0mlt?context=5)|The git repository is strictly to assist me in keeping track of my work. I'm not commiting HUGE changes to perforce all at once, I'm still checking in changelists that are the same size as if I hadn't used git. However my git checkins are usually tiny bite-size checkins that you would never check in to a shared repository. The net result is that each branch turns into a log of my work. This of course helps me tremendously when going back and debugging, seeing where I went wrong, how I iterated on a problem, going back to a previous technique as I learn more about what I'm working on, etc.
[My old colleagues would. :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6o0mlt?context=5)|The other major advantage that git provides for me is the ability to quickly be in a clean state. I shut down whatever I'm working in, a quick ""git checkout master"" later and I'm at a clean state that I can branch from and fix a high-pri bug that just popped up and ""ZOMG MUST BE FIXED NAO!"" without losing any work or letting what I'm working on interfere with the bug. It also is nice when someone checks in something that breaks the build (which of course NEVER happens =P). I unwittingly sync up (I always sync p4 when I have git's master branch checked out and check the fresh sync into git with the latest p4 changelist number in the git commit description), then ""git rebase master"" the branch I'm working on. Well, instead of syncing, building, just to find out I'm blocked, I can simply ""git rebase master~1"" and all of a sudden my branch is RIGHT back where it was before I synced and I can continue working as the appropriate party is fixing the blocking issue! (Side effect, this has also helped track down issues in the past as I now have a record of two builds between which the build broke.)
[Why not just use Perforce shelving?](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6o70z0?context=5)|I started using a local git repo around the time that Perforce introduced shelving. The impetus was the fact that shelving appeared to be incredibly useful to me but at the time, p4 didn't allow you to merge changes from a shelve into local changes. This was a huge problem for me as I was always touching a file I had shelved and then dealing with getting everything synced up again after unshelving was kind of a pain. The local solution I started rolling at that point was far more flexible and powerful. I'm also a command-line kind of guy so it all just fit for me. Since then p4 has most definitely improved shelving a LOT and also introduced streams. Both of these features can (I believe) accomplish everything I do with git but I'm used to git and I don't see a need to change currently. The only advantage I see is the reliability of our p4 depot and storing my work there. But I'm used to backing up my git repository constantly so it just doesn't seem worth it to me to switch.
[Will you ever implement or even consider a FoV slider?](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nuoo1?context=5)|We've heard players loud and clear on this one. But we're not prepared to answer yet because we just convened a team to investigate, on Monday in fact, and we want to give them time to investigate. For example, there may be a bug affecting FoV calculations in widescreen resolutions. We want to know what's a bug and what's by design before we change the design.
[What kind of witchcraft you use that makes both Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2 not need hours and hours of downtime for server maintenance and game updates?](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nuwf9?context=5)|Ok, so this is kinda secret, but I'll tell you anyway. I can tell you because it's easy to say and really hard to do.
 |We have a system which lets us run the old build and the new build at the same time. So we don't need to take the old build down when there's a new one, we just *also* host the new build.
 |That's it, it's that simple in concept. But complicated to implement.
 |It also requires great care because our back-end servers must support the old and new build at the same time.  Sometimes (not too often) we have to write code that only runs while both builds are live just to keep things compatible; then we remove it.  As Cam hinted, it's something you have to architect in from the very beginning.
[Do people on the ""old build"" still interact with people on the ""new build"" ? or are they segregated until they get on the same build?](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nw907?context=5)|They are segregated, except for some things like party and guild chat.

[Aww man. I figured you did something like this. One of my favorite features in the entire game is not immediately getting kicked from story mode when there's a new build. I was so goddamn thrilled the first time it told me ""you have 3 hours"" rather than ""you have three minutes.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nz7x8?context=5)|Yeah, it gives you a different amount of time depending on what you're doing. We try to minimize disruption as much as possible.
 |As you say, it would be pretty annoying to be 80% of the way through a dungeon and then get kicked to the new build!
[Is there a point to reporting bots any more? Not ""hey you aren't doing anything about them,"" but more along the lines of the activities I recognize as botting (identical pathing, attacking thin air, identical (default\) appearance, and so forth\) seems like it should be able to be recognized via an automated system.  If I see twelve bots running an identical path killing ALL the things, and only report ten of those (hard to remember if I've already reported xzxcczccx as well as vbcvvbcxxxvb\), do those other two get to keep on going? Or can I report only a handful to have them all looked at?  Is bug reporting in game more effective than on the forum? Or the reverse? Or are they about the same?  For issues like the broken skill point in Metrica Province (with the dead Hylek NPC\), is it really much more complicated than ""if dead, resurrect""? Surface level it seems so trivial to correct, wondering if there's more to it that players aren't seeing.  We've seen some information on the breakdown of the number of players choosing races. Will we be seeing more of that type of information? (side question -- closing in on two months after release, did any of the player demographics surprise the team?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nur36?context=5)|We ban bots in waves.  Those two aren't getting a pass.  There are several advantages of using the forums for both developers and players - we can ask for additional specific information, and also we can respond to threads on the forums.  Both bug reporting and the forums are very useful for us.  Personally, I wish we'd been better prepared with the Trading Post, and that we'd been better prepared with content problems with things like events and skill points.
[Is the culling issue in WvW (making other players invisible for sake of server/client issues\) going to get better? Do you like the state that it is currently in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nuoud?context=5)|Actually we have plans to improve this a *lot*. The biggest problem is making sure that we don't send too much data down to the client and make people on slower connections lag out. But we think this is solvable, we're on it.
 |Cam.
 |The issues with invisible players in WvW comes down to a couple of factors.  One is to do with when the servers notify any given client about other characters in the game (I'll call this reporting/culling) and the other deals with the time it takes the client to present the character on the screen after it has received that notification (I'll call this asset load).
 |The asset load issue is all about how quickly the client can show you something it knows it should show you.  We're looking in to ways that we can make that process faster, but it's always going to take non-zero time.  However, that's not where the bulk of the invisible players come from.  For that we have to look at the reporting/culling side of things.
 |In the situation where the local population density is relatively low, when another character comes in reporting range of your character the server sends a notification to your client with all of the data that it will need to track and render that character.  That includes appearance data, race, gender, profession, weapon sets, etc. etc.  It's an easy model to think about and works well, until the local population density goes up.  When there are a lot of characters in reporting range we start to get into a situation where, under the current system, there's an overwhelming amount of data to send to the client (hello n-squared problem!) - after all, resources like client CPU/Memory/etc. and bandwidth are finite.  In order to deal with this situation we elected to change the criteria for reporting characters slightly.  Rather than just using a fixed range we instead also limit reporting to the closest N characters.  By doing this we help to ensure that we're not overwhelming the available bandwidth and, since clients clearly can't draw or process characters they don't know about, we get some savings on client performance ""for free"".  This works out pretty well in PvE and doesn't seem, at least as far as I can tell, to have a detrimental impact on gameplay.
 |Unfortunately in WvW, where large battles are quite common, we find that players are bumping into these limits quite often and the effect has a real, and unfortunate, impact on the gameplay experience.  Do I like the state that it's currently in?  No, honestly I don't.  WvW has been my baby (though not mine alone!) for quite a while now and I really want to see EPIC battles play out in all of their glory.  If there was a switch I could flip to just make this work then I would have flipped the hell out of it by now, believe me.  However, when you're dealing with resource utilization issues like this there are rarely any easy answers.  I'm currently, actively looking into what exactly our options are in this regard.  The fix is likely to be large-ish in scope, with changes on both the client and server, but we have some ideas that look like they may work out.  So, will it get better?  I can't make any promises because we're still experimenting and building new tech, but as a person who works on this every day I certainly believe that it can and will do everything in my power to make that happen.
[Also, more skins for weapons that are NOT GREATSWORDS. Show more love to the other weapons.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nuwav?context=5)|Apologies in advance for only hitting one of your questions, but I'm not certain of the answers to the rest of them, so ;-)

Being able to move into anyone else's code in the studio and not be distracted by style differences is huge.
[I am currently studying as a software engineer. Any large game or software is amazing, but how do you scale it up to handle so many things happening at once and synchronize this among all players? I can imagine how you might handle player movements, but once you start having  50 players, each moving and using skills multiple times per second, all while there are other mobs... I start to lose sight how this is even possible (without using way too much bandwidth\).  **tl;dr Could you shed light on how you scale these server transactions up to handle so many players and environment objects at once?**](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nuqyk?context=5)|Of course messages are trimmed down as much as possible, but the best way to save bandwidth is to not send messages in the first place. At any given time, there are a lot of characters *not* using skills and *not* changing their movement and *not* even visible to you. We report to you precisely what you need for your view of the world where you are standing.
[What particular role do programmers play in the pre-production or design phase of game development, if any?](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nuuoa?context=5)|This varies a lot by studio. In some places, preprod and design are almost entirely separate from implementation. Those are the less fortunate shops, IMHO. In more pleasant studios like ArenaNet, we do what we can to involve all disciplines in the entire production process. This means that programmers typically have input into what is technically feasible and interesting from day one of design and preproduction.
[How is the coding workload typically divided up among a team of programmers, if at all, at Anet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nuuoa?context=5)|At the moment, we're organized by major groups of features. For instance, my team is focused on security in the game; anything pertaining to that generally lands on our plate. Different individuals always have their own strengths and specialties as well, so they tend to get assigned things that (A) they will enjoy working on and (B) they'll do a great job with.
[About how much time, on average, would you estimate one spends on code per day during the production phase?](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nuuoa?context=5)|This is really tough. How do you define time spent on code? Does that include reading code to find a bug? Does that include time spent talking about code with other developers? Does that include planning meetings that ultimately result in creating code?
[What duties do game programmers have beyond simply writing game code?](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nuuoa?context=5)|Troubleshooting problems is probably the second biggest thing we do, especially post-ship. We also spend a lot of time assisting in the design of new features, as I outlined earlier, to help ensure that everything we tackle is technically solid.
 |Programmers are super important during the design phase - it's really easy for designers to come up with cool ideas which could never be implemented. And (surprisingly commonly) designers sometimes self-limit their ideas because they think they'd be too hard to do - when actually there's an easy way of doing them. It's a collaboration.
 |We have lots of programmers and lots of work to do - we use a task tracking system to keep track of it all. In general our feature teams break down their high level goals into tasks and it'll be picked up by one of the programmers on that feature team.
 |During production, I'd say that a normal programmer would spend about 6 hours a day writing code.
 |Programmers tend to do activities *related* to writing code - brainstorming design ideas with other programmers, writing up technical proposals, buddy checking other programmer's commits, and so on.
 |During pre-production programmers may be working on general engine-level features or supporting prototyping efforts of design ideas.
 |Workload is usually divided up per-feature. For example, I'm mainly responsible for animation-related code in the game client. However, while we do emphasize code-ownership, we also value flexibility and shared knowledge of the code base, which allows us to shift the focus of programmers as different problems arise.
 |This is a tricky question, as it really depends on whats being worked on. If you've got a large feature or problem already worked out in your head or on paper, you may spend the majority of the day writing the code.  However you may instead be working on a tricky bug, which means you'll be spending a good amount of time reproducing the problem, reading debug info, hypothesizing, testing fixes etc.  So... anywhere from 0-8 hours, assuming you're not working overtime.
 |Fixing bugs and coordinating with designers, artists, and/or QA teams.
[Obviously aim high in whatever you do, but for someone like me who has little to no side projects that amount to anything would you suggest that I continue to work on these to set myself apart from everyone else getting into the industry or should I throw my resume out to everyone I can? I wanted to apply for the internship you guys offered but I don’t feel confident with my current skill set which happens to be the reason why I’m doing side projects.  Guild Wars 2 started development in 2007-08 I believe? Over the years I imagine new technologies that were discovered may have outperformed old technologies. What would you suggest that others start to learn today that you would have like to have known in ’07 –’08.  I don’t know how well the programming team delved into the design portion of the game but I imagined everyone had a “Wouldn’t it be cool if…” What was the best “Wouldn’t it be cool if…” that never made it into the release?  Finally I would like to thank you guys for working on such a wonderful game. It has truly blown my expectation out of the water.  P.s. What’s with all the trench coat armor for medium armor? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nuo9t?context=5)|(1) Technologies change all the time; in terms of advising somebody what to learn now ... to be successful as a programmer you'll want to be able to adapt to the the fact that technology does change so often. Experimenting with new technology is a great way to broaden your horizons as a programmer (especially if that means learning a functional language when all you've previously known are other paradigms, for example) as well as a good way to teach you *how* to learn new things.  You totally just need to keep plugging away at your own stuff. Having things to show off is the best way to impress in an interview, and the experience you gain from doing a ""real world"" project (as opposed to some sort of contrived demo) can be invaluable.  Certainly technology always changes. It would have been nice if things like Direct3D 11 were available and ubiquitous back in 2007, but unfortunately hardware takes time and iteration to develop.  No problem. We love to play games as much you guys, so being able to make one with our own ideas is an amazing experience.  Whenever anybody asks me about getting into the industry (as a programmer) my first response has to be: Write code!  Write code!  Write code!  Also, _make games_!!!  There is no substitute for either writing code or making games and the more you do it the better you'll get at it.  So I'd say you should do both: work on side projects as much as possible and send your resume to every company that you'd like to work for.  New technology is awesome but it's not the most important thing.  The most important thing is fundamentals.  The deeper your fundamental understanding and the stronger your critical thinking skills the easier it will be to learn (or invent) new technology on job, and you'll be doing that often.  One of the best things about working at ArenaNet is that we're all there to make the best games we can.  We tend to work on small, cross-discipline feature teams that provide a lot of opportunity to share ideas.  There are a bunch of ideas that didn't make it in, to be sure, but we keep all those around for later and I wouldn't want to spoil anything.
[To the content pipeline programmers, what is the craziest request you had where the only proper response was ""just no""? What was your favorite thing to program? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nvgi7?context=5)|Often designers want us to validate content data in such a way that would require us to solve the halting problem.  As you can imagine, our game content is incredibly complicated, and there are a lot of things that are computationally expensive to verify, especially every time you want to make a change.
 |I built a lot of the tools we used to do very large scale load testing in preparation for launch, which used Amazon EC2 instances to log nearly a hundred thousand game clients into the game in just a few minutes.  It actually literally used hardware spun up all around the world, on (edit: actually FOUR) different continents.  Pushing the button to start those tests was always pretty awesome.
[Please tell me that button was both big and red.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nzgv3?context=5)|It's just the enter key, I'm afraid - it's a little console app that talks to all the aws datacenters around the world and tells them all to begin spinning up instances.  You just type a number in the console of how many you need, and press enter, and it does everything else.  It's much more exciting than that sounds.
[Now that the Mac client is available, any chance of a linux client? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nutwa?context=5)|We have no official plans to launch a linux client. Having said that, I personally use linux a lot (starting with Slackware on those sweet A/D/etc floppy disks) and would love a native client. It's also *really* healthy for your code to support different platforms and compilers.
 |And as stuzart mentions, GW2 does actually run pretty well in Wine.
[Now that you mention it, it would be awesome to know that someone - maybe you - checked from time to time if updates break wine. I understand that wine compatibility can't be a show-stopper, but some of your fans really depend on it :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nvh6a?context=5)|We do actually check this - in fact, we've made a couple of changes specifically for Wine compatibility.
[How did you learn to code?  Do you have any tips for a ""youngling""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nusav?context=5)|1.I've been writing code my whole life. At first I was self-taught and wrote terrible self-taught code. Then I did a Computer Systems Engineering degree and learnt how to do it properly. But in general you get good at coding by writing code.  5.Write games! Seriously, just write lots of code and put something together in your spare time. Or anything technically challenging - I wrote a Game Boy emulator, that's how I got into the industry.  2 - As Cam said, most of our code base is in C++ and I do enjoy that. However my favorite language is probably the one I haven't learned yet =). I'm always trying to learn a new language because I find that just about all of them are valid in some context to solve some set of problems. I see programming languages as tools in my toolbox and picking the right one for the job is very important.  Make games.  Or at least find out if you enjoy making games, as it's not for everyone.  If you do end up teaching yourself programming, keep short and simple goals, and just slowly build up, as there are so many things to learn that go into game development.  Write code!  Make games!  Don't be a game programmer because you kinda want to, be a game programmer because you can't do anything else, because even if nobody paid you to do it you'll still write games anyway.
[What programming language is your favorite and why?  Do you prefer working on a small game or a big game? Why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nusav?context=5)|2.We mostly use C++ - so I guess that's officially my favorite language for writing a game like GW2. But from a pure language perspective, C# is probably my current favorite. I used to use Delphi (ObjectPascal) a lot, so that's probably why.  1 - I started out doing electronics stuff in high school and as a result, learned very low level things (even down to machine language programming at one point). I eventually got higher and higher level and enjoyed programming so much that in college I changed majors to programming.  I love me some C++, but I'm a language geek (both computer and human) so it's hard for me to pick a favorite.  I generally think that there's a right tool for every job and since languages are just another tool it really depends on what problem I'm trying to solve.
 |4.When I started in the industry I worked on a bunch of smaller ""boutique"" titles, so I feel like I've done that, and now I love the challenge of big games.  4 - Both have their advantages and my desires shift with the times. Small games are awesome as I really get the sense of directly affecting the final outcome. However the feeling of being a part of a large project completing successfully is unmatched.  5 - As Cam said, write games =). I would also like to recommend working on your math skills and problem solving skills. I find that most of my job is solving some problem given some set of constraints and nothing teaches you that skill set (IMHO) like higher math. Not to mention that math is of course incredibly useful in its own right as a programmer =P.  I've done both, from a small Nintendo DS game, to this huge MMO... and I'm undecided.  There are things I like and dislike about both.  Amazing, challenging, terrifying, fun, stressful, and immensely rewarding.  Working on games is a dream come true for me, and Gw2 is the kind of project that doesn't come along every day.  I've had a blast.  Small games are great because you get to finish things so (relatively) often, but working on a big game like Gw2 is like nothing else.  I cut my teeth on classic cyberpunk novels (William Gibson, etc.) and I'm still enchanted by the idea of a fully realized metaverse.  I love that working on a massive online world like Gw2 feels like, in some small way, I'm helping to move us toward that goal.
[Can you list all the programming languages used to develop the GW2 client? Is it 100% C++ or do you also incorporate scripting languages like Python or Ruby? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nuww6?context=5)|The game is written in C++. We do use other languages for other aspects of development (our tools framework is in C# and is uses Python for scripting). Many of us engineers will also write scripts for our own personal use, to automate some daily tasks we may do frequently (I use a lot of Powershell and Ruby).
[Is Powershell any good? When I'm on windows I always feel hobbled by the non-unix shell. Even bash via MinGW/Cygwin is annoying.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6ny004?context=5)|It has some quirks, but now that I'm familiar with it I prefer it greatly over bash and zsh, which are the other two shells I most frequently use.
[Can we please get a WvW queue number?  This would REALLY help, especially since it's gotten long on my server since we started winning more.  Probably part of why we're winning more.    Edit: (sorry, steam of consiousness\)  How some form of way to get to the front of the line, with limited use?  Say, allow a guild to skip to the front of the queue one night a week.  Players can only use during one period of time so as to avoid multi-guild abuse.  I've only spent about 15 seconds so haven't thought it through, and this is more of a design thing, but this would allow casuals to better-plan a WvW night with their guild.  Technically feasible, though?    I understand guesting would have to be done carefully so as not to mess up balance in a tight WvW match, but could also be great.  Maybe only allow players to guest to ""undermanned"" servers or those who are behind on total or current points.  Could help create more balanced matches, and maybe you could even put a small price on it, for either the joining players (pay to have no queue!\) or the ones being joined (undermanned?  hire mercenaries!\).  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nutxa?context=5)|Hmmm this is probably secret, but we're all friends here! We have something in development which will greatly increase the number of people who can play WvW at the same time.
[I was wondering how events are scripted, do the people who create events have to script it all by hand, or do you use some sort of WYSIWYG tool that writes the scripts for them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nv0qo?context=5)|Events and other content in our game are created with a proprietary in-house tool called Duo, which uses a custom scripting language (it's more-or-less a visual tool, but reads like text and not a graph of ""nodes"").
[ if so: What kind of language do you use? and how much flexibility does it provide?](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mz4k/i_am_a_programmer_for_guild_wars_2_amaa/c6nv0qo?context=5)|During the development of the tool we worked very closely with the designers who would be using it on a day-to-day basis to make sure that it they'd be able to use it efficiently and effectively for all the content they need to build.

If you are a college student attending one of these colleges and are looking to make a little extra money here and there keep reading.  I am a current intern with [Course Hero](www.coursehero.com).  Course Hero is a massive web database of over 7 million high quality study materials from over 4,000 colleges.  They hire college students like you and me as interns to help add to this database.  What you are paid to do is essentially collect high quality student generated study material (i.e. study guides, note sets, practice quiz/test, assignment, power points, flash cards, essay papers).  They compensate you $10 every time you ""complete"" a class which is just getting 10 total documents under that class tag.  Example: You have 15 old ENGL 1101 papers on your hard drive, add those papers to complete your English course, now those papers are a 10 dollar bill. I cashed out quite nicely my first week just by asking a few studious friends to help me out.  There is no minimum cash out because they payout every 2 weeks by way of direct deposit.  If you are an enrolled student at any of the above colleges and are interested in this program please pm me with ""Course Hero"" in the subject line.  "

11srdk,4,2012-10-20,Advice on starting Cuttings,McFX,botany,https://www.reddit.com/r/botany/comments/11srdk/advice_on_starting_cuttings/,"Hey y'all, 

I'm currently finishing my internship as a gardeners assistant at a ""big company"", where a lot of plants get thrown out for various reasons, but my ""boss"" has been giving me some of them, to try and start growing them by myself.

Now, I'm looking for advice on starting these cuttings.

As of now, I have a Rubber Tree (Ficus Elasticus) and a two ""Trazema/Traxema"" (not certain on the name, I'll post pics if we can't figure it out), but my concern is this;

What Advice on starting cuttings do you have?

I've just put them in glass bottles, filled with water.

The bottles are dark glass, as was recommended to me, as far as I know, this is so algae doesn't form/rotting doesn't occur, but maybe I'm totally wrong.

I'm guessing that different plants need different growing mediums/strategies, but what are some general tips you can provide for starting cuttings this way?

Alternatively you could just tell me what you definitely would NOT do when trying to induce rooting.

Thanks!"

There is a school near my called Capitol College (http://www.capitol-college.edu/).  They seem to have a pretty cool Astro program as they are partnered with NASA's Goddard Space Flight Institute, which is only a few miles away.  The majority of their Astro students seem to intern there.

Price isn't an issue as my tuition will be 100% covered by the GI Bill and the Yellow Ribbon Program.  

This school only has 400 undergrads spread across 12 different majors and another 350 Grad students for a total of about 750 students.  The small class sizes will be a big plus, but I feel that a school of this size might not be able to offer some of the opportunities that larger schools can offer.  University of Maryland is only a few more miles down the road and has a very large engineering department.  

Thoughts?

I get to go on ride-a-longs and respond to calls with the officers.  A call came in, in which we went to pick up a few guys who would be taken to the town jail for questioning.  We arrive, and I follow my officer over to where the other officers are standing and looking at the four guys who will be taken into custody.

Then one of the guys who is arrested looks over at me and says, ""Who's that fat bitch?""  ""Seriously, what's the fat bitch looking at?""  ""She hungry.""  ""Are ya hungry?""  ""What are you staring at ya fat bitch?""  ""Look at you, you should call Jenny.""  ""I have Jenny's number, want it?""  ""Why don't you loose some weight, you wouldn't look so bad then.""  ""Look at your fat, hangin over your pants.""  (which it wasn't, mind you, I always look nice) ""Man she so fat, she should go on my diet plan.""  ""Ya ever been on a diet?  Cause you sure need one.""  ""Ya ugly fat bitch.""

This went on for five minutes.  The entire time I stood there, stoned face while everyone just stared at me.  No one even told him to shut up.  He just kept going on.  I am so embarrassed.  I've been working with these officers for a couple months now trying to make a good impression and now it's just tainted by one guy to say those horrible things to me.  The entire time I was thinking to myself, don't cry don't cry don't cry.  I felt like I couldn't say anything back to him because none off the officers did.

As one of the officers took him away past me, this guy blew me kisses then wagged his tongue as if to show that he wanted to eat me out.  Ya know, that face.  He kept calling me a fat bitch and the other things written above and I turned around and just stared at him.  I didn't want to give him the satisfaction of being able to make fun of me behind my back, I wanted to face him.  And I did.  

Fuck that was hard.  I know I'm overweight, but have never had an aggressive, hateful experience like this in my life.  And I can't believe not one person stood up for me and tell him to keep quiet.  Can't they see how hurtful that was?  Maybe they didn't know what to do, but still.

Now I've been crying about this for an hour now.  I'm not even going to tell any of my friends because they probably wouldn't have anything helpful to say.

Does anyone have any experience applying and receiving internship offers for companies overseas?  Since I am mostly an English speaker (I can speak and read a little French, but probably not enough to comfortably live there) I am mainly looking at the U.K. and Australia.

The specific industry and field doesn't matter very much to me.  My previous work was in Manufacturing and Product Development, but I think something dealing with the Energy Industry would be pretty interesting.  My main goal is to get out of my comfort area and explore somewhere new!"
11shki,82,2012-10-20,Some Reflections I've had tonight.,[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/11shki/some_reflections_ive_had_tonight/,"I'm going to try and make this short and sweet!

The last few days of my life have been eye opening.  I am a long time lurker and have noticed a few things about myself and my fellow fapstronauhts.   Whether it is obvious to you or not, fapping can indirectly affect the people around you.  In the last week I have had both confidence and happiness.  The happiness has helped my whole family to be more happy and friendly towards each other.  I was constantly crabby living on a porn infused high which affected the people I loved.  My confidence has also been great, the last time I was at twenty-five days I made a speech at my sisters wedding.  Now most of you can relate to me.. I hate speeches!  I took a class on it and had a hard time speaking infront of 20 people.  But during this speech and my nofap all time record, I proceeded to both charm and humor the crowd of one hundred plus people.

The moral of the story is, whether your problem is big (like mine) or small, to work at it not only for yourself but for the people around you.  I have seen many posts on here saying that nofap didn't work or didn't give you the results you wanted.  But I think getting rid of this disgusting part of your life is freeing and contributes to you people in individual ways.  Some resolutions are more obvious than others, but keep at it and you will see differences for the better.

I just want to say a quick thanks to this community because if I had not stumbled upon it I would not be experiencing the success, gratitude, and happiness I am experiencing today.  

Oh, and I got an internship.. and I'm browsing for girl friends.

TL;DR  It's totally worth it."

Possibly animated?: On set of a movie being shot, an intern keeps asking everyone for the star's shoe horn. After a while, someone suggest he tries putting his shoes on without it. The intern informs them it's not for his shoes, but to get his enormous penis into his pants.

I decided to study abroad in China. There is a VERY good chance I won't have to pay a single cent because I applied to a multitude of scholarships.

Don't care about friends, dating, etc. I'm going regardless of their blessing or not. I see it as an opportunity of a lifetime and it's important for me to go. I've already put so much work into the scholarships and I would see it as a waste not to go. I'll be doing an internship over there and will be heavily applying for others when I get back. I lived my whole life stuck where they wanted me. I haven't really been able to life my life to the fullest because I always listened to them. To be honest it has made me miserable.

What college courses should I consider?,edthefreak,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/11s3u2/considering_a_job_in_game_audio_what_college/,"I'm currently in my fall semester of my sophomore year, majoring in Sound Recording. The course is aimed at working in the studio and is actually a very good program. I'm not sure in what direction of audio I want to go in yet, though I've been considering game audio. Does anyone have any info on game audio and what the job entails? I've ordered some books on it that I'm going to read and took a seminar on sound design. It just seems hard to find information about. What kind of classes should I be adding into my schedule to benefit me for the career? I'd have to double check our audio electives though I believe one of them is sound synthesis. I'm also highly considering taking programming, which I figure would be helpful no matter what field I decide on. Also, is there maybe a language or something I should take?

EDIT 1:
Ignoring my gen. eds and general music courses, I take these sound courses:

* Intro to Recording
* Critical Listening
* Acoustics &amp; Psychoacoustics
* Recording Production
* Video Production
* Audio Theory
* Fundamentals of Sound Recording
* The Recording Industry
* Recording Studio Repair &amp; Maintenance
* Multitrack Production
* Computer Science for Sound Recording Applications
* Sound Recording Internship

Other sound recording(and music) classes that become options are:

* Sound Synthesis 1
* Sound Synthesis 2
* Advanced Multitrack Production
* Arranging

We also have a ton of computer science courses to take and the languages: French, German, Italian, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, and Cambodian. I think they used to offer Japanese but I don't know what happened to it.

11s16m,5,2012-10-19,Custom NPC Entities for campaigns,cwonder,rpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/11s16m/custom_npc_entities_for_campaigns/,"Here are some NPC entities that I've created for my campaign. They're mostly for ease of use and simplifying some fluff. Feel free to use any or all of them. Your players may find some quirky ways to use them, my players have. If you want any numbers associated with DC or other checks, I'll let you know. I told my players that they shouldn't try and they haven't so far.

These all are used throughout the empires/kingdoms in my setting and any city of significant populace/adherence to rules can have any or all of the offices. 

Also noted: I've created a kind of ""magical fingerprint"" idea which allows mages to read someone's ""aura"" or ""mark"" in my campaign. In practical terms for a player, it functions like a detect spell, but can identify one particular individual. It can't be used for anything else but identification of a person (not spells or effects or abilities), so it has no potential for abuse. It works like a log-in for a website. You submit to an scan, they assign a proprietary ID, and encrypt it so that only their offices can use it. Each service uses it's own ID, so there isn't worry about someone getting ahold of it and being able to steal your identity. That is, unless you want to modify it... heh heh heh.

1. Arcane Messaging Service: Magic Western Union. Users can pay a small fee to transfer any message (up to a few pages in length) from any office to any other office. Messages are protected by arcane signatures and protective spells so that they are untraceable. Other features can be purchased for small fees that include things like: Deliverable to multiple people (e.g. any party member); Distant delivery (for those towns that don't have an office); Message delivery confirmation; etc. As long as nothing is blatantly evil or trying to overthrow the kingdom, any message will be delivered with complete secrecy.  

2. United Travel Services: Horse Rental. Horses are branded with an Arcane Mark, which is marked as ""out"" or ""received"" between any of the stables associated. A minor fee is charged to rent a horse by the day/days, or a pair with a wagon (also arcane marked), and the treatment or lack thereof determines any additional fees. Not returning a horse for what ever reason garners a heavy fine and a kingdom-wide warrant. All horses are equal in my world, but if you feel like nightmares or flying carpets could be rented, feel free.

3. Mages Guild: With chapters in all major cities, and a mage or two in smaller ones, the mages guild is basically a magical public library with other neat features. Books are not allowed out of the library, but may be studied for any amount of time. Interns can conduct a search and bring all relevant books to you for a small tip. All searches and studies are kept private except for those ""dark"" tomes which are regulated (as noted below). Nooks with spell scribing manuals, basic ritual books, rune charts, parchment, and quills and ink are provided. NO MAGIC is to be cast whilst studying, save quick-scribe or copy cantrips. Joining the guild requires a measure of arcane talent and a fee. Casting a larger spell reduces the fee. After first joining, the members are considered level 0. To progress to the next level, a member must scribe a scroll/scrolls/wands/magic items equal to twice the level attempted. Only one level may be achieved per solstice. The benefits of each level can vary, but mine works as such: 

Level 0: Access to the library of the home chapter. Can take one arcane class per year. (classes can grant any benefits, maybe a spell learned, maybe access to a cross-class feat, etc. Classes take anywhere from a week to two months to complete, at the DM's discretion.)

Level 1: Access to the libraries of other chapters within the continent. Access to one ""dark"" magic tome once per solstice. Can take one arcane class per solstice.

Level 2: Access to libraries worldwide. Access to two ""dark"" tomes per solstice. Can take up to four arcane classes per year.

Level 3+: An increasing level of access. I haven't had to worry about creating these levels. It's up to the DM. 


Hope these help. I might post a little more later, but I figure this wall of text is enough for now."

Any one of you who lives in a city knows the frustration:  If slummin' it isn't your style, you either you pay through the nose to live in a safe apartment building, or you go with an hour-long commute.

I'm a newbie secretary, so I had to go with option 2. But in January my lease was up, and I had recently been vomited on during my commute, so I was browsing for a superior living situation. My friend had a friend who was in a similar situation, and hooked us up.

We got along ok, she was some kind of intern for HR, and she told me she wanted to live in this place, like a 10 min bus ride from my work!
I feel like crying when I remember how cheerful I was that day. 

The place was okay. It's just a common room with a kitchen and two bedrooms to the right. Thin walls, but my bedroom is nice and quiet. My roommate was quiet and spent most of her time out.. though she was a bit of a food thief. The landlord gives us tea from time to time, and it always disappears immediately.

But things are just a little off.

First of all, my roommate?  I stayed off one day sick, lying in the common room, watching TV and wishing I could fall asleep. I saw her go in her room after breakfast. 11 Hours later she comes back in... through the front door.  What?  Her room doesn't even have windows! It's pretty clear to me that she doesn't work 'in hr'. Her hours are truly weird and she dresses more 'casual' than 'business'. 

The room next door.. people go in and out all the time. But I think it must be super-soundproofed. I never hear them. Ever.

The people who go in are a diverse cast. They are all, however, wearing suspiciously nice clothing. Like I can tell nice suites, and most of them are definitely horse-hair handmade.

People are shuffling just massive boxes in and out all the time, moving them up from the basement and back down again.

Then one day I'm taking a late-day, walking past the elevator. It starts to open and someone sees me, yells 'fuck' and forces the doors to close. 
But I saw what was in the elevator.
It looked like an operating table.

My roommmate is waiting for me when I get home after work that day.

I'm like, what? But before I can react she's shutting herself in her room. Five minutes later, the landlord is at my door.

""Sorry to bother you dearie, but we had a bit of trouble this morning and I need to ask a couple questions.""

""Okay.""  I smile my secretary smile. My landlord is a fat southern gentleman type. He's okay.

""Somethin got stolen this morning, a big somethin. Wouldn'ta fit down the stairs. Your dollface roommate told me that you mighta been in the building when the thieves were in - I really hope you can help us out. 11am, the elevator? See anyone in the elevator?""

He sounds so sweet, but all I can think about is the strangeness my roommate just exhibited. 

""Oh, wow, sir. Yeah. I was walking passed the elevator, and it started to open, but my back was turned! I only even looked cuz I heard someone yell, but the doors were closing. I couldn't see anything.""

""Oh hell sweetie, might notta been them. Don't worry. I'll see you soon.""

""Thanks, sir. Oh.. and thanks for the sweet tea. It was good.""

The expression on his face makes my stomach plummet. Just a smile. A tiny smug little smile and eyes just staring me straight through. Fucking glad I'd heeded my roommate. ""Well I'll drop more off tomorrow, doll.""

My roommate comes out only 5 minutes later. At first she doesn't say anything, just pacing. But then she turns and just stares at me. She looks so tired. So, completely wiped.

""Leave.  Leave tonight.""

""What?""

""Do it or I'm going to fuck you up. I'm going to fuck you to hell."" Holy shit, she's going for the knives.  And holy shit, you better believe I left.

I spent the week with my parents 4 hours away, using up all my sick time.

When I finally told them my story when my sick time was up and I needed to return, they immediately told me that I couldn't go back. I was like, my stuff is still there.  So we went together.

The building.  The building, it was abandoned.

Reddit, the building was abandoned.  Locked and barred and not opened for YEARS. We checked the adress 3 times. Drove down side-streets. But no, there is the bakery I always went to!  There's my bus stop!  That's my building!

My parents look shocked, I'm stammering.  I ask a passing woman what that building is.

""Oh honey, everyone knows the Gran Ol Red.  Haunted, they say.  You know, it was shut down when they found out the landlord was running a prostitution ring out of it.  Oh, not just any ol sex for your money! No, they say that some of the men payed for the girl's lives.. if you know what I mean.""

I was in the car before she finished the story.

My parents let me live with them now.

It's okay.  The drive to the therapist is only 10 minutes, and they don't mind taking me."

Intern or employer?",xxpx,ipr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ipr/comments/11uqb1/is_an_internship_considered_as_workforhire_in_us/,"I was an intern in a small wholesale company for over a year where I had an idea to develop an integrated software solution that would help any company of the same type get organized. A verbal agreement was made that I could keep the IP rights to my code being free to sell it, and the company would have exclusive license to use/modify its copy. I developed the software mostly as an intern, and recently as an employee (still no contract), heavily underpaid.

Recently the company has changed its attitude and asked me to sign a contract giving them 50% of the IP rights ownership. I didn't sign, I am now checking what my options are. My question is: **Who owns the IP rights to the software if no contract was present? Intern or an employer?** What are my options to legally claim my code and avoid any future disputes? If I leave the company tomorrow, can they sue me if I modify and sell the software for profit?

It was a big mistake on my part that I didn't ask for written agreement up front, I never thought this would become an issue since the company dealt with wholesale goods, completely unrelated to software. What they are asking is not fair and shows how greedy they've become. Hopefully the law is on my side.

From googling and some e-books I have gathered some terminology like OLAP/cubes/data mining/SAP/ETL etc but it is a bit overwhelming. Two questions:

- I would like to know what you, professional in BI, do on a regular day? (Can you be specific in terminology please so I can google). Or the frequent BI tasks, I know some time is lost on meetings, helping interns or what not. For example as a web dev: translate psd to html/css/js, db modeling, writing queries, programming back-end funcionalities etc.

- Is there an advantage or skills set overlap if I came from .NET development? I recently graduated, have done some .NET (school)projects with SQL Server/dashboards/C# and I liked it. But I want to try something else. Recently there are some openings for traineeships in BI at some big companies and I would like to know my chances.

Thanks!

For a little over a month now the transmission has started to slip from first to second gear. The car does still shift, but very roughly. It got slightly better (I believe this is due to the colder weather we are having) but regardless, I do not want to keep chewing up the transmission, and I'm curious to see if there might be any simple fixes available. I have heard that this may be caused by the transmission's governor gear, and this looks easy enough to replace. If the problem is much more involved or costly, I will probably just drive this car until the transmission is no longer usable, as I would lose less money scrapping it than trying to fix the transmission.

I don't know which to follow. I'm a junior in high school so time is running out to decide on majors/colleges/careers and I'm scared shitless about the future.

The first is cars: I love them so much. I work on/restore old cars with my friend Jack, I work at my city's car shows every year, I design them in my free time, etc. I feel like a career in Auto Engineering designing new cars and technologies would be amazing, but I worry about finding such jobs right out of college, and I don't think the pay is excellent (correct me if I'm wrong). Of my choices, that one sounds like it would be the most fun and the one that I could enjoy the most every day and do for the rest of my life.

The next is music: I play 4 instruments as well as sing and I love music more than anything else in the world. It inspires me in my darkest moments and I want to be able to share that inspiration with others through my own creations. However, music jobs are few and far between, with little to no substantial pay unless you're an executive or MASSIVELY successful. That would be amazing for me, but it just doesn't seem like a practical thing to pursue.

Thirdly, we have sports: I'm (without wishing to brag at all, just being factual) a farily good baseball player, at least enough to get me a scholarship somewhere. Obviously, baseball players make huge money (Major League Minimum is somewhere in the ballpark of $500k a year) but the chances of getting there are so slim it's almost disheartening. I would have to work my ass off every single day for the next 10 years just to have a chance, which in the end might not pay off. So I don't know about that one

Engineering is the fourth: I love to create and problem solve, and both of my older siblings went into computer engineering and have said it's awesome. My close friend's dad is a programmer for Microsoft and has arguably the best job ever. He works ~25-30 hours a week, and programs in his free time because he loves it so much. He works out of his basement and makes absolutely enormous paychecks. That would be an amazing life to have, especially for raising a family. Engineering/Programming jobs pay the most right now of any career path, so that's the option I'm most leaning towards.

Lastly, law: My grandpa, dad, aunt, and a few close family friends are all lawyers, so I've grown up with that life all around me and I love it to death. Logical thinking and mystery solving have always been strong suits of mine, and because I know so many people in the business, my work would be cut out for me in terms of internships and employment straight out of college. Obviously, law pays quite well, but my concern is the cost of law school, both monetary, as well as time spent in class. It would be a great profession for me, and I'd enjoy it quite a lot, but I'm still on the fence.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read all of that! Any and all advice is more than welcome."

Scared that there is no happy future.,accuallyisthrowaway,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/11tsc3/ive_lost_my_direction_in_life_scared_that_there/,"Some context: I graduated from Oxbridge in Maths at the end of June. I got a lower second class degree, and nearly all graduate-level jobs require at least an upper second class, usually not even looking at those who don't meet the condition. It's not that I didn't try, I was competing for grades with the best in the country. I'd have gotten a great grade anywhere else.

So now I've been umployed for nearly four months with a crap grade and zero work experience (it's practically impossible to get an internship without connections here). I've decided what I want to do, but the only way into it is through graduate schemes which are taking applications now for a start next autumn. I'm having trouble filling in the application forms (bullshit questions like ""name a time when you have made a suggestion to improve a process"" that no one coming straight out of uni will have a decent answer to), and thus only getting through about one a week (Reddit is definitely not helping in this regard) and feeling very guilty about it. And then there's the fear that none of these will come through and I'll still be here on square one next year. And I don't even know what to do in the meantime. I can't even get a shitty retail job to sustain myself because there's so much unemployment in my hometown.

So I'm stuck at home living with my family who I absolutely cannot stand, in a house that is nowhere near big enough and has no privacy, with -£1000 in my bank account. My friends have all moved away. I feel confined and generally shit. I'm probably going to finally book an appointment with the doctor about depression on Monday, but I just can't see a way out of this situation."

I've been to several resume workshops and have had several contacts try to help me out (""Wait for something to show up on BESS (Boeing's application area), tailor your resume, and apply.."" is literally the advice I've gotten from hiring managers and employees there.).

It's apparent that I've been doing something really wrong in my job search and need some advice on how to get into the field.  The problem that's been suggested to me is that I have no work experience, which has the obvious Catch -22 being that I can only get experience if I can get a job. I'm going to take the GRE in November and apply to grad schools to try to make myself more marketable (and because I found I like doing research, which I found out way too late in college).  But, I really don't want to go through with it if my situation after getting my Master's will be exactly like it is now, except for the possibility of becoming high 5 figures in debt.

I have found that I have a fairly common story: met a girl in Jr. year of high school and she was my first everything. We dated until I graduated high school and then continued in a FWB capacity but with more emotional involvement. I missed out on my Freshman year of college trying desperately to hang on to my high school sweet heart who was a year below me. Halfway through the year she started hooking up with other guys. I was shattered. I tolerated it, trying to reclaim my exclusivity, ceding more and more to her. Finally she broke it off and I was quite literally left in the rain to walk three miles to a bus back to campus from a Seattle suburb at five in the morning.

For the last year and a half my life has been colored by the melancholy left over from the memories of the relationship. Any improvements in my character came from my subconscious attempts to continue to qualify myself to her long after any kind of regular contact had been severed. I had a serious case of oneitis.

A few months ago I Stumble[d]Upon Seddit and I began diving into the side bar and regular posts. The inner game posts were most helpful. Inner assurance and ""game"" is what I lacked. Like every AFC I was hesitant to apply what I read here but when I began to the quality of my interactions with people jumped. They became memorable occurrences for all parties involved and usually ensured pleasant future interaction. This new-found confidence helped me score the internship of a lifetime and make a ton of social breakthroughs I couldn't have imagined a month prior. The most important thing was that I ceased to qualify myself to others. Let me try to explain it in a way more helpful than ""just be yourself."" Its never Just that simple.

Justification of your choices and your lifestyle to anyone is unnecessary unless you are impacting them in some adverse way. Seeking approval is not the way to go. Be happy with the decisions you make simply because you derive pleasure from them. Or at least you should. Stop asking yourself what you should do or say as if there is another person in there to consult. Act on that first impulse. Analysis is good, exchanging ideas is better but nothing beats action. Alright? Enough self-motivating maxims from this guy. This reddit is full enough of great ones as is.

I came for the seducation and am staying for the self-improvement. Speaking of seduction, (what we're actually here to read about) application of what Seddit preaches has paid dividends for me as well even though I don't feel like those are as valuable as my gains in self-confidence. In the last two weeks I have managed several #-closes, (some with followups!) a k-close and an f-close, the last I hope to turn into my first field report. This is all while working 7-days a week and taking a full college course load. Yes, I'm pretty damn proud of that. 

Thank you Sedditors, especially all of the contributors and comment-ers who make this a constructive community."

A week ago, I just started another part time internship, and well, I just need to quit it. It's a nice internship, but I already have a pretty full resume for a soon-to-be college graduate and don't have a lot of need for it (especially since I've just been offered full time at the other company, which I love). I originally took it on hoping to see come December which position offered me full time and which one I would want to take.

Would it be good to just be completely honest? That my other company has offered me full time and more hours?

I am also curious - the internship is highly specialized, and I would be surprised (but happy for them) if they found a student who had as much experience as me in the field already... and quite honestly, they were asking a lot of me in terms of completion dates compared to the amount of hours I worked. That was completely fine, as I had much more experience in it already and it made meeting those dates much easier. However, I couldn't imagine another student being able to meet those dates.

I'm taking an incredibly light and easy courseload and I don't know why, but basically I study/read/do homework 6-10 hrs a week and I manage to get all A's. So anyway, I wake up at 7:30 or 8 every morning, drive to the train station, take the train into the city, stay for a class or two, and get home at around 12-1:30. And then aside from maybe an hour of studying I have nothing to do... I love music, but I can't sit down and listen for hours, so I watch Netflix, but I can't do that for hours either, etc.

I'm bored as hell most of the time, and while I don't *need* money right now, I'm certainly not opposed to it. Why *wouldn't* I get a job right now?

I don't know. I want a job. I need a job (so I can feel better about myself). But I can't motivate myself enough to actually go and look for jobs, and I don't know why. But here are some theories:

1) I have a pretty bad case of ADHD, and lack of motivation is a pretty common symptom of ADHD. But I don't want to hide behind a disorder :/ 

2) I'm on an antidepressant right now, which gives me quite the flat affect - would that have something to do with it? I certainly can't use the excuse of being so depressed I can't walk outside, because, well, I'm not depressed right now. 

3) I have quite a bit of social anxiety, so I'm sure that has to do with me not wanting to drop in a bunch of places and asking for the manager, to whom I would then ask if they were hiring, and if so, then I'd have to worry about not fucking up the interview, bla bla bla... (Unfortunately, online applications still require you to go in and introduce yourself, so that's not an option.) 

4) I get bored of things *incredibly* easily, so I'm slightly concerned my job performance would suffer (but mostly that I'd be bored). It would have to be non-monotonous work but c'mon, what part-time job for a college student (discounting internships) *won't* be monotonous? 

I'm just confused why I lack this motivation. I have all the reasons to get a job - yet I can't/won't. I've always considered myself pretty lazy, but now I'm wondering if I've actually been right this whole time, and I'm just a lazy person :/

Also, it worries me that potential employers will notice such a gap in work history (my last job ended last January). And on a very different note, if I *do* happen to get the nerve to go up and talk to a girl, there's no way she'd be interested in some schmuck who's mooching off his parents because he doesn't have any independence, and just lays at home all day and doesn't talk to anyone.

I'll probably bring all of this up with my therapist when I see him next."

11wiku,1,2012-10-22,"Wow, this place is dead! Here's MY successful game-plan throughout freshman year so far. (long, but descriptive)",[deleted],UniSeddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniSeddit/comments/11wiku/wow_this_place_is_dead_heres_my_successful/,"**Key parts:** 1) Mindset, 2) Posture/Voice, 3) Contact, 4) Charisma/Confidence

**My mindset is fairly simple when I go out at night.**  Whatever happens, happens; as long as you're happy, enjoy yourself.  If I get slapped in the face by a girl I try to put a move on (never happened yet), then so be it.  If I end up bringing a girl back to my room for the night, then so be it.  If I wake up with texts from some girl I met calling me an asshole for ditching her, then so be it.  You need to realize that the only thing that is important, is what's important to you. And what's important to you should be your happiness.  If hooking up with multiple girls per night/weekend makes you happy, do it.  If being exclusive with one girl makes you happy, do that.  Don't conform your ideals of happiness to what your friends or society believe in, because you can't bullshit your own happiness.  Seriously.  Once you know what makes you happy, you can work towards that goal and once you achieve it, you'll feel on top of the world.

**Posture and voice are ridiculously important.**  What girl wants to talk to a guy holding a cup slouched over against a wall at a party? You don't look interesting.  You look like a bored, boring person, who doesn't have fun.  Also, when talking to a girl, talk with a purpose.  Don't mumble, it's not enjoyable to try to figure out what someones saying.  Don't yell, you'll just come off as a drunk shithead (even if you're not).  Talk calm, confidently, and about interesting shit (after you've gotten her name, where's shes from, where she's living, major, blah blah blah). 

**Not just physical contact, but eye contact is essential.**  I learned the hard way (via a subtweet on twitter, haha) that a girl I took on a date lost interest in me because apparently I wasn't making enough eye contact.  Looking back, almost every time we talked during a conversation, my eyes switched from hers, to the table we were sitting at, to my phone, back to the table, back to her eyes.  It was just too much, and it probably made her feel uncomfortable that I couldn't look her in the eye for more than a few seconds.  Just keep good eye contact, that's all I'm saying (not just on dates, but at parties, or when talking to ANYONE).  In addition to eye contact, physical contact could either make/break your chances.  Next time you're getting close with a girl at a party (by party, I mean anywhere where there's close seating/standing with others, with music, and alcohol being served) try lightly touching her when you respond to something she says.  She says, ""Yeah, I'm from Boston.""  Lightly put your hand on her upper arm/near her shoulder and say, ""What? So am I!"" (only if you are though..that's just an example).  If you're both standing and talking and you're picking up good vibes (trust me, you'll know when you are) try grabbing the lower side of her back and pull her in to talk.  If it's loud (which post parties are) then actually move your head in to whisper while you pull her in.  Girls fucking LOVE this shit.  Sitting down with a girl on the couch? You're an idiot if your arms not around her.  Even if she acts confused or she doesn't ""go with it"" when you put your arm around her, just say you're trying to make the rest of the guys here jealous, and laugh about it.  When you and her are sitting on the couch (presumably with your arm around her) don't just be a dead fish.  When you say something funny, or exciting, do something with your hand on her side like a little squeeze or something.  You really just need to go with the flow at that point.

**Your confidence/charisma are what WILL seal the deal.**  Once again, what type of girl would want to spend her time with someone who doesn't like himself? Answer: NO GIRL!  Be interesting, and be interested!  Don't go on an extended story about some lame ass prank you pulled in high school; don't talk about your ex girlfriend for more than 10 seconds (it almost always gets brought up, it's just a matter of how you react to this part of a conversation. if she asks what happened, just say it was bad timing for a relationship, conversation over).  Are you smart?  Subtly imply it.  You have your own business (even if it's still in the works)?  No harm in mentioning it! I can't tell you how many times I've joked with girls and said they could work as our intern, and when they ask what they'd do, I just tell them they'd get to chill with me and our team, smoke weed, and respond to emails and they always crack up, and I don't think I've NOT gotten a number after saying that to a girl.  Charisma, charisma, charisma.  Not everyone has it naturally, but you can still have it by putting in work.  Be **THAT** guy at the party that people love.  **THAT** guy who nobody can say anything bad about, but can be regarded as a good guy.  Surround yourself with a good group of friends, not the jackasses who try to hit on every single girl at a party until they find one drunk enough to fuck in the bathroom.  Wear nice clothes when you go out, you'll feel better and more confident.  Wear cologne, GOOD cologne.  Personally, I use [Givechny Play Sport](http://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Givenchy/Play-Sport-14596.html) and I've gotten too many compliments to recall.  I legitimately use my cologne as an opener when having parties in my dorm (which is often).  If I smell my shirt and can no longer get a whiff of my scent, I'll go to a girl nearby and ask if she can smell my cologne.  If she can't (she won't), I bring her over to my toiletries and spritz my shirt, and have her smell.  Instant compliments = Instant confidence.  Work with that, use it to generate a good conversation.  *Don't be an asshole to people, because people remember.*  *Don't be a little bitch, because people remember that as well.*  Be charismatic!  Be someone that you'd want to be friends with!  Be someone that you would see at a party and just silently respect.  And just a side note: nobody silently respects that belligerently drunk guy.  They may laugh at him and find him funny, but he's not the guy that anyone will go to for questions, or for help, or advice.  

**TL;DR:** 1) This subreddit is fucking dead, can we please get it going again?   2) Don't be a prick; don't be a boner; don't be a creep; don't be a pussy.  Be THE man.  Trust me, it's so very doable, especially in college, a place where you can basically start out new and become whoever you want to be.  

I'd love to start contributing more (and reading more) in this subreddit, but I can't be the only one to post here within the past month. "

11wh8k,1,2012-10-22,"Need advice on my ""engineering"" experiences thus far...",IAmKramerTheRacist,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/11wh8k/need_advice_on_my_engineering_experiences_thus_far/,"Hey guys, I guess I should give you a little background first. I was interning at my company, which is a structural engineering company, (I myself am an ME who just recently graduated from grad school with my masters this past may) since the end of 2007 up to the beginning of 2012.

I basically did very little actual engineering work. Most of the work I had done was coding, which was actually something I didn't know a damn thing about going into the job. The most engineering work I did was when I had to make a program that could do bending moment diagrams...keep in mind that I worked on this for about a month during my internship. The rest of the time I was coding and making a program run the way we wanted to (no engineering work here at all, just aesthetics). I stayed here because the money was really good and the schedule was anything I wanted it to be.

This January when I was going to start searching for a full time job, they actually gave me a job offer which I accepted. I was told that since our company is small, we could be flexible in the types of projects we get. In the offer sheet, I was told that my duties would involve mechanical engineering, mechanical design, software development support, and experimental research.

In theory this sounded great, but so far, all that I have done seems to be intern type work. I've had to buy stuff from online for projects, reserve cars, and manipulate a program to match some data. I'm still doing some coding, but we are almost done with the program that we've been working on. I've done very few engineering type things such as using Solidworks, LS-DYNA, and some other things that don't come to mind right now. Basically, if I had to turn it into a percentage, I'd say that 90% of my time is spent doing bitch work and 10% may be engineering related work.  They also just got me to work on a final report for a project that I had absolutely nothing to do with...

SO, with all that all being said, is it time for me to look for another job or is this just the process that all entry level engineers go through?

And because this post is so damn long...
TL;DR-I am an ME that interned at a structural engineering company for 4 years doing non-engineering work, was finally given a full time job offer in January. Full time job duties include 90% bitch work and 10% engineering work. Is this normal?"
11wgwq,2,2012-10-22,"I know I'm only 19, but help me gain some optimism about this break up.",waithereallthetime,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/11wgwq/i_know_im_only_19_but_help_me_gain_some_optimism/,"I'm 19(f), and I'm currently on a break with my 23(m) boyfriend. We dated for a year, and were best friends prior. Things have been getting pretty rocky the past few months, and I find myself becoming more and more resentful about what's going on (won't get into details, as that's for r/relationships).

Basically, I'm preparing myself for being alone. I was single throughout high school (besides casually dating), and dated someone before my current boyfriend, but we weren't very serious. Because of these past 2 years, I've lost the sense of being alone.

My boyfriend and I have many mutual friends. He and I were best friends before we dated. Our friend group (of about 10 or so people) used to do everything together. This has died out over the past few months, and things just aren't the same, but perhaps that'll change. Breaking up with him will not only mean losing my best friend, but all of my friends. I know they won't contact me as often (they stopped contacting me as often when we began dating, as they began seeing me as the ""girlfriend"" and would make plans with him for us). I know I shouldn't want these friends if they won't contact me post-breakup, but it's REALLY hard for me to let go of all of our memories. I spent the best few years with them, and *I wish* I wasn't so judgmental about making new friends, but it's hard.

I have many superficial friends, but it's very hard to find ones that I enjoy being around. I know I have to accept change and move on, though. I go to a state school where everyone (besides a select few) is obsessed with getting blackout drunk, going clubbing, or doing drugs. I work for a radio station, and have found a few quirky individuals, but they partake in the same behavior. This is one of the main reasons why I'll miss my friends. I do make friends, and enjoy their presence. It's just not the same. I miss having a best friend, and I do have a few close girlfriends, but it's not the same.

School is stressing me out. I work 2 jobs, and go to school full time. I'm lonely most of the time, because I can't really interact with people during my classes, and by the end of the day, I either go home and study, or I seek out some human interaction, and my grades end up slipping. I need to start applying for grad schools, but the program I'm applying to (clinical psych) is the most competitive in the country statistically. I am putting all of my efforts into working towards applying (doing internships, research work, developing relationships with professors, keeping my grades up etc) but I still have the odds stacked against me.

And I would love to pursue music. I am too much of a worrier to solely pursue this, which is why I'm pursuing my education as well. Some days, I just want to up and move, pursue my music, and never look back. And if I fail, I fail. I'm just very unmotivated. I live in a small state with little music scene, and no friends to come to my shows (now that I'm losing all of them). I don't want to become  ultra famous (Lady Gaga status) or anything, but I do believe that what I do is heartfelt and people enjoy it. 

The weight of everything is crushing me. I know that if we do break up completely, that it will be my time to have a blank slate and start over, but this all scares me. Any advice?

11w2vv,89,2012-10-22,Graduated this year. Feel like I've reached breaking point. This futile job hunt is making me suicidal. ,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/11w2vv/graduated_this_year_feel_like_ive_reached/,"Just need to get this out, and possibly get some advice. I am depressed, miserable, and just about ready to give up. I have no self confidence any more and I feel like I have nothing to give. I know I picked the wrong course at university, I didn't know at the time that a degree in English would be so useless, but I know that now. I don't need to be reminded about it. 

I've lost count of the number of jobs I've applied for now. I dread waking up every day and having to go through this pointless job hunt day after day after day. It's soul destroying. I managed to get a 2 week work experience stint a few weeks after I graduated, but that was it. I've been turned down for every single graduate scheme I've applied for, I've applied to big companies and small, I've applied for unpaid internships and minimum wage jobs at supermarkets but I've still be turned down for every one. It feels like I'm worth nothing. I just don't know what to do. The closest I've been to getting work was with a dodgy company offering a long unpaid internship with terrible hours, a 2 hour commute and no prospect of a real job at the end of it (which I'm sure is illegal in England now) but I would have taken it anyway. 

I know I don't have much work experience, and getting a foot in the door in any industry these days is difficult, but I'm not asking much. My parents can't comprehend the idea of having to literally beg for a job (as in going into the store, finding the manger, and begging him to hire you, which I did). I thought I was a bright young person, ready to get out there and start my career, but instead I'm sitting at the jobcentre in tears, then going home and getting back to the misery of job searching. I sometimes spend over 12 hours a day searching and applying, but still get nothing. Not even a courtesy rejection most of the time. I don't have a direction in my life any more. 

I used to be so ambitious, and I suppose I still am, I've always been a hard worker and have never been satisfied with being second best or not doing my best, and to sit here festering while the world passes me by is destroying me. It's not even about the money, although it's obviously important. 

So, I don't know where to go from here. I have a degree in English, very good GCSE's and A-Levels and have office, retail and editorial experience, all of which has proven useless. 

I hate being such a leech on society. I hate feeling like my life is amounting to nothing and probably never will. Every month I'm out of work will make it more difficult for me to find meaningful employment. I can't bear to go into the jobcentre again. I honestly feel like throwing myself in front of a train right now (sorry London commuters, I know how you hate that!)

Sorry about the rant. I just feel really down right now. 

Edit: I was also out of work before I went to university. I couldn't find a job when I left school and that's why I decided to go to university and better myself. But it seems to have gotten me nowhere.

Name: Alec

Gender: Male

Race: Human

Age/Level: 20

Hometown/Region: Slateport, Hoenn

~If human~
Trainer Type: Mystery (Used to train to be a master)

Number of Badges: (Alec was once an amazing trainer collecting badges from all regions attempting to be a master but now he set his badges aflame burning them into nothingness.)


Pokémon in team (Yes he carries seven. No it is not traditional. Yes it is symbolic. Get over it.)

Gallade (Nicknamed Pride)

Swampert (Nicknamed Wrath)

Bayleef (Nicknamed Lust)

Flygon (Nicknamed Envy)

Aggron (Nicknamed Gluttony)

Typlosion (Nicknamed Sloth)

Metagross (Nicknamed Greed)


Other Info:

**IMPORTANT**, the main difference between my old character and this one is that this Alec is a year older, in that year this Alec took a personal exile from all human contact. He hasn’t seen anyone in a year (Not Bez or Kriss) and has really changed, whether it be for better or worse is only to be seen..

History: 

Starting off in his hometown of Hoenn Alec always knew he wanted to be a trainer, and more than that, a master. So the day he turned 12 he convinced his parents to send him to Littleroot to meet professor Birch. On the way there he stopped in Petalburg and ran into Steven (at the time Alec wasn’t aware he was champion). He stayed with Steven for a few days and talked and befriended him. Steven taught him a few tricks for training. After receiving a call he informed Alec he had to leave and wished him luck and Alec continued to Littleroot, arriving later that day. Birch was waiting for Alec and accepted him as an intern to work with him. Alec worked under Birch for 3 years, learning all about Pokémon and their strengths and weaknesses. He also befriended a kind little Mudkip during his internship. At 16 Birch gave Alec the Mudkip as a parting gift, and Alec set out on his adventure to become a master. After 3 years traveling quite a way around the lands Alec has acquired an powerful team each of which he has an strong emotional bond with. (Has other pokemon in his PC, but these 6 are his favorite). Also while in the Sinnoh region Alec ran Pokémon coordinator Kriss they quickly hit it off. He is a fierce fighter being very analytical of every move made. Very strong offensive team and strategy. His bond with his Pokémon is unbreakable, and he loves and respects them.

A recent turn of events has sent Alec off the deep end. His Pokémon followed suit with their close friend. Alec renamed each after a deadly sin and now travels searching for something unknown.

Appearance: 

Alec is about 5’11” with a medium build. He has dark brown hair that comes to right above his eyes. He wears obsidian black jeans, and a dark grey shirt, a crimson red jacket over that. Alec now has an darker aurora about him. No one knows what turned him or why.. But whatever it was has only made him even more powerful.

My problem is that I have no idea what to answer when they ask the inevitable question on what I expect to make. I really don't know what kind of compensation I should be looking for. I understand that this is a relatively new profession, but there just isn't enough information on the internet on salaries for data scientists.

(Please excuse me if my English isn't perfect, it's my second language...)


Last night, I was talking to some of my friends, one male, three female.
Usually, they are all really open-minded people, so we do talk about most things that come to mind no matter what.

I should probably add that we're all med-students in our 3rd year, here in Germany. So, these people are going to be doctors. Keep that in mind.

We were talking about "" crazy aesthetic surgeries"" we had heard about, eg anal bleaching...
I started telling a story I had recently heard about the upcoming trend of (inner) labia corrections , eg when they are ""too big"" or ""not well formed"".
Utter nonsense to me, having someone else, let alone a surgeon decide, whether my vulva is considered ""normal"" or ""needing improvement"".

After finishing this story I looked around with a ""ain't that funny"" look on my face and was greeted by deeply dusgusted faces. 

- The one male friend plus another female friend had bever even HEARD of the fact, that vulvas CAN look different, inner labia being bigger than outer, coming in different shapes or colours etcetc... and they thought it was GROSS, to say the least ""why would anyone have that? this is abnormal,right? oh,that sounds so gross, that poor woman sueely never had sex""

All of us had to do several internships jn the nursing sector up to this point, so we've all gotten to washing and cleaning up lots of patients and they obviously had not come across anything ""unusual"".

- My other two friends, who are currently working as nurses, besides med-school, said they have seen a variety of patients and their...well...nether regions.
One of them said, she always ""pitied"" the poor women with bigger labia and tried ""not showing them how grossed out she is,as she would be so terribly ashamed, if she looked like that and had someone wash her"" .


The general opinion was, that ,of course, if someone was so unfortunate as to have such a malformed vulva ( they imagined the percentage to be somewhat around 1 or 2 in 100 women), they would advise them to have surgery,because:

- they can't imagine how a man would want to sleep with them, he would be to grossed out
- it must be extremely painful and the labia will get completely ""numb"" with time due to the constant exposure, much like ""circumcised penises get numb at the tip"" (circumcision is not very common in Germany, obviously...)


They were a 100% sure, that larger labia is something that only old women ""suffer from"",because the connective tissue gets weaker ( now, I know, that the connective tissue growing weaker CAN cause some change in the appearance of the vulva, but, still, really, friends?).
In short, they couldn't imagine that someone could have larger labia, from a very early age, just because the vulva and with it the labia develope and start growing during puberty, just like anything else. quote "" I mean, it's not as if you'd ever see a 14 yo with something kike THAT, haha."" 

I tried to reason with them, explaining, that 
-this really is quite common,
 -a large percentage of women have bigger inner labia, 
- not 2 vulvas are alike,
- they are all fine just the way they are,
- it doesn't affect the ability to enjoy sex,
- corrective surgery might cause a loss of sensitivity in some areas
- YES you should tell a guy, who doesn-t want to have sex with you, because you're gross, to get the hell out
- and yes,"" those women"" are usually fine with it.

And if they're not, it's mostly because society or friends or family have made them insecure with comments like those.

They wouldn't believe me. 

I'm dumbfounded,angry and can't quite believe what I heard. These people are my friends.
They consider themselves to be tolerant, left-wing people, who would never judge anyone. 
PLUS they are all going to be doctors, kne of them a gynaecologist, and now I shudder when I think of her looking at a patient's vulva with pity in her eyes,asking her, if she's considered, getting ""something done about that""

Mind you, I'm NOT judging ladies who decide to actually have something done, may it be because it can be uncomfortable at times or just for themselves!
I just find it awful, that women should feel ashamed of the way their vaginas look.


Well, and if you hadn't guessed until now, I'm also one of ""these women"" with larger labia, not huge, but definitely not porn-star lookalike. 
I happen to be completely happy with them, was never ashamed of them up to this point, never had a guy complain.

I just hate the feeling that my friends can be so judgemental and would possibly even judge me.

I consider sending them the great wall of vagina  ( http://www.greatwallofvagina.co.uk/images )
just as a lesson.
 
what do you ladies ( and guys,of course) think?


so sorry if my spelling is bad I just really needed to vent...

EDIT: Yesterday I sent them all on a journey along the Great Wall. Only one response so far and I have talked to her personally. her reaction was something along the lines of 
"" wow, I didn't know there were so many different...no, I really didn't. "" She also told me she'd never say anything biased about it to a patient. 

I guess that's a start.


I'm currently putting together a little to-see list for them.
 ( Special thanks to There-Wolf, sunny_bell and K_T )

There's not really much more I can do about it, but since I've always considered them to be quite an intelligent lot, this will probably at least make them re-think what they said.

**Thank you all for your input and honest opinions!!!**

****
**Background**

I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for over a year now and I Love her. We get along wonderfully, have a lot in common, have enough differences to constantly challenge one other and force the other to grow as a person (more in a bit). We have met each others' families and there is no significant tension there. I am nineteen, she is as well: we are sophomores in college. My passion is Pottery; her's is writing (more on that later).

**Confessions**

* I am so afraid that we won't go the distance. (General anxiety, that- not much reason behind it)
* Her writing is beautiful (we are both avid pleasure readers) but I feel it may never be recognized for the gem it is (she has written two books in a trilogy and has begun the long, laborious of editing the first [began writing when she was younger] simply because there are so many inspiring writers out there: I am terrified that her dreams will never sparkle in the heavens, never be enjoyed by the masses.
* 
I am studying pre-med and am very interested in the human body as well as being naturally gifted in Science, but can't imagine going to school for another six years (with two waiting for me as an intern) before even beginning to pay off the already-substantial school loans.
* I am terrified of trying too hard. I grew up learning not to fight with my adversaries, but to escape as well as out-smart them. But, now that I am older, I have no school-yard bully, I have no eternal teaser. Rather, the main antagonist in my life is within me: I constantly hold myself back (actually waking up in four hours to go to class after taking a full day to write a three-page paper). I am ashamed of myself- my parents always pushed me and I feel as if I have failed them.
* I have never had a ""real"" job but have worked hard with my father (manual labor) to earn descent, under-the-table money when I needed it. This has suited me well as I have never really found the need to spend unnecessarily and have preferred cheap entertainment (books, woodworking [with tools already provided], pleasurable conversation, etc.) over frivolous spending. But, my girlfriend has held a job, steadily, since she was fifteen (in food-service, no less!) and has worked hard for everything she has ever had (as well as being raised by parents who were... less than giving (loving, however- do not mistake me). So, lately, I have felt as if she looks down on me for not having had to work as hard as her for what I have (which is less, financially).
* Today, we had an argument that addressed the previous two bullets among other issues. While I view arguments as very healthy parts of a relationship, this one took a turn for the ugly side. I grabbed her while we were in her car and attempted to force her to listen to me. I was so frustrated that she couldn't see my side of the argument that I just wanted to lay it out very simply in the hopes that she would understand and, if not agree, at least know what I truly thought on the matter. After the emotions faded and I was alone... I was ashamed more wickedly than I am able to remember and not-terribly briefly considered... punishing myself as I once did (scoring my skin with a blade). I considered breaking up with her because I swore to myself that I would never be that kind of man, never be that person who abused their Love or tried to control it: I don't know why I did not do so. I considered simply leaving: just walking in a single direction until I found something that I was able to do to redeem myself.
* I feel as if I am wasting all that I have been given- the second chances, the support, the love and care as well as guidance. But, if I do my best... where will that end? Where do I draw the line between ""enough"" effort and ""damaging obsession"". I am not saying that I am currently operating at the extreme of that- not trying in school/life at all, but rather that I am able to see that there is SO MUCH more I could be doing. So many more activities and passions I could be devoting myself to.
* I feel terrified to grow up.
* I feel as if I should have never lived to this age- as if I should have died by eighteen or, rather, that I out-lived my expiration date.
* My principle motivation in life is now to achieve a healthy and happy life with my girlfriend and I am terrified to rely on someone so very completely. What I mean by this is that, if she was not in my life, I know that I would have killed myself from a lack of hope for the future. How is it fair to someone to bear that responsibility? What right do I have to force her to be my anchor? I believe a relationship should be balanced with each party supporting each other evenly for the good of the two... but I feel as if I am blatantly heaping responsibility upon her for my well-being. She doesn't know a good bit of this bullet-point, by-the-by, and I could never stand for her to know- never could I ever allow someone to be so responsible for me- not fair to anyone, especially someone who I claim to Love.
* I want to spend the rest of my life with her- but I don't see myself being good enough- why couldn't she take the free-ride to wealth and assured fame for her book when she was offered it? I feel as if I will hold her back and have seriously begun contemplating breaking up with her and just walking away from my life (literally just walk to the east coast and try to live however I can, cutting all contact off) so that she may thrive.
* I have never cared about someone so very deeply as I care for her- I would sacrifice literally anything in my power if it assured her well-being.

Why can't I be a Man? Why do I fear being outside of my comfort zone?"

I always used to spend my evenings working on creative projects, because my days were void of it. I like the challenge of coming up with a new thing and problem-solving it until it worked the way I wanted it to.

I went back to re-skill as a designer after 13 years of working not as a designer. I though an official qualification backed up by a good portfolio would hold me in good stead for a career change for the better and a future life of joy and happiness doing something I was genuinely interested in and passionate about. Received the highest mark possible. Was very excited about my future career and had a book full of contact to help me.

Boy, was I wrong. 3 and a half years later I still haven't found employment. Even as a junior. Or an internship. All those contacts dried out in the economy, I lost momentum and money trying to keep up with my knowledge and skill-set. I grew bitter about ""them fancy designers"" and the creative world as a whole.

So I have gone back to not being a designer by day and gently freelancing on the side--mostly working on personal projects that I sell, coping with depression and nurturing a new family.

*tl;dr: after seven years, I'm still exactly where I was. Except more cynical. And depressed.*

I'm thinking tank top and shorts will be appropriate to sleep in, can throw my uniform over that, but trying to sleep with a bra on bugs the crap out of me, and I don't know if I'll have time (or a place, pretty sure it's shared quarters) to take a shirt off, put a bra on, shirt back on, if we get a call in the AM. 

I know this sounds kinds silly but there's no other women where I work and I didn't know who else to ask. I'm a restless sleeper, so any other recommendations about sleeping comfortably on shift are welcome too. Thanks so much!!!

I'd love to get into marketing, but I know that I have some gaps in my toolset.  I'm hoping that you guys can give me some direction as to what I should be working on. 

I have a BA with a double major in Business and Marketing, 3.8 GPA, and all that though it was 10 years ago.  However, when I left college, marketing opportunities were slim to none because of where I was living.  Instead I worked my way into middle management.  after 5 years, I realized I didn't want to be promoted because I didn't really care for the job, and moved to sales.  I've been doing sales of one form or another for the last 5 years, and it's burning me out.  I'd much rather be on the marketing side. 

I have been getting some marketing great experience on the side, but the problem it's all been DIY stuff for my bands and events that I've thrown.  A lot of my work is not able to be verified.  I am great at analysis, testing, and implementing what works.  I've also become a wiz at social media, but again, that work is hard to verify because I haven't really been keeping a paper trail.  

My biggest skills gap is anything tech related.  I know enough to put together a wordpress site like [this](http://pinkmonkeyband.com), but that's about the extent of it.  I am also mediocre at best dealing with any sort of graphic design.  All of my creative skills went to the audio side with my music.

I'm in a unique position to be able to educate myself for very little cost.  Would it be worth going back to school for a CIS degree or would I be better off getting an MBA?  Another alternative is to continue to grow what I'm doing with my music projects and events and build up a bigger, better documented portfolio of experience and work. 

Ideally, my goal is to move to marketing as my full time career.  I don't need to be an executive, but due to family situations and obligations, I can't realistically take any positions making under 40k, so I can't intern either.  I don't need a job tomorrow, but I think I'd be a lot happier in a marketing department.  For you guys in the field, especially marketing managers, do you have any recommendations on how I can prepare myself to enter a marketing position?

Instead of seeing them as a human being, doctors find them as just another medical mystery or however they put it. They end up losing that initial motivation to want to help others.

This terrifies me as I have wanted to become a doctor for the longest time and medicine has always interested me, but I wouldn't want this to happen to me - not ever.

For my 20 something fellows and me?,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/11ytmj/so_where_are_the_jobs_for_my_20_something_fellows/,"I woke up from academic studies into this 'real world.' I followed the rules, I worked hard. I studied full time, I took risks, I then went and got my master's in business administration. 

The thing is, people are not hiring me for three reasons that I find very discriminatory but not illegal.

First and foremost, my age has become more of a problem than an asset. I'm a '20 something'. According to many manager's this means I am inexperienced with no work ethic. Although I've seen war, and worked summers on a family farm waking up at 5 in the morning. I'm not afraid to sweat. I do not feel entitled to a great job, I feel entitled to a job - just like you did at my age. I'm willing to pick up shit - but I have no experience (catch 22).

Secondly, I've noticed an automatic warning when I apply for work that notices my IP address is in a small Midwest town far away from civilization. The warning says this job is intended for residents within a 100 mile radius of the application. Now I understand the fear, but this feels like geographic bias. It's obvious that there are more jobs in DC, NYC, and LA. But jobs in the Midwest, Appalachia, and the Rockies are not that plentiful. 

Lastly, and this one is hard to explain but you will understand if you have any background in religion or political work. Listen, I had to graduate college so I worked for the GOP - it doesn't mean I'm a Republican - it means I was willing to work hard, and take on a challenge for to complete a goal (an internship to graduate). It helped me learn how to think even more critically - something I feel is discouraged. People don't like those who question, but I question because I want to make the world better.

The wanted feature that they wanted to implement (Which I tried through Telerik demos , Samples , documentation and Apress Telerik book ) doesn't work on the system , even it worked on demo project I created at home easily in less than 30 min , I even called the one of the senior to see what I did wrong and fix it , He couldn't implement this feature  and suggesting an alternative to rewrite some old code that they use it only in one page (Because of unexplained reason they override  every control out there) or using Jquery and Webservice they flat-out refused  .


I don't feel that I'm learning anything new , and I experiencing Stress that I never felt before and the future doesn't look so bright

I'm one out of three interns Who didn't finish their tasks either because of  previous reasons.


What Should I do ? I don't want to be quitter  at the same time I don't want to stay there to get fired or work on outdated technology while I could spend my time learning more and be more competent at my next job"

As a condition of my acceptance, I had to take a semester of courses on the subject-- in which I received top marks, and was top of the class. This semester (the first course of the grad program) has been tough-- and my grades are above average, but the average has been quite low. I recently got my first exam back (above average, and passing, but not quite up to my standards.) I went to meet with my professor to discuss how I'm doing, let him know that I've scheduled to work with a tutor and take some workshops on how to take exams in this discipline (since I entered the grad program having studied something else.) I told him that I'd been working harder than last year, but that I feel that I'm unable to properly convey my understanding properly in exams. I asked if he had any advice on possible structural issues with my work.

My professor told me that I was a disappointment, that there was nothing for me to achieve with tutoring or workshops because ""either you have it or you don't"" and that I clearly don't. He told me that he regretted ever endorsing me for an internship, and that I should have considered all this before applying for the grad program. I was then told I was wasting his time and should leave. He didn't want to hear anything about potential issues in my test taking focus (I wasn't there to argue about grades, just to get constructive criticism, which i made clear) and told me that I was clearly just lazy.
All this when I got above the class average on a test most students (who specialized in the field) had either failed or passed marginally.

What do I do? How do I handle this? Any advice?"

I don't feel like complaining at length on reddit, but suffice it to say that it is not the place I expected it to be, and, early as it is, I am considering transferring.

I just wanted to know if anyone had a similar experience that turned around for them evenutaly. For reference, this isn't about the social life (I have a few friends I really like, though the general dearth of sociableness does suck), but more that the atmosphere of pre-professionalism and learning just to get a degree are much stronger than I ever expected. I am at college to enjoy learning for a few years, not to feel bad about the fact that I don't already have a Morgan Stanley internship set up. 

I know I could adjust to it, but I'm worried that would involve becoming cynical as a defense mechanism (something I feel from a lot of older kids here). 

This is also not supposed to be a castigation of my fellow students; there are some of the nicest people ever here, I just don't think I quite fit the mold for this school.


*Figured I would post this reply up here to clarify, also thank you all for the responses, it does give me hope.

I do think that my experience is very personal. I feel like this is a very hit or miss type of place with a lot of ifs that go into happiness. I really don't feel like I am a part of my house culture, for one. Again, all seem like wonderful people its just the culture at large is not predominated by people that I am really going to become very close with. I some closer friends I met early, and I feel like we have become insular but I'm not sure how to change that.

My classes are here and there--can't expect much from Calc so thats fine, but there really isn't much class participation in my hume class despite the brilliant professor, and my chem class has been hands down my worst academic experience to date (and I'm doing well in the class, this isn't me complaining about a bad grade).

I also don't feel like I am meeting people, which seems to be a pretty key part of a college experience. A lot of this is definitely on me, and I could probably use a good deal of advice in this arena, but I feel like it shouldn't be this much work to meet people when I am surrounded by people my age. I am a very social person, and I have never in my life had trouble meeting people (I have changed schools plenty and always landed on my feet) and I just feel like I can't break though here.


I guess all in all, I expected to feel more like I went to a college, and I feel more like I go to a grad school. An amazing grad school filled with brilliant people, mind you, but just not the experience I was looking for (yet--I realize its been 5 weeks and this is ridiculously hasty but I just figured I would reach out for help).
Thanks for the advice, by the way.




P.S. just for reference I am thinking I may be better suited to a small liberal arts school"

11y9mv,18,2012-10-23,"I woke up one morning &amp; decided I needed a change in my life, used the rest of my rewards points to buy a round-trip ticket to South America...",[deleted],needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/11y9mv/i_woke_up_one_morning_decided_i_needed_a_change/,"Peru specifically. for 6 months because of how the point system works. 

I'm an idiot. I don't have anything planned, I'm 22/f. OH, AND I LEAVE ON HALLOWEEN. I bought the ticket a few days ago. 

I don't know. I have family &amp; friends down there, I've visited Argentina multiple times. 

I have been having these panic attacks for the past several months that are increasingly difficult to maintain. I've been to therapy, tried medicine, etc. I don't think any of that is going to help because the truth is, I don't know who the hell I am. I'm constantly surrounded by people telling me how to act/feel/think/do and up until several months ago, I thought I made all of those decisions. A little bit of distance in the city helped me realize that I don't have a future I want.


I've been getting increasingly depressed &amp; unmotivated, I feel like school isn't challenging or stimulating whatsoever, I quit both of my internships out of disinterest and becoming a bad employee, and I have no real responsibilities besides creating a successful future for myself. 

But I can't do it. I won't do it. I don't care enough to want to try. After transferring schools because of money, I haven't felt motivated. I keep wanting to move, start different projects, pick up &amp; drop internships, do everything and then nothing. But I'm getting nowhere. Wasting money by failing or dropping classes, barely making enough money to get by, and it makes me feel horrible. It makes me feel like I am not capable of being successful and applying myself. But god damn it I know I'm a smart motherfucker, but I can't go on like this.



so when I woke up a couple of days ago, I thought about my future and all I saw was me slipping through the cracks. I feel like I already have, I feel like I've lost myself completely. Obviously, the last two years have not helped me grow up and take responsibility, so I impulsively bought a ticket to Peru. 

I'm hoping that I did it because I want to find myself, grow up, figure out what I need to do to find my passion and finish school. But I'm scared that maybe I'm trying to run away. I know that your problems follow you, it doesn't have anything to do with my atmosphere, it has to do with the nature in which I live my life. I have no money, in fact, the bank messed up and refuses to pay the $150 they took out in fee's so now the fee's keep building up and I don't know how to fix that. Also, I did some research about hostels/work/volunteering but there's something so refreshing and scary about just solely depending on myself and figuring it out as I go. I need to grow up, fight for myself, fight for my life. 


So, how can I make the best of this? I know it isn't smart and hell, maybe I'll realize that I made a terrible mistake, but what would you do make the best of this unplanned 6 month journey in South America?"

Why UX? Long story short...I started a website and ended up learning I did much of it backwards. Through this experience I realized (to my surprise) that I really enjoyed developing wireframes, mockups, and usability testing. I also realized how crucial they are to creating a successful product. As I've begun searching for UX jobs I've realized UX means several things to different people. It appears a UX Designer should be able to do...a little of everything?? Personally, I am passionate about developing new ideas/concepts and learning how people interact with those ideas/concepts. I'm not too passionate about coding and only have a very basic working knowledge of it. 

Based on that...I have two questions:

1. Are there UX opportunities that focus more on wireframe, mockups and usability research and less on coding? If so, can you please give an example(s).

2. If you work in UX, what should I do to get my foot in the door (internship, go back to school, freelance, etc.)? Is it essential to obtain strong coding skills?

*It was an image, an illusion of myself.*

I rode the train and bus home now, unable to keep the past and the present from blending together. The roads could become quite the callous place when you didn't know which cars are really there, and which cars were there in some moment before.

*Another me. Three mes. A dozen. Fifty. A hundred, even. All in one space, all going about their day; a different day in different times, in different hours.*

It wouldn't happen if I didn't know the route. You can't remember something that never happened. The only way to live safely was to keep every day new, fresh. To not be trapped in a place where my memories ran rampant in my mind. To start forming new memories instead of trying to live comfortably.

*There I was chatting up a girl who had moved to a different firm. In another instance, I was talking to a former boss who had passed away; the intern who was brutally murdered; the manager who was fired for his inadequacy. All in the same space, speaking in a tangled mess of voices and gestures. My reactions varied as well, it was a horrible sight.*

I would wake up, and see myself wake up. Once, twice, three times, four. Ten. Each time, I wondered if I was still dreaming, never sure when I had actually gotten out of bed. I found that doing something new always helped me snap back into reality: a cup of water this morning, juice another-fuck, I got so desperate I even drank alcohol one morning because the memories were starting to converge again. Anything to get myself out of the loop.

*He wants you to rally the people.*

Rallying...not the kind of rallying a team gets before a sport. The type of rallying a squad gets before a war. It was perfect, so they had assured me. Each person in this city: all their secrets and hopes and dreams were all available in some shape or another. Interviews. Diaries. Vlogs. All these people, normal and regular: unremarkable and naive. I would approach all of them as a friend, and they would have no manner of doubting me as I knew so much about them. About this event and that milestone: the breakup, the promotion, the divorce, the death in the family. I worked in a law firm, but the boss-man had made arrangements for me. No one was to see or open the documents I was to ""work on"", and in return, people got more hours for their vacations. It seems silly, but it worked.

For two years, I read accounts of peoples lives for hours on end. The new home, the college-bound princess, the homeless-bound man. All their grief, all their sorrow, their joy, their happiness; this man had somehow managed to acquire it all and compose it in a journal-like book for me to read and dissect. What were their fears? Their aspirations? Their struggles and challenges in their lives? I was to be a savior, a messiah amongst the masses-ready to save them from the terrors of everyday life and the meaninglessness their lives had acquired in the recent years.

I took a taxi home this time. It was one of the few options remaining. His name was Parsa: a 32 year old Indian man from Mombasa, who had moved to the states so he could start saving up to bring his wife and kids away from his tyrannical family back at home. His wife, Nimrita, was 29 and of a different *jati*-some kind of caste subsystem if I interpreted right. They had two children: a baby girl named Jagdeep and an older boy named Divya. We drove to my home in perfect silence, all this had been from the file.

I didn't realize how much I had actually remembered from the accounts. I didn't know I paid so much attention to detail in general. Once I knew the man's name, I felt like he was a true friend. Like we had been this close for years. I wondered why this never happened with any of the others when I asked or figured out their names. ""Maybe because..."" I preferred not to say it. I could tell the man was depressed: clearly, this was not working out well, he must be making a small sum, not nearly enough to fetch his family from back home. ""It isn't going to become any easier friend"", I told him as I left the car and walked inside. He stayed parked in my driveway for a few minutes before he left.

Finding a job back at home in Philly is pretty bleak let alone one in the industry. As of now I don't have any real contacts yet to find work in NYC, but I'm working on it while I'm doing my internship here in London (its a stretch, but hey could work). Since I've been here I've been doing a lot of runner/pa type duties which I actually like doing a lot, but I've also done a bit of camera assist work. Ideally I would really want to get into that as a gateway to becoming a camera op, but I'll take whatever I can get.

Anyway could anyone explain to me how working as a runner works logistically? Is most of the work freelance or are you usually employed by a production company? What are the day rates like or is it usually waged? Is that money enough to live on, and if the work is freelance is it abundant enough that I would not have to get a second job? 

I know its kinda hard to answer these questions since it really depends on contacts and whatnot, but if anyone can give me a generalized idea of what its like out there in NYC as a runner I'd greatly appreciate it!"

that's all great. but i can't shake this indelible feeling as if there is something wrong with me.

i went to all girls middle and high school from 11 to 18. i dated one guy during that time, a college sophomore when i was a senior -- it didn't work out. i entered the relationship under pressure, feeling as though it was one more milestone i should get out of the way, truly feeling little to no attraction to him in any way. every romantic or sexual milestone of my life has been that way. first relationship, kiss, sex, everything - just something i needed to ""get out of the way"".

now i'm 20, halfway to 21. i have never been in love, nor have i felt the love people talk about. i'm rarely, if ever, attracted to men beyond physical characteristics. 7 years of girls school has stunted part of this lack of relationships -- but i'm beginning to wonder if i'm just not one of those people who will experience the love and relationships people have. 

i know some people reading this are going to roll their eyes and say i have so much more life to live. but here i am. everyone is living around me. and i just feel like i'm going through the motions of my life, continuing to 'get things out of the way' and right on time. 

just needed to get this off my chest. hopefully it will be buried as another 2 am musing from a self-conscious college girl."

Little background... I work at a business continuity company that does back ups of entire servers both onsite and offsite to our data center. If a server fails, you can spin up a VM from an appliance we provide or spin up a cloud VM from our data center.


This being my first job and being a rather new tier 1 intern to part timer, I had my first official walk through with a customer over the phone on how to spin up a test VM to verify it works should anything happens. Unfortunately, the appliance didn't want to spin up a VM correctly, so I'm on the phone with this customer for a good hour and a half trying to get this done while working with other engineers fixing all these issues. Near the two hour mark on the phone, everything seems fixed and only thing left to do was to do a firmware upgrade and everything would have worked out.


Customer decides it was a good time to be persistent on asking if they can test the VM over and over and I kept telling him to let the firmware upgrade first before touching anything. Then he asks if he could test it while an upgrade was in process. At that point I muted my phone and started my rant... Problem was... my phone wasn't on mute and customer heard everything... He hung up on the spot and I felt like total shit for what just happened. 


I immediately called back and apologized like crazy and customer accepted it saying something on the lines of ""It happens to everyone, don't sweat it. I know how stressful it gets some days..""

Boss understood that it was an accident and to never do it again... but I feared for my job that day....

11wzh4,3,2012-10-22,I was given two scenarios to respond to and discuss for a class. Looking for advice from experienced winemakers.,quackmaster,winemaking,https://www.reddit.com/r/winemaking/comments/11wzh4/i_was_given_two_scenarios_to_respond_to_and/,"If you respond, please note your experience as a winemaker.

1. Cusick and Mantheakis Cellars own 16 acres of premium Zinfandel. They enjoy inexplicably high scores from the renowned “Sinton’s Picks” wine blog. They sell quite a bit of wine via that blog site so want to maintain the attractiveness of their wine to Sinton. Their vineyard is a gentle sloping hillside and about 40% is flat. They like ripe flavors in their Zin, but deplore the trend toward high ethanol and the inevitable imbalance with acidity. They therefore like to harvest within a narrow Brix range, between 26 and 27 Brix. They are also frugal and do not like to waste fruit so they prefer berry sampling over all other methods. Their instructions to samplers, who are typically interns, are simple.  They have learned that if the instructions are complicated they are ignored. The interns are told to start on one row, but not an end row, walk in ten vines and then pick the first berry they see and to keep walking randomly through the vineyard picking one berry every ten vines until they have covered the entire vineyard, except the end rows. The samplers are further instructed to combine the berries into 200 berry lots for processing in the winery, and have no more than six lots of 200, or 1200 berries, for the entire vineyard. They also tell the samplers to not pick fruit from vines that have too many clusters on them as they will tell harvesters to drop the under-ripe clusters from these vines and not include them in the bins. The 200 berry samples are placed in a baggie, placed in an ice chest and taken to the winery for processing. They use a rolling pin to crush the grapes then measure Brix of each sample with a refractometer. They take the average of the six samples to represent the Brix reading of the vineyard.  They like the average of the six lots to be near the median of the six samples because then they know the sampling was statistically valid. 

In spite of this process they find that they usually over estimate Brix during sampling. Thus when the average first hits 26 Brix, they schedule harvest, which is usually 10 to 14 days later. The fruit then comes in between 26 and 27 Brix just where they want it.  This past year they had a problem and Brix levels at harvest were too high, over 28 Brix even though two weeks earlier the average reading of the samples was 26.5 Brix.  They suspect the interns did not follow the proper protocol and that is why the Brix reading was closer to the true value.  This is a serious problem for them as the ethanol will be too high negatively impacting their marketing strategy tag line “All the flavor without all the alcohol”. They have hired you to help them figure out what went wrong this year. Critique their sampling protocol. What are the possible reasons the Brix at harvest was higher this past year than in previous years? What additional information do you need from them? What advice would you give them for next year?
 
2. The much acclaimed, inventive and pioneering Irish-Eshel Winery is considering ending their long-standing contract with Han-Antignano Vineyards. They love the flavors of the HA Sauvignon Blanc wines but they are plagued by a dull pinkish grey brownish tinge that is sometimes greenish that they always get in the juice and that persists into the wine made from this vineyard. They do not get this color in any of the other wines that they make so they know it is coming from the vineyard. To stop this off color from forming, they add 50 ppm of SO2 to the press as the press is filling. The juice pH is typically 3.7 to 3.9, so they expect this level of SO2 to inhibit juice oxidases. Their press has a 2,500 gallon capacity and they expect 40% of the material in the press to be juice. Their smallest tank is 5,000 gallons and their largest is 10,000 gallons thus it requires two to four press loads to fill the tanks.  Therefore they add 250 mL of an 8% potassium metabisulfite solution to the juice in the press. However when they measure free SO2 levels 24 hours later, there is no free SO2 and the total SO2  is below 5 ppm, their limit of detection. They think there is something odd in the Sauvignon Blanc that is binding the SO2 so tightly that they cannot measure it in a total SO2 assay. 

Han-Antignano do not want their fruit to become known as problematic especially since they are convinced the winemakers are incompetent, so knowing your expertise in all things wine they have hired you to help them troubleshoot the off-color problem.  Why do you think they are getting off-colors so early in processing? Why is the total SO2 so low? Do you agree with their assessment of the problem of low total SO2? What advice would you give them to prevent the problem in the future? What other information do you need from them?

11wvds,84,2012-10-22,There was a fire at my beautiful church :(,tensegritydan,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/11wvds/there_was_a_fire_at_my_beautiful_church/,"A local news article: http://www.berkeleyside.com/2012/10/21/fire-damages-good-shepherd-episcopal-church-on-9th-st/

The most important thing is that no one was hurt. We have three diocesan interns living in the house next door, separated by only a few feet from the church. Their house was singed and the fence between the buildings was burned to ash. The fire started late Saturday night, a neighbor called 911, and the fire department showed up very quickly and were able to put out the fire within an hour, saving most of the main church building and the bell tower (which interestingly served as the original fire bell for the area). We were actually in the middle of having the tower repainted, thus the scaffolding in one of the pictures.

The sacristy (shown in the picture in the article) was where the fire started and it is totally gutted. The fire department is pretty sure the cause was electrical. We lost almost all the vestments, linens, supplies, beautiful icons and artwork, and tons of registers, books, and historical papers. The Fire Department was so brave and thoughtful--they went to the effort of covering our organ with a big tarp when they sprayed the fire foam. They also retrieved our large Bible that sits at the pulpit. I don't know if it can be restored or not, but we held our regular service the next morning in our parish hall and we used that Bible, wet and sooty as it was.

All of these things can be replaced but the damage to the building is a real tragedy. Our church has been in continuous use by our congregation since it was built in 1878. The building is a city landmark and on the National Register of Historic Places. The most terrible loss to me was that our beautiful stained glass window depicting Jesus as the Good Shepherd was completely destroyed. You can see it in the background in [these pictures](http://www.goodshepherdberkeley.net/liturgy/services/). In one of those pictures, our music director is holding the processional cross that I would carry in the procession. I can't believe I won't ever hold it again.

We barely scrape by financially as it is, but we are very well insured by our diocese, and we will certainly rebuild and recover. Still, it is a real shock to our tiny community (our usual services are about 15-25 people including the clergy). I had not heard the news until I rode my bike up on Sunday morning to get prepare the service (I am in the altar guild). It was like a slap in the face, seeing our beloved church in such a state. But we have been surrounded by love and support from our diocese, other churches, and our neighbors. The Bishop cancelled his plans to come and lead our Sunday service and many people came with tons of coffee and food to share for our usual after service hospitality.

I took a bunch of pictures from the inside of the church, but I don't feel good posting them yet. The insurance people still have to do their stuff, but really the images of the inside of the church are just too raw and heartbreaking. It just looked totally destroyed. I could see that underneath the soot and water damage, much of it could be restored. Material objects can be replaced.

Sorry for rambling, I am still in a bit of shock and processing all of it.

Please keep our church and community in your thoughts and prayers.
Peace,
Dan

EDIT--Thank you to everyone for your good wishes and prayers. This is a wonderful community. We will surely recover and rebuild--it's just a question of time and energy. We've been here for 134 years and we plan to be here in 134 more.

And thank you even to the wise asses. I wouldn't expend the energy to be hurt by your words, just amused at most. I invite you to show your comments to your mother or grandmother--perhaps they will be even more entertained."

This attorney recently told me that they want to hire me full-time, and I should submit my proposed wages.

I've done some research, with Robert Half Legal's annual salary report, and online services salary.com and payscale.com. If I can be forgiven for naming actual dollar amounts, the relevant median pay rates for my geographic area come to anywhere from 60+K to 80+K for ""Small/Solo"" firms.

I spoke with a friend who works in a very small family-run law firm (just two brothers) and he informed me of a different pay formula - ""one third of the business you bring in"". That got me thinking: I currently don't bring in any business for my lawyer. I represent clients at the relevant courts and agencies, but I'm not a ""rainmaker"" yet.

How should I go about this? Do any of you have experience with this and should I be taking the ""median salaries"" with a grain of salt (i.e. they're calculated from attorneys who do a lot of rainmaking)? I'm licensed in two jurisdictions and I have good foreign language skills as well as two or three years' experience in the relevant fields (but others I'm just starting out) - if I ask for the medians from RHL or the online sites, would I just be laughed out of the office?"

* Presenting at a conference late next spring
* Possibility of a summer internship (haven't had one yet!)
* Currently working on 3 research projects and could have a paper in the works soon, possibly out by next summer
* Have ample time to study for and retake the GREs (did okay, but could definitely have done better)

I have worked with kids in the past. I have been a camp counselor for the past two years at a very unstructured camp where I would be in charge of between 5-30 kids by myself at a time. I have taught Spanish to local elementary students in my college town, and I have babysat kids of all ages. I loved doing all these things, I am pretty good with behavioral management and have a knack with kids. I have an overly-enthusiastic and cheesy personality that works great with younger kids.

That being said, I am already a junior in college with a completely different career path in place. I would have to take around 25 credits not related with my international studies major in subjects I don't particularly enjoy. I would have to take summer courses or graduate late in order to have the requirements to be accepted to an education graduate program in Virginia. 

My alternative is to do international development (I have seen the underbelly recently and am very disenchanted with it), or work for the government in the political world which appears to be very cut throat. I had an internship doing international development program management and grant writing and I disliked the solidarity that it forced me into. I see education the extrovert in me would enjoy and I can just keep my interest in news and politics as a hobby. I'm not really going to make a lot of money in either career so that's not really an issue.

**Any suggestions or thoughts? Did you all enjoy your masters programs? How was the job search? Any unforeseen difficulties with teaching? How did you know teaching was right for you? What are some other resources I can read up on to make sure?**

I'm sorry if there is a forum addressing this I browsed and didn't see anything. I'm looking to every outlet to make an informed decision. 


Thank you for any and all feedback!

**EDIT: Wow thank you all for your informative and positive feedback! I'm very conflicted because I do love my major but I think I love learning more than I'm dedicated to my career path. I will definitely have to check out KIPP, I've heard of them before and it sounds like something great to look in to!""**

So the women's advocacy center at my university had their open house today, and I (gasp) stopped by for a while. I'd been there before; the two girls who are usually there are actually very level-headed, and I'm good friends with a previous (male) intern. But there was another girl there who was talking about a big sign she'd put up advertising a ""Men as Peacemakers"" event (one of those ""men can stop rape""-style things). She said she'd put it up a couple days ago, and then later that day found it torn down and in the garbage, so she put it back up. Then she said something about how men just don't want to ""take responsibility"" for things, at which point I realized that she was not sane and level-headed like the other girls.

She then went on to say that while she was putting it up for the second time, she was having difficulty and a couple of guys walked up and asked if she needed help. She apparently accepted their help, but she'd thought to herself, ""You're the people who tore this down, why are you helping me?"" Bear in mind that she didn't know who'd torn it down, and I had asked her to confirm that she didn't.

120gss,14,2012-10-24,Lying to get Retail/Service Work ,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/120gss/lying_to_get_retailservice_work/,"Apologies for the big block of text. I've provided a tldr at the bottom. Thanks for the help! 

My background: A few months ago I graduated with an MSc in Sociology from a prestigious (top 5) program in the UK.* When I entered this program, it was with the intention of applying to PhD programs in a few years, and taking time to work in the nonprofit sector in the interim. Without going into all the details, lets just say this plan has fallen through and I'm trying to figure out my long term career goals at the moment. 

I now live at home and I've been unemployed for months bar some freelancing tutoring (spare me the ""you need to network, do internships, volunteer"" advice, I understand that and have done it). Rather than continue to mope at home, I want to begin working retail so I can save some money and start paying down my student loan debt. I also want to start night classes once a week or so just to keep my mind active and keep myself from falling apart emotionally (I'm a masochist and am already missing being in the academic environment). 

I was wondering if I can get away with passing myself off as a community college student on my resume. My other degrees, after all, would be useless for a position as a hostess or working some other service or retail job. Before getting my MSc, I had tried getting retail work while figuring out my graduate school situation and was repeatedly told I was overqualified so I know employers can discriminate on being too educated.

My question is this: How do I handle bending the truth about my educational background? Its easy enough to leave the information off a resume, but should education come up during an interview do I lie about my background? Say I went traveling (I technically did)? Can I be fired from a job for hiding my education? 

Please no berating me for my poor educational decisions. I have done this already. I get it, it was a major mistake. 

*I'm an American citizen though and despite my best efforts looking for work in the UK (where my degree has actually garnered some oohs and aahs from recruiters), the current visa situation is basically making it impossible to find work. I was actually told by a recruiter to ""marry an English guy"" and that given the unstable changes of the visa system it is highly unlikely employers will spring to sponsoring entry level workers. 

TL;DR: Want to leave degrees off my resume when applying to retail jobs to avoid being told I am overqualified/having my resume binned because employers believe I'll jump ship immediately. How do I handle this? Do I lie in an interview if education comes up? Can I get fired for hiding my degrees? 

Edit: Thanks for all the advice so far. I think I'm going to put my BA, but not my MSc (otherwise just too big of a gap in employment) - and if anyone asks, I was studying abroad or traveling and have only just got back to the States. And as far as employers are concerned I'm still in school. Of course, I'm going to keep weighing options here as you guys give more advice. Thanks so much though. 

Just hope no one looks at my LinkedIn or I'm going to be outed! "

120ae4,3,2012-10-24,Relevance of development experience in a grad school application,wysiwys,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/120ae4/relevance_of_development_experience_in_a_grad/,"Hi people. I'm a 20-year old EE undergrad graduating in spring 2013. I recently just took the general GRE, and got a 319 (157 v and 162 q). Not very satisfied, but I guess it's decent. I'm very much interested in applying for a Masters degree in top US grad schools. The problem is, I'm not a shining star when it comes to academia. My GPA's around 72%, and I have a couple of backlogs. I don't have research experience or great referrals either, I'll be relying on a few EE professors from my no-name college for the recommendation. I'm planning to write the IELTS soon, and I'm pretty sure I can score well in that.

My question is, though my academic stats look bad, I have a couple of years' software development experience and a decent skillset that I've gathered through my own time spent writing code. I have a lot of projects that I've done on my own, covering C, python web dev and even android dev, plus I've taken a remote internship with Google (Summer of Code) successfully. I also have some FOSS development experience.

That said, is it worth applying to top schools relying on my programming experience and my GRE scores, since my GPA and previous research experience is lacking? I'm interested in courses related to AI, especially in courses which blend programming and cognition. I have a couple of small projects and a few blog posts that demonstrate my fascination with pattern recognition, Music in AI and the like, will those help?

I'm doing my best to try and aggregate information that would help me make a decision, so any general advice, such as courses that would be a good fit, schools which have a great AI base and where I stand a good chance, application advice, advice on contacting professors etc, would be great.

Thanks!"
1208e4,24,2012-10-24,Aren't complete jerks better off dead?,plmoknijn,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1208e4/arent_complete_jerks_better_off_dead/,"This morning my husband called me a bitch. I wasn't doing anything particularly bitchy at the time... but he's right. I am a bitch. He calls bitch, cunt, and everything remotely related a lot. I tell myself it's abusive and to ignore it, but he's right.

I yell at him and call him a dick a lot too. I tell myself at the time that it's because he's being one, but I realize that it's just my way of manipulating him. I manipulate a lot of people, including myself. I tell little lies (or sometimes big ones) to get people to like me more, to get my way, to get out of problems. I use my emotions to control the emotions of others. I lie to myself to the point that I believe the lies. It's my first time admitting this to anyone.

I act like I'm a great person, but this morning I realized I'm not. After he said that I started looking over my life and I realized I've never done anything for anyone when there wasn't some substantial benefit to me. I'm not even capable of maintaining friendships because I just don't feel like they benefit me. I have like 2 casual friends (both who I lie to constantly, one who I'm abandoning because trying to be friends is just too much work) and that's it.  I did my first ""noble"" thing this morning when I decided not to jump off the building I was sitting on the roof of because the street below was too populated and it wouldn't be fair to the people who had to watch it.

I don't really contribute to society and never will. I've been in college for almost 7 years due to money trouble, but even still I'm a mediocre student. I've interviewed at a ton of places for jobs and internships, but most places didn't even bother to call me back to reject me. To be quite honest I don't think I'll ever find a job, and I just don't care enough to. I don't even like what I'm doing in school. I wanted to drop out a few years ago but my husband pushed me to continue because he thought that I would have more opportunities with a degree than without. On top of that, I don't volunteer and I don't donate. I actually run a student organization that does a lot of volunteering, but I don't do any of the volunteer work myself. Instead I just use the position as a chance to meet more companies.

On top of that I'm fat and ugly. While I don't necessarily look like a whale, I weigh in the whale category somewhere at somewhere around 34% body fat. My doctor says I'm in generally good health, and as long as I keep exercising I have bigger things to worry about (he calls what I have a pre-eating disorder - I'll not eat for over a week and then binge). I can't stand to look at myself in the mirror. I tried to dress nice and make myself feel like it would be ok, but stores don't carry things in my size and the things that do fit are just to... showy. I feel like everyone is staring at my fat rolls. Along with some other issues from my past, poor body image means that my husband almost never gets sex, and the few times he does we have to quit because it's usually really painful for me because I just can't bring myself to like it. I hate that I can't even do one thing for the only person who might actually care about me because I'm so self absorbed, but that doesn't change the fact that I don't do it.

It doesn't help that I started broken. A family member tried to kill me when I was younger. Several times. When he couldn't get to me to kill me, he would threaten to kill himself. He would scare away all my friends and generally just made me feel much safer alone. I would cry going to school. As a first grader I was already forcing myself to throw up and otherwise faking sick to get out of it. I was a good student, but my teachers were constantly hounding me about how I wasn't as good as my older siblings. My parents were never home, and they were (to be perfectly honest) really shitty parents anyway. At the age of 11 I met my first and only (to this day) best friend. They told me she was a horrible person, and when she moved away 2 years later they essentially took away all forms of contacting her. At the age of 15 I met someone really awesome who tried to help me improve my life. They made me cut off all contact and start seeing a therapist. The therapist was one of the sorts who thought that God would handle everything. He doesn't. At 16 I got a job at a place where I didn't have friends necessarily, but I felt needed. At 17 I chose to work instead of going to my senior prom, and was sexually assaulted that night by a co-worker there. I quit shortly after. I took another job, where another co-worker who I confided in sexually assaulted/raped me me multiple times (30+) over a several month span until I could finally find a new job and get out. I saw a psychiatrist but he just didn't get it. My doctor doesn't get it either, but he at least goes along with it. My husband at least acknowledges that he never will understand. 

No matter how hard I try I can't come up with a single good thing I've done with my life. I'm a horrible person who contributes nothing and never will. I'm not even sure I'm emotionally capable of it. I just make the lives of people around me worse. I don't enjoy life, and people would probably be a lot happier without me. I just don't see the point anymore.

Problem: I don't know the first thing about it.",[deleted],FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/12073w/engineer_looking_to_switch_careers_possibly_to/,"I grew up in a rather poor family. Money, finance, business, etc. -- those were all for rich people. I didn't learn a thing about money growing up. We were a paycheck-to-paycheck, cash only type family. I mean, my dad doesn't even have a bank account. 

Graduated with a degree in civil engineering (3.7 GPA), worked all through school, internships, all that jazz. Been workinh as a structural engineer for over a year now, but it's pretty boring and the career outlook isn't ideal. Engineering may start out with a high(-ish) salary, but it peaks early. I'm a junior engineer, then I'll get my engineering license after 4 years, and then maybe 10 years after that I could be the lead engineer. This doesn't interest me, and I've been desperately searching for another career. I have looked at sales, actuarial work, teaching... maybe finance would be ideal for me.

*But I don't know anything about finance.*

I learn quickly and I know I can handle anything that is thrown at me. I'm quite personable (a personable engineer!) and I have always done well in interviews. I need to prove to an employer, and to myself, that we are a good match. I live near a big city (Philadelphia) so that may help my search.

**Basically...**

1. Are there any useful tools to learn the basics of finance? Any input on Khan Academy?

2. I've seen financial engineering majors at some schools. I love math so this would be great. How much math does someone working in finance actually do? This is my strength and I would love to play to it.

3. Should I go back to school (I really would love to, but money is an issue) or would I maybe be able to find a job with no finance experience? If I can get in somewhere I know I will learn, but I don't know why I would be hired over someone with a finance major and/or finance internship. I can self-teach, but I don't know if that will get my foot in the door somewhere."

A little over a year ago I met a girl through a friend,She seemed kind of beat down by her boyfriend at the time and I was there to help. We quickly became entangled in lots of sex, despite her not leaving him. After some time I became more and more attached to her. Eventually I spent all my time trying to get her to leave him. Then the pregnancy came and I flipped a shit. I wasn't ready for a kid but I don't agree with abortion. Fast-forward about a month or two and she had dropped off the planet. Eventually I finally got her to talk to me and turned out she'd apparently had a miscarriage, well I didn't react too well to this since I had come to terms with my mistake and was going to do everything in my power to do, what I considered, right. She got in with a ""bad crowd"" of coke heads and things of that nature, always getting fucked up. This went on for months with us having random nights together with more sex no matter what I did though she never thought it was good enough. I fell into a similar pattern as her spending more time getting high than anything else. Well after my friends had seen me start to lose myself, one of them introduced me to longboarding. Now I've never been good at things like that but this was something I enjoyed quickly and practiced for hours learning new things and getting back into shape. She kept coming back and I kept falling back into the routine of drugs. After some time of her being away though something just clicked inside me and I just couldn't care less about her as anything more than just a random person on the street. She came back and just tried to get me angry and depressed and back into old habits. I told her I didn't have time for her due to starting college and starting 2 internships plus a part-time job. Now I have another woman in my life that only wants to get her life right and help me along the way. I'm in shape again and just don't care what people think, I can talk to people at parties I don't even know and try new things without much fear, some of the shit I try is scary.

I'm reaching out to possibly get some career advice. I graduated college in 2012 with a major in Legal Studies in Business and a double minor in Psychology and Spanish. After ~6 months of working in the business world, I've realized that I made a mistake. I want to be a therapist, but one that specializes in a very under-served field. I want to be a women's sexual dysfunction therapist (I'm not even sure if that's the right way to phrase it). I want to help women who suffer from vaginismus, dyspareunia, vulvar vestibulitis, anorgasmia, pelvic pain, painful intercourse, etc. I'm only interested in treating women with these sexual issues.

My passion behind this comes from my own struggles with vaginismus, which I recently overcame this past summer. After 8 years of painful and embarrassing physical therapy, I found the lack of emotional support very detrimental to my mental health. I struggled with major depression and suicidal thoughts because of my problem. Vaginismus isn't something you can talk about easily with others. To have to hide that (huge) part of my life was very taxing for me, and I tried to seek out therapy to help cope. However, out of the ~20 therapists I saw, not one - not ONE - even knew what vaginismus was. That was very discouraging for me.

I want to be that emotional support for women who are struggling with this painful and embarrassing medical issue. The problem is, I don't even know someone who does that for a living to ask for advice. What kind of program should I look for? How do I specialize in sexual dysfunction? Where should I intern? Is this worth pursuing?

If anyone can give me advice, I'd be really appreciative. I'm not even sure what type of schooling I'd need to reach my goal. I just want to help!"

After ~6 months of working in the business world, I've realized that I made a mistake. I want to be a therapist, but one that specializes in a very under-served field. I want to be a women's sexual dysfunction therapist (I'm not even sure if that's the right way to phrase it). I want to help women who suffer from vaginismus, dyspareunia, anorgasmia, pelvic pain, painful intercourse, etc. I'm only interested in treating women with these sexual issues. 

My passion behind this comes from my own struggles with vaginismus, which I recently overcame this past summer. After 8 years of painful and embarrassing physical therapy, I found the lack of emotional support very detrimental to my mental health. I struggled with major depression and suicidal thoughts because of my problem. Vaginismus isn't something you can talk about easily with others. To have to hide that (huge) part of my life was very taxing for me, and I tried to seek out therapy to help cope. However, out of the ~20 therapists I saw, not one - not ONE - even knew what vaginismus was. That was very discouraging for me.

I want to be that emotional support for women who are struggling with this painful and embarrassing medical issue.  The problem is, I don't even know someone who does that for a living to ask for advice. What kind of program should I look for? How do I specialize in sexual dysfunction? Where should I intern? Is this worth pursuing?

If anyone can give me advice, I'd be really appreciative. I'm not even sure what type of schooling I'd need to reach my goal. I just want to help!"

We are not married, nor have children. Within the couple years, she has began to be controlling and irrationally jealous with no just cause. I've been faithful.

I'm a RN and as such I can precept students. It's pretty much a nursing internship that you have to complete a certain hour count to get your license. As a RN for only a year and a half, I can only precept LPN students. I recently precepted a student about 3 months ago and there was instant chemistry between us. Let's call her Lacie. I haven't felt like this is a few years. She was kind, intelligent, and gorgeous. She is 8 years my elder, and divorced from her only marriage with no children.  When her preceptorship was complete, she asked me to dinner to thank me and I obliged. We had a great time and slowly began to see each other multiple times a week to hang out. Over time, things became hot and heavy and we have slept together. 

What should I do? Tomorrow I move in with my first love, and have began to have second thoughts. Pretty much to the point of depression.

123ayn,14,2012-10-25,"37 years old, surprise pregnancy, a little (a lot) freaked out. (x-post from r/mommit)",MrsAnthropy,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/123ayn/37_years_old_surprise_pregnancy_a_little_a_lot/,"Hi, ladies. Bear with me here. My mind is all over the place.

So I've spent the past few years under the (apparently mistaken) impression that I would not be able to get pregnant again. I have a variety of issues with my ladyparts which, at this point don't really matter because I am now 5 weeks pregnant. I have an appointment with an OB November 9th. My husband has already offered to have a vasectomy. He and my daughter want another baby. I was on the fence (pregnancy was difficult for me), but since I didn't think it was possible, I had pretty much accepted that and was ready to move on with my career and focus on our family of three being happy, healthy, and probably traveling a lot.

There are multiple other situations complicating my feelings about this pregnancy. One is that I have miscarried at least a couple of times since having my daughter over three years ago, so of course I worry about that. But I did not miss a period by much in the past. A pregnancy that I lost in January was confirmed through a biopsy I had a few months ago. I kind of ""felt"" that I was pregnant, but had not gotten a positive pregnancy test.

Second is that I'm currently finishing graduate school. I would graduate in the beginning of June, and my due date would be June 30th. My plan was to adjunct at a couple of colleges while I worked my way into a full-time faculty position. With those benefits, my husband could go back to school and get his master's degree. I don't know what the possibility of that is now, because someone will need to be with the baby once it's born (assuming all goes well), and at this point, we can't afford for either of us to stay home. 

Our three-year-old daughter is in preschool right now while I complete teaching internships and we can't afford it. We're broke, broke, broke. Robbing Peter to pay Paul and all that jazz. We don't qualify for assistance because my internship and level of education are not considering ""necessary."" 
We live in a big, expensive city with progressive people. Our family lives in a small, affordable city with conservative values. I like raising my daughter in a place with so many opportunities and such great public transportation. If we moved back ""home"" for help from family (and for our dollars to stretch farther), I would feel like we're giving up quite a bit on culture and opportunities for everyone. But we know no one here. All my schoolmates are ten years younger than me, single, no kids. 

So, another thing I worry about is applying for ""real"" jobs (in either city) when I'm obviously pregnant and then getting turned down as a result. I'm also concerned about the upcoming holidays. I am very, very short and, as with my last pregnancy, am beginning to show already. There's no way I'll be able to hide it when I'm trying to apply for jobs, and I'm not sure I will be able to keep it under wraps before the first trimester is over. 

I keep saying ""if all goes well,"" because, you know, I'm 37 years old, so to add another layer to my quiet panic is the potential that something could come up in tests. 

God. I am kind of a mess right now. Sorry about all of this. I guess I'm just asking for general advice, suggestions, good vibes, whatever anyone wants to share. I'm scared and worried. Thanks, ladies. 

**ETA**: Initially, I wondered if I should post here or /r/mommit and went there initially since I hadn't subscribed to /r/babybumps until today. So here I am!"

I'm currently 22 and I grew up in a country that suffers from racism issues. Because of these I have developped some sort of social phobia because people like to pick on me for what I look like with mean jokes. I also got hit on and robbed many times because they clearly said that people of my kind are not accepted here.
However, I live with that and I got only one friend that knows what's up because we grew up together in the same conditions.

My family doesn't care about how I feel. My parents have never asked how I feel since my birth. And the whole family got severly torn apart since the death of my father a few years ago. Things got worse and worse and now we only communicate in a conflictual way. But nobody is here to admit it. We all know it but we do as if everything was fine.

A few years ago. I made a huge loan to pay my studies that I have to refund in 2013. However I also financed some personnal projects that have all failed by now.

By the end of 2011, I was a student with only one friend I signed up in a new school and everything looked promising for the future but it got a lot worse.

Like a lot of people on internet, I enjoy pornography however I took it to the next level some years ago. I started going on live sex networks and paying performers just to get my dose of pornography. Everything was fine until I stumbled onto that specific woman.

I don't know how but I saw something special in her. Obviously I paid her and I really enjoyed her shows. But quickly I developped some sort of addiction to her. I was just falling in love.

At the same time I started classes in my new school but right away they start to mess up (our very first class got cancelled). But this is how it was supposed to go: I go to classes etc. and after half a year I have to work as an intern in a company. But the days were very intense, I was spending literally 12 hours per day at school.
During winter I wasn't even seeing the sunlight, it was night in the morning while I go to school and when I get out it was night again.

When I get back home I was trying to talk to that woman I was falling in love with. Everything was fine even though school made it difficult. Right after new year's eve she decided to quit her job. And this is where I realized that I was in love. I asked her to tell me what she thinks about me and if she wants to take our relationship further. She replied she would love it and she added me on her MSN/Skype friendlists.

During two weeks everything was good. I was talking to a new woman that had nothing to do with pornography and I really loved it. My best friend was telling me that 2012 is the year where all the bullshit will stop and things will start improving for both of us. I was believing him.

But then she decided to go back there in a new studio (she doesn't work at home) and things started to get complicated. I was seeing her saying the same things she tells me to other men. I was seeing my girlfriend being called a bitch and both of us had to be okay with it because this is her job. Even though it was complicated I was okay with that because I know at the end of the day it was all fake.

However, in March, she completely disappeared and I was worried, I didn't have anything besides her MSN/Skype and she wouldn't show up. I realized that I completely changed. I was so in love with ther that I no longer live for my own freedom but I live for her. Everything I wanted to do in the past has become an optional interest she is my only priority. Anyway, I waited for almost two weeks and she showed up announcing me that she got her laptop robbed. At this point things started to be hellish for me.

We had to maintain our relationship while she worked at her job through private messaging. But at the same time classes ended and I had to find an internship and at the same time. Old customers (that she befriended with) started to be overwhelming (they can't stop calling her beautiful etc. knowing that she was dating me) however I let her do whatever she wants I think she can handle men she has to deal with that everyday. I find it really disrespectful especially when the guy knows she's dating me but I just don't want to annoy her with that. I tried to take it as best as I could.

I was planning to buy her a computer with my internship revenue. However, I've never found the internship. It was the most important thing because I planned to save all of it and go to her country (there is an ocean between us and only plane can make us physically meet each other) and meet her but I've failed. Maybe I could have found it, I had so many reasons to find it, my studies, my relationship ... but I've failed. My studies can't continue because I was running out of funds from my loan and I had to refund it the next year anyway.

In May, she disappeared again and end in another studio however she hid it to me. She told me she was working as an assistant. I asked her to give me her phone because I don't want to be worried about her disappearing anymore and she did so. However calling her gave away what she was actually doing (I heard the sounds). And I started to stalk the live sex websites once again and I found her. She said she was sorry and she didn't want me to see her as a slut. I forgave her and asked her not to lie anymore.

At this point I was just trying to find a temp job anywhere that could allow me to work for a short time and then do everything I planned to do with her. But guess what ... I couldn't.

In July, she had financial problems because she wanted to go back to school however she needed a bit of cash that she couldn't find. I naturally helped her with the last digits of my account balance. I was glad that she was getting back to school. It made me feel that I accomplished something good in my life that I may have contributed to the happiness of that person and obviously it's always a pleasure to help out the woman I love.

In August, she changed studio once again but this time she didn't lie to me. And here starts the next level of pain. At this point it has been 7 months that we're dating and I watch her getting naked for other men but this time she worked in another website and it made things a lot more difficult. We had many conversations about her job. I tried to take it as best as I could but sometimes it's too much for me to handle. She keeps telling me that she only does it for money and that I don't have to worry. She even told me that she's sorry that I have to go through that. (FYI she lives in a poor country and apparently she can only afford doing that job)

In September, we got in many problems, she started giving her body away. Setting cheap prices for shows or even free showing. Then she started watching other men fapping for free and I was watching her enjoying it. She tried to make me feel better about it but I can't live with that it's starts to be to much for me. I talked to her about a new plan.

I told her that I will stop searching a temp job (I gave up anyway) and I will look for a bigger job and split my salary with her in order to buy her freedom. She was okay with it.

But by the end of the month she started bringing a colleague. Who happens to be a man and they started to work together and they do some sort of foreplaying in front of everyone. I immediately called her saying that I won't accept it but she refuses to listen to me and she kept doing it.

I literally harassed her on the phone but she refused to talk because of the language barrier. She prefers to talk by typing. However it's nearly impossible to do so besides her work. Obviously I got really mad and I said I don't want her anymore.

However, when things got cooler in my mind I realized that I love her way too much to quit her. I tried to get back to her but she literally changed.

She admitted what she did was bad (apparently she thought it was okay during the moment because the guy was gay) but well ... she doesn't want me anymore. I tried to tell her that I forgive her if she doesn't do it again. She said she won't do it again but we're no longer in a relationship. After every efforts I made for her, I couldn't let that happen. I know it's very dumb but I think I'm an idiot and love is stupid.

In the same moment my best friend got a crush he met while playing Guild Wars 2 and he constantly talks to me of how things are getting better with his crush while actually things are getting worse in my relationship. I tried to avoid talking to him because it's very irritating. Even though I told him that it's absolutely not the topic to talk about he replied with life ain't cool and I have to deal with it. That's an ass move in my opinion but I try to talk to him because he happens to be the only person I can talk to.

I talked many times with my ""girlfriend"" but I seem to annoy her. She answer with simple things like yes hmmm yes hmmm while she is enjoying other men. For the few times she actually said things to me she said that our relationship is way too difficult. She refuses to tell me if she loves me or not but she stated that I'm the man of her dreams. I'm really confused but I thought that the fights were just too fresh to I gave her some time alone.

In the meantime I decided to ask the bank if I can get more funds in order to buy a flight to her country and make our relationship ""easier"" (obviously I lied to them and told them it was for my studies) but they asked for proofs so it's basically impossible to do get the funds. Since then I've been regretting going to my new school just to fail because it happens that the money I gave them would have been enough to do many trips to see her.

Recently we talked again and she said the same things. I'm important to her but it's too hard and she doesn't want us to suffer. I tried to explain her that I love her and that I will suffer more if she refuses me. But she tries to change topic. I don't know what to believe but my heart wants to believe that there's still a chance.

I called my best friend to book him a day to go with me to a convention. But he refused because it's holidays and his crush might be available. He told me that it's hard to see her (they live ~30min away) to me who dreamed about seeing my girlfriend in real for almost a year now. I told him that and he said that I have to forget her etc. I find it really stupid from him.

Today my ""girlfriend"" said that she likes her job sometimes (a job that she hated in the past) and she decided to make her room private but I'm not in the party. And who knows what's happening right now.

I don't understand how in a span of a few days she literally changed. She was a lovely woman and now she acts like a regular cam whore. I don't know if everything was fake or anything. I want to find out but in the meantime I suffer so much.

I know that I look like a dumb fuck for dating her but she's the sweetest thing I've ever met in my life she doesn't do only bad things and I believe she is a great woman outside of her job or at least she used to. You can tell me there are better women and I will believe you but I don't see them. My heart loves that specific woman I believed it was one of the few good things in my life and I tried everything to stick to it. I'm really ashamed to talk about this story but here I did it.

I don't wanna talk to my best friend or to anyone because it happens that everybody I counted on is now just gone doing theirs respective businesses. I'm literally lonely and I don't like to say it but I cried. When my tears stopped dropping I wrote this. Just to make me feel better.

I didn't think all of this would happen in the beginning of this year but now I'm convinced that things will always get worse and worse in my life. I don't want to live with such expectations but I have a little hope deep inside that everything is going to be fine for me.

So here I am I don't know what to do. I have to find a job to pay my loan but why would I do that anyway she's my only reason to live. All I've ever wanted is to be happy and it's too much apparently. It's been months that I say that but my only remaining pleasure in my life is video games and eating junk food and I guess this is what I'm gonna do right now. If you read it all, I would like to thank you. And it makes me feel a lot better to know that someone, somewhere knows what I've been through this year."

I guess my question is is which route does r/Accounting think is smarter: go into the PPiA program and work towards my Master's/Bachelor's degree simultaneously or obtain my Bachelor's degree first and go back for Master's degree later (potentially having a company pay for my graduate studies)?  
  
Any advice would be helpful. Thank you."

I know Python, C#, Java, some C, and a little bit of C++. I write networked desktop applications using Twisted and wxPython, with some backend written in C, and some pretty complicated databases in MySQL. All of this is self-taught, and I would say I'm a pretty solid programmer, all things considered.

However, I feel like I need to know more. I don't know how to write production applications or  how to optimize, and I have the nagging feeling there's a whole world of programming out there that I haven't seen yet because of being self-taught, and I want to learn all of it.

My question to you is this: What should I learn? What book should I buy, what language / language concept / whatever should I teach myself, if I want to take my programming from hobby-level to professional? And how can I do all that without attending formal education?"

Last time I posted this reddit went down for the day and I got ignored.  I guess I should give you a little background first. I was interning at my company, which is a structural engineering company, (I myself am an ME who just recently graduated from grad school with my masters this past may) since the end of 2007 up to the beginning of 2012.

I basically did very little actual engineering work. Most of the work I had done was coding, which was actually something I didn't know a damn thing about going into the job. The most engineering work I did was when I had to make a program that could do bending moment diagrams...keep in mind that I worked on this for about a month during my internship. The rest of the time I was coding and making a program run the way we wanted to (no engineering work here at all, just aesthetics). I stayed here because the money was really good and the schedule was anything I wanted it to be.

This January when I was going to start searching for a full time job, they actually gave me a job offer which I accepted. I was told that since our company is small, we could be flexible in the types of projects we get. In the offer sheet, I was told that my duties would involve mechanical engineering, mechanical design, software development support, and experimental research.

In theory this sounded great, but so far, all that I have done seems to be intern type work. I've had to buy stuff from online for projects, reserve cars, and manipulate a program to match some data. I'm still doing some coding, but we are almost done with the program that we've been working on. I've done very few engineering type things such as using Solidworks, LS-DYNA, and some other things that don't come to mind right now. Basically, if I had to turn it into a percentage, I'd say that 90% of my time is spent doing bitch work and 10% may be engineering related work. They also just got me to work on a final report for a project that I had absolutely nothing to do with which has really sucks.  The only positive that I am focusing on right now so I don't explode is that I have a job with decent pay and at least I don't work at McDonald's or some crap...

SO, with all that all being said, is it time for me to look for another job or is this just the process that all entry level engineers go through?

And because this post is so damn long... TL;DR-I am an ME that interned at a structural engineering company for 4 years doing non-engineering work, was finally given a full time job offer in January. Full time job duties include 90% bitch work and 10% engineering work. Is this normal for all entry level engineers or should I start looking for another job?"

Both of these jobs are manual labor work. They both pay the same.

Job 1: Been here for 1.5 years. Lots of sentimentality attachment to this place as this is the place that got me out of my social isolation. The work is generally a breeze, time goes by super fast and there's lots of breaks. But the company is small and has no union or HR to keep the bosses in check. Benefits are bad. Pay never goes up.

Job 2: Been here for 6 months. The work is very boring and monotonous. Stand in one place the entire time sorting through boxes, the entire time, with no breaks. ugh i hate it so much, time passes by SO slowly. The benefits are great, free medical. It's a big corporation so they have to treat their employees very well. The only reason to stay in this job is because if i stick with it for a year or two, i'll have a good chance of moving up to a position that is similar to my first job where where i'll have a much more enjoyable time. And if i stay for several years, i might be able to become a truck driver and make at least double the pay.

So it's really tough because on paper, the 2nd job sounds better. But the 1st job is so much more enjoyable and easier, and i have a lot of emotional attachment to that place and to the people there. I got the biggest crush on a girl that works there too. She's really pretty and nice. Well, i'm a bit concerned if that factor is actually influencing my decision making so i want to know what you guys think.

Here is my reasoning. I'm quitting the 2nd job, because i'm going to be a student anyway. I want to be a chemist. In a couple years I assume that i'll be going into internships and i'll be quitting my job anyway. So if i'm going to quit in a couple years, I might as well quit the 2nd job, because the only reason to stick with the 2nd job is if I'm planning to stay there for the long term, which I'm not.

Sound good?"

Ok so what exactly do they mean? I can do a bit of webdesign, I have no skills and interactive media (if that means programming) and what the hell is even social media? Facebook? Yeah I have a facebook. As a matter of fact, I probably have an account on every single website that has been created because I have a lot of free time, or time that is in fact no free but I use it to procrastinate and sign up for things that seem awesome at the time.

What should I learn/teach myself to make sure I don't make a fool out of myself? I've already told them I'd go to a ""meeting"" (I was just like, well, f*uck it, I can do this), and I'm really passionate about the subject (the utility of design), so I do have the motivation and all the good reasons to be a good asset, however I'm afraid I'll have no clue of what I'm doing technically speaking.

After reading this article:http://www.fastcocreate.com/1681815/why-the-ad-industry-is-in-a-talent-rut-and-a-prescription-for-change  I realized we're really moving into a truly digital age, and if I hope to keep up I really need to get on top of it.

I'm going to be graduating in two months with a degree in Advertising and Art Studio, and have an Associates in Graphic Design. I'm looking to transition more into the Advertising or Marketing fields rather than Graphic Design. I've realized that to make a truly effective ad, I need to start analyzing how people think and act in a digital environment. I also want to be able to learn how to create an effective ad delivered through a digital medium.

In my time as a Marketing Intern and Graphic Designer, I've been faced with launching or revamping websites, and making mock ups for Apps and interactive displays. I like doing this kind of work, and its something I would like to transition into while still keeping an Advertising perspective. I like trying to figure out whats most logical for the end user and simplifying information. I'm not a programmer, so working on actual UI is out of my grasp, but I would like to learn the basics of functional UI and UX. I think it could be a marketable tool for myself in the years to come.

So, I know everyone here prefers to build their own computer, but as a casual user (just gaming), I feel buying a pre-built one wouldn't be that bad. Specially because I am buying from a website much like ebay, from a user my brother has bought before, and who brings the parts from the US (so it's really ALOT cheaper then almost any where here in Brazil).

Here's a build I really like:

- Video Card: Either an Nvidia Geforce GTX670 2GB (my brother told me not to choose Geforce?) or a ATI Radeon HD7950, for the same price.
- Memory: 16GB of 1600Mhz memories with a Dual Channel ""cooling system"" (not sure how to translate what he wrote, so I changed to cooling system) and the best plug performance in the market, along with termal protection.
- Storage: HD 2TB Sta3 6GB/s 64MB Buffer 7200rpm 3,5'' intern, with 2048GB of storage capacity and S.M.A.R.T technology.
- Power supply: 800W with active PFC and certified 80Plus, from XFX, Corsair or Zalman (depending on stock).
- Drives: Sony AD-7260S

He is charging R$ 4,300.00 (~U$2,150.00, which is actually quite cheap for such setup, since we have craaaaazy taxes here).

[I know nothing of computers but i  was wondering if you could simply state why i should use firefox on my PC instead of others? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/120oif/we_are_mozilla_aua/c6r5udj?context=5)|Firefox is designed and implemented by a non-profit organization fighting for the rights and the privacy of users on the web. Other major browsers are basically the opposite.
 |Because Firefox is the safest and most customizable browser out there. It's powered by people like me and you who contribute to make it better every day. It's running stable and does your best to protect your privacy on the internet. Plus it's incredibly fast and supports many open standards, giving you a better browsing experience. :)
 |Plus, as an Open source model, if a security flaw is discovered, it's fixed in an average of one day, rather than other proprietary softwares can take weeks or months to fix it, for instance.
 |Firefox for Android, in my opinion, is the best mobile browser out there for Android. With it's recent features like Reader Mode and shift to native widgets to improve performance, it's become my favorite. Using Firefox on Desktop, gives me the option to use Firefox Sync.
[Firefox is practically slow compared to Chrome. What are you doing about it?  I am not talking about speed of launching it on the desktop, I am talking about speed in general.  Chrome is simply faster when in use compared to Firefox.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/120oif/we_are_mozilla_aua/c6r62hg?context=5)|Firefox is getting faster and faster with every release, so you might want to check back every so often to see if you still find it slow...
[What are you doing to develop/upgrade the local Bookmarks Manager?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/120oif/we_are_mozilla_aua/c6r62hg?context=5)|But, if you find Chrome faster, use Chrome! Mozilla is a not-for-profit which exists for the good of the web, and part of the web remaining healthy is there being multiple web browsers out there. As we saw when IE completely dominated, the web was a boring mundane place, but now where IE, Chrome and Firefox have a much more even split of the browser market, the web is a much better place! (Wouldn't you agree?)
[These are the make/break things for me.  I gave up on Firefox after many years of complete support only after I realized that Chrome was faster.  There is a huge saving of time in a long run when you use Chrome over Firefox.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/120oif/we_are_mozilla_aua/c6r62hg?context=5)|So, where was I going on this point? Ah, yes - if you prefer Chrome then use Chrome! If Opera has features you like, use Opera. Heck, if IE floats your boat... then use it! The competitiveness in the browser market is what pushes development on the web, and is exactly what Mozilla likes and wants!
[Ps: I am not a great fan of Google or even their browser, but speed is a big deal when one looks at it in a long run. The amount of time one can save is significant.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/120oif/we_are_mozilla_aua/c6r62hg?context=5)|As for the local bookmarks manager, I have no idea :P.
[Memory leaks. are they fixed and people just keep on saying that they are not, or are there still memory leaks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/120oif/we_are_mozilla_aua/c6r5pv0?context=5)|There are no significant memory leaks that we know of, and overall memory usage is quite good.. but there still might be memory issues.  A 'memory leak' happens when a program reserves some memory space, and then loses all ways to access it without releasing it.  These are pretty easy to find and take care of.
[If you could impliment one feature what would it be? Be crazy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/120oif/we_are_mozilla_aua/c6r5pv0?context=5)|Much harder is when a program reserves some memory space, and something still holds on to it -- even if it's not being actively used.  For example, a web app may load a bunch of data off the network and keep it around in case you click a button on the page to have it be displayed... and then keep loading more data every hour (for example, to make sure you have the latest info).  If you keep your browser and this tab open, you will see your browser's memory usage go up and up and up.  There's no real leak, but memory isn't being used efficiently -- and it's not the browser's fault!  As web apps become more complex, this kind of stuff is becoming very common.  You can get an idea of what's going on by looking at 'about:memory' in Firefox, which lists all sorts of interesting memory data.
 |I keep my browser open forever, other than for updates, so I see this stuff frequently.  Usually just closing tabs that I suspect are doing this causes memory usage to drop pretty quickly.
 |Vertical tabs ;)
 |Practically, every program has memory leaks. Unfortunately, adding new features to Firefox can also cause them to appear. But thanks to our contributors and developers who try to fix them as soon as possible, most users' browsing experiences won't be affected. And as soon as someone tells us about a memory leak, we're fixing it and keeping the numbers of leaks as small as possible. :-)
 |Regarding your second question: I'd personally love a feature that allows me to make sandwiches. I know it's impossible, but I'm really looking forward to seeing it in the future.
 |I just want to point out that we'll never ""fix all the memory leaks"", and we should never claim otherwise.  Firefox has millions of lines of code, and we're constantly changing it.  As hard as we try, we occasionally introduce new leaks (e.g. [1]).  And as we change the browser, the amount of memory it uses also changes -- this can give the appearance of ""leaks"" when there are none per se.
 |The right question to ask isn't ""are the leaks finally fixed?"" but ""how has the chance that Firefox's memory usage is acceptable for my workloads changed over time?""  In this respect, we've made demonstrable progress, as we've not only decreased memory usage for average workloads (as indicated by the telemetry we collect from users who opt in [2] and by our automated tests [3]), but we've fixed a number of edge cases which were causing some users to see high memory usage.  (For example, we fixed the vast majority of leaks caused by add-ons.)

[Are there any future plans/projects for Firefox that we should looking forward to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/120oif/we_are_mozilla_aua/c6r5wxg?context=5)|[Firefox OS](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefoxos/) :)
 |FirefoxOS, formerly Boot2Gecko, is going to be available early next year. It is an OS aimed at commodity smartphones built exclusively on web standards, and it is pretty freaking neat. This has driven a lot of the performance improvements we've seen in Firefox (and Firefox for Android) over the last year.
 |WebRTC: real-time communication in the browser without plugins required. p2p Audio, Video or data streams directly from within the browser, all in a couple lines of javascript.
 |Rust, a C/C++ replacing system language that is memory safe. They just released version 0.4.
 |Servo, a next-generation, multi-process, super-flexible browser engine, conveniently *being written in Rust*.

[It seems PCs and OSs are becoming increasingly locked down - tightly controlled App Stores, Restricted Boot etc - which actively discourage third party applications like browsers or make them impossible to install or compete fairly with the native one. What future do you see for Mozilla in a world where computers become thin clients on which the users have minimal control and just accept the defaults?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/120oif/we_are_mozilla_aua/c6r7cyz?context=5)|This is why we are building [Firefox OS](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefoxos/) we think that while OSs are currently locked down that it doesn't need to be the trend for all time.
 |Firefox OS, just like Firefox browser, is not aiming to take over the world and force everyone else out (unlike what our competitors would like in both cases.) We want to have an open platform that forces platforms to also embrace open standards. Shake things up and make them better for humans instead of only getting better for corporations.
[I am a Firefox fan and a programmer. I would like to be able to see Firefox with eyes of a developer by making changes in code and building it.  The issue is that I always get put off by thinking about creating the build environment. Creating a build environment for Firefox is too complicated.

[You can still release a ton of point releases on a regular schedule, but save the major version number for major changes.  Instead of calling this version 18 or whatever crazy high number it is, you could call it 5.6.3 or something. No significant changes have been made since 5.0, so the question is, why the version number?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/120oif/we_are_mozilla_aua/c6r6b80?context=5)|Because version numbers don't matter. Let's pretend they did matter, and you could know that FF 6 contained at least one ""major change"". How do you define that? Do you still have some kind of schedule for when major changes occur? What if you suddenly need to make a ""major change"" due to a 0-day security bug that threatens users? Do your updating rules change for major releases?  The point is, version numbers are arbitrary. Many people associate them with big things like UI refreshes, or a new JIT engine, but there's a host of things that could constitute ""major changes"" that are harder to market in a traditional way. When we are releasing new versions every 6 weeks, it is counter-productive to limit the changes we're allowed to make in a particular cycle due to an arbitrary number.
[Let's not fuck around here, is it also partially do with ""bigger is better""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/120oif/we_are_mozilla_aua/c6rpg2j?context=5)|Agreed, let's not fuck around. No.

[In regards to your codebase, has your C++0x usage been rising? With the latest improvements in GCC (sadly not in MSVC\), I'd would have expected your use of C++11 to rise? Also, nearly every C++ book has references to the new standard, I'm sure this has a positive effect on the volume of C++11 you get now?  Can any of you confirm this? On a side note, this question is related: I'm thinking of contributing a patch, though I tend to write a lot of 0x; thus I would like to know if it is acceptable?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/120oif/we_are_mozilla_aua/c6rqq9i?context=5)|We're starting to incorporate some more recent C++ features that can degrade nicely through the use of macros to compilers that don't support them (such as nullptr, strong enum classes, and other things I forget). Given that we support a fairly varied range of compilers (consider that we build the same code across Windows, Linux, Mac [recently dropped support for Apple's gcc], and Android [fun times there]), we often have to be conservative in what we accept. We also have very little STL usage in the main codebase, so if you feel like that's going to totally turn you off writing code for us... be forewarned?

 |Here's example of the kind of complexity we face:  With traditional refcounting, one problem you encounter is cycles.  That is, if A points to B and B points to A, then when nothing points to A or B any longer, we should delete both A and B, but they both have a refcount of 1 and don't get deleted.  Any refcounting scheme has to deal with this somehow.
 |But in Firefox, we can have the situation where A is a refcounted C++ object and B is a JavaScript object.  JS objects are garbage collected.  So that means our C++ cycle-detection code and our JS garbage collector are inexorably tied together.
 |Oh, and a garbage/cycle collection event needs to run in no more than 20ms or so.  Have fun.  :)
[There's a lot of really zealous people out there who act as crusaders for their browser of choice, constantly insulting other browsers and the teams that work hard on them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/120oif/we_are_mozilla_aua/c6rjzk2?context=5)|A lot of us who work on Web Standards have to work with developers working on other browsers, since many a time, it's their spec that we're implementing or vice versa or some general discussion on things like ES6 etc. We don't have any hostility towards them and quite a lot of time, the interaction is very healthy. We collaborated recently with technical writers from a lot of companies to come up with this awesome site on documentation : [Link to www.webplatform.org](http://www.webplatform.org) . It could never have happened withouth good interaction.
[In my mind, however, I like to imagine that the Firefox/Chrome/IE/Opera/Safari/etc. dev teams get along pretty well with each other even if they disagree on development approaches. Is this generally the case or is there actually an attitude of hostility with other browser teams? Or do you not interact with other browser teams enough to have strong opinions of them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/120oif/we_are_mozilla_aua/c6rjzk2?context=5)|Mozilla aims to make the Web more open and better for the user and we don't just aim to make the other browsers feel bad or just aim at getting our browser share high.
[How do you feel about Brendan Eich's donation to California Prop 8 in Mozilla's name?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/120oif/we_are_mozilla_aua/c6rk1bs?context=5)|Let me clarify something first: he didn't donate to Proposition 8 in Mozilla name. But if your donation exceeds a certain amount, you /have/ to indicate your employer too.  Now, Mozilla is a really huge community. Diversity plays a huge role. There are black people, white people, men, women, kids, Africans, Asians, Europeans, Muslims, Christians, straight and gay people. Luckily, there’s no discrimination going on. All members are respecting each other, which is a very good thing. Of course you don't need to agree with every opinion, but in a community, you have to respect every member - even their opinions. And having your own opinion is important. In fact, it’s one of the main reasons why Mozilla and many other organizations are so successful. We promote choice. We don’t do things like the others do, we do it in a way in which we think about other people, because doing something without keeping other people in your mind would be egoistic. Mozilla is definitely one of the best communities ever. The members are very accepting and understanding and a single opinion or donation can never represent the whole Mozilla community.

The three major problems right now are: Plug-in support, accessibility support and we're not sure what to do if users have both 32-bit and 64-bit Firefox installed. But anyway, stay tuned and check [this page](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Features/Desktop/64bit_Firefox_Windows_7) once in a while to get to know about the latest status. :) Thanks for using Firefox!
[Why is your codebase in C++? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/120oif/we_are_mozilla_aua/c6rlrdx?context=5)|We use a bunch of languages in our code base. A detailed analysis is here : [Link to www.ohloh.net](https://www.ohloh.net/p/firefox/analyses/latest/languages_summary)
 |We use C++ because it's popular and many developers know it. Oh, and it works on all operating systems we support. :-)
 |As mentioned by sawrubh, the codebase is not only in C++.
 |However, indeed, the backbone of the Mozilla Platform is written in C++. This language was chosen for the following reasons: - when Mozilla was started, it was available and well-tested on all the platforms we targeted at the time; - it interacts smoothly with C, which is pretty much a requirement for all the low-level tasks we need to handle on just about every platform; - it can be customized to do just about everything; - it is fast.
 |However, since the start of the project, a new language has appeared that: - is available and well-tested on all platforms targeted by Mozilla; - is able to interact well with C; - can be customized to do most things; - is fast enough.
 |Interestingly enough, this language is called JavaScript and it is already part of the Mozilla Platform. So, as we maintain the code, whenever we realize that some component would be better implemented in JavaScript rather than in C++, we port this code.
 |Also, we are currently experimenting with a new language called Rust, a system-oriented. If, as we hope, Rust proves to be a better C++ than C++, we will end up progressively migrating part of the C++ code to Rust.

I'm graduating in December of this year with a degree in Computer Science (B.S) and have been working as a paid intern for a government agency. My contract has been extended to continue working for them, but due to hiring freezes, only at my current intern wage and with the same ""intern"" title. 

I have a couple of questions regarding the search for job opportunities.  

It seems the area I live in doesn't have very many opportunities in the field of software development. Recently, I've been looking at a lot of county jobs and I'm having trouble understanding whether or not I should even attempt to apply for them.

For instance, one listing says ""Programmer Analyst I"", so I assume the ""I"" makes it an entry level job, then I read further and see that they want two years worth of related experience, which I don't have. On top of that they post things like ""the ideal candidate will have 5 years experience in..."", basically invalidating even their two year requirement.

Anyway, here are my questions:

1. If all jobs I've stumbled across have similar time requirements, how do I find an entry level one, or should I just apply to these anyway?

2. I've looked on DICE and LinkedIn and basically everything I see has basically the same requirements for these level one positions, is there any place out there designed specifically for entry level positions.

Thanks for you help!"

Of course, they're not the ones who don't know where they're going to live next semester. 

Anyway, I am a university student currently studying abroad. Last semester, after a bit of a struggle to find housing, I finally found a spot in one of the better on-campus apartments. Since I've lived in a ""normal"" dorm for the past few years (i.e., one with a large communal bathroom and no kitchen), I was really looking forward to one of the biggest perks of being an upperclassman -- apartment life.

No longer would I be condemned to buy overpriced, crap food from the cafeteria; instead, I would have kitchen access, which would allow me to cook my own food. It would be cheaper, healthier, and, of course, more delicious.

This girl informed me last spring that she would be studying abroad during the spring semester, so she needed someone to fill her spot. Naturally, I agreed.

Now, in freaking October, she tells me she doesn't want to study abroad anymore, and that I'll have a to find housing elsewhere. THANKS A LOT BITCH. 

She apparently got some internship at the UN, which is ""the opportunity of a lifetime"" as she posts on Facebook fifteen thousand times a day. The worst part is that my university is eating it all up. They don't realize that this girl, though hard-working and socially gifted, is a jerk. Also, I'll most likely be living in some old, underclassman dorm next semester while she gets to live in a nice apartment. 

Next time I make a housing agreement, I am making people sign an agreement in blood. Or something.

Already did an edit for repeating two words.)"

The majority of my friends have all been offered positions or after a few days of pounding the pavement have found some kind of opportunity. I don't understand the disconnect beween the masses of college graduates unemployed and the diificulty obtaining jobs. Is our generation lazy, incompetent, or feel entitled to jobs? 

Last summer, while I was looking for a summer job I walked into a Brazilian restaurant and asked to see the manager. He interviewed and hired me on the spot (first job ever) and trained me to be a waiter. I was making almost 18 an hour in tips, sometimes more. It was my first job and job interview. On the other hand I see redditors complaining about even getting entry level food service jobs. 

Today on a whim I decided to attend an oil company recruiting presentation at my university. I walked in confident into a room full of graduate students, the majority foreign, while I was only a sophomore. I began talking to the chief geologist and a geophysicist and after an hour they took me out to the bar. I was playing pool, conversing, and sharing drinks with the recruitment staff for five hours while I learned more about the industry. When I was leaving they told me to email them and they would set me up for a summer internship that paid 26/hour doing some geological mapping and modeling (masters students get 40+ an hour). I beat out more than ten foreign graduate students who knew infinitely more about the subject than I did.

If you are sociable, can hold a conversation, and just network why is it so hard to find a job?

122eto,34,2012-10-25,"37 years old, surprise pregnancy, a little (a lot) freaked out. ",MrsAnthropy,Mommit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/122eto/37_years_old_surprise_pregnancy_a_little_a_lot/,"Hi, ladies. Bear with me here. My mind is all over the place.

So I've spent the past few years under the (apparently mistaken) impression that I would not be able to get pregnant again. I have a variety of issues with my ladyparts which, at this point don't really matter because I am now 5 weeks pregnant. I have an appointment with an OB November 9th. My husband has already offered to have a vasectomy. He and my daughter want another baby. I was on the fence (pregnancy was difficult for me), but since I didn't think it was possible, I had pretty much accepted that and was ready to move on with my career and focus on our family of three being happy, healthy, and probably traveling a lot.

There are multiple other situations complicating my feelings about this pregnancy. One is that I have miscarried at least a couple of times since having my daughter over three years ago, so of course I worry about that. But I did not miss a period by much in the past. A pregnancy that I lost in January was confirmed through a biopsy I had a few months ago. I kind of ""felt"" that I was pregnant, but had not gotten a positive pregnancy test.

Second is that I'm currently finishing graduate school. I would graduate in the beginning of June, and my due date would be June 30th. My plan was to adjunct at a couple of colleges while I worked my way into a full-time faculty position. With those benefits, my husband could go back to school and get his master's degree. I don't know what the possibility of that is now, because someone will need to be with the baby once it's born (assuming all goes well), and at this point, we can't afford for either of us to stay home. 

Our three-year-old daughter is in preschool right now while I complete teaching internships and we can't afford it. We're broke, broke, broke. Robbing Peter to pay Paul and all that jazz. We don't qualify for assistance because my internship and level of education are not considering ""necessary."" 
We live in a big, expensive city with progressive people. Our family lives in a small, affordable city with conservative values. I like raising my daughter in a place with so many opportunities and such great public transportation. If we moved back ""home"" for help from family (and for our dollars to stretch farther), I would feel like we're giving up quite a bit on culture and opportunities for everyone. But we know no one here. All my schoolmates are ten years younger than me, single, no kids. 

So, another thing I worry about is applying for ""real"" jobs (in either city) when I'm obviously pregnant and then getting turned down as a result. I'm also concerned about the upcoming holidays. I am very, very short and, as with my last pregnancy, am beginning to show already. There's no way I'll be able to hide it when I'm trying to apply for jobs, and I'm not sure I will be able to keep it under wraps before the first trimester is over. 

I keep saying ""if all goes well,"" because, you know, I'm 37 years old, so to add another layer to my quiet panic is the potential that something could come up in tests. 

God. I am kind of a mess right now. Sorry about all of this. I guess I'm just asking for general advice, suggestions, good vibes, whatever anyone wants to share. I'm scared and worried. Thanks, ladies. 

**Edit** Thanks to everyone for your kind words and suggestions. I've been busy at work, but it's been nice to occasionally check reddit and see a pleasant message from someone throughout the day. I will crosspost to /r/babybumps!"
122e8c,0,2012-10-25,We all miss hockey. This lockout is killing me on the inside. Here's my story.,IMissHockey,hockey,https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/122e8c/we_all_miss_hockey_this_lockout_is_killing_me_on/,"I know we all dearly miss hockey with this crappy lockout going on. Yeah, there's KHL on TV, but it's not the same as watching your favorite team.  

I didn't experience the '04-'05 lockout because I wasn't a hockey fan. As a matter of fact, I thought it was a stupid sport, for no reason other than being an ignorant high school freshman who wasn't ever even exposed to hockey.  

Queue junior year of high school. My friends and I were looking for something to do. Our one friend, a transplant from a different city, suggested going to an NHL game. He was a huge fan of a different team than the local one, but hockey is hockey. A few other friends were varying degrees of hockey fans, from pretty big to not at all. I decided to go because what the hell, being social is good and I wanted to be a sports journalist at the time.  

The game was a LOT of fun. It was a 3-0 shutout for the home team. I quickly rooted against them because the original friend was a fan of one of their biggest rivals and getting heckled was *fun*. I learned the basic rules and really got into the game. I went to three more games that season and started to learn hockey.  

The following season, I started to follow hockey full time. Still my third favorite sport behind football and baseball, but it's great. I pick up NHL 08 to really learn the rules and more importantly the players. I watch as many games as possible between the three franchises in this market. I watch any out of market games - whether on TV, on NHL Center Ice previews, or even finding streams online for bigger matchups.  

I decided around this time, too, that I wanted to work in sports, not just cover it for a newspaper or whatever. I go to college and get on the proper path to work in sports. My hockey fandom grows - - I buy a few jerseys, I go to more games, I go to a playoff game, and so on. Baseball is am afterthought at this point. Football is still number one, but dammit hockey is awesome.  

At the end of my junior year of college, I need to seriously start having internships in sports. As it happens, the networking attempts I made have paid off, and I intern with the team that I originally saw in person, one of my least favorite teams in the sport.  

I intern with them for almost a solid year, from May 2011 to October 2011 and again from January 2012 to June 2012. It was singlehandedly the greatest experience of my life. I eat, sleep, and breathe hockey. I intern there 40-60 hours a week, for free, depending on the team's schedule. I meet the GM, the owner, a few players, and most importantly, everyone who works on the business side of things. Marketing. Ticket sales. Public relations. Arena operations. Community relations. And so on. These people are absolute die hards, doing what they love for long hours and comparatively low pay. I want to do the same. I'm pretty much rooting for two teams at this point, the team I'm interning for and their biggest rival. I know. It doesn't make sense. But whatever. It's hockey. For the second round of my internship, I immersed myself so deeply in hockey.  

It's my favorite sport. It's all I can think about. There's zero comparison. It's the best sport on TV, in person, and on the radio. Ok, maybe not radio. But other sports cannot compare to this. At all.  

1. The fans - hockey has some of the absolute best fans. Most dedicated. Most crazy. Most devout. The atmosphere at an NHL regular season game, let alone a playoff game, is incredible. 

2. The playoffs - I'm never more excited, more anxious, and more... complete? than I am during the NHL playoffs. I live and die with every play on the ice. And overtime? Forget about it. It could be two teams I'm totally neutral towards and my anxiety is ramped up. 

3. The game itself - wow was I ever an idiot as a freshman in high school. Hockey players are far and away the best athletes in professional sports. The feats they have on the ice are incredible. It's so physically demanding, and it's so tough to play, but dammit are they good and dedicated. 

4. The players - As I said, they're incredible athletes. But, beyond that, they're some of the most incredible people. They're not assholes, or at least few are. There are so many genuinely good people. They care about the fans and about the game. They keep things in perspective.  

I could go on and on and on about this. I don't know how to even handle this lockout. I'm lost. I feel depressed thinking about it. I want hockey. I need hockey. I need it. It took literally 1.5 days into my first job out of college (non-hockey, non-sports) to realize how badly I need hockey. There is nothing, NOTHING, that compares to the great sport of hockey."

Looking for a Master Thesis Internship in Madrid Jan-June 2013 in Industrial Management",[deleted],Madrid,https://www.reddit.com/r/Madrid/comments/12238x/looking_for_a_master_thesis_internship_in_madrid/,"I am currenly researching opportunities for my master thesis internship in Madrid from January to June 2013. As part of an international study program (Polimi, KTH and UPM) and industrial management graduate student of Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, my fields of interest are industrial projects, supply chain management, logistics and financial control. Furthermore, topics in the area of organizational leadership and organizational learning would be interesting.

I would be thankful for any advice on where to apply or a recommendation in case of a vacancy for an internship.

If anybody has leads or a personal contact, that is looking for a motivated and well educated, international intern, please let me know!

1221z7,2,2012-10-25,A list of my sins. What to do? ,oorp,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/1221z7/a_list_of_my_sins_what_to_do/,"•	Laziness. 

•	Never been accepted anywhere. Been rejected by three groups-professional, academic and social-after high school. 

•	Depression which is medically maintained. 

•	Lack of filter. I say inappropriate things at times. People that know me don’t mind, but casual acquaintances are offended. It’s hurt my professional and social life.  

•	Academics. I’ve never given a shit about it. I’m studying Philosophy, but made sure to have relevant work experience (security guard for government and journalism internships). I’m currently trying to get work at a national non-profit journalism organization. If I don’t get it, or a Customs job, I’m literally SOL. Thinking about employment stresses me out daily and I’m constantly hustling. I’ve got a portfolio, but that doesn’t pay me a salary. 

•	I’m lazy. In uni, I don’t do my homework, but I pay attention in class. When It comes to exams, or tests, I study my ass off and try to do well. Since I can write, my essays are usually well received and I scrape by with a B. My Institutional GPA is 2.8 on a 4.5 scale. Not great.

•	I probably have a porn/internet addiction. By addiction I use porn and Reddit as distractions when I should be doing something else. No, I’m not a neck beard virgin. That said, not being a virgin means absolutely nothing. 

•	The nature of my work and school forces me to use the computer, so I can’t completely toss it. 

•	I sit in my bed for most of the day propped against the wall with pillows. Here I lie with my laptop across my lap. 16hrs a day if I’m not doing anything. 

•	I do have friends and I’m driven with things I care about (Journalism). Over the summer I was elsewhere for an internship. I wasn’t living at home and I was independent. I loved it and had a great time.  I try to help out with the chores at home, but I could do more. I hate living at home, I feel emasculated and I desperately want to be independent again. It’s just depressing being here. I love being on my own and doing my own thing. I’m literally counting down the months when I graduate and I can be gone. However, I need to get a job before graduation so I can actually afford to do so. 

•	No I don’t want a McJob. I actually want something decent. Nobody has asked me for my GPA yet. Everyone cares about my portfolio and work experience. Sigh, this could be another lie I’m telling myself.

My day would consist of preparing an array of meals (most including chopped rat, mouse, quail etc.), cleaning out bear pens and deer runs, exercising and catching/handling birds of prey, and a lot of cleaning/manual labor around the center. I worked alongside rehabilitation and veterinarian interns from around the country, as well as from around the world. 

Since it formed in 1982, the Wildlife Center has treated more than 47,000 wild animals, representing 200 species of native birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. Working at the Wildlife Center was a dream of mine, and the experience I gained from this will last a lifetime. I hope to continue in this field of work and give these animals another shot at life.

I'm a 26/F Canadian and my boyfriend is 22/M American.

To start of let me tell you about  our background. We're both gamers. We met at an MMO-RPG game back in 2009. We've been friends since, we helped each other through issues in life like school, weight, work and so on. I think we have a pretty good relationship.

He came to visit me and I got him a part time job while he's visiting me to keep him occupied while I'm doing my internship. I used to work at this workplace too and I still go around there to help once in a while. 

Around the end of September, he started getting sneaky with his phone, he usually just lets me play apps on it and doesn't hide himself. I got suspicious, then he comes home late one night and tells me he was out with a 17/F from work. This happens again a week later. I was miffed and uncomfortable already as he used to tell me everything then just nothing now. He gets annoyed easily too.

One night we're out downtown with a friend, 17/F joins us late at friend's place. I know she knows that he and I are together, people know at work and my friend told her too. When she comes over, she only pays attention to him, flirts with him and is touchy. Granted Ive also had a bit of alcohol that night, I was upset. I got mad at him and her and walked out. 

I saw texts between them too that are flirty, provocative and teasing. I got mad at him for doing it. I was crying at this point and asked him to be honest with me, as his bestfriend, I wouldn't stand in the way of something he wants. But he stayed.. He's still flirting with her.. She's still flirting back even after she told me they were just friends and nothing would happen.

What should I do? Do I just leave him? He lies all the time, I can spot the lies, i think. But what about the girl?  I'm at the end of my patience and wits. 

TLDR: 22/m flirts despite of 26/f hurt feelings."

121ihq,1,2012-10-24,I'm completely screwed,LeSoft,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/121ihq/im_completely_screwed/,"I cannot get serious employment *anywhere* because I'm in that happy fucking place of being overqualified (and thus declined) for shitty jobs, but not getting any responses from the jobs I want. I have resorted to applying to shitty retail positions for seasonal work because I know they're just looking for warm bodies.

I am okay with the major I picked: Broadcasting. I did well in the classes and made some decent projects happen that received good feedback. In short, I have a solid portfolio. The problem is that everyone wants a mindblowing portfolio - like you aren't good enough to work in an industry unless you're the next savant ready to make headlines. The point is I can do the work for the position, and I've proven that with portfolio work and experience (internships + paid position), with my work appraised by industry professionals and audience feedback.

I chose this field because I knew several people in the industry already, and I was good at the technical aspects of directing and production. Unfortunately, the people I knew weren't able to give me a job after I had graduated. This major would have been a mistake if I had not known anyone, but I took a calculated and informed risk. It so happens that it failed.

This is compounded by the fact that I live in a terrible part of the US and few employers are open to relocation candidates. The job market is very small for my major here (essentially all of the TV/Radio news stations), and I've exhausted all current possibilities. At this point, I'm waiting for some terrible accident to disable or kill someone just so the position becomes free and I can get a paycheck. Morbid, eh?

So, unfortunately I say, fuck this field. Despite knowing people in the industry and having work to show, it still led to nothing. Where does that leave me? In debt with cheap booze, but still ""living"" while mooching off of my parents' success (trust me, I don't like doing it).

...

My first degree was paid for. I'm fucking lucky to have that and I know it, but I'm still no better off than if I had not gone to college (perhaps worse off, if you consider the over qualification filter to most low-end jobs).

I *could* go back, but I've already specialized in the field that I knew best. At best, I would be turning a secondary interest into a degree, and rolling the dice again if I could find a job in that field after graduation. Even then, the most job-successful degrees aren't usually degrees that interest me (engineering, comp sci, finance, healthcare, etc). I'm not strictly an artist, but I'm not strictly technical, either, but I'm pretty good at both, but unfortunately there is apparently fuck-all job prospects for someone who's a full time artist or in between.

Maybe I should just start a community for disgruntled graduates and live off of page views and black hat SEO.

121e2b,261,2012-10-24,One Year Report,ArdentDrive,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/121e2b/one_year_report/,"It’s been a year since I masturbated.

Reflecting on the past year has put much into perspective. Thanks to occasional journal entries and posts to this forum, I can see both my growth and my shortcomings, my aspirations and my letdowns. Most importantly, this type of perspective gives me intuition into what type of goals I should set for the future and how to conduct myself to achieve them.

I’m writing here today to share with you what I've gotten out of it so far, what I have not gotten out of it, and what my experience-adjusted goals for the future are. 

**One Year Ago**

To give you an idea of my progress, I’ll summarize where I started.

I cut out masturbation a year ago at age 22. I was a college dropout living at my parents’ house, I was getting paid poorly for some part-time remote web consulting jobs, I was in a draining relationship with a needy girl, and I felt a general sense of boredom and lacking. I’d get off to Internet porn 4 to 7 times a week, and have sex about half as often. In bed, I’d sometimes go limp during and have to stop. I didn't really think it was an issue because it didn't happen all the time.

I joined NoFap not because I thought my porn habits were a problem, but because I felt directionless, stagnant, and as if I were becoming complacent with my mediocre situation. I knew NoFap wouldn't be a magic bullet when I started, but it felt like a “first step.” I just needed some direction to move in, to see where I could go from there. Anything was better than wasting my early twenties in my parents’ house with an unstable job and an unstable girl.

**What I've Done**

Briefly and chronologically:

* I left the consulting gigs and got a real internship.
* I moved out of my parents’ to the city.
* I dumped the needy girl and started playing the field.
* I re-applied to college and was accepted.
* I met a smart hottie and started dating her.
* My internship offered me a full-time job.
* I turned down the job offer to go back to college, where I am now to finish my undergrad.

I don't attribute these events to abstaining from masturbation. NoFap helped catalyze them though -- especially the women-related ones. Here’s a deeper look.


**General Physiological Changes**

The best way I can describe what I've given myself by not fapping is a mild discomfort in my stomach and chest (like “butterflies”). It grows when I’m not accomplishing things, expressing myself, exerting my body and mind, being social, or leading. Sorry if this sounds a little eastern.

I’d previously get this feeling only rarely, and usually when I felt threatened or embarrassed. I thought it was a bad feeling. I’d suppress it, thinking I was taking the “high road.” I'm convinced that my numbness from a year ago was largely due to my automatic suppression of this feeling. 

Not jacking it made that feeling so strong I couldn't possibly suppress it all with my mind. So I followed advice I read on this subreddit: I (clumsily) ran, did push-ups, and focused on hobbies. I started making music again, writing, and throwing myself out there at parties more.

Somewhere along the line I realized all that is the point. Suppressing that light stomach-chest feeling feels like fear. Channeling that feeling into whatever I choose is exciting, empowering, and gives me focus.

**Vocal Changes**

There are a lot of excitable guys in this subreddit claiming miracles. But the change in voice is real.

Not only is my voice a little deeper, I wield it with more articulation and precision. Listening to and practicing some of the material in Roger Love's Vocal Power helped. I have less stress and tension in my body, so my vocal chords are more relaxed and able to speak with ease.

I've been putting my voice to use recently. I was asked to announce a large annual regatta, with 3000+ attendees. I did, and it led to plenty of compliments and an offer to announce an even larger one. I'd like to develop my voice and public speaking more. I'm thinking about joining my local chapter of Toastmasters International to do so. This is something I probably wouldn't be pursuing if NoFap hadn't let me see this skill I have.

**Creativity and Spontaneity**

I picked my music back up, and have been working on an album due out whenever I feel like it. I started writing a blog about my university that’s gaining popularity (and authors) on campus.

I second-guess myself less. I've found my first thought is usually right. And when it's wrong, I can correct myself with grace. One trick I've been actively practicing is just saying a thought out loud as soon as I have it. No thinking about saying it, deciding if I’m going to say it, or waiting for the moment to say it. This might be contrary to the popular advice “think before you speak”, but when I do it, I often find people agreeing with me. Maybe that advice is just for those prone to poor wording.

**Sex**

In my [Six Month Report](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/t3pbi/6_month_report), I mentioned that my problem of occasionally going to half-mast had decreased from once a week to once a month or so. Now, I can say that I never have this problem.

I have sex only with my girlfriend, and it’s still exciting. I've pushed her for a threesome, which she’s tentatively agreed to. She understandably has reservations, which I hope to assuage. I probably never would have even asked if I were still watching porn.

And just to cover all the bases, what I mentioned 6 months ago holds true: my stamina, passion, ability, and virility in bed have increased tenfold since starting this journey.

**Women**

My buddy and I were drinking some beers and cooking some t-bones. At a silence, I told him “I'm jealous of you, man.”

“Why's that?” he asked.

“Because you're single. You can have sex with any girl you can charm and seduce. We're at college, and all the benefits of bachelorhood are yours.”

“Yeah, but I’m jealous of you” he responded. “You have a smoking hot girl with an amazing personality who you can bang any time you want, without working for it.”

After a moment's contemplation, we clinked our bottles and moved on to something else.

That conversation has probably played out millions of times, but it's a perfect anecdote for my dilemma. Sure, my girlfriend has an amazing personality. She’s in love with me. She’s got my back and is always there when I’m down (or otherwise). Plus, my buddy wasn't lying about her looks. I got her with energy and drive that NoFap helped provide me.

Maybe it’s a grass-is-always-greener situation. But I miss the titillation of meeting new girls and seducing them that I was having closer to the beginning of NoFap. So much that I flirt with other girls as much as I can without hurting my girlfriend or making her jealous. It’s still not the same though. Believe it or not, I actually miss the surge of having no sexual release for four or more days.

I feel like I'll have to make a decision before too long: I'll either end things with this amazing girl because I’m young and desperately want to feel the intensity of being a completely free man; Or I'll make a bigger commitment to her, have a stable loving grounding in my life, and always wonder if I settled.

NoFap has helped keep my relationship vibrant, but it has also kept me looking at other options.

**Men**

I've noticed for the first time other guys looking up to me and watching what I do for guidance. It’s led me to a leadership role on my sports team at college. It’s extra pressure, but instigating camaraderie in others in worth it. I’m more outwardly focused, which projects confidence. I find it easier to relate to other guys and build friendships. It’s just a matter of willingness to do so, which I have more of now.

**The Future**

NoFap is here to stay. Porn and masturbation are out. I like who I am now a lot better than who I was a year ago. I want to continue to improve myself in all aspect of my life.

I didn't meet all the goals I laid out for myself after starting NoFap.

I didn't “become a force” in my company during my internship, but I left a good impression and accomplished several large projects.

I didn't “make the most of city living,” but I moved to the city, explored some nightlife, and made some friends.

I didn't build the huge entourage I had envisioned, but I expanded my social circle and made connections.

I didn't achieve a zen-like clear mind, but I'm generally more purposeful and decisive.

In another year, I hope look back on my personal growth and again see obvious improvements. NoFap is clearly part of a balanced and accomplished life.

I may not have become the impregnable force I had hoped for, but I've improved myself gradually and distinctly in so many ways.

Here’s to always doing.

My parents divorced right after his birth( a year and seven days after my birth!) i have a half sister as a result of an affair(my sperm donor's). i have another half sister(the product of my dad remarrying) and another half sister on the way now(mom cheated on my amazing stepdad and is preggo) when it was just my mother and i, she never did or said anything unusual to me that i remember. i was often lkeft with random babysitters so she could go ""be young"". never had health insurance or anything and men were in and out of my life quite frequently. my biodad beat his wives and i saw it but it never happened to me. my mother kinda ignored me and would randomly say things to me like ""burden"" ""too much"" ""ungratefful"" etc. i was very small and only tried harder to help out. we were very poor and lived in section 8 housing(welfare homes) i never had new school clothes or anything but that didn't matter because i was happy just being outside or talking to my dolls and furniture. when mom married my step dad it was the greatest thing. she started to notice me gaining weight and picked at me for being fat(i wasn't actually fat) but my stepdad stood up for me. my biodad also has a bunch of random kids that he seeded and never took care of. so anyways.. my stepdad jason is a great guy. slowly but surely he started noticing my mom saying things that were weird to me. personal injuries and such. she left him and ended up with ray. ray called me sexy at 12. he pinched me, pulled my hair, hit me, grounded me, and eventually went on to beat her. she never listened to any of the things i told her about him until he finally hit her. then she went back to jason. things were ok until we moved. she started doing her graduate work at a pretty good university. then the real trouble started. she would tell my friends' moms that they were on drugs, thus alienating me from my peers. she smoked weed but grounded me for not making my bed. she hit me kicked me whipped me and all that lovely stuff. she would tell everyone else that i hated her because i was a bad kid, or that i wouldn't listen to her. i told her i was sexually assaulted and she asked me how i could have let that happen. i got into a car wreck(i was a passenger and the only one hurtin a drunk driving wreck) and the whole time we were at the hospital in icu (2 mnonths) i couldnt eat and she would bring delicious food in and eat it in front of me. she complained about having to be in memphis for so long, and what was i going to do about the immense doctor bills that were to come. i was fifteen. my jaw was wired shut and she had plans for xmas dinner so she didnt want me there i guess. she sent me for a visit with bio dad. after telling me how much i looked like my mom and acted like her, he proceeded to get really drunk on xmas eve and hit me in my broken wired shut jaw. i ran into my baby half sister's room, locked the door, and held her sooo close until his wife came home and sent him away. i called my mom and she said she was entertaining guests and couldnt come get me. 2 teeth were broken in the back(molars) and she told me we didnt have money for it. however she did have money to rent a house from the man she was cheating on jason with at the time. i knew and she told me if i said anything she would leave me and jason. at seventeen i was a huge party kid, because the everyday fighting beatings and mental/verbal abuse sucked. drugs were my answer. there was one day i hid from her and she came running through the house and picked me up off my floor by my upper arms and asked me what the fuck was wrong with me. i had been crying because of usual boy girl breakup stuff. she slapped me until i stopped crying and told me she wished she could just leave us or just me. i decided then to move out. i left, finished high school and applied to college. little did i know that she got my vanderbilt acceptance letter in the mail and threw it away. so i went to another super shitty school. i dropped out because i got the shit beat out of me by a boyfriend and was trapped and beaten for three days before i tricked him into going to a friend's house where my best guy friend was waiting for him. i moved back home only to discover the car that had been stolen from my house while i was in college was sitting in her driveway. she told me about the vandervbilt thing and the car thieving. she told me that because of having me at seventeen she didnt have a good chance. she asked me why i deserved a better chance than she had. i ended up moving back in with her and jason because my job fell through and i became broke. she charged me three hundred dollars a month to sleep in the living room. i had to buy my own things but i was just happy to have a chance to start over. i knew she was still cheating on jason. she told me i was a fucked up drughead(i was) and that she wouldn't take any of it. weed only. i said ok. she then kicked me out because i was cramping her space. i moved in with a friend and began paying bills. she told me that me and my druggie friends would get caught(no more drugs for me after i moved out mind you) so i was sober and she called the cops on me. so finally i had enough of her shit. then it happened. i got uninvited to xmas dinner this past year because she got caught by jason with one of her fuck buddies. a different fuck buddy told jason about the situation. she left jason and asked me to move in with her to help her pay bills. i said yes because i desparately needed her approval and i still wish she would love me.i moved in and found out she was pregnant. mny teeth started hurting from all the wreck damage and i asked her to help me pay for it or at least sign a loan with me so i could pay it myself. she said that she was done providing me with a security blanket(i have paid rent in my house since i began working at age fourteen). she said that i was an adult and if i wanted a hand out i should just go get pregnant. she told me that the sexual assault, beatings, car wreck and being born were my fault. i have inconveinenced her for too long and now its time to move on. iam now over 200,000 dollars in debt because she never took care of the wreck insurance things. i am 21 now. this is six years later and she says that because she didnt handle it then i have to deal with it now. she took out a loan for my physical and mental therapy sessions in my name when i was fifteen and thats another 4000. my dental work lefftover from the wreck is another 5600. so now i am young, poor and deeply in debt at the very beginning of my adult life. she seems to be jealous of my opportunities and every time something hapens(good or bad) she somehow uses it to exploit me. she has never told me she loved me, never initiated hugs or kisses. just so cold and unfeeling. i dunno if i mentioned it but i am a rapid cycling bipolar type 2 sufferer and all the drugs i did to make me feel better also made me kinda crazy. mom said i don't need medication because it doesn't work.
 i am scared of losing my bipolar because the mania helps me work and be creative. i work 20 hours everyday at two jobs and only make 80 buck every two weeks because i am in this unpaid internship. poverty sucks when you have no one to help around you
i just wish i had a family that calle or gave a shit or did anything besides birth me abuse me and abandon me.
i wish i could scream loud enough for them to hear"

*It was an image, an illusion of myself.*

I rode the train and bus home now, unable to keep the past and the present from blending together. The roads could become quite the callous place when you didn't know which cars are really there, and which cars were there in some moment before.

*Another me. Three mes. A dozen. Fifty. A hundred, even. All in one space, all going about their day; a different day in different times, in different hours.*

It wouldn't happen if I didn't know the route. You can't remember something that never happened. The only way to live safely was to keep every day new, fresh. To not be trapped in a place where my memories ran rampant in my mind. To start forming new memories instead of trying to live comfortably.

*There I was chatting up a girl who had moved to a different firm. In another instance, I was talking to a former boss who had passed away; the intern who was brutally murdered; the manager who was fired for his inadequacy. All in the same space, speaking in a tangled mess of voices and gestures. My reactions varied as well, it was a horrible sight.*

I would wake up, and see myself wake up. Once, twice, three times, four. Ten. Each time, I wondered if I was still dreaming, never sure when I had actually gotten out of bed. I found that doing something new always helped me snap back into reality: a cup of water this morning, juice another-fuck, I got so desperate I even drank alcohol one morning because the memories were starting to converge again. Anything to get myself out of the loop.

*He wants you to rally the people.*

Rallying...not the kind of rallying a team gets before a sport. The type of rallying a squad gets before a war. It was perfect, so they had assured me. Each person in this city: all their secrets and hopes and dreams were all available in some shape or another. Interviews. Diaries. Vlogs. All these people, normal and regular: unremarkable and naive. I would approach all of them as a friend, and they would have no manner of doubting me as I knew so much about them. About this event and that milestone: the breakup, the promotion, the divorce, the death in the family. I worked in a law firm, but the boss-man had made arrangements for me. No one was to see or open the documents I was to ""work on"", and in return, people got more hours for their vacations. It seems silly, but it worked.

For two years, I read accounts of peoples lives for hours on end. The new home, the college-bound princess, the homeless-bound man. All their grief, all their sorrow, their joy, their happiness; this man had somehow managed to acquire it all and compose it in a journal-like book for me to read and dissect. What were their fears? Their aspirations? Their struggles and challenges in their lives? I was to be a savior, a messiah amongst the masses-ready to save them from the terrors of everyday life and the meaninglessness their lives had acquired in the recent years.

I took a taxi home this time. It was one of the few options remaining. His name was Parsa: a 32 year old Indian man from Mombasa, who had moved to the states so he could start saving up to bring his wife and kids away from his tyrannical family back at home. His wife, Nimrita, was 29 and of a different *jati*-some kind of caste subsystem if I interpreted right. They had two children: a baby girl named Jagdeep and an older boy named Divya. We drove to my home in perfect silence, all this had been from the file.

I didn't realize how much I had actually remembered from the accounts. I didn't know I paid so much attention to detail in general. Once I knew the man's name, I felt like he was a true friend. Like we had been this close for years. I wondered why this never happened with any of the others when I asked or figured out their names. ""Maybe because..."" I preferred not to say it. I could tell the man was depressed: clearly, this was not working out well, he must be making a small sum, not nearly enough to fetch his family from back home. ""It isn't going to become any easier friend"", I told him as I left the car and walked inside. He stayed parked in my driveway for a few minutes before he left."

1253ip,0,2012-10-26,[m] My story of going down the spiral into experimentation....and losing it all ,[deleted],gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/1253ip/m_my_story_of_going_down_the_spiral_into/,"While I love a good sex story, I felt the need to tell my own. The sidebar said stories can be sexy, funny, or whatever. I'm afraid this fits the ""whatever"" category.....not a throwaway account because-everyone important to me knows anyway.

My story began by just sneaking to look at Dad’s “books.” I remember him saying he read them for the articles (one time citing the hostage situation as to why he was reading them; I didn’t realize Penthouse or Playboy had first hand journalism in the Hostage situation and even as a kid-I didn't buy that). At times, I would catch a glimpse, but more often than not, he would berate me if I wanted to see them. I began to view this as “privileged” access. Why could Dad do this, and I couldn’t? What was he hiding? Why was he hiding it? Why would he do it right in front of me (view this material) and not share it with me? I recall him putting a pictorial type of page record that came as a bonus from his magazine once and put it on the record player and put me to bed for a nap. I don’t know what was on it, but Mom wasn’t home, I do know that much. And he wanted me out of the picture to listen to whatever was on it. I don’t recall where my sister was during this time, perhaps with my mother. I found one of his books under the couch mattress and left it there to revisit in the middle of the night. I remember a few nights sneaking out there to visit this particular magazine. Curiosity was clearly what drove me to it. I had to be 6 or so. I do not recall getting aroused, but I do recall it driving my curiosity further and further into wondering what was going on in this pictures.

My Father was into Racing, Rock and Roll, and Fishing. So, I was too. I recall a couple fishing trips and a couple trips to a local racetrack and I remember him giving me my first Hot Rod magazine. As you may or may not know, these were not “dirty” magazines per say, but these were filled with scantily or seductively clad women positioned on or near the cars. I don’t recall actually “thinking” these exact words but I somehow viewed this as my first “magazine”—Dad let me have one of my own now. One particular picture was not even of a scantily clad woman. She had a black dress on with a slit up the leg and she had high black boots. She was positioned next to a Coupe of some kind. Her legs and the boots somehow turned me on—it was enticing to see her teasing nature and just a bit of bare skin on her thigh to show the adventure side (and I was 7 or 8). I was laying on my stomach on my bed looking at this particular picture and noticed as I moved I was enjoying the sensation it brought. I proceeded to do this until I had an orgasm (not yet producing any kind of fluid). This new experience was euphoric, and not knowing the nature of how bodies worked, I tried it immediately again. I thought “this will be my new secret world of pleasure-where I will go when I want.” I told myself I would do this every night all night long it felt so good. But I noticed after doing it, I wouldn’t want to right away again. The body had to recover and I was young of course. I formulated a fantasy around this time in my head of a woman who looked somewhat similar to this Hot Rod girl. I would call her “The Sexar” in my mind, not knowing what exactly that meant or anything. I pictured her in a room that seemed almost lab/dungeon like wearing the boots and seductive dress—after that the fantasy got foggy—Im not even sure I pictured any particular act of any kind—just pleasure coming from this person to me. Very metaphorical at this point because I didn’t actually know what sex was.

As the years would progress, masturbation had become a daily occurrence at bedtime. I would use it to prepare for sleep. Usually only during this time. I had sucked my thumb since birth and was still doing so at this age. Braces/orthodontics at age 12 would eliminate that. I hadn't viewed porn much but would whenever I had the chance. I just didn't have many chances. My folks divorced around this time and my practices evolved a bit from here.

I still masturbated frequently, but with new material as I got into my teen years. My mother was gone a lot (was a night waitress) and if I wasn't at my grandparents house I was being quite nosy looking for things in her room, wondering what I would find. Well, I struck gold.  I found some dildos and a black video tape. This video tape would reveal a dubbed porn movie. I would watch this with much intrigue and curiosity. This was the first time I had encountered homosexual sex between women.  Often I would masturbate, rewind it to the same place, and then hide it where I found it. As far as I know, she didn't know about this. Getting in to my teen years, masturbation to this new avenue (her video) would become the default if I could get it. If not, I would look at lingerie ads or think of what I had seen at bedtime and do it mentally.

I had very little contact with my Father during my teen years, and I let this absence fuel a lot of my anger, loneliness, and depression. When I did see him, I would be plagued with mixed emotions, not knowing exactly what to feel. I do remember a few times  I would try to steal from his porn or view it if possible and feel “entitled to do so” under the precedent that he was a shitty father. The least I could get was a decent porn magazine or video. I recall keeping a lot of bikini clad girls on my walls at this time—and being more bold about it. I had started trading porn pictures with a guy on my school bus and got caught looking at them by some girls on the bus. I was then brought in to the principals office and chastised with gentle but firm reminders. Id stopped caring how my mother thought (and she didn't voice much concern at all). She had walked in on me masturbating once I think and chastised me (my memory is foggy here) but it didn't stop me from continuing. I recall for a short time keeping pages and pictures inside a jar next to my bed, and some under my mattress. For some reason, I thought this was the magic place that parents never look. Now that I’m a parent, I know differently. I look back now and am almost certain Mom knew this stuff was there but never talked to me about it.

College kept a silent pattern of masturbating although not much use of pornography—only a few times did I sneak to rent certain “top shelf” movies from a local video store. Each time, like when I was younger, I would swear to never do it again and make an emotional vow to God to never do this again.

I experimented some with making out and “grinding” sessions with certain girlfriends (always having a girlfriend or girl I was hanging with) and even with oral a few times, but I did not like it and felt very uncomfortable doing it as I vowed to not have sex until I got with my wife. Most of my girlfriends didn't last long and usually it would end with me” trading up” to the next girl. Only a few times did they break up with me and if they did, I was happy about it to move on to the next fling. I recall turning at least 4 girls down when they asked me to penetrate them. I had not been to any bookstores, parlors or anything of the like except a strip club before college only a few times (2 or 3) and this was with some friends from high school.

The summer before my junior year of college, I lived in an apartment with a guy. During this time, I would be private about my masturbating but would use the phone for phone sex using my phone card. I ran up hundreds of dollars while masturbating and laying alone in my room, quickly hanging up after I had an orgasm, then feeling guilty about doing so. I recall one night burning with passion in my room wanting a woman so bad, I, even being a Christian man, spoke the words of asking the devil to provide a girl to me for my sexual needs at that moment then he could have my soul. I said “make a woman to please me right here and you can have me-I want to get laid so bad.” But no woman came, only vacant masturbatory fantasy and absence in my heart. I am a spiritual man, and often wonder what this actual conversation did to open the doors of evil in years to come.

One night at work, things changed. A woman came on to me at work. I was not attracted to this woman at all, but I knew she craved me like a piece of meat and for some reason, this tempted me. She would make flippant comments and make gestures of sexual nature in my eyesight. One night, she invited me to her house to get drunk. So I went. And I acted physically with her outside of intercourse but in sexual ways (fondling, making out etc). I felt guilty and shameful leaving her home telling her I would never be back. But I did go back, more than once. I can recall 3 or 4 more times of hooking up, these times for sex and quick exits happened each time (once with her giving me money). I thought to myself how I could make money in this way, but never pursued it after this). I felt shameful and disgusted by my actions.

I left on an internship, came back to finish college and got married. After my marriage, I was in a job that kept me in a private office for many many hours a day with no supervision. This new world of the internet opened doors I had never intended to open. Viewing and placing personal ads to see what would become of it. Viewing profiles, chatting with various women to get a deep emotional connection, all while my wife was trusting her husband was working hard to change the world. Within a year on the job, I had arranged a hook-up with one woman. I was told by her that she and her husband were swingers and that an open marriage was ok for them. She and I met in her hometown and she had a kid in the car seat in her car—I followed her back to her home and she put the kid down for a nap. We proceeded to her bedroom (pictures of her husband on the wall) and had sex. I did not have an orgasm but she did and I felt very guilty and dirty when I left.

124uyv,0,2012-10-26,"I want to travel after college instead of jumping right into the workforce, but I'm worried about disappointing my father. Advice? First post ever btw.",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/124uyv/i_want_to_travel_after_college_instead_of_jumping/,"Some background: My father could not afford college, and my mother went but never used her degree. (works for my father) My whole life my father has told me to work hard in school so I will get a great job, make good money, and not have to work everyday for my entire life like he does. He works extremely hard and does it all for the family. Currently i am 22 years old, a senior in college, and ready to graduate in August. 
   I have done very well in college thus far (president of the finance club, first and only student to take all offered tracks/classes in finance, chosen to compete in the cfa challenge, the finance tutor, and completed a great internship this summer) but i do not want to start working right away. I want to travel, see the world, meet new people, see new places. It would be ideal if i could find a job that would allow me to do so but that is not easy to come by.

    Plan- Work this summer, save, buy a plane ticket somewhere, and just start anew. Wherever i go i would work here and there, just enough to get me where I'm going. Don't care about the conditions I just want to experience the world. I only want to do this for a year or two then i would be fine coming back into reality and starting work.

    Problem- My parents expect me to start working right after graduation. Also, they are pretty old fashioned so taking time off to travel isn't exactly appealing to them. I kind of mentioned my idea one day and got scolded/ lectured. I understand they want the best for me but I feel like if i don't try and take this opportunity now I will never get the chance.

TL;RD: Parents want the best for me. Expect me to start working right after graduation. I want to take a year or two to travel instead. Should I risk disappointing them or start working and hope I will find another time to travel?

**Edit: Debt Situation/ Plan B- When I graduate I will own about $80,000 in student loans. I thought about this (majoring in finance) and Plan B would be to work for 2-3 years, pay off the debt, and then follow through with my plan.**

**Assume Plan B is now Plan A, carry on**

Edit: My family is Italian and extremely close. I was raised under the phrase ""family comes first"".

Edit: My degree will be in Finance with a triple concentration in Wealth Management, Financial Management, and Financial Services.

124txl,0,2012-10-26,I think reddit can help me reply to this email...,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/124txl/i_think_reddit_can_help_me_reply_to_this_email/,"Right wing family member sent this to me. I would like to send him a nice reply.

A lot is being said in the media about Mitt Romney not being ""likable"" or that he doesn't ""relate well"" to people.  Frankly, we struggled to understand why.So after much research, we have come up with a Top Ten List to explain this ""un-likability.""
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Top Ten Reasons To Dislike Mitt Romney:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 1. Drop-dead, collar-ad handsome with gracious, statesmanlike aura.Looks like every central casting's #1 choice for Commander-in-Chief.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 2. Been married to ONE woman his entire life, and has been faithful to her,including through her bouts with breast cancer and MS.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 3. No scandals or skeletons in his closet. (How boring is that?)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 4. Can't speak in a fake, southern, ""black preacher voice"" when necessary.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 5. Highly intelligent. Graduated cum laude from both Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School...and by the way, his academic records are NOT sealed.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 6. Doesn't smoke or drink alcohol, and has never done drugs, not even in the counter -culture age when he went to college. Too square for today's America?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 7. Represents an America of ""yesterday,"" where people believed in God, went to Church, didn't screw around, worked hard, and became a SUCCESS!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 8. Has a family of five great sons....and none of them have police records or are in drug rehab.But of course, they were raised by a stay-at-home mom, and that ""choice"" deserves America's scorn.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 9. Oh yes.....he's a MORMON. We need to be very afraid of that very strange religion that teaches its members to be clean-living, patriotic, fiscally conservative, charitable, self-reliant, and honest.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; 10. And one more point.....pundits say because of his wealth, he can't relate to ordinary Americans. I guess that's because he made that money HIMSELF.....as opposed to marrying it or inheriting it from Dad.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Apparently, he didn't understand that actually working at a job and earning your own money made you un-relatable to Americans. My goodness, it's a strange world, isn't it?

&gt; &gt; Michigan He was raised in Bloomfield Hills , Michigan He is Married
&gt; &gt; to Ann Romney since 1969; they have five children.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Education:
&gt; &gt; B. A. from Brigham Young University, J. D. and M.B.A. from Harvard
&gt; &gt; University
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Religion:
&gt; &gt; Mormon - The Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Working Background:
&gt; &gt; After high school, he spent 30 months in France as a Mormon missionary.
&gt; &gt; After going to both Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School simultaneously,he passed the Michigan bar exam, but never worked as an attorney.
&gt; &gt; In 1984, he co-founded Bain Capital a private equity investment firm,one of the largest such firms in the United States.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In 1994, he ran for Senator of Massachusetts and lost to Ted Kennedy.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; He was President and CEO of the 2002 Winter Olympic Games.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; In 2002, he was elected Governor of the State of Massachusetts where he eliminated a 1.5 billion deficit.
&gt; &gt; Some Interesting Facts about Romney:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Bain Capital, starting with one small office supply store in Massachusetts,turned it into Staples; now over 2,000 stores employing 90,000 people.
&gt; &gt; Bain Capital also worked to perform the same kinds of business miracles again and again,with companies like Domino's, Sealy, Brookstone, Weather Channel, Burger King,Warner Music Group, Dollarama, Home Depot Supply and many others.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; He was an unpaid volunteer campaign worker for his dad's gubernatorial campaign 1 year.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; He was an unpaid intern in his dad's governor's office for eight years.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; He was an unpaid bishop and state president of his church for ten years.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; He took no salary and was the unpaid Governor of Massachusetts for four years.
&gt; &gt; He gave his entire inheritance from his father to charity.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Mitt Romney is one of the wealthiest self-made men in our country but has given more back to its citizens in terms of money, service and time than most men.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And in 2011 Mitt Romney gave over $4 million to charity, almost 19% of his income....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Just for comparison purposes, Obama gave 1% and Joe Biden gave $300 or .0013%.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Mitt Romney is Trustworthy:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; He will show us his high school and college transcripts.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; He will show us his social security card.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; He will show us his law degree.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; He will show us his draft notice.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; He will show us his medical records.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Mitt Romney's background, experience and trustworthiness show him to be a great leader and an excellent citizen for President of the United States.
&gt; &gt; You may think that Romney may not be the best representative the Republicans could have selected. At least I know what religion he is, and that he won't desecrate the flag,bow down to foreign powers, or practice fiscal irresponsibility.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I know he has the ability to turn around this financial debacle that the current regime has gotten us into. We won't like all the things necessary to recover from this debt, but someone with Romney's background can do it.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But, on the minus side, he never was a ""Community Organizer"", never
&gt; &gt; took drugs or smoked pot, never got drunk,did not associate with communists or terrorists,nor did he attend a church whose pastor called for God to damn the US.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you care about our United States of America -- Send this to all your friends!"

I was doing great and they offered me a full time position after my internship. One of the last bitch work chores I had to do before the holiday break was to make sure the CEO signed all the dealer Christmas cards. I put them all out in a room for her and sat in there while she signed all some-odd-thousand of them. She took about half a box full home with her because she wanted to write personal messages in them to owners she knew personally. She sealed them and brought them back for me and I was glad because she did part of my job for me. Turns out she forgot to sign them and when they went out unsigned it was apparently extremely unprofessional and when they needed someone to point the finger of blame at they pointed it at me for even allowing her to take them home with her and giving her a chance to do them distracted. Long story short she didn't cover for me because I was an intern and at the end of my internship my job offer suddenly ""did not have the funding by the board."" So I went on my merry way to finish up my final semester of college.

**TL;DR was an intern. CEO didn't sign Christmas cards and I mailed them out. Pinned the blame on me. I was no longer an intern**

I also got fired from a Driving Range when I was 14 for falling asleep on the cash register. I was 14 and it was my best friends dad's place.

So Ladies &amp; Gents, what are your ""I got fired for this"" stories?

I know the week is not yet over, but it has just completely gotten me down this morning and I figured this was the place to come and seek advice. 

The day I decided I was going to lose I weighed 222. Granted, I had been weighing in anywhere from 222-226. I am a female and I am so grossed out telling ya'll this. It's shameful.  

I have been working out 3-4 times per week. It's my senior year in college and I'm maxed out at 16 hours of class, I work two jobs, one during the day, and one at night, doing an internship, and volunteering at an assisted living facility. It is extremely difficult to work out more than that. 

My typical workout includes 30-40 minutes on the Arc-trainer(depending on when/if I have to work that night), usually level 4 but in the past week I bumped it up to 5, which burns 400-500 calories; 10 minutes doing hill intervals on the bike; and 10 minutes walking/running on the treadmill. 45-50 minutes of cardio per day, no weight-lifting.  

I eat anywhere between 1,000 - 1,600 calories per day. Diet, diet, diet, everything low-cal, absolutely no sugar or sweets. I zig-zag to keep the weight loss going. My current weight is 206. I am 5'10. I started dieting/exercising August 22. I know losing 16 pounds is not a small amount by any means, but I am so god damn frustrated that I am ready to scream. I cried this morning to my boyfriend who has lost 25 pounds and I am not feeling any better.

I know a lot of it is water, and I have been drinking more to try and pee more often. How the hell do I get this fucking water out of my body without dehydrating myself?

If you have been in a situation like this, can you please offer me some advice to get over this plateau? I'll post a pic in a few of some befores and afters."

I'm kind of at a crossroads at the moment. 

This is going to be my last chance at getting real world experience. I haven't had any yet but not for lack of trying. I've been to several career fairs and gotten some interviews but that's it. Im pretty sure its just my lack of experience thats hurting me as my GPA is at a solid 3.44. All of my friends who have gotten co-ops and such have gotten them through connections basically, something I don't have.

On the other hand, this will probably be the last chance I get to do something like backpack through Europe for 5 weeks. After graduation, it'll all be about getting a job so I'm not going to have the time for such a trip. I really feel like this is something I should experience while I have the chance. I've never done any traveling before and its something I've always dreamed of doing. Its finally within reach now after I got a small inheritance and my mom essentially doubled her salary at work. 

I know the ""right"" thing to do would be to try for an internship but there is no guarantee ill get one. I suppose I could potentially find a job for next semester and push graduation back further and still attempt the trip over the summer. Any insight? What would you do?"

What subjects do you suggest I draw?

After I receive my BFA, I plan to move to California and get my MFA and get an internship. I've noticed a few colleges that offer an MFA in animation, including CalArts. What exactly is Experimental Animation? How would a BFA in character and a MFA in experimental benefit me? Do you know any schools I really should look into?

I now work at a company and am in dire need of assistance.  CEO gave me the go-ahead for an intern.  Getting resumes but conflicting with my boss on how to test them.

Boss' testing mechanism: add a new site to our monitoring server.  We sit down with the candidate, find the Nagios configs, copy an existing one, edit it to monitor your favorite site.  

This was the same test I took during my interview for a full-time position.  For SysAdmins, I feel it tests your knowledge of the linux fs, command-line abilities and understanding of services and how not to break them.  I don't expect interns to be on that level and would prefer an understanding of how many linux tools they know (grep, package manager(s), chmod, chown, wget, curl... and so on).

My test (admittedly, taken from my own intern interview): install something from source.  Go out on the web, find software x, download its source and install.  You have n minutes and I will not hold your hand.

To me this shows much more about the intern's abilities to work independently, how much they are going to poke me with questions and what tools they know/can pick up in an hour.

We interviewed one kid yesterday, he got through the test but we helped him.  I got an understanding of what he knows but I have no idea if he could figure it out on his own.

So, my question to you is, which one sounds better or do you have an even better method?  Any students out there, which one would you feel more comfortable doing?"

I'm 20 and a sophomore in college, majoring in art and psychology, considering dabbling in Japanese and/or Russian and maaaaaaybe theater arts. I'm a bit of an odd case, I want to practice art therapy (I need my art therapy license and an MA in Art therapy, which in the state of Oregon can only be acquired at Marylhurst oooooor if I get a doctorate,I don't need the MA in art therapy apparently) but I also want to go into clinical psychology or psychiatry. I haven't decided which as of yet, but I want my options open, and it's kind of a dream of mine to be accepted to OHSU for their MD/PhD combo program for psychiatry. Aside from the fact that I'm going to have to take my PreMed courses veryyyyy slowly because I struggle in math and science (I'm very good at psych, especially art therapy courses and BioPsychology), I'm not really sure how to get into the world of extra curriculars and what would be helpful and what might be harmful and what will help me to stand out. I am also looking into the PsyD programs at Pacific and George Fox, but I'm not sure if any of this is helpful to those. OHSU is my main goal though.

I've been looking into volunteering at Doernbecher (the children's hospital at OHSU) and I've also been looking into trying to volunteer or intern at the VA hospital, where my friend and sometimes my father go to. I'm worried though that these may be too generic? However, I'm not really sure what is considered better than others.

Meanwhile, Ive been told that a well rounded education is good and preferred for med school, but is studying fine arts and eventually performing arts going to cause me more harm than help? Would it perhaps be useful to take an EMT course or something? Should I maybe go for my MA in art therapy or psych before going onto trying for OHSU, George Fox, and Pacific?

Do you have any other helpful pointers for me?

I'm not sure what information I should give about myself presently because my college history is a bit unusual and a bit rocky,but I'm determined to go out of school with an amazing GPA. I know it's probably really early to be thinking this much to things, but my entire school life and heck, even my normal life as I know it (I've changed up pretty much my entire life by choice and by awkward circumstances involving my adoption and other things) so I feel like I really need to do whatever I can to keep all of my options open now and as long as possible, and to be able to try and achieve my dream. Down the road I may look into a few other med schools as well, but OHSU is my main choice.

Thank you and I'm sorry if any of this sounds a bit awkward, I'm on my iPad (which tried to autocorrect to MySpace) and I'm suffering a bout of insomnia.


Update (in case you read my wall of text to Sentriculus)
I started on Elavil 10mg today, and well be testing it for a month. Next month we may also look into having me try Adderall, when were sure that Elavil doesn't fuck me up. My boyfriend kept all of his old textbooks, so he's bringing me a huge stack of math texts and is going to be working with me frequently on math and eventually science. "

Ok, so since I started using MFP in the last week of July, I've been losing 2-4lbs a week. That is, until last week and this week, where I have lost nothing. And I just don't understand it. My current intake target on MFP is 1200 calories. While last week I broke that calorie amount once (camping with hotdogs and smores), and I could use that to explain away the lack of weight loss, this week I was extra diligent and did not come close to going over my calorie allotment at any point this week. 

The only thing I could possibly think of is that I'm taking in too much processed sugar. This week I had 2 starbucks grande green tea frappuccinos (skim milk, no whipped cream) and a small non fat chocolate ice cream cone (non fat, but still sugary). Now, I know these aren't great foods to eat and I should probably make better choices more often. But they fit in my calorie allotment, and social eating habits, so I didn't think it would be a problem. Well, is it a problem? Or could it possibly be water or fluid retention?

Any ideas you all might have as to why I've stopped losing weight would be super helpful, because I don't want to stop now AT ALL. I've only just started!

P.S. I haven't been working out at all because with classes, work, and my internship, I just don't have time. But I bike to class all the time and walk around campus, so it's not like I'm a complete couch potato. I know I should workout, and I'll definitely be doing so come January, because I'm enrolled in a course with a workout portion!"

Inspiring Others to Inspire Others: Young male who wants to become a teacher and inspire young people but needs help to make it happen.,mgilder,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/124dmo/transforming_one_person_at_time_inspiring_others/,"Hi Reddit World,

This is the first time I've posted anything on reddit. So I'm giving this a new shot. I'm Milton and I live in Durham, North Carolina. I graduated in 2009 from Duke University. After graduating, I worked in a variety non-profits and small businesses. Yet one thing I noticed in those three years, there was this endure excitement for young people and drawn to young people. I'm that alumnus who just won't leave college. Teaching was something that I've imagined myself doing. But it was a thought that was tucked away in the back of mind as a potential option. One evening in July I was thinking about becoming a teaching and thinking about ways to do it. I knew that Duke had a program and scholarship for Duke Alumni who are interested in teaching to join the teaching licensure program. I wasn't completely sure about doing the program but I took the plunge. I had nothing to lose. Within one week, I applied to the program, submitted a scholarship application, submitted transcripts, got a teacher recommendation, had an interview and got accepted to the program with scholarship. {Breaths hard - woosh} Case closed? I'm going to become a teaching? Nope. 

While my scholarship paid for most of my tuition expense, I still was required to pay a portion of my fees...no bigee...I can get a pell-grant - so I thought. I could get a pell-grant from the government for my teacher preparation program. Yet as I investigated more getting this money wasn't simple as submitting a FAFSA and receiving a check in the mail. Once I finally got in contact with the financial aid office at Duke they said that they would have to see if my program qualify for the funds since there are strict requirements to receive funds for a post-secondary teaching pell-grant. (NB: Most pell grants go to undergraduate students. A small portion goes to teacher who are seeking licensure/credential).

Weeks go by while Duke Financial Aid it communicating the US Department of Education. I'm chugging away at my education program (in which I'm doing really well @ about an A-minus/A average).

The news comes my program doesn't qualify for the pell-grant. Okay I'm sure I can look into other option to get the necessary funds. But now I'm left with a dilemma as I don't have personal funds - I've only made less than $25,00 since graduating - non-profits and starts biz don't pay much. So I attempt to apply for a SallieMae loan of course I didn't qualify as I don't have income or establish credit. And my parents don't make much. My mother is a single parent who makes half of what she made 10 years ago in CA. Okay that's not an option I think. Maybe I could get a job? Umm...I think about that...how are you going to get a job when between your classes, class work, required tutoring and internship - probably 60 hours a week or work - you don't have much time to rest? Yeah...that would be difficult. What I'm supposed to do when my program requires that I work full-time in the school without pay? Not sure about that. Plus I'm unable to receive additional fund from Duke since I'm not a degree seeking student (the scholarship I have is actually an agreement between the Education Department and Continuing Studies Office for a significant fee reduction) Given this situation, I'm unsure how will I support my personal basic living expenses. Do you see the dilemma/quandary?

Nonetheless, it is my desire to see that I complete this program no matter what and start teaching next school year. It is my desire to work with high school student to inspire them to reach their full potential. Eventually, I want to focus on economic development in developing countries. Specifically, working with young people (and marginalized people groups) doing leadership development and aid them to become entrepreneurs who contribute to their communities. I genuinely want to see the world around me transformed. Transformation begins with one person at time...first me. then my fellow human. the fellow human can impact others lives. and others can impact others. Let’s start a movement of seeing change and transformation in our world.

So I'm looking to raise $12000 for the cost of tuition, misc education cost, housing, food, gas, health, and misc. expenses for unexpected events. 

You can help two ways to begin seeing transformation in the world and in schools: (1) LIKE this post, (2) send me a message to learn more how you can donate. All donations are tax deductible since you would be sending the money directly to Duke University. If need be I can verify my acceptance to the program and my expenses...I also appreciate any comments of encouragement.

Thanks for taking the time to read this post.

Long time browser of reddit here. First time poster, though.

I wanted to reach out to you guys, because reddit has always been very helpful in providing me with advice, and pointing me in the right direction.

Here's my situation:

I'm returning to the USA in a couple weeks (US Citizen). I've been in India for the past two months helping my mother recover from a surgery. Before I left, I quit my marketing internship of 6 months, since I didn't know how long my mom would need my help (she's good now - she broke her clavicle and needed something minor done, but due to her age the doctor's were uncertain on how long her recovery would take).

Now that I'm coming back, I really want to live in LA. It's been my dream to live and work in LA since I was a kid. Additionally, I am extremely passionate about marketing and public relations, and am fortunate that LA is a hub for these fields. 

I've been desperately scouring online job boards for marketing opportunities, but I'm not having much luck.

If you guys have any advice on how I can get started in LA, I would greatly appreciate it!

A couple stats:

Could anyone point me in the direction of where I could look for a post production internship or any kind of assisting editing work? Does my current résumé put me in any kind of position to be considered for such work? What should I be doing?!?!

But I'm enrolled in this program that lets me take 12 graduate credits in my senior year because I'm ahead a bunch of credits due to summer courses. I would finish undergrad in spring 2014 with 12 grad credits. Then in summer 2014, take one grad course, an approved CPA exam review course, and the CPA exam (or a lot of it at least) and finish my MAcc in winter 2014. 

The program comes with complications, namely summer 2014. That's when traditionally an internship takes place I guess, summer after your senior year but before grad classes. Since that summer I'm going to be taking a graduate course, reviewing for, and taking the CPA exam, my school doesn't recommend a summer internship in 2014, but rather 2013, summer of junior year. 

So that's this year. Alright. I was ready. I met the firms. I had a few interviews. But I'm a junior. Most of my interviews went down the same path - oh, you're a junior...accelerated program, who gives a shit...alright, we'll be in touch, maybe. Some jobs wouldn't even let me apply because of my graduation date. So it goes. 

So now I don't have an internship for summer 2013. I'm so drained from trying that I don't really know what else to do, if I want to keep trying to get an internship for this summer, if I even can. 

But then what? If I don't, and I probably won't, get an internship for this summer, what then? Summer 2014 is, again, a very busy summer, and I don't think I'd feel great trying to intern at 70 hour a week internship while preparing for the CPA exam/taking it and taking another grad course on the side. Seems...excessive, to me anyways.

Not sure what I'm looking for, I guess just some direction, or advice, on what my next move should be. I was thinking maybe find any work during this summer even semi-related to accounting and doing that. I just don't want to finish grad school, pass the CPA exam, and not be able to find a job due to lack of experience. "

I just went threw a very traumatic point in my life. I've relied on friends and /r/breakups to get over this. I've never posted, I've just read and I've read a lot of ""we dated for six months and my life is ruined."" I understand your pain, guilt, sadness, anger, everything. I've been there. I know the feeling. It sucks. You go back to the dating websites that are dead ends, you hang around the bars and hope for some kind of strange to walk in so you can lift them off their feet for the night or you just sit and sulk about what could have been and why it's not. I see these issues as 1000, some kind of undergrad class that everyone HAS to take just because. It sucks, you do it, you forget it. It doesn't impact your life unless you want to impress someone because you can explain Boolean and Aristotle and that might get you laid. What I'm talking about is graduate level break ups. Ya know when you have a lease together, planning a life together, actually LIVE together not just ""oh we live together"" but ""WE live together."" We as in one. What's yours is mine and whats mine is yours kind of shit. Now that I think I've explained my shit theory, I'll go on with my story. I'll even to do a tl;dr because I'm drunk.

Here is my story: I met Girl Unit A through Friend Unit J. Girl Unit A and Friend Unit J are brother and sister. Myself and Girl Unit A hit it off immediately and start to form a solid friendship (this happened in 2010). Myself and Girl Unit A start dating. We become exclusive, friends and family recognize us as a couple, everything is golden. She stays in my apartment in Manhattan or I stay at her apartment in Brooklyn. Either way, we have things at each other places; it starts with a toothbrush, then an article of clothing and from then on it just blossoms. Fast forward two years. Relationship is still solid, together we have an apartment in East Village, we adopt dogs that we call our ""kids"" even after two years that honeymoon feeling is still there. After months of thinking and self doubting yourself you save up three months salary from your well paying internship and buy that ring. Ya know, THAT one. The holy grail of rings. You practice your lines over and over again; riding the subway, in a cab, the mirror, in the shower. You write them down and fix every little detail. Then the night comes, both of you are ACTUALLY free from work and school. You plan that special dinner at the Brazilian place on 9th avenue that you had your first date at. The bartender remembers you and makes you and her special drinks to celebrate a happy and healthy relationship. You eat, laugh, drink and you love. On the Q train home you hold hands and whisper how much you love each other and how life couldn't be the same without one another. Not much is said and that's fine, you just lock eyes and smile. Happiness. You clench onto the ring box in your jacket pocket, that hand has been in your pocket for 15 minutes now and it's dripping with sweat. You know a subway car is not the most romantic place, but the timing is right. You feel each other, you feel her life from your scalp to your toes. She feels you. Together you are one. Together we can take on the Red Army. At this point you're trying to beat the clock because you know something, somewhere can change that feeling. You inhale and exhale slowly. You casually get down on one knee and you pull out the ring. All of the lines you practiced come out perfect, the timing is perfect, everything for that 45 seconds is perfect. Your heart is racing, you're dripping in sweat, people on the the Q are watching and you wait. You see the look in her eyes, you're predicting the ""YES!"" followed by the kiss but you get ""No."" A dead serious ""No."" The moment is gone. You put the ring back in your pocket and ride the train back home in silence. Nothing is said the entire time. Both of you walk apart from each other, arms crossed at a face, speed walking pace. Nothing is said in your apartment that you have painted and designed together. You sleep in separate rooms for the first time since that one party. You replay every moment in your head over and over again. Eventually you pass out and when you wake up the next day all of her things are gone. The toothbrush, the clothes, the everything. The only note she leaves you is terms for a sublet. Friends and family have no idea where she is, you call her office and she's in a meeting and not able to take calls. You slowly start to realize this person is not in your life anymore and it's the most depressing feeling ever. After days of sulking and worrying she finally comes back to the apartment, not much is said you ask questions and she gives short answers. All you want is her touch, to embrace her but the only feeling you get is when she hands you the apartment key and your fingers lightly touch one another. That's when you know its over.

If you're wondering, I have the dogs. They're doing good. I know there is more missing but I'm drunk and I really want to watch horror movies right now.

**tl;dr** I proposed and I got rejected. 

**UPDATE** Still haven't heard from her and I haven't made any attempt to talk to her. The dogs are still doing well.

**tldr of previous post**: Got some advice on an entry level IT intern position.  Thanks guys.

So I had my phone interview for an IT intern position last week.  I believe things went well since he invited me to a lunch interview sometime this week.

I was so stoked!  I never really expected to get the position in the first place since I felt I was very unqualified.  I had no real professional experience, and all my technical skills came from managing my home servers and network.  

I think the tips you guys gave in the previous thread really impressed him.  I focused on how *teachable* I am and gave lots of examples.  I didn't pretend to have skills I didn't have (ex: no database experience) but let him know how I would learn the material.

Anyway, he told me he wanted to meet for lunch this week.  So after the phone interview, I sent him a thank you e-mail and let him know when I'd be free this week to schedule a lunch meeting.

On Monday, I got no response.  No biggy.  I sent him another e-mail, again thanking him for his time.  I also let him know a sysadmin project that I had worked on over the weekend (setting up and configuring a LAMP stack).  I really wanted to demonstrate that I would be valuable and easy to teach and work with.  Again, I let him know of my availability this week and next week.

Still no response.

Getting that first phone interview invitation felt like being asked to prom by the hottest girl in town.  Last weekend, while I was studying and working like a fiend, I felt like I was shopping for that perfect tux for the big night.  Now it's Friday, and I feel stupid standing on my porch wondering when my date is going to come.

I know I shouldn't be surprised.  I know I shouldn't be too disappointed since this was WAY over my league anyway.

Looks like I'll probably have to start from helpdesk and move my way up.  Thanks for your help anyway.

**EDIT: Thanks everyone for your encouraging words.  I will take some of the advice on here and move on.**"

123odc,1,2012-10-25,How do i deal with my past employer?,dustedrob,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/123odc/how_do_i_deal_with_my_past_employer/,"Last month i was laid off from my job as a software developer due to ""financial difficulties"" from my past employer. During the year and a half i worked there, i kept a very friendly relationship with everyone around the office. Also, as the sole software developer, i had some perks like flex hours,  occasional telecommuting etc.  

My first project with the Customer Service department was a success by all means. The application was developed and deployed well under the deadline and was well received by the staff.  

Next, i was assigned to a project with the HR department. The development went smoothly and everyone was pleased. We had weekly meetings to review milestones, check the functionality of the application and discuss new features. Within a month of finishing the project, everyone around the office started gossiping about poor financial results and potential layoffs throughout the office. I wasn't really worried since upper management was already discussing moving me to a different department to begin a new project.  

I finished the project with one week left under the deadline, the final meeting went smoothly and everyone was pleased with the results. The next day i was informed that i was going to be laid off by the end of the week.  

The news hit me really hard but i decided to keep a positive attitude. I devoted the remaining days to deploy the web app into the server and perform some additional tests. My last day at the office was uneventful, we finished our work relationship on a positive note.  

Last week i got an email and a phone call from my boss; apparently, she presented the project to the CEO and he had some suggestions for new features (without knowing that i wasn't working there anymore) Now she wants me to work for free to add those features arguing that she was ""surprised"" that those features didn't already exist and since i finished the project a week early, i shouldn't have been paid for the last week. Obviously, i politely declined and offered to return temporarily as an outside consultant.  

Today i received another email with a harsher tone. This time, she also says that she's ""honestly surprised"" with my attitude since the company provided me with many perks and benefits and i wasn't reciprocating. She also stated a veiled threat about not providing letters of recommendations for future employers.  

How do i proceed now? Those extra features would take about a week's worth of work and I definitely don't feel like working for free, specially since my financial situation is a bit weak right now but i also don't want to hurt my chances of future employment by not having their letters of recommendation. Take into account that this was my first ""real"" job besides internships and freelancing.  

**TL;DR: My past employer is trying to guilt-trip me into working for free. What should i do?**"

I graduated from University in 2009 with a Masters in Graphic Design and Visual Communication, having studied graphic design since I was 16 at college.

Since graduating I have applied for around 500 design-related positions within the UK (where I reside) and abroad. These include internships, full-time, part-time, freelance and agency-based work. I have had no luck at all in terms of finding employment in the industry I love, with rarely as much as an reply acknowledging my application or interest.

The replies that I have had include gems such as being told I can work for them full-time without pay for 2 years then they would consider giving me a wage and an email telling me that I was talentless since I failed to get a 1st in my degree. I am not joking.

My question is am I alone in this or is the industry now so enclosed and full of already established designers that new graduates are unable to become a part of it? Also how long did it take for any employed designers on the Reddit to find their starting jobs?"
123mpp,5,2012-10-25,Girlfriend (20f) and I (21m) just broke up very suddenly.  Can someone help me understand what has just happened?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/123mpp/girlfriend_20f_and_i_21m_just_broke_up_very/,"Ok. So let me first say that this was my first adult relationship.  I knew this girl before but we started dating ten months ago.

We both fell madly in love.  Always near each other.  This summer she had a summer internship in another state and I even managed to fly up and see here every two weeks.  Things we going beautifully!  This fall started rolling just perfectly.  I was still happy and so was she. Then the trouble.

Two weeks ago I decided to go back home from college to spend the weekend with my family and my Aunt visiting from out of state.  Upon returning, there was something of about her.  I kept asking what it was, but I could not get a straight answer.  Just ""I'm in a slump"".  I asked if it was me. ""No, its just school"".

Well that ""Its just school"" turned into ""I never see you anymore, you are too busy"".  To be fair, I am very busy.  I have an internship a job and tutoring amounting to around 35 hours a week plus five upper level college classes. So yes I am busy.  I thought I had made every opportunity to see her.  Apparently that wasn't enough.

Tuesday she was very upset with me for not spending enough time with her.  She also explained that she was in a slump because of me not spending enough time with her and because I no longer made her happy.  I was confused and very upset.  I asked if she wanted to be without me and expressed my want and need for her and that I love her.  After calming me down, we had a nice two days. Until this afternoon.

I was getting screwed over with car problems and frustrated.  After telling me she would come pick me up, she said that she could, but she was studying.  I took it as she was too busy studying to pick me up.  I got mad and called her selfish.  This is wrong of me.  And I apologized.  But it was not enough.

After pleading with her and begging with her to give me another chance, she told me that she could no longer be with me.  I explained that people in love give each other seconds chances and are understanding.  She explained to me that she had already been doing that and enough was enough.  I asked her to give me the weekend without me before she officially broke it off. She agreed.

Can someone explain what just happened to me and why she would act this way? Am I the bad guy? Is she a bad girlfriend? Should I just move on? I love this girl to piece and I feel like we are perfect together, but this sudden turn of events has been a dagger in the heart.  

Any questions I'll be happy to answer.

tl;dr: Girlfriend of perfection suddenly breaks it off. What happened?"

Right now I'm taking a full course load with *difficult* classes, leading a very active campus club, and working an internship on a big political campaign. I have no time for anything. I'm sleep deprived, over-worked, and over-stressed. I've consumed so much red bull this semester that my heart palpitates constantly. And surprise- I'm not doing a good job at anything I'm trying to do.

This past week I bombed, and I mean **bombed**, every major assignment I had. I've spent many nights staying up until 4 or 5 just to study for one particularly difficult neuroscience class. It's a class I care about deeply. I've put more genuine effort to succeed in that class than any other aspect of my life. But, I'm at the bottom of the class and probably failing. I was hoping to make it into a top-ten cognitive science graduate school, but now I'm realizing I'm just not going to make it. I can't even complete everything I need to do, much less do a stellar job. I can only hope to pass.

I'm doing the best I can do, failing miserably, and hating the notion that it should be okay. It's not okay. I'm not the least bit happy with myself right now. Surely I'm not alone here... I've got to find a way to turn this around.

**tl;dr current graduate student at University of Texas considers going to Creative Circus instead**


I’m currently a graduate student at the University of Texas (AdGrad). 

…And I’m considering finishing out this first semester and transferring to the Creative Circus in Atlanta. 

It’s not that I’m having a hard time with grades. I’ve always made really good grades and I’m making A’s and B’s here so far. 

I was really worried about getting accepted into the portfolio program here, but even now, I don’t feel the same anxiety…maybe it is because I think there is a possibility that I may not even be here when portfolio courses start.

It was a culmination of things that stirred me into seeking more information about Creative Circus. 

* Required core classes are courses I’ve taken already because I majored in advertising, like media management and research 

* Taking these classes costs me three times more than when I took them in undergrad (out-of-state)

* Very stunted elective options

* Electives I did find weren’t even available this semester. I asked my coordinator what to do and she told me the “entire catalogue was open” and “maybe I could look into a filler course in marketing or something in the business college.” For the price and my career aspirations, filler courses in seem like a colossal waste of time and money.

* Staff/Professors/Administration don’t seem to care…From permitting obvious cheating, to not planning for class size (like opening only one meeting time for a course all 70+ of us graduate students need), to giving athletes special treatment (“I don’t think you realize how little I care,” a football player calmly said to me when I was trying to get his input on a group project.)…you get the picture.

* My peers. Not all of them! There are some **incredible** people I’ve already met in the four months I’ve been here. Unfortunately, there are also some people that make me wonder why they even applied for graduate school. From aforementioned student athletes, to people always unavailable to come to meetings or contribute to projects, to people who just seem to want to rehash undergrad and picked a degree they thought would be easy…it's the lack of passion and drive that just kicks me in right in the guts. I wanted to be around like-minded people… passionate and driven.


What set the wheels in motion...

So, a couple months into the program I’m pulling an all-nighter, formatting a research paper for media that only three out of seven group members have contributed to, and I see this picture on Facebook from my friend currently at the Creative Circus. The picture was of her apartment, covered wall to floor in these Sharpied (new word!) black and white pieces of paper in these insane designs.

Circus is scheduled in quarters and she had just started. In her first week, she was already balls deep into intense art direction projects…Maybe not working on her book yet, but definitely working on stuff that was relevant to her desire to be an art director.

We were both pulling all-nighters. One of us was working on being an art director. And one of us was formatting a research paper in InDesign. 

And it just hit me: even IF, I get into the portfolio program here, it is only one class per semester for the next three semesters. I’ll have three classes to work on my book. The rest are required core classes or random electives that I have to hope are going to be beneficial to me as a fledging CW. And if I don’t get in, or if I get kicked out of a class and have to re-apply, it’s adding more and more time I’m at least partially wasting and more money I’m paying.

So, I requested info and I’ve had long conversations with a recruiter from Creative Circus. I was pleased by how much she grilled me on what my aspirations are, what I like doing, in what kind of environments do I work best, why did I pick advertising…all the meaty, juicy stuff. She told me to apply and said she wouldn’t recommend I do unless she thought I was a good candidate for their program, but she also steered me toward VCU or Miami if I really wanted an MA. She couldn’t give me any advice on Texas because she wasn’t really familiar with it. 

I looked over their curriculum. It looks incredible…very focused on copywriting and building your portfolio. There are even interactive classes I can take so I have that competitive edge when I enter the job market. Smaller classes are also a plus, but not such a huge positive that I think it would sway me in either direction.

I’m working on my application right now. 

But I wanted to ask --- should I give it more time? Am I being too harsh? Am I not seeing something right in front of my face? 

Anybody have any opinions on Creative Circus or the program at Texas? I have talked extensively with friends and family but I usually get the safe, “Do what you think will benefit you the most.”

I’d hate to think that I made the wrong choice…in either staying here or going there.

The only person I want to ask I’m afraid to ask. I consider him my mentor and he championed my going to Texas…he even helped me polish up my essay and wrote one of my recommendations.
I know he’s very proud of my acceptance here. He’s asked me to Skype with his class about my experience here at UT so far. He’s even sent out some emails to people in agencies here trying to help me get an internship. I guess I feel like he’s invested in my success because he’s put effort into helping me. 

I don’t want to disappoint him or have him think his efforts were wasted or that I am ungrateful. He does not look at portfolio schools positively…he thinks they don’t teach conceptual thinking, they only teach beautiful executions. 

But looking at the work I’ve seen coming from Circus…I don’t think that is true. 



(Maybe no one is thinking this, but just in case, no – I was in no way romantically involved at all with my mentor. He actually does not prefer my gender. He is just someone I respect a lot and would hate to disappoint.)




So, for an aspiring copywriter that is excited at the prospect of being thrown into intense portfolio work for the next years…good idea to make the move to Creative Circus?

 Or stay and get an MA and try get into the portfolio program at UT?

I'm going to blab on about my whole situation, but there's a TL;DR at the end if you want me to get to the point :)

I recently graduated from the a top CS university in Canada (Waterloo) with a bachelor of CS, Bioinformatics option. I had 5 internships throughout my undergrad career, and spent most of them in tech companies in Silicon Valley. When I graduated, I was lured into San Francisco by the big money, and that's what I've been doing for the past year. But I've realized that I don't particularly enjoy this too much, and that got me thinking about what I do like. I remember that in university I enjoyed some of my bio courses, I enjoyed some CS courses, but all the Bioinformatics courses were always the most interesting and fun to me. Which made me realize that maybe I should follow that route instead of the pure CS route.
So I started looking for bioinformatics jobs and pretty much everything I saw required a PhD. So now I'm thinking of going back to grad school and get a Master's in bioinformatics (I don't want to commit to 5-6 years of a PhD, I'd rather do 2 years first to see if I like it). The hope is that I will really like it and then want to continue on to PhD and live happily ever after. And if I don't enjoy it too much, well then I can always come back to Silicon Valley and be unhappy but at least rich..? :p

My question is what program exactly am I supposed to look for in grad school? I'm looking mainly at Canadian universities, probably University of Toronto. I was hoping to just find a ""Bioinformatics"" program, but instead I found faculty members in either the Biology department or the CS department working on bioinformatics. Do you think that doing there will be large differences between doing a master's in bioinformatics through Biology vs through CS? Do you think that the job market will react better to one or the other? If you have any other piece of advice or information that can help, that would be appreciated too.

Would this be a turn-off?",neverenough22,askagirl,https://www.reddit.com/r/askagirl/comments/126k8p/ladies_questions_about_masculinity_and_machoness/,"I'm probably not what you'd consider to be the ""average"" straight Midwestern, American male and I'm wondering if it's ruining my chances with women. I live in the Midwest-- and it really seems like I'm nothing close to what women are looking for around here.

I try to dress well, I'm very clean, I love to cook and bake, enjoy art and culture, love creative writing and, recently, I've looked into going back to school for Interior Design. I have quite a few female friends, hate most sports and don't fit into the beer guzzling Neanderthal stereotype of most guys my age. 

On the flip side, I love to work on cars, go to junkyards, build things, longboard, go to punk shows, go to the gym, shoot at the gun range and operate my two car-related side businesses. On the weekends I'm usually in the garage getting dirty, followed up by cooking dinner. 

From what I've learned about myself, I'm a really compassionate, kind and generally gentle person who's probably a little too sensitive at times. At the same time, I'm protective of friends and family, stubborn and fairly intense and competitive.

It's a very unique mix, I know, because I have a lot of traits and interests of both genders. It works for me and I like who I am. I won't change who I am, but I'm concerned this is causing girls to distance themselves from me or show no interest. Or, worse yet, see me as ""one of the girls"" and throw me in the Friend Zone (of which I used to be king of). 

A few weeks ago I went out to dinner with a female friend (just friends) and someone asked if I was her boyfriend. I later found out they said they knew I couldn't be because I'm not ""rugged"" enough. Similarly at work yesterday I was sitting with a table full of female co-workers (most of my male co-workers can't hold a conversation outside of fantasy football... fuck that) and one commented that I'm ""chic"" based on something I said. (Also, fuck that.) The conversation turned into the fact that I'm not ""rugged"" and, honestly, I became a little offended because I felt like it was being used more as a euphemism for ""straight"" or ""masculine"" in the conversation. 

I've been single since June and, other than a poorly-thought out fling with an old ex, I've yet to go on a date-- and I've tried. I have a good job at a prestigious ad agency, a degree, I'm in shape, own two cars, live on my own and, in general, can have a quality conversation with any girl I meet and treat women like absolute princesses. (I have references!)

I lived in New York for a summer for an internship and really felt like the girls there thought of me differently. I felt appreciated for who I am and what I offer and again last weekend hanging out with some girls from Nashville while I went on vacation. Around here, men are ultra-masculine (in general) and I feel like that's what women expect and it's not me.

So, do I need to move away to find an area where women appreciate guys like me? Would you be turned off by a guy who could fix your car and then take you inside and talk about your day over a lemon-pepper and dill stuffed trout with asparagus spears, fresh from my kitchen?

I genuinely don't get it.


TL;DR: Guy from Midwest likes to work on cars and bake brownies. Guy from Midwest likes to shoot guns and then pick out curtains. Guy from Midwest gets zero interest from females and wonders if women are turned off by his unconventionally dynamic interests.

UPDATE: Thanks for all the input everyone. I'll post back once in a while with updates, but for now I'm headed out to San Francisco for work over the next two months (kids, go into advertising-- it's fun!). Kind of glad I don't have a girlfriend to ""run this past""! If I'm not working 80 hours a week I'll have to see if girls in SF are like girls in NYC. 

UPDATE #2:
Whoever suggested online dating, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I met an incredibly wonderful girl at a Match.com mixer. We had our second date last night and there's definitely something here. I could not be happier. She's from the deep South and seems to like or at least appreciate my quirks.

Reddit, get out there and meet someone. This is the best feeling imaginable."

All meal plans come with 5 free ""guest passes"" that allow a guest to eat in any dining hall with you. I was flirting with her and she asked me to go eat with her. I told her I didn't have a meal plan and she offered to use a guest pass.

When we got there, it turns out she didn't have any guest passes left, so she charged the $10 on her student account to purchase another.

Should I pay her back? I know she's struggling financially; she mentioned how she needed new running shoes but couldn't afford them, she mentioned what her parents did for a living (so I can guess how much they make), and her backpack/clothes looked really old and well worn. I'm on a full scholarship and have a well paying internship.

My only issue with paying her back is I didn't ask her to pay for my way in; just to use a free guest pass."

I bought D3 at release and I stopped playing after 4-5 days. I liked the game but an internship forced me to move to a remote location for a few months, and I couldn't connect to the blizzard servers from there.

I started playing again earlier this week, I killed inferno diablo yesterday and I'm ready to farm. I'm not on my PC at the moment so I will not be able to post my gear, but I'm sitting at 38k unbuffed DPS, 41k unbuffed HP and a total of 240 all resists. I focused on STR and VIT on all my items, while trying to get all resists, attack speed, crit chance, crit damage, life leech and magic find where I could. Oh yeah, since I play on MP0 and stuff dies fast, I made it a point to get +life on kill to keep me alive. So far I only spent 200k or so in the AH, I could improve my stats a lot but that's not really why I'm here.

I play a barb, I've been using the following build/strategy: leap into a group (using the stun on land rune), cleave as a main attack, rend (with the life leech rune) when I get low on health and/or against elites and champions. I use battle cry and my right click is the +400% damage hammer thingy. I forgot the name of the attack and I'm not at home right now, sorry.

This has allowed me to finish the game, and I pretty much never die on MP0 unless I'm not cautious. Since I don't have crazy stats (I couldn't pull off the popular WW builds yet, I think my strategy is more effective considering my non-existant budget). Is there anything I could do to improve my character easily? Is there a better build for me considering I don't have money to buy gear? I don't think I could afford to improve my attack speed while replacing LOK for LOH to switch towards a WW build just yet.

Also, where should I farm? I've been reading the forums and reddit, I understand what makes items worth a lot for barb players but I'm not really familiar with the other classes. For example, what's the minimum DPS a weapon should have if I want a realistic chance of selling it? What are popular combinations of stats I should look for on rare items when trying to figure out if they're valuable?"

My boyfriend (25) and I (21) have been together for 15 months. When we were first together, he was super sweet, amazing, and I was excited at the prospect of falling in love for the first time.

Fast forward, and we now live together. We’ve been living together since August. I thought everything was going to be great, and, well, it hasn’t been horrible.

We don’t fight, but I can’t help but be pissed at him. He’s a college sophomore majoring in Biology. I am a college junior majoring in public relations. I am set to graduate early next winter.

I guess what I am trying to get at is, the problems I feel we have. I have a full time job, I go to school, I have an internship, a project with the president of my university, and I volunteer. He has school. He constantly tells me that he is always so busy.

On an average day, I wake up at six to go to work, and work eight until four. Or I go to work and then go to class until five. He has class at 1130-230. I come home and he’s playing video games or sleeping, everyday. I get to come home and cook and clean. Then, I get to do my homework or work on a project. I usually work straight from six am until around midnight. He stays up until four a.m. playing WoW.

He has also lost anything and everything romantic about him. For our anniversary, he promised me we’d go to a nice restaurant, which turned into me finding him in his pajamas and him finally deciding at nine at night to get Taco Bell (which I paid for).

He used to say sweet things to me all the time, tell me how much he loves me. Now he doesn’t. I can’t remember the last time he said it and I thought he was sincere. I don’t feel like I’m important to him. I don’t know if I ever did.

I know in any given situation, I wouldn’t be his first choice, his second, sometimes even his third. He ranks his happiness above everything else. I rank his about everything. I never say no to him, but I ask to go to a park, he says how horrible of an idea it is, and tells me it’ll never happen. 
	
I don’t have many friends because of him. As I am always waiting at the drop of a hat for his plans to change and for me to maybe be invited along somewhere.

He tells me he appreciates everything I do. But he just tells me. My 21st birthday is in two weeks, and I know he has nothing planned, and I know he wouldn’t, but I guess I’m still disappointed. He never shows me.

And he does tell me he loves me, but it’s not like how it used to be. And when he’s around his friends he talks down to me, and won’t even touch me. I have no desire to break up with him, and I’ve attempted talking. I love him more than I can ever explain. I’m just not sure as to what to do.

I know both are important. I'm not saying either one is dominant over another (you need both to have a functional game, of course).

This is a long diatribe, so I apologize in advance (I'm half expecting you guys to not even have answers). I''m stuck in a rut that I fucking hate but have no way to get out it. I'm an outwardly happy person in real life, but internally I'm turning into an emo.

I'm a sophomore college student who has been having a really hard time socially. People seem to like me, but it seems they're quite busy on the weekends whenever I ask (there's a whole bunch of guys I know in a fraternity who I'd like to hang with but they're all on some retreat this weekend), so going out is rare. I keep having to remind myself it's probably not me, but it seems this week I could not think anything but that. If anything it does seem like they're coming up with excuses not to hang out with me. I try to plan in advance or suggest things to do, but I fail. I'm usually not invited anywhere, so it's rare if someone texts me about something; I'm the one who's usually texting people. 

I do have maybe 1 or 2 meaningful relationships, but both of them are busy a lot and one can become really negative/complainiac. I talk to my parents a lot who are big comforts in my life, but obviously they can't come down every weekend.

I  would like to meet new friends, but the clubs here suck (tried rushing fraternities-rejected twice), I have night classes Monday-Thursday (bonehead move on my part), and an internship twice a week (most of the interns either have significant others or are considerably older than me). I'm willing to make friends with people, but everyone seems so distant. I'm friendly with my roommate but he's usually out with his friends; I try to suggest stuff to him but he says he's busy.

I don't drink, smoke, and am not into parties. I'm in therapy at school, but it seems like things are stagnant with no way of changing. (They say their office is booked solid with people in similar situations to me but aren't legally able to tell me who they are). I'm trying to look for a social group to work on my social skills but that search hasn't been successful.

I would like to go home for the weekend but it requires a plane flight and I'd only be able to spend like a day with my folks.

Oh and I have an idiot professor who's making my life hell as she doesn't know how to fucking teach, assign an essay, or answer her email.

College has taught me how much I suck, how shitty people are and how much they deserve to have their faces socked in. I'm not going to commit suicide, but I seriously don't know what the fuck I'm supposed to do. I doubt people here at school would give a shit if I died in my room alone.

Four friends of mine (from my college) either work there or have accepted an offer which is also a plus. I believe I've shown a good level of interest, having applied for an internship last summer, and attending two events at my school by them so far this year. I was just wondering if anyone had some tips to help me nail the interview. 

* Anything I should try to do at a semi-informal dinner the night before, aside from be myself?

* I have to give a 5 minute presentation on a project displaying my technical skills. I have chosen my topic and realize that it's probably a device to display my communication skills and condense a large topic into a short period. Anything I should do or avoid? 

* There is a ""group project."" I'd guess trying to be a leader is advisable, but not sure what to expect.

* Any other advice for the individual interview/in general?

Hello, Reddit! I was recently directed here by a friend (somewhat warily, as I've heard quite a few things about Reddit--mainly regarding dead dog threads and creepshots or whatever it's called--but after browsing for a bit I must say that I am really proud of you guys; you've successfully managed to become a better, healthier community than the League of Legends forums and the LoL general threads on 4chan combined), and told to introduce my months-long project to you, as your refined and well-read nature as a collective community would make you a bit more receptive than ""I DON'T WANT THIS BECAUSE IT'S DIFFERENT""

I tried to post this as a link but apparently it's already been done? In light of that, you can see the project at the link at the top.

While the long and short of my project can be found in my Statement of Purpose and FAQ, I'll give you guys a bit of background information: I am a Game Design (Interactive Design/Game Development) major from the Savannah College of Art and Design, and my current goal is to eventually land a job at Riot Games Inc. in Santa Monica to work on champion designs and eventually spearhead my LoL 2 project, creating a better game while allowing older players to stick to the LoL they're familiar with. Over the past month and a half, I have redesigned over 50 of the League's champions, keeping in mind kit coherency and the representation of an overall theme (while creating defined playstyles and counterplay in the process, making LoL a more dynamic game in general as well as increasing the variety it provides as far as the run-around-and-try-to-force-teamfights metagame goes), and have designed 30+ champions of my own (coming soon to lolchampdesigns.tumblr.com) as a portfolio for my application (along with the general acclaim of the redesign blog and the fact I've been playing LoL for over two years and have accumulated 2000+ games worth of experience, and am thus no stranger to the nature of the game and the design principles therein). 

I have applied for a summer internship at Riot Games Inc. in Santa Monica to acquire some of the experience required to work for them fulltime as well as gain some insight as to their internal process as far as champion creation goes. 

I know what I plan on doing will be fairly controversial (trust me, it's been an uphill battle the entire way, as the community of people-that-refer-to-themselves-as-gamers--ie. the group responsible for applying the adjectives ""casual"" and ""hardcore"" to games and not the people that play games--has become hard-wired over time to oppose change) and will take a lot of work to even turn it into a considerable option, but I'm more than willing to bust my ass to get shit done. If you disagree with what I am fighting to do, please think long and hard about why and how stupid such a notion is (ie. ""I don't want you to improve a pre-existing game through a sequel--thus not affecting me if I like LoL how it is--because uh"").

Thank you for reading through all this text and I hope you enjoy at least certain portions of all my hard work!"

I started off helping make a website and then kind of transitioned into answering tech calls, being a tech support guy.  Now I'm pushing myself back into a software development role and my bosses are wanting me to sign a non-compete agreement.  They haven't gotten anything written up; it was just mentioned.  My bosses are awesome.  Great to work with, very trustworthy and I love them to death, but I don't want to shoot myself in the foot.  I'm a very self-motivated person.  I know I can do whatever I want to do.  I just want to make sure I don't sign anything that is unreasonable and really it takes experience to know what is reasonable.

Here are my thoughts on the subject.  Anything beyond two years is unacceptable for any terms or agreements.  Inside of those two years I find it acceptable for them to restrict me from doing anything near them as long as they agree to pay for my relocation to a job in another area.  If they are unwilling to do that then the terms need to be very relaxed and only includes things such as:

- I can't take code I wrote for them, put it on a flash drive and then use it at a new company.
- I can't start my own business and take any of their clients.  However, if I'm employed at a new company they can steal clients as long as I never have any contact with the client during the period we agree upon.

Am I on the right track?  Is the industry standard more strict than this?  Will I hurt myself looking for a job in the future if I give up this much?  They don't pay me all that much in relation to what I do for them, but they are giving me a crazy good amount of experience and free reign to learn stuff I want to learn.  I want to stay with them, but I also don't want to hurt myself and others by being lax and accepting things that hurt employees.

Thanks for any input and please explain your experience level in your comments.  I want to avoid taking advice from somebody who is overly idealistic and never had a job in software, but please don't be discouraged from giving me advice no matter who you are.

I tried forgetting about her, but our friend circles overlap.
tl;dr broke up with gf without legit reason, now she has new bf, but i still like her. what do i do?"

I've always been really interested in finance, however with no finance major, however when I was deciding on colleges this was not immediately apparent to me. I was considering pre med or eventually going to law school, however my focus has shifted dramatically over the last year. 

I've been considering transferring to a top ""regular"" university, which would give me broader range of majors, however that is not my top reason for transferring. I do really love my school, especially the size of classes (most less than 20), as well as the professors, but there are other aspects I'm not a huge fan of.  

I've been pretty undecided so far in what I want to major in. I've also been thinking a lot about majoring in Comp Sci, however I haven't had the chances to take any classes in that yet (I will in the spring). I have a very strong foundation in mathematics and will continue with that for the remainder of my time in college. I've considered economics as well, however the major is so over saturated it's ridiculous.  So as of right now I'm very unsure of where I want to go or where I should be going. I already have very strong connections in the tech industry as well as finance, and will be pursuing a financial internship over the summer. I'd also like to be prepared in lieu of having those connections in case they fall through. I'm only a freshman and my GPA is currently very high, so I still have some time to think about all of this. Thanks /r/FinancialCareers. "

I'm from the UK and TEFL is something that I have been considering for around three years, since I began my English Literature and Language BA. Now that I've finished the course (ended up concentrating on lit with a few language modules first year and getting a 2.1) it has reappeared as a serious option. 
Teaching is not something I've tried before and sinking a lot of cash into a course I won't see much use of sounds a wee bit silly, so I'd prefer to try out the lifestyle first. 

I have a couple of ideas/options and was hoping to get opinions, insight and abuse hurled at me so here it goes. 

One possibility is an internship with a company called ""I to I"", a five month stint in Vietnam with a 60 hour qualification thrown in. This includes plenty of support, accommodation etc but the ""monthly stipend"" works out very low at about £150. I'm well aware that I'm not qualified and in the position to be demanding a better wage than this but if you can, why wouldn't you right? 

Another is to do a 2 day tefl course, buy some books and start applying for positions on the strength of my degree. This seems doable from what I've read, though I'm unsure which in countries this approach would be most successful. 

Or maybe there is a better way? Anything you can think of that may help is appreciated.

I'd like to try out teaching and see if It's something I am good at and enjoy. If it is the CELTA or TESOL would be my next stop or even a PGCE and teach in the UK. 

Thanks for reading!"

Choice 1:
Great name recognition in the industry

Role is a trade assistant but from talking to people, it seems very middle office oriented

choice 2:

Moderate size, but zero name recognition outside of its niche

Has a history of developing its employees internally

Position would be more research/analytics oriented


I know that on my first day at work, I'd rather be at the smaller company and I'd learn more there, but I'm worried that in 10-15 years I'll regret not having the name recognition on my resume.  I'm also unsure about the future of the niche market of the second choice.

128bjx,17,2012-10-28,Advice on fall recruiting.  Recruiting from a sub-par student POV.,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/128bjx/advice_on_fall_recruiting_recruiting_from_a/,"Hello,

I wanted to give my life story from accounting.  You guys may smirk and say ""I've seen this a million times.""  But to be honest.. I don't think you have.  Not trying to prop myself up to be awesome, but I think I saw a post like this, it would've really helped me out confidence wise; and given me a framework to getting that job.

I went to a small school, didn't network, partied my way through college.  Had a 3.2 GPA. Didn't receive any interviews.

Undergrad: I didn't go to class.  I focused more on having fun, partying, drinking, smoking weed, and enjoying life.  School was secondary.  I did shitty in all my accounting classes. Went through fall recruiting my senior year. Received an internship offer from a shitty CPA firm with a total of 10 people.  They literally picked me because I was the only one left.

When I graduated I was jobless, living at home, hating life.

Found a little internship at minimum wage in something not accounting related.  Being that was the only thing in my life at the time, I rocked that shit.  Cleaned house, I currently work there making 20/hr.

While there I decided I should go back to school and get that 5th year.  Took the GMAT, barely passed. Got into a program that had only been around 2 years before.  Decided I needed to rock that shit too.  Took my classes serious, asked my teachers for help on anything I didn't understand.  Then I started going to BAP, networking, getting in good with recruiters, showing my party mentality.  Pretty  much being myself.

Let's fast forward to recruiting season.  Recruiters knew who I was, liked me as a person, not necessarily as an associate.  Then I spent countless hours on my resume -- close to about 100 probably.  These 100 hours involved research, finding buzzwords, formatting, font that was appealing (aggressive, but welcoming).  Submitted my resume to a 6 firms.  They all pretty much have heard who I was just because I'm a pretty outgoing guy.  Then they saw my 3.95 GPA.  

They knew who I was as a person, knew I could kill it in the classroom when I tried (which I did, pulling multiple all nighters).  They all decided to bring me in for an interview.  In the interview I had my typical elevator speech prepared, along with a vision of where I wanted to be.  5/5 in first rounds.  In fact, 5/5 in final rounds.  The one firm that didn't interview me said they didn't want to bring me in because they knew the career track I was on and knew right away I wouldn't be a good fit.  Too bad, because that was my #1 pick - a local firm.  Anyways, fuck them.

I interviewed at 2 big 4's, 2 regional, 2 small.  I'm in a position to pick where I want to spend my career.  The firms who didn't interview me in the undergrad were trying their hardest to get me to apply.  

Advice to get interview: Get involved with recruiters, go out to lunch (on their tab), coffee, anything.  That will get you in.  Even if you have a horrible GPA.  Just show that you're human and that you had a low GPA because you didn't focus.  But the key is to KILL IT in your 5th year.  

Once you get the interview: They know you can do the job.  Now its to see if your goals in life align with the firm, and if you'll fit in.  Don't be nervous in the interview.  I could write another post just on interviewing itself. In fact, I will at a later time.  

Long story short: You don't have to be superman when it comes to getting a job, you just have to show that when you are passionate about something, you absolutely destroy it.  Am I passionate about accounting? No, absolutely not.  I'm passionate about life.  But I realize the the opportunities in public accounting will enable me to be passionate about life.

If you show you want to be with an accounting firm long term, and you fit the culture, you'll get the job.  Every firm as a recipe for their perfect candidate.  Do your research about the firm and turn into a chameleon.

I just wanted to post this to give the person who doesn't know what they want to do with their life, and did shitty in school, some hope.

Quick advice: if you do shitty in undergrad, work for a year and gain PROFESSIONAL experience.  Then get that 5th year, then you'll be sitting pretty. Because you just don't lean about the technical aspect of the job, you learn how to communicate professionally.  Take that shitty job even if you have a degree in accounting, and they pay you minimum wage.  You will feel down about yourself, but that's okay -- it will serve as a motivator. 

Sorry for the long post, but a lot of my friends couldn't get jobs in accounting.  I feel I was able to help them out, now I want to help out the people of reddit.  I'm sure I'll get some flack from other people in their jobs currently, but its not them telling you why you aren't good for accounting; it's about wedging yourself into a position for success, and then getting what you feel is yours.  

Now I'm going to crack a beer and watch some football. Because THAT IS WHAT LIFE IS ABOUT!

Edit: I'm on the East Coast, New York area.

I'm sure you get questions like this all the time in this subreddit, but here goes. I'm a 20 y.o. 1.5-generation Indian-American male (born in India, but moved to the States when I was 4; no trace of an accent, don't speak my mothertongue, etc.) studying at a top-tier university on the West Coast. I'm thinking of coming to Singapore for a summer internship with a financial company. What should I expect?

Specifically, I have four questions:

First, renting: I've heard that some Singaporean landlords are racist and refuse to rent to Indians. Is this true? For the record, I'm really Americanized (read: wear deodorant, don't cook smelly curry, don't push and shove other people in queues), but would that matter to a potential landlord?

Secondly, language: I understand that Singaporeans speak English, but would it be a good idea for me to brush up on, say, Mandarin before coming? (I learned some in high school, but it's a bit rusty at the moment).

Thirdly, dating: is it true that Singaporean girls/women only want light-skinned guys and wouldn't give a brownie like me a second glance? I have a pretty conservative attitude towards dating (looking for exclusive, monogamous relationships, no one-night-stands or drunken hookups). Is Singapore a good place for a guy with my outlook to find romance?

Lastly, socializing: What do Singaporeans do for fun? How can I get out and meet people in my age group, given that I don't attend a Singaporean university? What is the bar/club scene like, and what are attitudes toward social alcohol consumption?

Thanks so much."

I want them mainly as a flat alternative to the pumps I usually wear to my internship, but since I'm picky about shoes and tend to spend more money on them than on my other clothes, I would also like to be able to wear them more casually. At work, I tend to wear pencil skirts, blazers, cardigans, and blouses, sometimes slacks—unfortunately I don't have any pictures, but think very J Crew. My casual style is dark skinny jeans, skirts (most of them are slightly more structured), solid colored t-shirts, sweaters, cardigans, blazers, casual button-downs... kind of a hipster-preppy-New England look. I can take some pictures later if any are wanted.

Here are some examples of the style shoe I like:

1287qa,2,2012-10-28,I'm getting a B.S. in Neuroscience. What can I do after I graduate given my situation?,narcey,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1287qa/im_getting_a_bs_in_neuroscience_what_can_i_do/,"Basically, I'm currently an undergraduate student working towards my B.S. in Neuroscience, originally planning to go to Med school. 

However, now that I'm in my Junior year and hitting the bulk of my bio-like courses, it's not going well. This week I was forced to drop one of my courses - Neural Mechanisms of Disease - for fear of getting a D. My transcript is full of B's and as such my GPA isn't very strong either. For these reasons, although I like being in a hospital setting (I did a clinical internship outside of the US where I got some real experience and a proper feel for what being a doctor is like and I liked it) I don't see myself getting into med school or being able to succeed and become a doctor. Even if I did, I found that I wasn't interested in Neurology or Psychiatry too much but I really only enjoyed learning about hydrocephalus and brain cancer and surgery related to those specifically.

So I'm not sure if I should still try to get into Med school and if I should follow through if I'm accepted. I've been trying to see what else I could do after I graduate that may be somewhat related to my major (It's too late to switch). The thought of going to graduate school for Psychology or Neuroscience (and have a career as a researcher) seems equally daunting and I'm not sure that I even want to do that considering the difficulty I'm having with the biology portion of my major and the just lacking enough interest I have in psychopathology.

So my question is, what else could I do? Should I get a minor in business administration or management and try to go for a managerial/consultant type job in an R&amp;D setting? Should I do what my parents are saying - take whatever course to fulfill your elective credits requirement, don't have a backup plan and just go to med school and think of nothing else? I've also been looking at teaching English in places like Japan and what not, but that's only a temporary solution at minimal pay - just mentioning that I wanted to take 3 TESOL courses got an extremely negative reaction from my parents.
I'm really at a loss of what to do, so if you have any suggestions I would love to hear them.
Thank you."

**The guy friend who treats me like I'm an idiot:**

I was talking to B, a close male cousin of mine on Facebook. Eventually we start talking about juggling university life, work, and internships (we're both uni students, he in his second year and me in my third. I'm 21 and he's 19, but I took a gap year after graduating high school). I start talking about paid vs. unpaid internships, and here's his response verbatim:

B: Paid ofc didnt study math econ for shit

B: u art students are almost free all week""

*(He refers to me as an art student because I've been making films since  2005, and am going to university to learn and connect with fellow filmmakers)*

B: yeah arts is shit easy na

B: maths/econ is hardd

B: maths = theorems

B: and proof

B: i make proof

B: i make theorems

B: ure argument irrelevent

B: = u noob

B: = me pro and math econ gg""

Me: your problem is that you think intelligence/skill can be defined by just one factor, when it's multi-faceted

B: my ""problem"" is that i cant stop talkin to bitches who think arts is hard

Me: I'm not even gonna bother xD a debate is wasted on you

B: Thank God. Women just REFUSE to see logic

B: Come on man

B: u know maths is the language of logic

B: and women just plain suck at it

B: we MEN

B: u stupid tiny girlies

We have this conversation almost every single time we speak. And he constantly brings up his SAT score, which was near perfect (2200 – 2300 I think. I got 1700, is that really horrendous?) Every time I try to have a conversation about intelligence or competence, he just brings up his score and daunts me with my “noob SAT score”. 

What drives me nuts is I know I'm a smart kid – I'm well-read, I interact with people from all walks of life and disciplines and talents, not just “arts” (I'm studying Film &amp; TV at an arts university, but his idea of the arts is literally just painting). I have a multitude of hobbies and interests outside of just filmmaking, but it makes me crazy that despite all this, their self-righteous attitude still gets to me. I feel like for some stupid reason I still have to try to validate myself to these jerks.

I was raised in California, and he has spent his entire life in Pakistan, so I understand the mentality is different, but constantly taking this from him is just exhausting and ridiculous.

EDIT: I've known B my whole life, since diaper-times. I know I'm one of the only girls he talks to like this (I imagine he playfully insults his older sister). When is comes to more feminine girls, he's suddenly much meeker and sensitive. It's kind of annoying, especially since I do act more tomboy-ish around people I'm very close to, but that doesn't mean I should be treated any worse.

**The guy friend who thinks I owe him sex because he's nice to me:**

There's a guy in my class (let's call him C.) C has a crush on me, and he mentions it to me every single chance he gets. He's admitted he only attracted to me because I don't return the feeling. (Ugh.) I've told him many times that I'm flattered, but I simply don't want to 'date' him or even try to. He always says we should “run away some place together” or that I should come over and he'll cook dinner “which will seduce me” etc. I've told him I'm uncomfortable with his compliments and come-ons, and that I don't like being talked to that way.

Then of course he gets frustrated and asks me to explain in great detail WHY I'm not attracted to him. The thing is, I cannot CONTROL who I feel attracted to. I don't have a check-list of traits and features I look for in a guy, and if the guy and I get along well, it doesn’t mean I'll instantly want to date him or have sex with him. I've fallen for a rude hairy fat man, and for a skinny sweet white guy. I can't control it. I told him all this, and then he gets mad at me for not being able to articulate it better.

He apologizes the next day every time this happens (usually we have this conversation when he's high or drunk) and he keeps asking me “why don’t you like me? Tell me what is wrong with me” and I keep trying to explain that just because I don't want to sleep with someone doesn't mean there's something wrong with them.

Despite all this, and even after I telling him constantly that I will never be interested in him in that way, he continues to come-on to me and give me sexual compliments and generally make me feel uncomfortable (I'm pretty sure he just doesn’t' realize it, because he is a nice person otherwise).

 I feel that maybe I'm too polite when I try to tell him to stop, but I don't want to be rude or make him feel like he's disgusting or anything.

I told C a few weeks ago that I'm interested in another guy named D (we chatted online, and since have been texting regularly, but haven't met in person yet) and he constantly asks me about “the boy”. “Where are you taking the boy/the cherry-picker for Halloween?” “You should take him to A.C. (a sex club)” “You should take him to that sushi place on ETC. street, and then go for a walk on ETC. boulevard”. Basically C keeps giving me advice on dating D, advice that I didn't ask for. And he refers to this guy as the 'cherry-picker' because I'm a virgin and he's convinced that D is the guy I’m going to 'finally lose it to'. (I haven't even *met* D yet!)

It feels good to get all of that out. I'm not even going to bother talking about the third guy (who I live with) because that's going to take too much out me. Another time for sure! I'm just really glad that there's a space on reddit for girls to rant :) "

I'm an intern for Icelandair and last summer a plane popped in that I didn't expect. It was a DC3, it was there for a minor checkup.

We were a few interns along with fully qualified technicians that got to work on it. 
Once the week long checkup was done the pilots came in and we started chatting. Turns out they were going to a small airplane festival that was literally across the street from a music festival we were going to. We jokingly asked if we could hitch a ride. Which they agreed to surprisingly.

The plane got pushed out and all of a sudden we heard a LOUD bang. But couldn't find out what it was. Everything checked out and they decided to fly over to the capital which is only ~hours driving distance away from our hangar. That's where we would meet up with them and go to the festival.

When we got there they told us they had bad news. The bang was the lock for the rear landing gear. and the pin had been in while the tug driver tried to turn it. Shearing the pin.

We did NOT want it to end there and started looking at the damage. They told us they had an extra pin laying around somewhere. So we sent them out to find it while we spent the next 45minutes working the pin out.
We called our bosses and told them what was wrong, they told us that we didn't have a chance fixing it.

Well, the entire repair took us an hour with limited tools. 
We got moving and our 80+yo pilot just became young again behind the wheel. The take off in this plane felt really different from any other take off I've had, it was so much fun.  We were flying low just enjoying the view and the feeling of this plane. All of a sudden the pilot asked: ""Aren't you boys going to a festival?""
""uuuh yeah"". ""Then start drinking those beers you've got there in the back""

We got to the festival, the pilot did a few low passes, landed and let us exit in everyone's view. We felt like such badasses. 

After the festival we got a ride home too. But the last pic shows the state of the party area, it was incredible how little people cared about what they were doing, or left behind.

I've worked on that plane again since then. I definitely hope I get to ride along again sometime.

Hope you enjoyed it."

I am a Dutch Commercial Economics (Sales) student - Looking for internship. ,BillyDekkers,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/127xl7/please_help_i_am_a_dutch_commercial_economics/,"As the title states, I'm a Dutch student. In februari I get to go on internship, anywhere in the world for a semester. The only thing I need is someone who is able to guide me during my internship. This guidance doesn't have to take long (maybe an hour a week), and is only to reflect how it's going.

So I can go take this internship in the city where I live. But I prefer to go abroad. I'd love to go on internship in an English-speaking country. I was thinking about the **United States, New Zealand, Australia or Canada.**

So what will I be doing for those who will accept me as their trainee? I can do a wide variety of assignments in the field of Commerce and sales. I got some examples:

- Organize some of these: A day for business partners, Direct-Mailing campaign, Social Media campaign.
- (conduct) Market-research
- Look for possibilities for export
- Research one (or more) of the following matters: customer satisfaction, effectivity of promotion, purchase-analysis, analyzing product-line, etc.

Or course I’ll be able to do a lot of other tasks/jobs, as long as they’re commerce or sales-related. I’m open for recommendations.
If there is anyone that can help me, or knows someone who can help me with getting an internship, I’d be very glad. Please react to this post, or send me a personal message here on Reddit. We’ll be discussing my internship farther from then.

I hope I have provided enough information. If not, please tell me so. 

If there are any other Redditors from one of these countries, that want to do an internship in the Netherlands during the same time, we might be able to help each other out!

My mind is turning on itself and I'm starting to break down",poopyfarts,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/127m6o/19th_day_of_no_weed_no_fap_and_no_gaming_my_mind/,"People told me to do it one at a time but I kept find myself falling back into the classic cycle--&gt; Smoke, Play Games, Fap, Overeat, Nap, Play Games, Fap, Smoke, Overeat, Repeat in no particular order while completely ignoring any personal issues, escaping responsibility, procrastinating, and closing the door into my own self-built virtual world of addictions until problems continue to pile up and someone bails me out.

I was done. If I smoked then I was tempted to overeat and play games, If i play game I was tempted to fap or smoke, if I fapped I got lazy and would fall back into gaming and smoking. All the addiction fed off each other so I needed to quit them all.

My mind was fucked up from the cycle. I was out of touch of reality. I no longer had any hope or faith in anything in my life. All I wanted was pleasure. I was lonely. Isolated. Angry. Sad. Only time I was happy was when I was caving in, overstimulated with what ever came up on my monitor.

At first it wasn't too bad. I hit the gym every other day, followed a very good diet, stayed busy. I noticed as I smoke less my desire to escape into virtual pc game world lessened too. The porn was hard to get off from at first, but I wanted to use it as a practice hoping the discipline would translate to other areas of my life. Also wanted more mental clarity, and less bitch-ass-ness that comes from low testosterone and low sex drive.

I didn't focus on meditating or reading books and shit like I did before. I didn't go to marijuana anonymous meetings because all they talk about is how great the meetings are but never really get into any real juicy issues. Wanted to just spend the first 2 or 3 weeks detoxing before getting into rebuilding my mind.

Things were getting better. Covered shifts at work. Got an internship. Started dropping fat from diet and exercise. Then I met a girl. We had a lot of wild sex. Too much. She was a negative girl and it rubbed off on me. My mind was vulnerable without its usual fillers and was sensitive to any new incoming information.


I noticed even after we had sex, my mind was still trying to find a way to keep the high going. I started craving weed. I smoked once to bond with the girls friends, but I told myself no more for at least 2 months because I had immediately desired more the next day. 

When I went home my mind was still looking for a chaser, and it found one: Anger. Things got really violent with me and my Mom and I got kicked out of my house. I don't have any family besides her so I stayed at this chicks house, but she didn't know me to understand what I was going through, so I bounced and now I've been sleeping in my car the last 2 nights.

Halloween weekend, 24 years old, young, handsome, smart, passionate, yet somehow I managed to spend every holiday alone this year. It really got me down. I was skating down venice beach just wishing someone would bump into me so I could beat the shit out of them. I tried meditating but just ended up cursing at God and knocking down signs and trashcans. 

Grew up an only child with no family, so I have a habit on sitting alone feeling sorry for myself that's hard to break. Depression is my baseline emotion. I'm very up and down, Some say I'm bipolar, others say I'm an asshole, but it's hard for me to be in between. PEople love going to parties with me but never stick around on regular days when I just want a friend to hang out with. 

I know the weed made it worse. It was clouding my dreams, giving me suicidal thoughts, childhood flashback, inferiority complexes. Started having more and more violent fantasies.


Sober on my 18th day ( I smoke once but fuck it ill say 17th, I'm not gonna start over just because of 2 puffs) under a full los angeles moon I feel horrible. I pulled up some porn to get a quick good feeling in, but I commited to my effort and closed the porn and put my dick away.  I also broke my cell phone in rage, so for the last 4 nights I've been without a home or any kind of communication with people besides email.

Suicidal thoughts are reigning my mind tonight. If things don't get better in a year from now I'm killing myself. Whatever it is that people need in order to live happily, well, I'll be convinced I don't have it. I hate that the holidays are coming up, I'd rather be out causing mayhem than spending another thanksgiving or new years crying in my room.

Until then I guess it's time to get into some recovery. Get a sponsor for my weed problem. Try to understand what my mind is going through without having porn or gaming to escape into. Try to accept the lost years of my life, lost opportunities, and dreams I threw in the gutter. My whole life was built around these addictions, and without them, I don't know what to do with my life. I'm scared, and I'm lazy.

I really just want to feel good. Just close my eyes a disappear from the world. I don't have much hope for anything. Maybe my bipolar has me swinging really low again. I'm tired of the mood extremes.  Going to yoga tomorrow morning, hopefully I get an epiphany or that the universe flows love into my life, it's the only thing that slows down my anger---&gt; my rage addictions being the final frontier. I learned this last few weeks I have no business trying to date any chicks, nothing more than hookups if I can even get that. 

Just going through a really hard time with all this right now, on top of not having a place to stay, finding out I got kicked out of my college and cant reapply til fall 2013, and seeing the white girl who only worked at my job 3 months get promoted where I've been working 1.5+ years. My mind is looking for victims, an outlet, I don't know. I hate everything and everyone right now. I just hope all of this is worth it, and that I find a better way to live, and have love and success in my life."

He's more experienced than I in the relationship department. The only thing I want to be is on the same page before I leave. If it turns into a serious relationship I want him to know that he will be on my mind, and not a burden (he's mentioned this as a worry) while experiencing this new internship/job. I also don't want to be jealous or worried that he's talking to other girls and such. This is only the second guy I've dated seriously so far, and I really would like it to work out. I know I'm coming back, I just want him to know I'm interested in making it work and being faithful, hoping he'd do the same.

Here is the post:

*The presidential race shouldn't be this close. This is the most important election in the history of our country by far. This is a lengthy post, but it's 100% fact and scary to think about.

Obama has racked up $6 trillion in debt through failed bailouts, run away spending, and Obamacare. Just to put this into perspective he has outspent George W. Bush in 3 years over Bush's 8. He has racked up mo
re debt than the 1st-42nd president COMBINED.

Proclaimed to Vladmir Putin's aide that he would have more ""freedom"" after the election.

Has reduced America's nuclear missile count from 5,000 to 1,500, and plans on 0 nukes his second term. When Russia has 1,500 nukes, China 600, North Korea 90, and Iran is building nukes as this is written. Nukes are detrimental to deterring our enemies, and there are many of them compared to how many allies we have. Not to mention how much these enemies would love to wipe the United States off the map.

He also plans to cut our military spending in half. He's not doing this to save money, but to disarm the most powerful military in the world.

Obama doesn't care about our only ally in the middle east. He wouldn't care if Israel was taken over by the Islamic countries in that area. The state of the middle east is deteriorating fast.

Obama praises Muslims and has always recognized their holidays while acknowledging 0 Christian holidays, and yet he still proclaims himself Christian. It was a tactic to not scare the votes in 2008 and people still believe him to be Christian.

He has been mentored by a terrorist, Communists, and Socialists. Never by anyone who has/had a love for America.

He wants Americans to be dependent on the government. That's already working in a way. He has gotten many voters on his side because they don't want to lose their government benefits. This is absolutely ridiculous!

He's going to raise taxes to their highest levels in decades.

Unemployment is the highest it's been since the Great Depression.

The American dollar has lost 40% of its value while inflation has raised most prices on EVERYTHING by 2x their value. Gas prices have doubled.

Obama has gotten rid of NASA. One of Americas most iconic programs. NASA invents a lot of technology and learning more about space and our planet only helps us as Americans and as a species. I'd say this was an extremely anti-American move.

Romney is leading in the polls by about 6 points, but the election shouldn't be this close. If Americans were still true to their values that once made this country so great this should be a landslide election with no contest.

I can't believe about 46-47% of all Americans who are likely to vote for Obama are this ignorant. Can other people not see this? Do almost half of all Americans really hate their country? Do they want to see it fall like the Roman empire, British empire and Greece once had?

Obama is anti-American and does not love America. We let a traitor take seat in the greatest country in the world. We need to vote him out before he does this country anymore harm.

Above all, Obama wants to turn America into a 3rd world country ruled by Communists or Socialists, and so far nothing is stopping him. The good thing is, is that we have a choice come November 6th. We can continue on this route to Socialism/Communism or go back to the American values that once made this country truly great.*








**This was going to be my response:**

*Broadening view by sections of your post. (Each empty line separates sections.)
Section 1) Your opinion, no need to state mine.

Section 2) Spending on capital goods boosts the economy and increases the real GDP in the long run.

Section 3&amp;4) Every country would have more freedom in a world without militaries. It would allow us to allocate more resources to production instead of destruction. Unfortunately as the human race we aren’t at that point yet. In the cold-war era the US created more than 70,000 warheads. The nuclear count has been decreasing regularly since then.

Section 5) Cutting our military spending in half would save approx. $300 billion (http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BUDGET-2009-BUD/pdf/BUDGET-2009-BUD-11.pdf) and leave us at over 2 times the spending of the next closes military spender. (http://defense.aol.com/2012/03/16/the-military-imbalance-how-the-u-s-outspends-the-world/ )

Section 6,7,8 &amp; 9) Not sure where these came from or if it is just opinion.

Section 10) Raising taxes is always associated with being bad. Taxing the upper class may lower their disposable incomes slightly, but the money gained from doing so has the potential to help the US in many ways… and that income is only their disposable income.

Sections 11) Bureau of Labor Statistics seems to disagree. http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000 

Section 12) Gas prices are lower now than what they were 4 years ago near the election period. http://gasbuddy.com/gb_retail_price_chart.aspx 

Section 13) NASA is not gone. They are actually looking for interns right now. https://intern.nasa.gov/solar/web/public/main/index.cfm?solarAction=view&amp;subAction=content&amp;contentCode=HOME_PAGE_INTERNSHIPS. They have just changed somewhat. 

Section 14,15,16,&amp;17) Your opinion. Not going to try and change it.

Just trying to show other ways of looking at things.

**Writing Sample**
 
In the end it was the morticians who took the biggest casualties. This came as a surprise to almost everyone, particularly the morticians. They had banked on the fact there were only two constants in life, and they wanted to be less hated that those working for the Internal Revenue Service. But when taxes became the only thing left in life that you could count on, a whole profession suddenly became (for the most part) obsolete. Many agents of the IRS all felt justified in their decision to not to become morticians, and the more daring of them celebrated by leaving work 15 minutes early on a Friday and not reporting it on their time sheets.      

The person most confused by the entire turn of events was undoubtedly its catalyst, Illinois Tech Graduate student and Fermilab intern John Maynard. During a drunken bull session with his fellow physics grad students, he claimed he could turn on the now inactive Tevatron. Always sticklers for actual results, his friends reminded him nothing could be claimed as proven until it had been reproduced with a 3-sigma level of uncertainty and then reviewed by a group of the discoverer’s peers. Basically “We’ll believe it when we see it.” Emboldened by a sense of wounded pride and around 10oz of brandy, John angrily walked the short distance from his on-site housing to the control room. Due to his inebriation and the broken status of several security cameras, exactly what he did to get the defunct particle accelerator up and running will forever be a mystery. The result of his drunken bravado was something that no one could have possibly foreseen. The world’s greatest scientists all claim that they can now explain exactly what happened but the common consensus is that they are lying. Suffice it to say that some great energy was unleashed, and no one is sure how, or why, it works. Nikola Tesla once claimed the Earth was a giant conductor, and if he weren’t dead he’d feel vindicated. Well if he hadn’t been dead so long. The result of Mr. Maynard’s fiddling was that suddenly the Earth produced, and conducted, electricity. Oddly it seemed to have little effect on wildlife, but it did have one huge effect on humans. Primarily the newly deceased. Any neuroscientist worth his salt will tell you that without oxygen the brain will die within minutes. Despite that the Maynard Event (as it is now called in non-scientific circles) causes all those who have been dead less than a week to return to an animated state. The US government declared it a great achievement for American science, but refused to increase the budget for the department of education.   
  

Andrew Washington’s last memory was being left on the cold cement outside the emergency room, writhing with the pain from his gut. It had been perforated by several small balls of lead during the botched robbery of a liquor store. So when he awoke to total darkness in a small box, he was at first surprised that he was no longer in pain. The second surprise was that he was in a coffin and wearing a suit. Over the next few days he came to realize he no longer had need for food, water or sleep. Andrew also realized that people can’t hear you through several feet of dirt. It was mostly by luck and the poor economic situation of his family that he was buried in a grave that was shallower than is allowed by regulations. So after about five days someone heard his yelling and incessant pounding and ran for the cemetery manager.

It's been tough, but we managed to communicate effectively, neither of us have cheated, and we've never broken up before. The one thing we do fight about is the amount of alone time we have.

Both of us are living at home. I just returned from 4 months abroad, and am now completing a post-grad project, applying for jobs and internships, and saving up money to move out (hopefully) after the new year. During my time abroad, I had no real desire to cheat, and almost turned off my sexual side completely, and rarely even felt the need to masturbate. 

He has been living at home for almost 18 months, and working at a job that he doesn't really enjoy, but pays him well. He constantly texts me suggestively, tries to initiate sexual contact when we're together, and always suggests I dress more provocatively. The combination of the stress of finishing my project, looking for a job, and living with my parents has put a huge dent in my desire for intimacy. My mind is constantly on work, and when he tries to initiate, it shifts to panic about my/his parents interrupting. Where some people get a rush from sneaking around, I feel almost disrespectful to be doing that in my parent's house. I had no problem when we would fool around in high school. 

So r/relationship_advice, am I a robot? Is there a good way to turn off work and turn on sex? Is there a good way to get around the guilt of fooling around in our parents' homes?  

TL;DR Underemployed BF and I live with our parents, and I have a hard time getting turned on. Work anxiety + threat of getting caught = ladyboner kill. Help!"

I have endured sexual harassment, almost daily ridicule because I accepted student loans and am therefore ""living off the government"" (I accept no aid except for my school-based expenses) and arbitrary and misdirected temper-tantrums from my boss - but have dealt with it, as it comes with the territory of being a server.  

I have worked at my current job for over a year and a half, and have been a good employee, had no complaints from either customers or coworkers, &amp; have generally worked my ass off (up to 10 shifts a week through this past May because we were short-handed, and about 4-8 shifts a week through the summer) and have a current availability of 2-7 shifts even with my current semester load of 17 hours. 

 My boss hit the roof when he found out I was returning to school.  There was some initial issues with working out when I could\couldn't work, and I was pulled aside and asked to be sure I had put in when I couldn't work, but was  promised that I would ""get anything [I] wanted"" as far as scheduling, as long as I put in the days I needed off in the request book.  My schedule started to suffer, and at first I wasn't worried because I only needed to work 3-4 shifts per pay period to make my budget.   I didn't request off any days one week because all my professors were either in conferences or allowing us to work on group semester projects on our own time - I had full availability, and fully intended to work whatever shift I was scheduled.  That week, I was scheduled for only one shift.  I haven't been scheduled for the 2+ weeks following.  My last shift was October 14.  I have not been contacted about my schedule, questioned about my availability or received any communication about why my hours have been cut.  

I have started to apply for other jobs, but my student status will make finding something that works with my schedule difficult, unless I can get a job tutoring or as a paid intern (ha,ha - although I'm a programming major so this is a possibility).  I've heard that when an employer forces you to quit rather than firing you, it is wrongful termination.  I know it is upheld in this state, but have no idea what I should do, where I should start.  The ESC has no information about this on their website.

I just graduated from college this past May. During my last year of school, I was involved in a very abusive relationship, both physically and emotionally. This guy had once been one of my best friends but things slowly got worse and worse as his alcohol addiction increased. Aside from the physical part, he often told me all the things that were wrong with me. I ate too much, talked too much. I was annoying. I wasn't very pretty and he had a list of girls he wished I looked like. Eventually, I realized that I had no friends left because of this relationship. It was hard to leave him, because I didn't want to be alone. He was horrible and I hated him, but at least he was there. I finally managed to leave him right after graduation. One former friend stuck around long enough after that to tell me that 1) everything was mainly my fault because I never stood up for myself and 2) there were tons of times that my bf had tried to cheat on me that I didn't know about. I begged this friend to stay with me anyways, because I didn't want to be alone, but he left. I never heard back from him.

I moved back home with my family to look for a job and my own place. I didn't really know what I wanted to do or where I wanted to be. I just wanted to get far away and fast. My family was in the process of moving to another state, so I thought I might as well go with them. There were still several months to go before the official move.

I had been home maybe a few weeks when I was contacted by an old friend. We had known each other pretty much our whole lives, and dated twice before. We started spending time together, and I was really happy, in love even. He asked me to stay here, so that we could be together. At the last minute, I changed plans. I arranged to stay with a friend here until I could find work and a place to live. I knew that once work started for me we wouldn't get to see much of each other. He was still in school, working, and doing an internship. 

Fast forward to now. I'm working at a job I absolutely hate, which technically is supposed to be done by three people. I'm stressed all the time, and free time is all but non existent. I found an apartment, but both my apartment and work are in a city about an hour away from where my bf lives and works. My family has moved. The last time I spoke to the bf was a month ago. I finally cracked and told him about my last relationship and he came over to talk. I haven't heard from him since. I told myself that he's just really busy. But when I got on facebook the other day, I saw pictures of him going out with friends. He's apparently been to the city I live in, and never said anything to me about it.

I'm really struggling. I try to make friends but I almost never have time, and when I do, I find it's hard for me to talk to people now. I feel so hurt, mad, confused, alone. There's no one here I can talk to. My job sucks. Some days, I get home and have a massive panic attack at the thought of going back the next day. We found out recently that we'll be open the days before and after Christmas, so I won't get to go see my family for the holidays. 

I'm most hurt my my bf's apparent abandonment. I texted him a week or so ago, and I mailed him a letter. Nothing. I'm mad at hI'm and myself. He's broken my heart twice before. I brought this on myself. Yesterday, I typed out a letter to him, letting him know that I was hurt, he's an asshole, a bad friend, and I regretted staying. I don't know if I should send it. It's polite, but sort of long. I don't want to come off as whiny. I don't want him to think I'm begging for his attention. I'm not. If he wants to talk to me, he would, and I've come to terms with that. And I'm still having trouble standing up for myself. Part of me wants to send it. Part of me thinks I should wait until he finally contacts me and then let him have it.  There's no one here I can ask for advice.

I'm tired of feeling like shit because of a relationship, and I'm just tired. I don't know where to go from here."

I have been offered an internship with my state's DPS Department of Criminal Investigations (basically the state's premier investigative branch- all the big cases are handled by them and it should be pretty exciting work) my 1L summer. On the one hand, it is not specifically legal work, but I am looking to go into prosecution, and I think making some connections in the DCI would be a good benefit for me going forward. Also, it is (minimally) paid, which is a real bonus. Because it is not law work, do you think it would be a waste of time? Do you think it might preclude me from getting an internship with a firm or law office my 2L summer, because I was not a ""Legal Intern"" my 1L summer?

Any advice would be much appreciated.

Omitted/changed a lot of information for anonymity, hopefully the context still makes sense. 

I've had nobody to really talk to or vent to about all the shit going on over the past year. I’m usually the one people call when they have bullshit in their life, but I feel like I have made nothing but stupid decisions lately. In the summer I moved 1500 miles from home to attend Uni. I feel as if it has been the singlemost stupid, ill-prepared decision I have ever made in my life, and I wish I had known this in retrospect to keep me from living 300 miles from the nearest city with no money, gas, job opportunities, and barely any food. 

I came here with $100 to my name after gas and with whatever I could fit in my car. I found extremely cheap rent and I needed to get away from my chaotic life, so I moved early and started at a jr. college about half an hour away because I needed 1 class to finish transfer. I registered for 12+ units to become full time and was expecting to get Financial Aid as I had at my previous jr. college, but lo and behold because of the new policies, I have been denied FA and all subsequent appeals -- and this school offers no private loans. After weeks of fighting with them, I’m over it and gave up. My family, not well off either, have been sending me what they can, when they can. I haven't told them yet that I stopped going to classes because I can't afford the gas to go there anymore. They think the money is helping me pay rent, which I haven't paid in 3 months. I don’t want them to know how ashamed I am right now or how desperately I need money. My car insurance is gone. I’m waiting for when my phone gets shut off. One room mate of mine I've known for 4 years, so he has been supportive. But I feel that I’m standing on the edge of the abyss here, and that his friendly optimism will eventually grow tired.

I've been desperately looking for jobs, but being a small college town, I feel that I'm extremely outmatched and outnumbered. I was lucky enough to land a job in my profession right out of high school, so I have no experience in retail or restaurants. I started to joke with my family that you need a degree to be a dishwasher, but that's what it feels like. And now, because I followed my passion I feel it has bitten me in the ass. I can't find any source of income, and 99% of the scholarships I find aren’t helpful. When I'm in good spirits, I look for 8 hours a day, and get discouraged when I do nothing but apply for jobs I know I have no chance of getting. When I do find something I might be qualified for, I never hear back. I've been editing, modifying, and doing everything short of straight up lying on my resume to find a job. I've been living off of PB&amp;J, nicotine, and water for 2 months, and my hope and patience are dwindling.

Out of high school I started working for a small start-up NPO paid internship that did field work and I had been admitted to a jr. college program that I loved. My parents divorced while I was there, and a bunch of horrible shit came out about our family. So my classmates and the internship I had been at for 4 years became my new family until my real one could heal. I couldn’t balance school time and the NPO anymore, so I had to quit my job, even though my boss wanted me to stay, she was very understanding. Then we graduated, and the NPO couldn’t afford to hire me back on. 

Everything up until this point have been miracles. I felt like the luckiest person alive to get into my field early and have so many opportunities. My career is everything to me. My first job I landed I was uncomfortable with from almost the beginning, but the income was exactly what I needed to survive and pay off some backdebt for being unemployed. I started to question my career choice because this environment was not positive at all. I didn't get along with anybody in my department, even though I just kept my head down and mouth shut most of the time. I started to lose the plot and ended up quitting before I was fired, because I couldn't handle the stress anymore of my boss and his ridiculous expectations, constant flip-flopping on policies and then yelling at me for “not knowing them”, and other bullshit. 

Examples I think I can share: a few of us were scheduled to work on holidays, which is expected in my field. I was scheduled to work every single holiday. Fine, whatever, I'm the lowest man on the totem. But everybody else scheduled with me all called out on every single holiday, and I ended up working every single holiday by myself, so I ended up being there for 8 hours when the idea was to only be there 3 hours max and go home. When I talked to the boss about it, he basically said just take your holiday pay and shut up. I ended up being sexually harassed by my boss as well, which only gave real concrete reason to why I needed to leave (and I’m a guy, so it wasn’t something I didn’t feel like I could report because I doubted anyone would care anyway). 

I was a light smoker trying to quit, maybe 3-5 cigs a day, until I started working here. By the end, I started to not give a fuck, and let my anger and frustration take over. I took smoke breaks constantly. I was smoking over a pack a day, the most I ever have. I became basically the worst employee there, and I knew it, some people I knew from other departments sympathized (other smokers, which is why I was out there often). In the end, this job was a waste of time. Even the people I thought that liked me don't return any of my attempts to contact them after I left. My only reference is HR, because as far as I know they think the only reason I left was to pursue school. 

So seeing how horrible this place was right after starting my employment, I decided I should return to school and pursue undergrad work so I could do something beyond being a lowly grunt. I feel like a BS in my field is actually very useful and can open up all kinds of job opportunities for me at 3x the pay. In reality I just wanted to leave that job as soon as possible, but still have something going for me. I put in my applications and was conditionally accepted to all my school choices (because of that 1 class I was missing), and went to my #1 choice. Because I was working up until I left on my 1500 mile road trip, I didn't have time or the extra money to even go check out the area, campus, or anything. I decided to just wing it and hope for the best. I had second thoughts every day until I finally got into my car and started driving. 

Almost immediately when I got here, I found a job from a lady who was looking for someone in my profession. But because they had an unlicensed business, they paid me under the table. I knew it was shady, but it was income. Or so I thought. They told me first they would pay me $xxx a week, and then a week later said it would be $xx an hour. It was like they hadn't decided. That scared me slightly, but I went for it, knowing this might be the only opportunity I had to find relevant work here. Over the course of 2-3 weeks, I was being called in rather impulsively to work. I just did odd tasks that they needed an extra hand with, they kept saying ""we should have time to train you next week"" and being told about how I’ll be getting more hours and other too-good-to-be-true bullshit. After 3 weeks and giving them about 30 hours of work, I finally got paid. $50. I was irate, but they didn’t know, since I never look at my checks until I get into my car. They said they would pay me ""as we could"", but they haven't called me since I left the day I was paid.

I don't know where to go from here. I was hoping dropping my classes would help me too, I lost out on the one and only other job opportunity I had since being here (at a pet store). I made it to a second interview but I’m guessing because they possibly didn’t like my school schedule I wasn’t hired (based on the hiring manager’s reaction when she saw my schedule, anyway), despite claiming they would work around that. There's places hundreds of miles away I can find more work in my field, but I don't even have enough gas to leave this town, let alone get a down payment. I suppose this post is just my one last burst of hope, one last attempt at feeling validated to help mask my overwhelming sense complete failure. I feel like I’m being punished, or that I’m not selling myself efficiently, but I don’t know exactly what I’m doing wrong anymore, or how I can make it right.

I'm stuck, I can’t sleep, but I want this to work out, but the stars are simply not aligning for me. All I need is an income to bridge me from now until next fall, the next earliest possible time I can start at my uni and from there I can get FA due to their different standards from jr. colleges, internships, and all kinds of employment potential that I can’t even touch right now for not being a student. Honestly, the most horrifying thing to me right now is my roommate no longer tolerating me being here after all this. He was part of my pseudo family when my real one was falling apart. He’s one of my closest and only friends around here, and I want more than anything else to not have to walk away from this situation. I don’t want my cigarettes to be my only friend.

I just need somebody to give me a chance.

In about 2 or 3 of them, a person has come up and passed out slips of paper asking for contact information. While this is happening the person is giving a speech about how he/she represents an internship group (I don't think they ever specified) which is in the top 10 in the Princeton review ranking. Apparently it's a paid summer internship involving ""leadership skills.""

So this is all very vague and nameless which already got me suspicious but then on top of that, my professor in one class starts laughing as soon as they leave and says ""look, the best internships aren't going to be handing out papers and coming to you, ok? You will probably end up scrubbing toilets.""

So ya. They called me and I agreed to go to an information session. Assuming that doesn't put my suspicions to rest, how should I mess around with them during interviews?"
129d08,0,2012-10-29,Is transferring the best decision for me?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/129d08/is_transferring_the_best_decision_for_me/,"I'm thinking of transferring colleges. I made a list of pros and cons:

My Current College's Pros:

1. It's an academic powerhouse.
2. It has excellent networking.
3. I'm familiar with the campus and the people.
4. The campus itself is beautiful, along with the surrounding area.
5. I like the closeness of the community.
6. Both of my majors have strong programs.
7. There are a lot of on-campus activities and clubs.

My Current College's Cons:

1. I should have gone to my potential transfer college initially, due to health reasons.
2. Academically, it's much harder than it should be, and it's a high-stress environment.
3. My major programs are limited, including not much class selection. (It's a smaller school.)
4. I hate being sick when I'm so far away from home. (I was recently diagnosed with reactive hypoglycemia.)
5. I hate the lack of dorms that I can choose from, including no singles until Senior year.
6. I just don't love the school. I dread having to be there.
7. I'm really bored there, and I have almost no social life. (It's really cliquey.)
8. I don't have any close friends, or people that I can rely on, give or take one or two.
9. I will be absolutely miserable after graduation if I stay. I know I will be mentally and physically drained.
10. I prefer my hometown and city to where my college is located.
11. Being away from home stresses my parents out and creates more of a rift in their marriage.
12. My GPA is far lower than it could or should be.
13. Your undergraduate college doesn't really matter when it comes to salaries for jobs.
14. I can't get around my college's area well without a car. I'm constantly spending money on taxis.
15. I spend a lot of money at my current college just trying to get by. ($300.00 or more a month, for food, dorm supplies, etc.)
16. The administration is evil.
17. It's expensive to go to the school to begin with. (I would save about $10,000.00 by going to my potential transfer college, which I could use towards grad school, rent for when I move, etc.)

My Potential Transfer College Pros:

1. It's a fresh start.
2. The academics are much easier.
3. There are more clubs to join because it's a larger school.
4. I can go to the doctor's or physical therapy when I need to because I would be close by. (I can only go once every other month or so while at college.)
5. They still have good networking because of their size.
6. My parents would do my grocery shopping for me, meaning less money spent on food.
7. It's an up and coming school academically.
8. My best friend would be there, along with her college friends, who already like me, so I would already have an established group to join.
9. Their computer science program is fantastic, so if I worked with computers after graduation, (which I am considering), the name would be recognized.
10. There are more people, so I would make more friends.
11. I would have my best friend and her friends to work out with, and I would generally be healthier.
12. There is MUCH better housing, and I would almost be guaranteed a single.
13. There is better food there, and more gluten-free options. (I have Celiac's Disease.)
14. I would be near a large city, so I could go clubbing on the weekends, or out exploring the city. Also, internships would be more readily available.
15. I would still be independent because I would live on campus.
16. My parents would be much less stressed and could work on repairing their marriage. (They're currently going through a rocky point of their marriage.)
17. My GPA would sky rocket.
18. My parents TEND to be right on these sort of things, so I feel like I would regret not listening to them.
19. I would be far less tense and stressed.
20. I would save money, and I could make money by working for my grandfather, since he would be nearby. ($70.00 a week for just doing his laundry.)
21. My parents wouldn't move from my childhood home if I went to my potential transfer college.
22. I could come home easily if I needed to.
23. I would have a car.
24. There are more class opportunities.

My Potential Transfer College Cons:

1. Their psychology and sociology programs aren't quite as strong. (I'm double majoring.)
2. If I decided to go to grad school, it's reputation is less than my current college's reputation. 
3. I would have to go to community college next semester, and possibly during the summer, since my transfer credits are iffy.
4. I really love my current college's surrounding area, their traditions, and the animal shelter that I volunteer at that's near my college campus. I would really miss all of that.

I'm heavily leaning towards transferring because I think I would be SO much happier. At the same time, people would KILL to be at the college I am right now, and I feel almost stupid giving the spot up. Yet, I'm absolutely miserable when I'm there. Does transferring sound like the right decision?

**Tl;dr:** I hate my current college, yet it is renowned in the U.S. I want to transfer to an academically average college, but one that will make me MUCH happier. What should I do?

I did an internship at a power plant last summer and while I didn't mind the work, I didn't feel like it was particularly what I wanted to do with my career, and am now thinking I'd rather do something in the consumer electronics field, or possibly research.

To make a long story short-ish, my first relationship when I was 16 lasted until I was 21 (early last year) and was with a boy who was very very Catholic. At the time we started dating, I was not religious, but I was very insecure, so I was perfectly fine with agreeing to no sex before marriage. And that's how it went. Any time we would slip up and go ""too far"" (I'm talking making out and him grinding on me until he came in his pants here people), he would have incredible guilt and just absolutely withdraw into depression for some time. Once we got to college together, he imposed even stricter rules-making out was no longer allowed, because to him it resembled intercourse. We once stayed in a hotel room together when he came to visit me while I was on an internship, and we ""slipped up"" and grinded, fully clothed. I orgasmed, and he cried from the guilt. Anyway, I eventually converted to Catholicism, not necessarily ""for"" him but because of him. Like I said, this all lasted until early 2011, when I was 21. 

We broke up because he was considering the priesthood. I didn't take it well and had some flings and did some things that, looking back now, would not shame me at all. But at the time, my Catholic guilt absolutely tore me up. It also tore up my ex as well, as we were trying to uphold our friendship. At the end of my fling summer, he broke down and told me how much he worried, how much it hurt him to see me in such sin. I agreed with him, and threw myself into so much guilt, for so long over that summer.

Now I'm in a serious relationship with someone who has never been religious, and things are changing. I'm finally admitting to myself that Catholicism isn't something that is natural to me, and that it was something I did to please the man I thought I was going to marry.

 My new boyfriend and I lost our virginity to each other, and have an enjoyable and safe sex life. As we start looking into new things to explore (things we like, birth control methods, etc) however, I start feeling that old twinge of guilt, like I'm doing something terrible. At times, I feel like my body is gross and shameful, that there's no way my boyfriend could find it sexy. I feel like my libido is too high, like I'm some insatiable whore. Even that taking birth control is going to, I don't know, set my body on fire or something :P I feel like I never had a chance to develop a healthy view on sex- I always just shut it out my mind completely, by eliminating the media, music, friends, everything that the devil would supposedly use to ""tempt"" me. 

Almost all of my friends are still very devoted Catholics who would truly pity me if they found out I was ""giving in to sin"" having sex. And if they knew I was using condoms.... they would truly consider that to be like having an abortion. I know because I once considered it like that. I feel that, aside from my boyfriend and a few distant friends, I'm pretty alone on this. Sexxit/research/education outside of the church is really helping me, but I really feel like I'm starting anew on something that should be natural. How do I do this?"

As far as job experience goes, I just started interning at a very selective student impact investing/venture fund. I also have non-profit admin and fundraising experience, and anticipate being offered a budgeting position at a Federal bureau. I also think a local internship with Goldman Sachs would be attainable in the near future, and hope to work there or somewhere similar for ~3 years before grad school. I'm a good test taker (33 ACT) and am going to start studying for the GMAT ASAP.

My personal goals and experience thus far have mostly revolved around poverty reduction and 3rd world development (Stanford's SEED really appeals to me). I've already done volunteer work to this end and have a professor in the field as a mentor. Am I right thinking that this would be a good 'angle' to flesh out for applications?

Just from an MBA admissions standpoint, what should I start doing now, and what kind of activities would best help me improve my chances? I'm not really involved in any extracurricular activities right now, other than creative writing, which I would like to pursue more seriously. Would joining my school's Economics SAC benefit me? How about getting involved in Economics research?

 I probably will do a 2nd major too, but am unsure which would be the best choice in this context."
12990l,1,2012-10-28,How to choose grad program (Biology vs CS)?,deanat78,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/12990l/how_to_choose_grad_program_biology_vs_cs/,"Hello fellow bioinformaticians!
I'm going to blab on about my whole situation, but there's a TL;DR at the end if you want me to get to the point :)

I recently graduated from the a top CS university in Canada (Waterloo) with a bachelor of CS, Bioinformatics option. I had 5 internships throughout my undergrad career, and spent most of them in tech companies in Silicon Valley. When I graduated, I was lured into San Francisco by the big money, and that's what I've been doing for the past year. But I've realized that I don't particularly enjoy this too much, and that got me thinking about what I do like. I remember that in university I enjoyed some of my bio courses, I enjoyed some CS courses, but all the Bioinformatics courses were always the most interesting and fun to me. Which made me realize that maybe I should follow that route instead of the pure CS route.
So I started looking for bioinformatics jobs and pretty much everything I saw required a PhD. So now I'm thinking of going back to grad school and get a Master's in bioinformatics (I don't want to commit to 5-6 years of a PhD, I'd rather do 2 years first to see if I like it). The hope is that I will really like it and then want to continue on to PhD and live happily ever after. And if I don't enjoy it too much, well then I can always come back to Silicon Valley and be unhappy but at least rich..? :p

My question is what program exactly am I supposed to look for in grad school? I'm looking mainly at Canadian universities, probably University of Toronto. I was hoping to just find a ""Bioinformatics"" program, but instead I found faculty members in either the Biology department or the CS department working on bioinformatics. Do you think that doing there will be large differences between doing a master's in bioinformatics through Biology vs through CS? Do you think that the job market will react better to one or the other? If you have any other piece of advice or information that can help, that would be appreciated too.

TL;DR - difference between doing grad school in Bioinformatics via a Biology department with a biology prof vs the CS department?"

To be specific, I am a intern working ten hours a week while in college, and have doing so for about 6 months now, but I've connected with these guys in a deep way, and just wanted to give anyone who's curious a chance to ask some questions.

If you guys need proof, I can screencap some emails, but that's probably the best I can do unfortunately. They refuse to let absolutely anything out of the prison so my identification stays at the front desk.

I have already started conducting some research and asking around, but I thought I'd ask real people who have real experience.

I am a business major and a military science and leadership minor (Army ROTC) and heavily involved with business groups on campus.  I'm not planning on contracting or enlisting as of now, but have an interest in aviation.

What I want to know is: Can you work with Boeing or get some kind of internship with similar companies  through a business degree and work with military projects and aircraft?  I know that it will take some sort of special clearance and I won't land a first job working with badass choppers or jets, or anything, but just wanted to see if anyone on /r/aviation or other respected subreddits have experience working in the civilian department of military aviation, or what other general aviation opportunities are available.

It was one of the suckiest things I've ever had to do, but breaking down in my therapist's office was my final straw. I don't want anyone else to have to go through what I'm going through at the hands of this jerk. My friends have been very supportive. Thanks for the support, y'all.

I was raped twice in my lifetime before this, neither of which I reported, but this time is different.

I thought I was just drunk, but I had eaten before I drank and I hadn't drank very much. Normally I drink hard liquor for hours at a time, and don't get drunk or lose control of myself. I should've known something was up when my first beer made me feel funny.

I don't remember how I got into bed. I had slept next to him before--I know this guy, my friends know this guy, I thought it was safe. I kept my clothes on. In the morning I felt too sick to move, and I hadn't even drank enough to get a hangover. Then he pulled off my clothes and did what he did.

I felt sick the rest of the day, like no hangover I had ever had before. My blood was humming in my ears all day. My heart was racing, but my blood pressure felt really low. I took my anxiety medication and it did nothing for my racing heart. I did my deep-breathing exercises. I drank water. Nothing helped how sick I felt. I just drifted in and out of sleeping and crying. I called my mother because I was so scared and sick. That feeling lasted off and on into the next evening. 

The next day at my internship, someone brought up the name of the place where the guy works, and I almost started crying. I broke down and told her about it so she'd at least understand why I was so upset at the mention of this place.

For the next couple of weeks I kept having flashbacks. I couldn't even touch myself without feeling the onset of a panic attack. I told my doctor, who gave me more medication, and I started feeling a little better, even if therapy was only getting more difficult to go through. 

Friends keep encouraging me to report to the police. I'm so scared that if I report him, he'll come after me. And if he doesn't come after me, I'll face social consequences. 

I ran into him last night when I was with my friends and my date, and he sent me a nasty text message about ignoring him. I want him to leave me alone, for good. I feel like I have to do this so he doesn't do this to anyone else, but I am just so scared of what will happen to me.

Dear (contact),


I am writing to express my interest in the account services intern position at (Company). (Company)’s innovative and engaging approach to marketing drew my attention to the company and fostered my initial interest. The way your company uses an integrated digital strategy to reach client’s target audience stands out as being uniquely interactive and results-oriented. I feel that my unique background and enthusiastic desire to learn more about the account services side of the marketing field make me an ideal candidate for the Spring 2013 internship.


I am currently a senior at (University) majoring in Sociology. The courses I have completed within my major have cultivated my interest in understanding how people relate to one another and the world around them. Within these courses I have gained research, writing, and presentational skills while critically examining social phenomena in the real world. Most importantly, my sociology background lends itself to the ability to view the world from different individual perspectives. I feel like this skill will prove to be a vital asset in helping the marketing team evaluate brand strategy through the critical eye of the consumer. 


In addition to my academic background, I hold two leadership positions in (my sorority), which has allowed me to gain experience in project coordination and event planning. These experiences have helped me develop my critical thinking and strategic planning skills while exercising creativity, working with a team, and meeting deadlines. These traits will help me assist the company in coordinating client projects and completing day-to-day work. 


Finally, my past professional experience at (Retail-ish company) emphasized working one-on-one with clients. Through on-the-job experience I gained skills in listening to individual needs and providing excellent customer service. I feel that these experiences will translate well into building strong relationship with clients and consumers in the marketing world


I believe that these experiences combined with my motivation to learn more about account services and the marketing field will make me a great addition to the (Company) team. Thank you in advance for reviewing my resume and I look forward to hearing more from you in the future. 


Sincerely,
(Me)

Just moved here with the gf who has her masters in Education and is a teacher.  I attended college for a year and a half for History Education, but dropped out.  Wasn't my thing, and pay was too low.  

I just applied to Northern Virginia Commnity College to obtain a AS in Engineering, with my next step to transfer to George Mason University to pursue an undergrad in Civil Engineering (they have a guaranteed acceptance pArtnership with the community college).  I chose both schools because they are very close to home/work as I cannot afford to commute far.  I am currently working as a car salesman.

Is it realistic to think I can complete an engineering degree program while working 40+ hours a week?  I know with enough diligence it is, but what about after course work is completed?  I know I'll have to complete internships in order to get an entry level position, are these internships usually paid?  I'm currently living month to month, and I know I'm thinking a couple years ahead of the curve, but I don't want to shoot myself n the foot.  I don't want to get three years into a program, and then put myself into a financially unstable position, but this is my dream profession.  

Basically, just looking for advice from someone else that possibly started down this road after they already established a life, have a couple thousand in bills a month, and other responsibilities etc haha.

Any words of advice is greatly appreciated, as I've been out of the college life for awhile and I think I'm over thinking things -_-"

12d045,8,2012-10-30,Chemistry course question from bioinformatics undergrad.,[deleted],bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/12d045/chemistry_course_question_from_bioinformatics/,"**EDIT:** Everyone seems to agree that I should take a full year of o-chem in order to later take biochemistry electives. So, I'll do that.

**One more question:** I'm not planning on taking any of the laboratories that go along with the chem courses. Is that okay?  

**Original post:**
Sorry if this is slightly off topic for this subreddit. I'm planning my courses for next semester and am having troubles deciding how much chemistry to take.  

I’m doing undergrad bioinformatics and am only required to take one semester of organic chemistry. My college has two version of o-chem. One version is two semesters long. Another lower level version is one semester long and more of a broad overview. 

Four things:

* Would a graduate schools for bioinformatics/computational biology look down on me for taking only the lower level course? 

* If I took the lower level course or one semester of the two semester course, I wouldn’t be able to take any biochemistry courses later on. How important would it be for me to take biochemistry as an undergraduate? 

* Would future genetics/biology courses be more difficult without organic chemistry? 

* I don’t really like chemistry.

My question is, which course should I take? If it's the two semester course, should I take both semesters? 




One more question. I've been working in a wet-lab for about a year now. Should I start looking for an internship specifically in bioinformatics or wait until I have programming and computer science experience (which would be next year)? I only sort of know python at the moment. 

Thanks for any input. "

I think I'm a little lacking in experience (recent graduate), but if I can nail my resume and cover letter, I should have a shot. I'm a competent designer, so my resumé is in good shape, however I feel as though my cover letter still sounds pretty generic.

I'd appreciate any help on the matter. **Here's what I have so far:**

&gt;Dear personwhowillhireme,


  &gt;The University of X is a robust institution which requires a passionate and multifaceted professional videographer. As a videographer, photographer, educator, and professional artist I will make it my mission to contribute to the success and excellence of the University of X. 


&gt;I have worked in a variety of settings as a videographer with a wide selection of clients and collaborators. This experience has provided me with a knowledge of cutting edge technology, softwares, as well as the ability to adapt to a multitude of styles. I have also, for the past four years, been immersed in the fine art world. My work has been screened in several of CityX's most well known galleries and art spaces, by some of CityX's most respected curators and artists. As a recent graduate from a tier 1 university and competitive fine arts program, I have a flexible aesthetic that is relevant to the contemporary dialogue and modern visual vernacular, which will no doubt benefit the University of X in a multitude of ways. Throughout my experience I have been no stranger to a busy schedule. Just after graduating from the University of X, I juggled working as a full time photographer/videographer, as a photography instructor, intern, student, and artist. Maintaining a busy and productive schedule in this way has given me the ability to manage multiple projects and responsibilities on time, while maintaining an attention to detail necessary for each project to be successful. 


&gt;My passion is to create engaging and relevant pieces of video and photographic work, while collaborating with  to meet any specific goal at hand. My experience combined with my aesthetic, and work ethic make me an ideal candidate to the University of X's Videographer position. I will work hard to maintain, promote, and advance the sophisticated image and environment the University of X is known for. "

I need some serious guidance from americans,

Personal data:Currently in reside in Mexico, I'm 21 and a month from graduating  from international business (4.5 year carreer). I'm fluent in spanish, english and currently I'm studying german. I have worked a couple of years flipping burgers a year and a half as a bilingual sales agent (telemarketing) and almost 2 years on internships at companies

Situation: My father is a U.S. citizen and he is currently doing the paperwork to get me a citizenship as well (or greencard, not sure) Apparently the process is about to conclude and I'll be able to travel to the U.S. without a problem.

Now, on a short-term I would like to get a job, in finance if possible but I don't know if my studies are valid over there. 
Would I have to take some kind of exam to get my degree recognized? If so, Is it hard to get certified? I get the impression that unis over there have higher standards, It's kinda scary to think all I have studied is worth nothing over there. 

My biggest concern concerns jobs. All the time I hear how hard
it is to get a job and how underpayed young college graduates are. Is this true everywhere? My father tells me its true for unskilled workers and that people like me have it waaay easier in the states, on the other hand he is an unskilled worker and thus gets the perception of one.

Now if we talk about mobility around the U.S., I have no trouble with it, my father resides on Dallas but he constantly moves all around the states working, so I am open to settle anywhere. My plan is to permanently reside on the U.S.  

So, how hard do I have it? My father is really optimistic about my situation, then again, he is optimistic about most things."

I've been wanting to get the OSCP for a while, so I was thinking about doing this in the downtime I have now. As some of you may see from some of my other posts, I am not incredibly familiar with networking, though after about 8 hours of reading and screwing around with nmap last night, I think I am a lot closer to understanding the OSI model than I was before. 

So anyway - what level of understanding in what subjects would you recommend before starting the OSCP coursework? I have their syllabus, so I can see what subjects will be covered (I have a liveboot of BackTrack 5 right now, and I have been using some of the tools on my host OS, mostly MSF, nmap, netcat and while I got Wireshark to build from source last night, I haven't actually gotten around to using it yet). A little background on me - I have 3 semesters of CS classes behind me, I can program in Java and Python, and I've done software testing before. 

So, from those of you who know about this program, what do you think I should do? Do you think this cert is even worth it (I've heard a lot of mixed things about certs, but this one seems like it would be great to have once I finish my degree and want to look for security internships or entry level pentesting jobs)?

Here are my options:

1) I have worked as a chemistry tutor at my university for over 3 years so my boss for that might be a good one but since it is not research related I am hesitant .

2) Big boss (phd/md) at my research job where I have worked for over 2 years. He is pretty well known and it would look great to have one from him but I have not worked with him much because he is always in his office and never in the lab but I know that the other employees have said very good things about me to him and he knows everyone likes me.

3) One of the assistant professors that I have actually worked in the lab with and will be published on one of her papers but less of a big name.

4) The PI from my first summer-long research fellowship. I was really young when I did this internship and had not done much course work yet so may have not given as good of an impression as I would have now that I really understand biology in depth. But this research experience included two presentations to the entire department at the graduate level. I am also worried it will look bad if I don't have a LOR from this experience, (maybe they will assume I am hiding something)

5) A professor I have taken 3 classes with received A's in every class. And also am volunteering in his lab for academic credit this semester. He has already said that I have not worked there long enough for him to be able to give a letter of recommendation and I need to prove myself more so basically I would have to work my ass off to get one by the time LOR's are due.

So basically I have three research experiences, so I could try to get one person from each research experience to write a letter or two people from my most current and longest research experience. Maybe I should mix it up a bit and get one from the tutoring job even though it might not be as relevant to what I want to do which is research.


Please help!
Also I have a few schools in mind for where I want to apply and a lot of advice I have read says that you should be able to tell the people writing the letters where you are applying right away but I know that I will be adding more schools to the list in the next month before deadlines. Is it ok to just tell them a few schools and then ask them to send the same letter out to more as you find more schools?

Thanks

12c9uc,11,2012-10-30,My[30] husband [34] is talking about extremely personal stuff with a new colleague[30s]. ,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12c9uc/my30_husband_34_is_talking_about_extremely/,"I've been with him for 9 years, and we've known each other since we were in HS. I know him well enough for this to raise a red flag or two. Maybe a yellow flag, I don't know. I'd like some outside input before I decide to say anything. 

My husband used to intern for Company X. He interviewed for a job there, got passed over, and he didn't renew his internship because of other obligations. Recently, he got an email from one of the people he worked side by side with on one project. It was very casual, saying how she missed himnand he should apply again because she got turned down 3x before getting the job, etc. He honestly doesn't know her from the next person there and wasn't sure who exactly she was when she wrote him. He is starting a new internship (keep in mind this is paid, while he also works 2 other jobs) this afternoon. I am excited for him. 

Building up to this, they have been texting each other a lot. This is alright with me, as I'm close with my male coworkers though they are also friends with my husband. If I'm having a text conversation while we are hanging out, I let him in on it since I feel like it's rude to be having a secondary convo with someone else while you are actively spending time with someone. He doesn't see it this way. I feel like I'm prying when I'm like ""Who ya textin? What about?"" though I don't feel like it's right to let me sit there hanging while he sends a 3 page text. 

I picked up his phone and looked through it. Yeah, it's snooping, but he was sitting right there and he does it to me all the damn time. What I saw was really really weird to me. While he sat next to me, he was texting this person that he supposedly doesn't remember about personal issues like his depression, and details regarding friend-drama that just popped up recently. He was texting this person about things that I didn't even know he was feeling and we are very open about that kind of thing. When she asked what time he needed to leave, he said ""6:30, I have to pick someone up from work."" Yeah, that ""someone"" is me. His wife. 

I simply said ""You guys are getting close pretty quickly there, huh? Are you sure it's a good idea to discuss personal issues with your superior?"" He didn't think it was a bad idea, at all. I think it makes him look vulnerable, but in a bad way. I mean, to tell someone that you are battling anxiety and depression and you don't even remember what their face looks like? In this industry, it's a bad idea to talk about that kind of thing with coworkers, let alone supervisors. 

What I didn't say, which I should have, was that it made *me* feel weird. He neglects to tell this person he is married (we weren't married when he met her in the first place), and spills his guts to her. If this was a dude that he was getting all personal with, I'd still feel very weird about it. I am okay with him sharing personal information with his friends, but I believe he is jumping into this work relationship too fast. 

He also has a tendency to lead women on. In our 9 year relationship, there have been 4 separate instances of him making ""friends"" and them freaking out when he turns them down romantically or when the find out he is seeing someone. He thinks a girl asking for his number at the karaoke bar means she just needs a new singing buddy... Yeah right! He's not a bad looking dude but doesn't know it at all so if floored whenever I tell him someone is flirting with him. He's also very open with me and will say things like ""Uh, so and so is asking me to come over. It's 2am... WTF?"" and be SO SHOCKED when I tell him that texting someone into the night complete with "";)"" faces is considered flirting. It's the 21st century, man. 

I absolutely trust him when it comes to not cheating, but I don't trust him to make those lines clear from the beginning. This woman is spilling her guts to him as well and using language that is much too casual for just a business partnership. I mean, saying things like ""I miss you"" and ""Can't wait to see you"" is a bit much, no? So, no, he wouldn't cheat (and if he does, well fuck him then), but there are other problems that can arise from becoming too close with someone in this way. He is a straight male and she is a straight female, and she has mentioned that she is single *twice*. 

Reddit, tell me I'm nuts and that he's not totally self sabotaging by talking to this woman about his personal business. Or tell me that it's his problem to figure out. I don't even know what to do here. I do know that I'm done looking at his phone because all it does is blow my mind at how naive he is.

**tl;dr My husband is prone to leading women on and being shocked when they want to be more than friends, which ends up disrupting *my* life, and I believe he is doing this again with a superior at work and is ruining his chances at his dream career. Can I do anything or do I let him figure it out on his own?** "

I typically search jobs listed on company websites and mostly steer clear of amalgamators like careerbuilder and monster (although I touch on Indeed.com often).

The big problem I'm running into has to do with my extracurricular engagement through college. I had been under the impression that you go to college, nab a degree and BAM! job. I skated by and graduated with a 2.9 GPA while mostly avoiding hands-on fabrication clubs like the F1 team and Aero team. If I could do it over again, I would pick up internships for the summers in school where I wasn't studying abroad in Germany. I would also have joined in on those fab clubs.. they did seem interesting.

When it comes down to it, I have a GPA below 3.0 and not much extra engineering experience to make up for it. I believe it's because of this that I'm just not getting much interest from prospective employers. I can only blame it on the economy for so long before I realize it's probably me and my credentials holding me back. It doesn't help, though, that all the ""entry level"" engineering job listings want 3-5 years of experience. I've had my resume looked at by several different professionals so things are in line in that regard. I also tailor my cv + cover letter for each job.

Is there any advice you can give me? Thanks for your time."

I have the experience and a proven track record of being damn good at my job, but I'm done with it now.

During that time I often had my own horses and then one or two 'project' horses who I would train up and resell/work out issues and return to their owners (unpaid, unless sometimes a small amount from the sale price). I have never, however, worked at a barn or similar. I've worked in a coffee shop and now I'm a telemarketer. At 15, circumstances beyond my control led me to selling my horses and moving off property. I stopped riding until a few months ago (now 19). I'm now taking lessons at a dressage/warmblood stud for one hour a week. 

I do enjoy lessons, but it's really getting to me only riding/being around horses for an hour a week. My whole life used to be horses. One hour a week is just not enough- it's just a tease reminding me what I can't have. I used to really enjoy the general responsibility that comes with horses- I always kept my crappy little barn meticulously clean, my horses were always in fantastic condition, tack was impeccable. Basically, I took a lot of pride in the general care of my horses. I enjoyed that aspect of it (dare I say it...) much more than simply riding. 

I finish uni in a few weeks for the summer and want to get a new job as I *loathe* telemarketing. I would really like to work as a stablehand, but am concerned about how attractive I would be to prospective employers because of my lack of professional experience. I am a perfectionist and I absolutely know that, given the opportunity, I would be a great employee. 

Should I email around to some barns around here and enquire about any upcoming positions? I'm hesitant to send a resume as it'll lack anything horse related and frankly I don't think they'd have a second look at it, so I was thinking of being quite upfront and just sending an email explaining that I have no professional experience but I'm looking for summer/ongoing work and would be happy to do some trial unpaid shifts. Is this a good idea? Anyone had any experiences with doing this? 

*By the way, I've already asked my trainer if she has any work and she said she won't until next year (no promises) as she hires a whole lot of German interns over the summer as part of some exchange program, so she's up to her shoulders in employees at the moment.*

I've asked the same question at History but since some people don't go here and the other way around I wanted to ask the same question here but formulate it in a way that I think suits this subreddit better.

For an IB class I'm going to teach I was asked by my teacher training college to create a 5-6 lesson series. The IB school I am an intern at is now working on the second world war and I thought it would be good to do that lesson series about the mind of a WWII soldier. In essence that means from every big war going country, US, GB, Germany, Japan and the USSR. I don't think I will find information on all of them as usable as the other but that doesn't matter, I have to cater for international students so all is welcome. I want to have a look at the motivation, the war period itself and the aftermath at home for the soldiers. In essence experience the war from their perspective.

So good stories are welcome but I have to use sources and give photocopies and handouts, so books and other kinds of information are welcome, as welcome as the stories you write down here, which I will probably use as anecdotes, simply becuase I have to tell the IB and my teacher training college where I got my information from.

I hope I'm clear in my question and I hope you can help me. If not, ask away for more details. Lesson plans and how it went will also be posted in the end, the lessons start about 6 weeks from now.

12bx4w,16,2012-10-30,Depressed as long as I can remember. What can I do about it without spending a dime?,dpr_trwy,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12bx4w/depressed_as_long_as_i_can_remember_what_can_i_do/,"I somehow made it through high school, avoiding almost all social interactions. I went to community college for the last two years of HS for credit towards both. I then left for a university without hardly saying a word to the friends I managed to collect.

Fast forward 3 years, and I've done the same. Out of all the friends and connections I've made, I really only talk to a couple of them who moved to the same town as me. Only when they call me.

Everyone I know already has jobs, even the ones I helped pass most of their classes. I'm not dumb, just unmotivated. I took an underpaid summer internship while I ""looked for work,"" and now I'm still ""looking for work."" I have no money, but no reason to spend money.

During this time, one of my parents got extremely sick - Hospitals and surgeries sick. As much as I hate to say this, I couldn't care, even after the unlikely recovery.

I'm not sad... I'm not really anything. In reality, I know my life is pretty great compared to most, and full of opportunity. My SO would disagree, given our financial and housing situation. I don't feel anything.

I've feigned emotion as long as I can remember. I go through every day as a zombie. I can't count the number of times I've said ""Just tired,"" and then later stayed up until 6am just to avoid starting a new day.

I don't want to do this for the rest of my life. I want to get help, but I don't think talking about it is going to make it any better. What am I even supposed to say? ""I don't like anything or anyone for no reason.""

I am on my parents' insurance, but I really don't want to talk to them about it, so I don't want them to know. And I don't have any money, not even to spring for co-pay/deductibles/whatnot. I don't even want my SO to know. I've seen how everyone handles mental illness, it isn't fair.

What do I do? I know I'm not a danger to myself or anyone else, but I just want to be normal.

Can I even swing using my parents' insurance without their knowledge? Should I buck up, and wait until I have enough money on my own?

Not to mention... I've wanted help for so long, but my greatest fear is that it won't do anything. I know too many people already that antidepressants have done nothing for. That and I'll have a damn hard time giving up drinking. I know I shouldn't drink, but any day that I do is infinitely better. I get sleep, I get things done, I socialize... but I don't even have the money to drink anymore."

I'm leaning towards London right now, but I'm also willing to consider Prague. I really just need some tips on really what I should do to meet people and make sure I just don't end up sitting by myself in a hotel room. I honestly was thinking of going the hostel route but I'm kind of lost because I've never stayed in one, rather travel to a country that I'll be completely alone in. I found hostelbookers.com, and there seem to be some good prices.

So, if anyone has any tips or suggestions on how to make the best of it and where to stay or go, that would be great. If you have any suggestions on if either London or Prague would be better for me, that would be great too, because I haven't traveled to neither of them before.

12bwcm,0,2012-10-30,"Reddit, Help! A month ago I took up an amazing job offer, but now I realise I really hate my new job. What do I do??",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/12bwcm/reddit_help_a_month_ago_i_took_up_an_amazing_job/,"Hi reddit, I need your help.  This is really really long but I need to know what is the right thing to do. 

During my final year university studies I got offered an internship at a local newspaper. I was studying a Bachelor of Arts majoring in journalism and public relations. I took on the internship, then that turned into a casual job, which after 3 months, turned into a full time job as a junior journo who helps out the other seniors journalists on the paper. After one month, and still during uni, I was offered a full time senior journalist position. I was worried it would be too much to handle, as it was my first job as a journalist, but I thought I could do it. Now I have to look after an entire paper by myself (i write about 9 stories every 3 days). I graduated in absentia, and have been working as the full time senior reporter for about a month now.

And I hate it. I hate it so much. It is too much stress, it makes me depressed, and I hate waking up in the morning and I hate the terrible knot in my stomach I get everyday. I wake up at 5am to work on stories and go to bed at 12am. I think I was given too much responsibility in such a short amount of time. I know i should be really really lucky and grateful, but reddit, i can't handle it! I don't know what to do. I can't tell anyone at work. Why? Because when I applied for the full time position (as the junior journalist) they thought I couldn't handle it and I told them I wanted it really bad and would do my best. After working as the junior journo for one month, they were impressed and gave me my own paper.

But I am already burnt out. I have lost my passion. I don't want to work on hard news stories. I'd rather work in PR, or write light hearted stories, or work for a magazine. I wish I could do PR for a con, or expo, or gaming company. 

I have a beautiful amazing boyfriend and he gives me so much support, but I still burst out crying every day and he knows how much I hate it. He told me to look for another job, but I can't. I will let everyone down. They will think of me as ungrateful. Especially after convincing them how much I want it. But reddit, I have never had a break from schooling or working. After high school, I went straight to uni, then straight to work. I have never been overseas. I have lost all my friends because I work too much. (For your info - I am a 21 year old female)

If I quit, I don't think I will be ever able to work in the media industry again. I can't ask to be demoted, because the casual job and junior journo role have already been filled. 

I have two weeks holidays in December. I can't afford to go overseas because I recently moved out of home. I even have to technically work part time during those two weeks so we can still put out papers over christmas and new years.

So reddit, what do I do?

**tl/dr - I thought I landed my dream job, that hundreds of people applied for, but after a short time, I realise how much I hate it and I can't quit**"

I'm making this request for a friend of mine. I'm temporarily living in Philadelphia for an internship and I have made a very good friend who introduced me to a world of beer that I had never known before. Being from Texas, I had no grasp on beer culture and didn't know anything more exotic than Dogfish Head. He has opened his cellar to me many times, introducing me to just about every style and brewery. And now I think it's time that I repay him. We were hanging out one night talking about beer, as usual, when he mentioned to me that the Cantillon Blaber is probably the only beer that he really wants to try, that has eluded him thus far. Sadly, I'm leaving Philadelphia in the next few months and I thought there would be no better way of saying thank you to him than by finding a bottle of this beer. I'll do whatever it takes to repay this friend of mine. Just let me know what you would want for it and I will try my damnedest to get it. Or even if any of you just have some tips for me on where I could possibly find it, it would sincerely be much appreciated. And, in addition to whatever you would like in exchange, I will throw in a bottle of Tired Hands Brewing Co.'s first bottled beer Handfarm, a funky saison, as soon as it's released. They are an up and coming brewpub in the Philadelphia area and I think you'd really enjoy this first of it's kind beer."

I finished my Masters of IT a few years ago (taking post-grad degrees without experience should be illegal) and I've been jobless ever since. I've tried to tailor every single application to every relevant job on seek.com as perfectly a fit as I can without lying or embellishing (much), and I've gotten zero interviews, one polite negative reply, and one negative reply *three months after the job application*. That's the extent of how close I have been to getting a job.

It really beats down on your ego when you can't get hired for graduate positions because of shitty results, or because you're too old for internships, or lack the experience needed in entry-level help desk roles. My headspace is a bit of a mess right now. It's fucking depressing and messes with your entire idea of self-worth and esteem, man. I'm down to my last $40, and I've not slept in room of my own for like 2 years. I think my friends are sick of putting me up, and my family has enough financial problems of their own so I've applied for Newstart after fighting the idea for years (maybe due to pride). The idea was to hopefully get a job through them and get off the claims ASAP.

Does anyone want a Masters IT graduate for cheap? I really just need some IT-related experience and enough to eat. I can do some programming (C, Java, VB .Net), SQL, troubleshooting, basic website stuff, antivirus / firewall / ip packet filter setup, a bit of forensic software like FTK / Wireshark, I've worked with Linux a little (Ubuntu and shell scripting from a long time ago). I'm more than willing to learn whatever systems you use for your company or business on my own time. I'll also do any non-IT related stuff you need done at the same time. I'm a permanent resident too, so you don't have to worry about visas.

Oct 31 Edit - You guys are champions - I really appreciate the advice and help you guys have given, and I feel much better now and, more importantly, hopeful about the future. Thanks again. "

12bhg6,27,2012-10-29,A first post and an admitted vent: abortion and an encounter with Planned Parenthood.,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12bhg6/a_first_post_and_an_admitted_vent_abortion_and_an/,"Well, I'll start off by saying that I'm posting here because it's filled with some of the most thoughtful comments on these issues that I've seen on the Internet.  

I'm 28 years-old and I'm senior at a business school in the US.  I'm a returning student that started out in community college and transferred.  Not long after I transferred I met a man, my now-fiance.  In February of this year I had to have my gallbladder removed.  Since that time my digestion has been troublesome and I have stomach issues frequently.  

Honestly, it was at this point that I should have changed my birth-control method.  Feeling nauseous all the time and other...well, digestive...issues probably wasn't asking for success from a sensitive daily pill.  And now, after just a hair over a decade of being sexually active I'm disappointed in myself to have an unwanted pregnancy.

It was clear to me immediately that this wasn't something I was prepared to deal with.  My fiance has entered grad school.  I'm in a competitive business school finishing my last year with a hectic fall job recruitment period and an internship in winter.  I live in my father's daylight basement.  I do want children, as does my fiance, but eventually.  We wanted to be in a better financial situation, a better living situation.  And, honestly, I wouldn't trust companies not to have a bias against me as I go forward interviewing.  Right at graduation and the birth of this baby I wouldn't have the luxury to take time off.  I'd need a job.  

Maybe it goes without saying it's been a stressful time.  This was compounded by my first visit to Planned Parenthood.  I'll emphasize right now that it wasn't their fault this particular visit was stressful.  Since my gallbladder removal my period has been all over the map.  When I went in and told them the first day of my last period they estimated I was at 12 weeks.  I was crushed by this.  It felt far to me.  While I hold no judgement for anyone else for that time and beyond,  *I* felt emotional.  I was still going through with the abortion but it left me feeling very hollow.

I made my appointment with the support of my fiance and my Mom (who I have an outstanding relationship with).  I was armed with copies of my insurance card and paperwork from my plan indicating their service numbers and coverage level.  I felt assured and prepared.

Then...I arrived for the appointment.  It was at a different Planned Parenthood location four days later.  This past Saturday morning at 8:00 AM.  I arrived with my fiance.  I was told my insurance information hadn't been processed by their financial office.  The person who had begun to process it had left a note ""no insurance on file"" even as the woman at registration could see it in the notes on her screen.  I would need to pay $650 to them at that point.  I'd come with 20% of that, the portion I'd been told to expect to have to pay.  I explained my situation and that I was frustrated to hear this.  I once again gave my insurance card.  The woman at registration decided to check me in and said she would contact her manager while they did their initial pre-procedure work.

A bit of good news came then.  I had an ultrasound.  I was only at an estimated 7 weeks.  This took a large weight off my chest.  It was at this point the woman from registration came in and said the manager had said the same thing.  Pay the $650 and I'd be refunded later.  I just didn't have it in my account.  My fiance didn't have it.  

This is why I'm venting.  I'm upset about how this was handled.  If I had been called even the day before and told no one had processed my insurance I could have wrangled something to make it work.  I could have gotten the cash from my Mom, heck, I would have gone so far as to pay a penalty to get it out of a CD.  But instead, in a very vulnerable and stressed state, I had to deal with their error and their inflexibility.  No one called.  This still surprises me. This person typed in ""no insurance on file"" and never lifted the phone.  It just seemed so cavalier.  

I was told that people would bring in fraudulent insurance cards which was almost humorous because in the same breath they said the ""good news"" was that they wouldn't charge my for the ultrasound but would instead bill my insurance. I was told that I wasn't at a critical point, I was early enough along that waiting a week would be fine.  Really?  I feel like the ""critical point"" is pretty subjective to the patient.  

And now, I wish I was joking as I type this... The big announcement.  My engagement party is next Sunday.  My parents organized it and about 45 people are coming.  And the day before I'll have had an abortion.  Some might even say I'm adding this for a level of drama.  I'm scanning the invite and the Planned Parenthood appointment reminder in prep.  The other option was to have it Wednesday, the day of a mid-term in a class.  It's safe to say that right now I feel cursed.

I'll acknowledge I put myself in this position by not thinking about my birth control at all the angles I should have.  But at the same time, the lack of flexibility demonstrated by Planned Parenthood, the lack of customer service really, honestly demonstrates to me that no one - not even the clinics performing this service - see abortions the way other medical services are seen.  It was their error and the potential of a fraudulent or card or no, in my opinion, they should have moved forward.  

Today they called me to inform me that my insurance was now properly processed.  I'm sitting here even more stressed and emotional.  I can't help but feel like this sensitive issue was handled incredibly poorly.  

I stand by Planned Parenthood.  I always have.  I've always been pro-choice and when I was starting out after high school I went there for physicals and birth control.  I don't value that any less.  But right now I'm definitely disappointed.  I am just one person but I'm still stunned and hurt.  It's a stunned and hurt that I have to add to this already difficult time.

Planned Parenthood, I have no doubt of the importance of the work you do and your stance on these issues.  Hell, without you and your advocacy who knows if I could even be having this procedure right now.  But, as a patron, I'm profoundly saddened by what happened on Saturday.  I'm disappointed in this manager.  I don't feel I received compassion.

I just had to put it somewhere.  

Update:  I appreciate the comments!  The support has really made me feel better.  There's not many people in my immediate circle I just want to up and share this with so it's nice to have the additional kind words.  As an update, I contacted the health center at my university and they actually were incredibly supportive and referred me to another clinic.  I contacted them.  They've already verified my insurance and I have an appointment for Thursday!  So, I should feel better for the party.  Still a rough decision but I already feel much more relieved."

I'm a little ashamed because nothing in my life is causing me to feel the way I'm feeling, I'm just ruining my life on my own. It all started last year in August. I loved high school, had an awesome set of friends, met the perfect girl for me, and things were great. While I definitely coasted through academically, and my GPA was average, I figured I'd be fine and get into my dream college because I got a near perfect score on my SAT and ACT. Not the case, and after 3 rejections had to pick an option I didn't even consider. A year and a half later, after joining a fraternity I love, failing two courses twice each (passed one on the 3rd try, got by so far without the other) and becoming an introvert (which is the complete opposite of my normal personality), I don't know what to do. My friends from high school visit somewhat often, and everything is great for the few days they're in town, but once they head back I'm stuck again. I see my girlfriend a lot now, and feel great around her, but again the minute she heads home I don't do anything. I can't motivate myself to do any school work (which is why I failed those classes and am struggling with the current ones, not lack of intelligence) and all I do is browse Reddit and fantasize about somehow getting rich and avoiding all the work I have to do. My parents think I'm doing great, and that I'm going to transfer to said dream college next semester (definitely not happening then, if ever). All my fraternities brothers try to get me out and about, but I just don't feel like it any more. I always have a plan to save myself from the academic downward spiral, but keep procrastinating it day by day to the point where I'm literally drowning in these classes. I can still recover at this point, but without a motivation boost there's no way I'll make any progress. My first semester was pretty awesome, in that I did a lot on campus and at least did some school work, but it got progressively worse until the bottom (I hope) I'm at right now. I've already lost my scholarship, so now I have to get a job soon to pay for next semesters tuition, and then an internship in the summer (not even sure I can get one with the abysmal GPA I'm carrying right now). I don't know where else to go, and I'd really appreciate any help you guys could give me. Similar stories that turned out well, a regiment to get me focused and back into the swing of things, or even a kick in the ass to man up could help. Anything to get me back to being the old me and not the mess/lie I'm playing right now."

We always get a lot of submissions just before the Fall break, but one in particular stood out this afternoon. As an intern, I am the front-line of the texts that the sociology department receives. With storms and whatnot rolling in this week, the workload was laughable and I was the only one in the office towards the end of the Friday shift.


The office email address received one last submission around four pm. But after I read it, I added it to a queue so no other employees would be able to review or edit it. I... I have reproduced it here, obscuring some details, and just wanted to share it with someone.
The professor mentioned, of course I edited his name a bit, but he is a full-time member of our faculty. He has been absent on a short medical leave since the last spring term. I do not know if this is related to his submission. I have copied and pasted it to the following link. Please forgive me for the external source. But it's length breaks this page's limit.

I need advice on what I should do from now up until I graduate to get more experience and connections with people.

    I want to submit applications for internships, and research fellowships (such as http://www.murf.caltech.edu/), but often times they ask for letters of recommendations from faculty members. 
I have no other relationship between my professors other than the fact I was/am their student that just attended class, so chances are I have zero candidates to get recommendations from.

I don't have many questions to asks during lectures. I suppose I could visit my professors during office hours, but my main problem is that I don't know what to discuss with them once I visit. What are somethings I can discuss with my professors during office hours? Are there additional options I can take besides visiting my professors' office hours or stuff I could do to prepare myself for a future career?"

I'm so irritated with my boyfriend. We have been together for a little over a year and I am SO.TIRED.OF.HIS.SHIT.

Here is a list of some things I am super super incredibly sick of:

- He smokes weed all day every day.

- We're in college and he makes no effort with school which really really bothers me. We took a couple GE's together and I ALWAYS did his work for him. He has an internship at the school radio station and he has done literally NOTHING for it the entire semester. He doesn't put effort into anything!

- He wants to be a stand-up comedian BUT HE ISN'T FUNNY AND I AM SO SICK OF ""LAUGHING"" AT HIS TERRIBLE JOKES.

- He has some seriously family disfunction. His mom and dad got a divorce right before he went to college. His whole dad's side relies on guilt and manipulation to keep them together as a family. Once, his grandma told me I should ""read a book"" instead of watching trashy TV and he didn't even say anything. I can do both! 

- He is a big baby whiner and I have to mom him.

- He's super irresponsible with money. Like, so irresponsible with it that he ran out of money so he just decided not to get me a birthday present.

- He had a bad roommate situation happening earlier this year. I started to let him stay at my place and then everything just started to snowball. He literally moved in. He never looked for a new apartment. He just spent all his time bumming around my house, EVEN WHEN I WASN'T THERE. It took me getting like a serious talk from my roommates for him to realize that he miiiiight have overstepped some boundaries. In the three weeks since the talk he's, found a new apartment and moved there. WHY COULDN'T HE HAVE DONE THAT WAY EARLIER????

- For about a month, he refused to drive his car. He would only drive mine. I wouldn't let him drive if he was high so he would lie to me. I just found this out. HE FUCKING DROVE MY CAR WHILE HIGH AND LIED ABOUT IT. WHAT THE FUCK.

- Whenever I ask him for space or say, I would really like some br0srsly time right now he like, loses his ability to be rational. He will cry and whine and beg and get upset and list reasons why I should just let him stay at my house 24/7. We have been having the same argument about this for weeks. I JUST LIKE TO BE ALONE! I'M TIRED OF HAVING TO ARGUE UNTIL I JUST GET WORN DOWN!

- He is incredibly pushy, if he doesn't get his way he acts butthurt all day. 

- He bitches about my roommates more than I do! I know that they're loud and somewhat passive agressive and of course they get on my nerves sometimes but I can't handle all the negativity from him about it! He comes in my room and is just like ""What the fuck, when I walked in your house your roommate Woman1 gave me the dirtiest look."" ""Oh my god, I went to the kitchen to get water and Woman2 walked out of the room. What a bitch!"" He's like, personally upset with my roommates because they asked me to tell him not to be here as often and everything they do he perceives as an insult to him. SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE JUST DONE BEING IN THE KITCHEN AND SO THEY LEAVE OMGWTF.

- He also gets upset with me when I don't like stand up to my roommates. I have no reason to do so! Seriously, one of my roommates used all my hair spray and didn't tell me. When I asked about it they realized what happened and gave me a new bottle. He was upset that I didn't say anything. Who gives a shit?!?!?! She replaced the hairspray immediately! 

- I have a male roommate. I will admit that he is a little weird sometimes and I feel like he is sort of flirting with me, but I have no interest and never respond. My boyfriend is still incredibly jealous of my male roommate. I cannot handle it. When he is not busy talking shit about my two female roommates he's talking shit about my male roommate ""Male roommate is so fucking creepy!"" ""Make sure you lock your door at night because I'm worried about what will happen!"" ""Even if you lock your door it's pretty easy to pick those locks!"" I think he uses that argument as a way to kind of freak me out and convince me that I should just let him stay over so that he can ""protect"" me.

- He doesn't give a shit about himself. He has gained massve amounts of weight this year because he just doesn't give a fuck. I sometimes have to REMIND HIM TO SHOWER. He's a fucking adult. He should know when to shower.

- He eats like, all of my groceries and then I depend on him for food when he buys groceries and it's this big tangled mess. 

- He's incredibly jealous of my female friends. Whenever I leave to go spend time with him he pouts and whines and it's SO ANNOYING.

- I am his only friend. He makes no effort to have other friends. I tell him that being someone's everything is too much. Then he reminds me that last year, when I was suffering from an extreme depressive episode (I'm Bipolar II), and when I had no friends (because he drove them away by being really intrusive and kind of a dick), it was hard for him to be my everything too. That's not chillbrochad! Sorry for having a MENTAL ILLNESS. 

- When he gets drunk, he gets really fucking drunk. It's quite scary. 

- His parents are in serious denial. They KNOW he has a lot of problems and literally pawn them off on me. Like, they really expected me to allow him to just stay at my house forever because they just couldn't really face reality. They know he has like, substance abuse problems (he will openly admit that he is an addict) but they still give him limitless cash (which he spends on nothing but weed.)

So basically- he is a lazy, douchey, controlling, jealous guy and I am sooooo done with his shit. Here's the kicker though. I tried to break up with him on thursday evening and he WOULDN'T ACCEPT IT! He showed up at my house in the morning with flowers and coffee and 1000 apologies and he kept talking about like ""throwing away a beautiful, year-long relationship."" There was so much guilt trippage that I felt like I had no choice but to take him back. Now he keeps buying me things and asking if ""we're okay,"" and I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!! His birthday is this weekend, I feel like it's cruel to break up with him AGAIN on his birthday weekend. My mom suggested I wait and break up with him right before thanksgiving break so that he can't come bother me (we live on opposite sides of the state) but that's not until mid-November and every day that I have to put up with this shit I feel more and more drained, I'm not happy and I really don't love him anymore. I'm sorry that this is so long. I have no one else to talk to. I feel like I can't even tell my mom most of this because she would be so upset with him that I truly believe she would fly across the state and confront him (my mom is the greatest, seriously.) and it would also make me feel stupid for staying with him for so long. Most of my friends really just don't like him and then the few that do like him always just say that we're so perfect that we should never ever break up. I'm not worried about being alone, I'm just scared about hurting him or what the aftermath will be. SRS, WAT DO?!?!?!!?! 

**tl;dr: Need help with douchey terrible boyfriend and I have nobody else to talk to.**

Edit: I accidentally commented on everything with my real account and had to delete all my comments! Thank you for your words of encouragement. I broke up with him for real about an hour ago. I feel sad right now but I know it was the right choice. If I had stayed any longer I might have spontaneously combusted out of frustration. Thank you thank you thank you SRSWomen. You are seriously the best group of people on the internet!!!

This is my 3rd semester as an undergrad (I started college in Fall '11), but it looks like I can graduate early (with a BS degree, maybe Fall '13 if I play my cards right). I'm thinking about grad school. My school has a MS in GIS track (non-thesis, I think) that allows starting in the spring, and also gives students the option of finishing it in one year. But I hear that experience is crucial, even in entry level jobs. My question is, should I stay, as an undergrad, for a couple more years just to try to get internships for the experience, or should I just go ahead, take the GRE, apply to different schools and hope for the best? In other words, would it be easier to get a job if they see more internships/experience on a resume, or would a Master's (even with less experience) speak for itself? I'm hearing conflicting things from friends/family."

[M,23],[F,24]",phase16,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12fap4/is_my_4_year_relationship_going_to_end_in_a_month/,"so i recently posted under the throwaway ""phase15', but i've forgotten the password due to being 'all over the place' recently.  here is what i wrote last:   

[previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/123inc/how_to_save_a_crumbling_4_year_relationship_m23f24/)  

i need a third party opinion here. so my girlfriend and i have been having problems recently as you can read in my previous post.  she has been more distant and has also been more open to me about the crisis she has been having.  this has been going on for 2.5 months. we havent had sex in 4.5 months since i was in my home country visiting family for the 2 months prior to coming back. since i've been back things have not been going very well in certain ways.

So I decided to open her computer.  i didn't know what was really up. so i snooped around and i looked in her emails to see that she had accepted an internship ( i dont know how long, but i know at maximum 4 months) starting in december in another country. she hasnt told me about this yet. the email is 4 days old. maybe she is waiting for a good time or maybe she has another reason. I know it is not good to look at her emails but I know she looks at mine too.  I also found out that she had a doctors appointment to get an IUD. Which is a bit surprising seeing as we havent had sex in awhile after she stopped taking birth control. i really dont know what to think about that.  

I know at this point you might be thinking: ""why don't you just ask her what's going on?"". I am really tempted but i don't really want to say i went on her computer just yet. instead i want to wait for her to tell me these things.  


anyway, given that we have been having a rough time in our relationship this is worrying.
however I'm still not exactly sure whats going to happen. this is because we still get along really well. in spite of all that has been happening in our couple, we generally have enjoyed each other's company. we still do the normal couple things like go out to dinner or make a dinner together, go out with friends and family, cuddle and watch a movie etc. etc. Moreover recently she has been befriending my friends and getting on really well with all of them. after four years of being with her, I'm close with her family and they really like me and always invite  me  to family events. also last night when we went to bed she spooned with me and wanted to be close to me.  (which i mention since it has been a rare thing these days). basically everything has been going well, except for what hasn't if that makes sense.   

so what im trying to say is i'm getting very mixed signals here. i know there is something wrong in our relationship but i dont know if its enough to end it like this.
 The thing is, it could very well be that she wants to do this three month internship and still maintain our relationship long distance even though we have been having problems. I think i might have a paranoid bias in all this which is why i asked for other opinions in the first place. anyway a long distance relationship between us is definitely plausible seeing as in the past we have had to have a long-distance relationship for up to 5 months.   

Or she could want to end things. Or taking a more 'middle' view of things: maybe a short break is what she needs to get over her problems? my honest opinion on this is that we can stick it out together. it may be rough but we have stuck it out in the past over rough things.

also im in the first year of grad school here and i would like to think she cares enough not to emotionally fuck me over so that i fail out. compounding all of this, is the fact that she and I live in an apartment owned by her parents. so basically i have been living and studying rent-free for the past 1.5 years. (in a foreign country). so i would really like your opinions.

TL;DR: I think my girlfriend will be leaving for another country in a month for a short term internship. I dont know if our relationship will remain in place or not.  Need your thoughts."

What supplementary texts would be of use to me? Any real essentials? What textbooks did you have in school that you really valued?

I've desperately been trying to find a low position (even an unpaid internship) at a shop, but no such luck. There isn't a lot to choose from in my immediate area, and it'd be real tough to afford gas for a two hour commute if I'm not even getting paid. What would be my best strategy for finding some shop work?

I'm planning on simultaneously attending i3, a local makerspace, while I go to school. I figure that would be a pretty good leg up (although someone had mentioned to me that it would poison career options because local shops prefer to mold their acquisitions from a blank slate, lest they hire on a ""know-it-all""). Is this something that would help me or would it hurt my chances of finding work?

Lastly, a two-part question: what advice would you give to a budding CNC machinist that you wish someone gave to you, and do you believe the industry's hiring options in America are dying?"
12f5ec,2,2012-10-31,Does anyone know a good place to look for National and State political internships? I am a college student from Georgia looking for some one with experience who can help.,georgiaonmymind93,Atlanta,https://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/12f5ec/does_anyone_know_a_good_place_to_look_for/,"Like the title says, I am a 19 year old Sophomore in college who is looking for someone who can answer a few of my questions. 

First off, let me say that since I am not 21, many US Senators and Representatives will not accept my application. I also have an issue of whether or not to intern in Georgia.

I attend Mississippi State University in Starkville, MS but am a native resident of Georgia, and my home is in North Fulton. I will be home for the summer, and as such, figured that I could possibly apply for an internship with a state senator or representative. I live in the Sixth Congressional District and know that many surrounding State Senators and Reps enjoy staffing kids from their districts.

So one question: My University only offers internships from Mississippi politicians. If I were to apply to, say my rep Tom Price, would I be looked over for attending an out of state school. For example, if a UGA student with similar credentials get selected over me? 

Also, is there an online listing for internships strictly for Georgia State congressmen? I have looked at individual State Senators and Reps' websites, but each one has a different internship application or process. 

Thanks for the help"

I lived in Erlanger during my internship and hated every minute of it. I'm from Atlanta so I'm drawn to the city atmosphere of Cinci. I'll be moving late December/early January.

Just wondering if there are any financial benefits to one side of the river or the other. Rents seem cheaper in NK, but Cinci has more nightlife and trendy neighborhoods. Is there a significant difference in state income tax between the states? How do the price of utilities compare? 

Some other questions:
How is traffic coming from Cinci to NK? I lived 5 minutes from Toyota this summer so I never saw 71/75 during my commute. Is most of the traffic coming into Cinci, or out? Or a pretty good mix of both?

How is the snow? I've never been around snow in my life. It ices over in Atlanta every couple of years. This past year was the mildest I've ever experience. I don't think it ever got below freezing. I don't know the first thing about living or driving in snow. 

A couple things about me:
24 year old female finishing my undergrad at Georgia Tech; love music of all kinds but my favorite is trance; love theater, art, dancing, hookah, sailing, and rock climbing; not a foodie but I love trying out new restaurants; want to live walking distance to a park, restaurants, shopping, bars

Applied for a job online, seemed an all right fit, in the civil engineering field. Small company in Chicago, mostly public works and infrastructure, which sounds perfect for me. Recent CivE grad, I have a 3.5gpa, varied resume with journalism, marketing, research, etc.

About two months later, I get a phone interview, where I am a little bit excited, but it went off without too much of a hitch. They say they'll follow up with an interview later, so I'm happy and excited.

I call them back two weeks later asking for an update, and they tell me that the position is ""suspended"". I guess this means that they're not sure about keeping the position anymore? It's a fairly small company, so it sounded to me like they didn't have the time for the engineers to do double HR duty for it.

Anyway, I was wondering what I should do now. I really want the position, the company seemed like a good fit. I was thinking of offering to take an internship position if they want, because I'm in no rush to climb the ladder, I just want to work. Any advice?"

Unfortunately, I have not taken any circuit classes or anything, so most of the vocab you guys use, I probably won’t understand…  The most experience I have is using Ohm’s law regarding resistors and parallel/series circuits. 

 I just finished my freshman year and am doing an internship right now.  My typical day involves looking at a schematic an engineer designed and building it.  However, most of the stuff I put together, I barely understand.  Currently I put together something called a “Load Cell Amplifier”, where if we input a small voltage, for instance, 20mV, we get out a signal of 10 Volts (using a bunch of magical Op-Amps).

Now here’s my question.

I can’t help but imagine that it literally takes a small signal (and by using the term “signal”, I really don’t even know what it truly means.  I’m just guessing a flow of electrons of some sort) and makes it “big” enough to drive something.  To me, I feel like it breaks the physics of reality.  You have something small, and magically turn it big.  For instance, if we have 1 AA battery (typically at 1.5 volts), we can somehow use an op amp to turn that 1.5 volts into something like 10 volts and drive a hefty DC motor?  (I sort of know that’s what a transformer does, but we sacrifice the current in order to increase the voltage). I know there’s much reading I have to do, but right now, lots of the sources online aren’t really doing me any good. 

Thanks for any future feedback guys.  You guys can flame and caps-lock at me all you want.  It probably drives you guys a bit angry for me asking a bit of an ignorant/uneducated question.

I accepted the offer and I am really excited for the opportunity. I originally applied for a summer internship but told them I was also open to co-op opportunities, just wanting to get any sort of experience I could get.

If you aren't familiar with the way ""alternating term"" co-ops work versus educational co-ops: I will work 3 non-consecutive semesters with Dow over the course of two whole school years. I start this coming summer, I will return the following spring, and then I will return the fall after that. Each of these stints will be paid, so effectively I am getting a years worth of work experience (and money) with Dow before I graduate college.

The questions I have are:
&gt;Do you think the opportunity of the co-op is worth postponing my graduation by a year?
&gt;
&gt;If you worked a similar co-op, did you receive a job offer effective after you gradated?
&gt;
&gt;Does a co-op look better on resumes than a few summer internships?
&gt;
&gt;If you worked a similar co-op, can you tell me about what you did and what experiences you had?

I'm not trying to change my mind about accepting the co-op. I'm extremely excited about the opportunity, Dow was at the top of my list with companies I interviewed with. I'm just looking for some perspective from people who are familiar with the prospects of a co-op.

Hey all, first time poster, long time lurker.  I just wanted to share something that happened at my internship the other day.  I came in to find one of my bosses putting up a poster and donation bin for ""Movember,"" a fundraising site/event dedicated to spreading information about ""men's health issues, specifically prostate and testicular cancer initiatives.""

He asked me to sign up and start growing a mustache this Thursday, which I will be doing despite the fact that while my beard is excellent, my 'stache sucks.

Right on the site it says that the event is aimed at ""prompting private and public conversation around the *often ignored issue of men’s health* .""

I thought /r/mensrights would enjoy reading about a positive experience.  At a workplace, the issue of men's health specifically is being promoted through a growing network and cause.  We always see information about events aimed at women's breast cancer awareness.  I'm not bashing that, but I would like to make the point that we rarely hear about promoting awareness and support for our brothers.  At least nothing the size and scale of the Susan G. Komen walks/foundation.


Here is the website if anyone is interesting in supporting the cause and growing a wicked 'mo for the month of November.

12eq2k,1,2012-10-31,The invention side of entrepreneurship or: how I learned to stop worrying and love the job,ortegasb,Entrepreneurship,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneurship/comments/12eq2k/the_invention_side_of_entrepreneurship_or_how_i/,"In 2008, I partnered with an inventor. I was a Junior in college and had just joined the Small Business Entrepreneurship Center as an intern. The program connected me to an older guy that had some napkin sketches who had just entered a competition and needed a quick business plan and slide deck. Eager to please, I jumped right in despite having no experience to speak of. 

After meeting with the inventor and hearing the idea, I had a funny feeling creep over me. Like that first moment you met your significant other, I knew I wanted this idea in my life. I had no idea what inventing, or more, starting a business entailed but I knew I'd be doing it. 

So I signed on--hook line and sinker. He would take care of the product development and I the business side of things. I wrote the business plan, built the slide deck and we finished as finalists in the competition. That only emboldened my resolve and I dropped my major (Philosophy, what a shame) to begin taking strictly entrepreneurship classes which my university was fortunate enough to have through the engineering department. 

I entered the school's start-up competition, and started putting 40 hour weeks into developing the idea. I built teams from each class to write feasibility studies, marketing plans, ip strategies, etc. Eventually, we won the competition and the inventor was able to scratch together enough money to build a prototype. 

At this point, I was living off student loans so it wasn't much of a big deal to commit myself entirely to the project. However, once I finished up my senior year I had a decision to make: continue on an academic course I didn't much care for, or drop out and see what I could do with this still fledgling idea. 

I dropped out and moved to a small downtown apartment with my girlfriend. Money was extremely tight (the inventor was covering an hourly wage) but I had equity in something that could be huge. On and on we struggled, perfecting the design, getting validation from the market, laying out a strategy and cleaning up the documentation to make us investable. 

After 3 years, things were looking pretty ugly. I was a month behind on my share of the rent, my girlfriend had terrible pneumonia which required hospital visits, and I got the car impounded for driving without a license I had lost because I couldn't pay my registration tickets. 

And then I closed our first investor. It wasn't a huge investment but it was the first true fiscal validation we'd received from an outside party. We were able to get ourselves out of the financial hole we'd dug ourselves into, build some marketing units and hit the road to present our product to the market. 

To the uninitiated, spending is a funny thing. After creating a back-log of all the things you need to do over the past three years, being given the sudden ability to do so can be a dangerous thing. We went to a few too many trade shows, stayed on the road a bit too long, and make some purchases that could have waited. 

But the feedback! It was like a drug to hear all these people praising our product after hiding in a garage for so long. People truly seemed to love the invention but whether it was the economy, buying cycle, infancy of the company, whatever, nobody made the commitment to buy. 

So, because we were still novices, we pushed harder and faster, instead of smarter and more precisely. Of course, the money ran out. The stress started building, I became a very depressive type, not much fun to be around. I ended a really good relationship, moved out of my apartment and moved in with the inventor because I had nowhere else to go. 

In my misery, I gained fortitude. I rekindled the passion I had for the project and started turning over every rock I could find to help progress the project. Not long after I started looking, I found a casting call for a new show on the History Channel and got an interview. We were able to wow them and I went down to film the show. It came out a few months later and I was able to use it to raise some small investments to keep the lights on and momentum going. 

I built a sales team of commissioned reps and started giving them the support they needed. Now, I have our first letter of intent for a major order and things are looking up. 

The simple fact of the matter is that entrepreneurship entails failure. In the beginning, the failures are minor and easily surmountable. As you put more and more of yourself into your business, those failures hit closer to home and you will constantly want to quit. You might lose some really good things in your life but if you really care about what you're trying to do, you'll push on anyways. No set-back is too devastating, no obstacle too large. 

Commit and succeed. 

It's still a daily struggle but I have faith in the future. If you would like to learn more, check out www.lifecubeinc.com and let me know what you think!"

When I call to touch base they either don't pick up or make the receptionist take the call and lie that they're not in. What does this mean? What is going wrong? They practically promise me the job one day and don't even have the decency to answer my call to say they found a more qualified candidate.

I've been careful with my online presence. My facebook page is there only for the benefit of potential employers. All you find when you google me is my name in the list of graduates for my two degrees and my online portfolio.

The only thing I can think of is maybe my internship is trashing me to potential employers, but they have no reason to. I worked diligently and they even offered me a job at the end of my assignment (which I wasn't able to accept because I was moving.)

It is quite obvious that the show, whether talent or staff, or fan, are fed up with this fag-cunt and the entire organization needs a push in the right direction.

WHY keep this man on staff? So we can POSSIBLY relate to the younger crowd, the one's with the skinny jeans and the dildos up their asses into the O&amp;A crowd, who will bastardize the program in whatever way they can?

I'd much rather hear intern Rob host the show of lies for 88 months straight than hear Sal say, ""uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..........uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"", on the air again, unprofessional terd.

First year was great, no arguments whatsoever, we got along tremendously well. Once the first year was over and summer began I noticed he began changing personality wise. At this time I discovered he has tendencies to be a lush, especially when he goes out with friends. This was found out because I'm the one who's almost always dealing with his inebriated state of mind. 

We began our internships, which kept us busy, and he made new friends as did I and we didn't see each other as often (generally once a week at most. It's been this way since due to our schedules). To sum up the summer, it was rocky, we argued at least once a week or once every other week and contributed it to the distance but then a few lies were found out that he kept secret (purposely keeping me out of social life, lying to me about friends behaviors, lying about his thoughts about me, and lying about his personal opinions). When this was all happening I also noticed he became more hostile, specifically towards me. He yelled at me over minor things, publicly and privately. After a few long talks things simmered down with a few arguments here and there. 
This created a few trust issues that took me about two months to completely get over(he refused to accept my coping method of talking issues out). I came from a rocky past where a raised voice is a natural tear-jerker for me. He's aware of this and has become what seems to be desensitized to my emotions. He claims he has no feelings and is around simply because he loves me. 

Today he was in one of his moods (he's either hostile or indifferent since summer) and began criticizing me over the phone accusing me of judging him, being negative, and doing things wrong enough that he's become accustomed to it and is not able to list them when I ask what he's talking about. 

I've given him numerous ways out and I know I'm not perfect. In fact since he's began yelling I've found myself pretty unstable emotionally, normally I'm very stable and give him loads of space. Due to insecurities that have risen from our confrontations I've recently felt that I'm the only one keeping our relationship together (he has admit he doesn't put effort in) and I've explained this to him. He's reassured me that he wasn't changing back to the way he used to be and that if i'm sticking around to wait and see if it happens I should leave (I'm not). 

He hates when I ask him what's wrong and has had personal family issues the past year or two years but now he claims that his life is going great. Whats up with his attitude towards me? Any idea? 


He used to be a great guy and very affectionate but recently his actions don't seem very genuine and i'm either upsetting him or he's expressing no emotion whatsoever.
I've given up on asking him to communicate, he won't budge. I've given him outs and he is determined to stay. I don't get it. "

I went through Unit 5 of CS 101 on Udacity, am currently going through Learn Python the Hard Way, and am currently enrolled in edX's CS50X (though I'm not sure if I will continue).

I want to do a side project to put stuff into practice but don't know where to start. For example, I'd love to create a really basic version of Tumblr with Python with an option for reblogging, liking, and a an infinite scrolling timeline. I've looked on places like GitHub for ""timeline"" and ""social networking"", but I honestly have no idea what I'm looking at when I find interesting projects or what's happening.

I looked at the reddit GitHub account and it's sort of the same thing - I don't know how to navigate these files or how they're all interconnected. 

So my questions are these:

1. Where should I go to learn how to create this basic Tumblr?
2. Although it all seems a bit above my head, I'd love to learn how to navigate through GitHub and be able to understand these neat projects that people post up. How would I learn how to do that?
3. Am I even on the right path? How would you guide me from this point? (I have no Django experience either and would love to know how to set it up)
4. I eventually want to get a job at a startup someday (either as an intern or as an actual dev if I get enough experience). Would tackling this project successfully and learning from it be an awesome portfolio builder or is it simply a waste of time (I know it's not, but in your eyes at least).

Fist things first, this is my first post on Reddit. I had been lurking for a while, and I would have never subscribed if it hadn't been for this subreddit. I find it awesome to have all those stories in the same place, all those testimonies, and all this information, that just need to be read, analyzed and used... Keep it up !

I needed to formulate things. I needed to clean my closet. It took me 5 days to write the following 6 pages (mind you, I had other things to do). If you care to read it, I hope it will be food for your thoughts as much as your stories have been for me. I have one flaw, though, which is that I talk too much, so I might seem off-topic from times to times... However, I think there will be a great amount of information to pick up here. And I have my own problems. Any suggestion, any help is welcome.

I would like to say that I have started NoFap for a rather unusual reason. I've stopped masturbating because I just didn't have the motivation anymore. I have a strong case of ED and I'm tired of trying to even pretend that I can do it.

I'll add an arrow besides topics where I try to talk about general things, and I won't besides topics where I talk about myself, in case you would not be interested. 

Also, if you think this is too general to be posted here, just tell me.

**BACKGROUND** 

I'm 23 years old, I've been diagnosed with depression 3 years ago, I've seen a psychatrist and been under medication since then. Doing a therapy has been one of the most inspiring things I've done, I strongly suggest it to anyone that would be currently hesitating about it.

I come from a rather strict family, with strong moral values and with a bit of religious values. My mother died when I was 11. As a widower, my father taught his children that there was the true and sacred love, and that sex outside this true love was dirty and disgusting. Also, I went to a moderate catholic school, which I have nothing to complain about, except for having taught me that masturbating was wrong.

**FAPPING &amp; PORN**

I hit puberty very lately compared to my schoolmates, due to the trauma caused by the death of my mom (I basically stopped growing up for three years). I tried to fap for the first time at 13ish, when I was still prepubescent, out of curiosity, because I was hearing my friends talking about it. 

I've always felt guilty about it, for the reasons I've mentionned above (sex is disgusting, masturbating is wrong). Also, I've understood a few years ago, that I did not allow myself to have pleasure without feeling guilt. Fapping is too much of a relief when you're supposed to mourn the loss of someone. And yet, it's a relief you can't deprive yourself of. 

In the meantime, I was scared of girls, and I still had this strong disgust thinking about sex. I started watching pornography at the age of 19, thinking that it was not normal to be as disgusted at the sight of a vagina as I was. 

It worked quite alright, because it really helped me tearing down some of my moral presuppositions about sex and relationships. I got a bit more confident and less scared of girls. But I could not have sex. Even though I was not disgusted by the organs, I was still scared of the real intercourse.

**WHAT FAPPING PROVIDES** ← 

Do you guys think that sex and fapping are the same feeling ? Some say yes. I for one would say it is totally different.

When having sex, have you ever felt as if your body did not contain your soul anymore ? It's like that for me. When I climax, I literally can't think straight for something like 15 minutes afterwards, I'm just smiling with my eyes wide open. My previous girlfriends have always found it quite funny.

I'm French (hence my scholar English). The French have an idiom for the orgasm : *la petite mort*. The little death. It refers to the spiritual release you get when you have an orgasm. That's a heavy form of pleasure which has a scary side. Losing control, dying. Who wants to lose control ? Who wants to die anyway ? 

Fapping provides a way of relieving the pressure without losing control. You know what to expect and you know how to do it. You just need 5 minutes. You do your thing, clean up, throw your napkin away and move on with your life. It's a very safe and rewarding feeling you get out of something that should be an adventure. It's like watching TV when it's sunny outside. Well, at first, fapping is a way to discover yourself, your body and your access to pleasure. At first, fapping is an adventure. We should not make an habit out of it though. That's the mistake I've done.

That's something about which I disagree with a lot of you fapstronauts. You tend to say that NoFap is about getting back the control of your life, I personaly think it's dealing with the fact that you don't control everything. To begin with, you don't totally control yourself.

**LOVE** ← 

Since I was diagnosed  with depression, I've been trying to change. I've tried to question everything, to understand everything. It has not actually been about changing to become who I wanted to be, but it's been about discovering who I really was, what I really needed, and becoming able to leave according to myself.

I've discovered how love and feelings were important. Not only do they make sex better, but they also can be vital to a sexual intercourse. It all depends on the way you relate to sex. My psychatrist told me a few months ago that there is a huge difference in the way women and men deal with sexuality. They don't have the same access to pleasure. Men need to have an orgasm during an intercourse, else they only get frustrated. Women don't get an orgasm as easily, and they often won't. So they know have to rely on other stuff. On foreplay, of course, but also on other aspects of the relationship : feelings, love, activities...

The thing is, all every man and every woman are not as described above. Some men have a rather feminine sexuality, some women have a rather masculine sexuality. 

**SOCIETAL PORNOGRAPHY** ← 

The problem is that that's not what we are told. We are told to fit in the models that will make us consume... 

We frequently hear that porn is not real sex ; but when was actually the last time you saw something real on TV, in the news, in books, or on the Internet ? I believe that the mass media, along with trends such as advertising, feminism, egalitarianism... , have resulted in standards to emerge, and those standards also corrupt the way we see things. We see beautiful, sexy and flawless people everywhere. If you feel insecure, you'll start thinking you can't succeed in this society.

Everybody is lying about that. You just need to listen to your friends talking about sex, about their stamina, the size of their dick and how they make women come, then type « erectile dysfunction » on the Internet, where everyone is anonymous an can speak shamelessly about their problems, to see how biased we are.

All I'm saying is that NoFap should be a first step towards being a real freethinker, not only a porn-conscious person.

**SEX DRIVE, PLEASURE, ERECTIONS...  AND DEPRESSION**

Now, depression is known to kill your sex drive and your pleasure, and antidepressants are known to kill your erections. Which is what leads me to the crucial part...

**ED** (where any advice is welcome)

So... Where to begin... 

Like I was saying, I've always felt insecure about sex. My first time, 2 years ago, was chaotic (or should I say « my first times ») ?  I was with a girlfriend I really liked, and I had strong feelings for her. We had been together for 2 months. I was 21, she was 20 and it was her fist time as well. Couldn't have been worse. We managed to have a normal sexual life for a few weeks after that. I just needed to understand that having sex was not about pounding her in a porno-like way (it made me come in a few seconds anyway).

The shit hit the fan after a few months, when we started over-capitalizing the sexual part of our relationship. We were both rather insecure about it, and yet we were thinking it was the most important thing to do. I wish I could go back in time, because I really screwed up. We ended up having sex with minimal foreplay, when we did not want to, when we could not, we started taking no more pleasure about it, and we started feeling guilty about not making it work. 

Somehow, we managed to get back to a rather normal sexuality, by rediscovering foreplay. But the deed was done, I think. I could not get it hard anymore. We broke up after a 6-month relationship, and sex must have been the major issue in my decision. I had managed to become even more insecure about sex. I also had to increase the dose of antidepressants.

Consciously or unconsciously, I destroyed every relationship I had in the year and a half following, and it was always about my erectile dysfunction and the fears it induced in me. I would meet a girl, start dating her, eventually end up in bed with her – despite trying my best to postpone it, then I would not get it hard, feel like shit about it, start stressing and dump her over something else a few days after.

My psychatrist has diagnosed me with a fear of castration. I won't detail this, unless you want me to, but it makes great sense. 

**HOW I STARTED NOFAP**

I was still PMO at least once a day, even though my sex-drive was going downhill. I started not being able to get it hard on my own, I started having premature ejaculations alone (basically, I would come with half a boner, which sucks big time, I swear). 

And I discovered NoFap a few months ago. Yet, I kept on masturbating as a way to pretend to have some kind of sex-drive whatsoever. I was thinking that if you don't try, you don't get anything, right ?

Then I met this girl. The type of girl that makes you want to make it work. I usually don't masturbate when I'm in a relationship, and I decided it was the right time to do it. On the 31st of July, I stopped fapping. It did not do much, I must say. Picture yourself getting a blow job by a girl you genuinely love, being unable to have an erection, and the girl is just like ""what the fuck ? am I doing it wrong ?""... And yet, she was really patient and careful, and we ended up having sex. It was the first time in one year, and I hadn't masturbated for 30 days. After a very, very heavy foreplay, it was my best love-making ever (even though it did not last too long). 

I wish I could say that my ED was all about the first time anxiety, but I can't lie. This awesome sex session was a one time thing. We tried twice on the following days, and it was lame. The first time, I did not come, the second time, I had a premature ejaculation (after hours of not being able to pop a boner). What happens is that, when things get sexy, boner-killing images and thoughts pop in my brain, like work, family. Once again, picture yourself getting a blow job, and starting to think about your father or your boss. Damn.

I started stressing beyond all reason. It became the only thing I could focus on in the relationship, and I was genuinely terrified. I talked about it to my psychatrist and to my doctor. I even tried to get a second opinion by my step-mother, who is a doctor as well, and I swear I was on the verge of cracking in tears. She told me it sounded like a phobia.

I managed to focus back on the things which made me love her. But very soon, she left the town. I wanted a long-distance relationship, she did not. I can't help but think that if I had been making love to her properly, she would have thought about it twice. I can't help but hate myself about that.

On the 8th of September (the day when she told me she wanted to break-up), just before going to her place, I knew there had been too much stress and distance, I knew something bad was to come. I masturbated. Then she broke my heart. I haven't masturbated since then. I haven't even felt like it, to be honest.

**DAY 53**

On the 28th of September, I left my home town for an internship. I found myself alone in a city I don't know, where I have a few acquaintances but nobody really close, suffering from oneitis. On top of that, just before leaving, I asked my psychatrist to lower the doses, because, well, there was nothing left to lose. I've been feeling castrated,  emotionally crippled, I've met quite a few nice and good-looking girls that seemed interested by me, but I've basically behaved like the jaded guy I am. But I'm doing better now. And I'm proud to hold tight. Step by step, I'm getting my confidence back.

As far as no fap is concerned, I have something like one wet dream every 3-4 nights. I've always had lots of wet dreams, which are entertaining and relaxing, but which are always about premature ejaculation, shame and awkwardness. I fear that it somehow prevents my sex-drive from increasing, but I guess my brain is doing his work on his own. I sometimes wake up with morning wood, but I don't have random boners. I would do anything to though. When I touch it, my dick still feels insensitive, as if it was dead.

**THINGS TO COME** 

Anyway, I'll keep on counting my days without fapping, because even though it's quite easy at the moment, it's an achievement in itself. What is the worst that can happen anyway ? I know that some day will come when I feel the urge to fap and when NoFap really becomes a challenge.

In the meantime, I'm done focusing on it. I'm exhausted of being ashamed and frightened about it. I'm worth more than my temporarily dead dick. 

I swear it guys, I'll get my dick back. But before that, I'll get my Mojo, I'll find another girlfriend (for now, I still would just like to get back with the previous one, you know...), even though I'm planning on not having sex until I'm able to face it. I'll assume that, and I'll make them love me for that.

**SEDUCTION** ← 

And this leads me to the last issue I wanted to discuss.

Like I was saying, I've read some stuff about social engineering, self-improvement, and especially PUA. I must say that PUA, along with NoFap, have something that can't work with me. They both, in their own way, use sex-drive as a leverage to achieve things. And yet, there are great things to learn about them.

Through my 3 years of depression and 2 years of ED, I've met quite a lot of girls (although I haven't had sex with a lot of them...). They've all been careful, patient and lovely. I've managed to seduce them without the least sex-drive, and I've been rewarded. I didn't have to give them great sex to keep them satisfied, they really liked me for who I was. I've understood a few days ago that if it hadn't worked out, it was because I was the one hating myself. For all those who suffer from ED, don't ever think that you won't be able to make someone happy. You are awesome, just be patient and honest with them as well as with yourself. "

I'm an intern (graduated BSME) at Company A and am signed on for six months. The boss knows I'll be looking for a fulltime job afterwards. I found through LinkedIn that someone from my Company A later got a job at Company B. In a few days, Company B will have a representative come to our location to check out whether or not we will be making products for them. Company B is one of my top choices in getting a job and I'd like to try to get to know people from there and think this could be a good opportunity.

Any ideas on how I should go about this to be able to get closer to Company B? Or is this not the setting I should somehow go about this. "

12dfsj,3,2012-10-30,Job hunting help/advice,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/12dfsj/job_hunting_helpadvice/,"Hello r/accounting,

I know this has been asked before, but I am in need of some advice. I live in the Detroit/Toledo metro area.

I graduated in May 2012 with my Master's in Accounting with a focus on tax. In the program I had a 3.65 overall GPA, and a tax GPA of 3.8. Additionally I graduated in 2011 with my Bachelor's in Accounting with a 3.25 Accounting and overall GPA. I know my undegrad GPA is something that is going against me.

While attending school I helped out with VITA- certified preparer one year and site leader the next. I was involved in ASA- not a E-Board member though. I was also selected as the team captain for a Deloitte case competition, and was told they had written me down as an individual to watch. I was also involved in several IM sports.

I have had two internships, with the same company, as a corporate controller where I was able to do a lot of corporate accounting work. However, due to budget cuts and pending legislation they are not hiring until they have a better idea of the future.

After I graduated I have been working with a small company back home acting as the treasurer/bookkeeper - It is helpful to give me some extra cash, but there is no room for advancement and no benefits or anything. I have also been studying for the CPA exam. I have passed REG and AUD, and am currently studying for BEC. I have also been volunteering as a coach of a local youth sports team.

I have been applying through our career network and have had some interviews, but still no offers. I have done mock interviews to get an idea of what I need to improve on and I try and work on all those things. I have also cold called/mailed local CPA firms to see if they need any help during tax season.

Can someone provide me guidance on trying to obtain a full-time job? I am geographically mobile, but when I fill out application I always narrow it down to two or three cities.

I appreciate your help, and sorry if this type of question has been getting old on here."

I don't find myself around people as much as I used to and I'm kind of putting a wall between me and my social life. I feel very alone.

I previously had a big 4 internship, and I never got the full-time offer. Should I be worried that I will accept an offer, then someone will call them and ask about me? 

I'm also worried about the fact that in one interview with another big 4. They asked me if I was extended a full-time offer at that firm and I said yes. Not sure if that was the right decision but when youre on the spot like that you dont even have time to hesitate a second to think about it. They ended up offering me the job. Do you think they will bother to check? Or do they generally just do criminal background checks after you accept?"

I had a few investment banker and management consultant friends who through interns and then graduate jobs would, with pride, talk about how many hours they worked and the importance of their work.

I also find that their job titles are listed as ""Executive"" or ""Senior"" after 2-3 years in the role. This only made me question the value of job titles. I wouldn't have thought you could have that tag with such little experience.

So whats the deal? Do you take real pride in your work and are those titles truly warranted, or do you feel its just in place to make you feel better about the hours you have to put in? 

I'm honestly curious, its not meant to be negative... but moreso there's little said about these industries. "

As the title states, I'm curious about the school and health care in general. I'm a freshman in high school and have wanted to become a doctor for the past few years and am still just beginning to get a grasp on the medical world.

I took a few classes these past few summers through saturday academy, some of them at OHSU. One was about medical careers and the average day of a radiologist or cardiovascular surgeon or whatever the case happened to be. I took another at Pacific (medical illustration and anatomy) and was one of several lucky students who got to stick my hand in a cadaver (It was no longer being used in their classes and would be recycled at the end of that summer). I understand many people will tell me that I don't know for sure what I want to do yet, but even so, I still want to learn more about the medical profession and the required steps I'm going to need to get there.

While research intrigues me, I am mainly interested by trauma surgery, as I like the stressful atmosphere of the ER. I believe that at HS2 we have a partnership with OHSU (not positive) and am interested in learning more about OHSU and the opportunities there. I hear there are summer internships, tours, ect.

**TL;DR** What can I do in high school to help prepare/expose me to medschool and the medical field in general?"

I'm also curious about these undergrad research things in general, are they tough and time consuming? What happens if I am too busy to focus on it, and is it a low-stress thing?"
