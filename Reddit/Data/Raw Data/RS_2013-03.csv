My university is also advertising internships with these companies for the students starting their placement year this September.

Like I said, I'm new to all this and I'm not sure how to organise or where to start or what could be done to address the situation.

I wanted to pursue Biology research after college, but after working in a lab for a few years, I decided that really wasn't for me. After graduation, I had a pretty good internship with a start-up in the health IT space doing business development. I enjoyed what I was doing and more importantly I was very curious about the technologies we were using. I began to teach myself basic programming (already knew VBA, started Python and Java).

I know that the CS world has a lot of demand right now and is forecasted to have a great deal of demand in the future also. 

I have been specifically looking at the MS program at DePaul
My question is whether the MS in CS program at DePaul is worth it? The program seems like it's targeted towards not just CS people, but also non-CS folks. The people with non-CS backgrounds would end up adding an extra year to their program and would have to take foundation courses before they began their grad school courses. So the program ends up being 3 years instead of 2. Also, the program seems like it's really easy to get into. All I would need is a 3.0/4.0, transcript, application and fee. No rec letters or GRE scores. I checked with the admissions office and they said I had a very good chance of being accepted. One of the things I really like about this program is that it can be full-time and most of the classes are in the evenings so I could potentially work in the daytime and go to school at night. 
 
Does anyone have any experience with this program? Is it too good to be true? Or should I wait and get the foundation courses else where and apply to a more competitive program next year? I'd appreciate any feedback about this program, my next steps, or any other advice or comments you can provide.

19h934,5,2013-03-01,[Help] Converting string to symbol; package/intern problems,Tiomaidh,lisp,https://www.reddit.com/r/lisp/comments/19h934/help_converting_string_to_symbol_packageintern/,"*EDIT: Solved.*

I'm writing a parser for a type of music notation. Internally I store note names (A-G) as symbols, but as I parse the file they initially come to me as strings. To convert between them I've been using INTERN, and everything was great.

With the parser done (or so I thought) I turned to the research project I actually want the parser for, which is a new `quickproject`. The parser is in the package #:cl-abc, the project is in #:loom. In my .asd file it says that LOOM depends on CL-ABC. My workflow is to open Emacs, enter `(ql:quickload ""loom"")` and `(in-package #:loom)` into the REPL, and then compile functions with C-c C-C as needed. Each .lisp file starts with `(in-package #:foo)`. I haven't dealt with exporting things yet--I'm using double-colon access.

The problem is that the following function from CL-ABC blows up when called from LOOM:

    (defun get-accidental-for (note key)
      (let* ((circle-of-fifths '(C G D A E B F# Db Ab Eb Bb F))
    	 (sharps '(F C G D A E B))
    	 (flats (reverse sharps)))
        (cl-ppcre:register-groups-bind (raw-key mode)
    	(""([A-G][#b]?)(m?)"" key)
          (let* ((sharp-count (position (intern (string-upcase raw-key)) circle-of-fifths))
            ...etc))))
    

The reason, as far as I can tell, is that `(intern (string-upcase raw-key))` interns that symbol into the LOOM package, whereas everything in `circle-of-fifths` is from CL-ABC. This causes POSITION to return `nil`, and then everything dies.

Obviously the goal is to have all symbols introduced from within cl-abc.lisp be part of CL-ABC, but I'm incredibly confused by the whole package system. The HyperSpec's documentation on INTERN was not terribly helpful, so I'm turning to you for advice.

Thanks!"
19h8xq,2,2013-03-01,Personal Narrative Input,ChuckleWave,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/19h8xq/personal_narrative_input/,"After reviewing several of the SOP's here, I've decided I needed to re-write my own as it was very subjective. I'm applying for an interdisciplinary master's program (MAIS), which requires the following:

A brief narrative outlining your academic interest and meeting the following criteria:

* Narrative should be approximately 650 words

* Include any current or long-range interests in research, teaching or other professional objectives.

* Please describe any publications or other evidence of scholarly endeavor you have achieved.

* List academic and professional organizations in which you are active and any fellowships, scholarships, or other honors you have received

I've removed some personal information for my own protection.

Here's what I've got:

I aspire to study geographic information systems (GIS), geology, and public policy at Reddit University using the MAIS degree plan to develop myself into an educated and experienced emergency manager. In 2010, I graduated from The University of Reddit with a bachelor’s degree in Emergency Administration and Disaster Planning. I have over 1.5 years of work experience in emergency management, in addition to skill sets gained from training exercises outside of the workplace. I excel under pressure and have a strong technical writing background. I have chosen Reddit University due to its science and technology atmosphere, the strong reputation for GIS, Dr. Awesome Sauce's impressive background and the flexibility of the MAIS program. In the short term, I look to achieve an edge in my industry while gaining experience. In the long term, I look to apply GIS and supplemental research to develop better ways for private and public industry to perform planning and analysis in disaster situations.

While at The University of Reddit, I was a member of the International Association of Emergency Managers - Student Chapter and completed certifications for nine FEMA Independent Study Courses. My area of study consisted of comprehensive emergency management involving the emergency management cycle: disaster response, recovery, preparedness, mitigation and terrorism. I learned what techniques are necessary to control, overcome and rebuild from a catastrophe.

I completed an emergency management internship at the Reddit Hospital, in which my main research concentrated on the hospital's new mass decontamination facility. I, with my mentor, put together training exercises in which we taught hospital staff how to mobilize and demobilize the facility, in addition to how to respond when needed. I have been involved in training ranging from small tabletop workshops to large full scale exercises in which stakeholders are actively involved. My current employment is the management of hazardous material releases throughout North America. In my position, it is critical to remain vigilant during stressful 'on-call' days when there is pressure for an expedited response. Following the account of a spill, I author detailed incident and corrective action reports to state and federal agencies, including the State Commission on Environmental Quality and the Environmental Protection Agency. I am a trained NOAA Super Severe Weather Skywarn Storm Spotter, and regularly attend the Severe Storms Association National Storm Conference. I am also a member of the County Community Emergency Response Team.

I am interested in researching GIS combined with geology and public policy due to their applications for effective and efficient disaster management. GIS technology allows for the 'fast-track' integration of vast amounts of data to turn into actionable intelligence for first responders and stakeholders. That data can be quickly assessed, shared, collaborated and can result in a coordinated response. Supplementing GIS with a background in geology will provide a better understanding of the natural environment and its possible risks. Executing this concept with an understanding of public policy can provide for better implementation of regulations preventing the loss of life or property. The combined study of these subjects will provide strong performance in situational awareness, data management, operations support and mitigation.

I was initially drawn to Reddit University due to its flexible yet strong science and technological programs. The atmosphere provided is beneficial for my anticipated research to thrive. Upon further investigation, the fact that Reddit University has been a leader for GIS research and education in this state is significant. The GIS program's recognition of excellence by the Council of Governments and Oracle Corporation make it noteworthy. When exploring the GIS faculty, the discovery of Dr. Awesome Sauce solidified my desire to continue my education at Reddit University. A member of the National Academy of Sciences, among other things retained for privacy make him someone to be astounded of.

I look to offer Reddit University my experience, knowledge and commitment. I hope to gain more of these three traits in return. I have no doubt I would succeed in this environment and am eager to do so. I am looking to invest in my future, and I want Reddit University to be a part of it.

We've been together for almost 2 years now.  
  
My boyfriend is the kind of person who achieves everything quickly and in a way that amazes and interests other people. He's frequently flown out to places where people want to see his work, buy from him, even lately asked to have some of his work put into a music video.  
  
I'm the kind of person who's more average and has to work really hard to achieve small things. Case in point, he's working on his PhD, and doesn't pay tuition because the university loves the publicity they get from him. I'm still working on my undergrad because I've had to work and pay my whole way through as a part-time student. Everyone assumed for a long time I wouldn't actually graduate.  
  
On his last trip to the music video set, I got really upset back at home while I was at a career fair because of how a recruiter there spoke to me as if I wasn't worth her time. She kept telling me that everything I said wasn't what any recruiter wants to hear and why haven't I done any internships (because some of us have to work and don't have time to jump around with short-term internships, bitch), blah blah blah. And then to FaceTime my boyfriend later and hear how much the music video guys love him and how he's making really great connections there and they're so excited about his work and it's better than they imagined and maybe they'll do another one with just him and his work... I just couldn't handle it.  
  
So when he got back in town, I listened to everything that had happened while he was there, I was genuinely excited to hear about his experience, and I asked a lot of questions. Then, nothing. He didn't ask me anything about what happened with me while he was gone or asked about the career fair or the interview I had with a huge company or why I had been upset while he was away. It was like I didn't matter.  
  
Then, to hear his roommate (who's become a friend to both of us) ask him to teach him how to play piano (because he's amazing at that too) and say that he feels so blessed to be living with my boyfriend because he's able to teach him so many things... You get the picture.  
  
I know it's just my pride, but I feel like SOs should also make you feel like you're special and super amazing too. I promote everything that he does and try to help him make more connections with powerful people. And now that he's asking me if I would move to another state with him if he got this dream job of his (which of course, they had already heard of him and wanted him to apply and he's pretty much guaranteed the job)... I just think if I do that, I'm essentially disappearing into this shadow of awesomeness that he's casting because our interests are similar so anything I can do, he's done and he's done it better, and then I just don't have an awesome enough life in comparison where he even asks me what happened in my day.

My apartment has a parking spot, but my roommate has had her dead car there for three months now, meaning I nor any of my other roommates can use the spot. 

The problem with her car is as simple as a dead battery, but she keeps asking people to jump it for her, clearly not understanding that batteries' lives are not infinite. She has jumped it and reparked it upwards of five times now. I have done everything short of going and buying her a new battery. I've cleaned it for her, I've borrowed a device from my father to diagnose the problem, I've jumped it with my car twice now.

Last week, my own car died (failed ignition coil) and I replaced it, and I let her know that I needed the spot that Saturday to find if there was a root problem. After putting in the cleaned battery, the thing started, where she celebrated by driving to the bank where it died again. So, clearly, she gets it jumped again only to drive it back and park in our only spot. I tell her that I need to work on my car and my next free time was Monday, so I expect her to deal with it then since she only has two classes per week and an internship with flexible hours that she can telecommute to. Not happenin. Car is still there Monday. Wednesday is my next free time. Trying to be considerate, I let her sleep in until noon. Then, I went and looked up service stations she could tow it to. By then it was too late and I had to go to work.

So, I shot her a text saying I absolutely had to work on it this Saturday morning. No response. Texted her again asking if she got it. She did. 

Meanwhile, I have put probably 400 miles on my car waiting for her to get her act together. If I come home and the car is still there, meaning it's taking the spot for when I plan to work on mine tomorrow morning, I want to just push it out onto the curb. I am tired of waiting, I am paying for the spot too and every time I drive my hour long commute, I am putting my car and my peraonal safety at risk (by sparsely using my blinkers).

My question for you folks is: Am I overreacting by pushing her car to the curb and essentially forcing her to deal with it? What should I do in this situation? "

I'm an undergraduate student looking to go for my masters in planning. I've thought a lot about the possibilities of it and am really trying to build my resume in preparation for applications next year. It's very likely that I'll want to go into the social stream, though I am not terribly excited about having to specialise so early - I'm an avid interdisciplinarist and I know that whatever programme I go to become a part of, I want to bring in as many different things as I can. 

With that said: I've been given the advice that it would be ideal, falling short of actually getting a paid internship with one, that I work with a planner of some variety (preferably social, but that is not essential) to get hands-on experience with planners and planning before applying to graduate school.

I have an internship position I've been accepted to and I start soon. The only obstacle now is the drug test.

The last time I smoked was the night of February 18th. Before that I smoked twice a week maximum, with maybe one week at the beginning of the semester where it was more frequent than that. I am 5'11'' and weight approx. 156 pounds. I think I have a fairly fast metabolism.

 I found out the next Friday (2/22) I got the job and started cleansing immediately. I've been drinking at least a gallon of water a day, along with cranberry juice when I can get it (I'm a college student and rely on rides from friends) I have also been lifting weights 2 or 3 times a week and running here and there. 

I take the test on monday at Quest. Basically what I'm asking is should I be worried? What else should I do before the test?

I also should mentioned that I have stopped exercising and plan on eating a hearty steak meal for the creatine tonight. Hopefully I'm doing everything right. Is it reasonable that I should pass this test?

EDIT: I passed. The key for me was exercise, water, and probably having it out of my system quickly due to my fast metabolism."

19gveh,24,2013-03-01,Life changing career descision,Pooryid,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/19gveh/life_changing_career_descision/,"I have recently come across a life changing career opportunity and have no idea which route to take. Currently, I am a 23 years old and have recently graduated with an accounting degree. I work for McGladrey in their tax services for two months now and I hate it. I’ve done an internship at KPMG last year in their international tax department and it was a bit more interesting.  I’ve also done 3 other accounting internships for various companies. 

The opportunity I have in front of me is through my first accounting job. I worked for this guy who owned a business selling computer and electronic related hardware online. They now selling pretty much everything and have grown from a $4 million dollars in revenue a year company when I left 3 years ago to a $24 million dollar company. I left that company because I needed to focus on school and also get different experience within accounting. 

Now the McGladrey position is a good job. It has good salary, good benefits, it’s safe, and there is growth. But my god, it is boring and not something I have passion for at all. I met with my old boss from the old company and he wants me back. Essentially, he wants to bring me up to a position that acts like a CFO. He never had a great accounting system going on. When he hired me, I was his first accountant and I set up quickbooks for him. Now he wants me back and have me take on roles that oversee the finances, accounting, and investments of the firm. This is something I’ve always wanted to do and is a great opportunity. The salary will be paying more than my current job after the first 90 days and the potential to make a lot more quickly along possible with equity in the firm. The biggest benefit and what I want most out of a job is to take ownership of my work and be part of something where I can help make it grow. I want that passion where I can wake up every morning with a purpose and I feel like this new career will take me to that place. 

The problem is that I have is that if I do make this switch, I can’t go back to McGladrey or the big corporate world. No one will want to see that I’ve only worked for McGladrey for two months on my resume and then see some company no one has heard of. Few will hire me and hire me to a position and salary I deserve. This new company though isn’t some 5 year job or 10 year job, it is a lifelong commitment that I will be part of and benefit from. I am friends with the owner and have known him for 5 years. In addition, I am not that experienced. I may have had two tax jobs and some other accounting internships but I will make a lot of mistakes. My old boss knows this and says he will bring me up to be where I need to be because he sees potential in me.

What do you think Reddit? Should I stick with McGladrey through this storm or should I make that life-changing and risky career decision that can leader to a happier life and potentially more $$?

How can I transition?",SyrioBroel,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/19gpl5/im_currently_a_network_engineer_however_i/,"I went through college without an internship unfortunately. 

I graduated in 2010 and landed a network engineering job in 2011 and am currently employed. I have a few cisco certs, some Citrix certs, etc.

The problem is...I don't genuinely enjoy networking. I think it's dull, it's boring. Not to mention when there's not actually a problem, I'm just not doing anything.

I took it upon myself to learn some programming. I picked up a few introductory C# books, and I've blasted through them in less than 2 weeks. I seriously love it. I wake up and can't wait to come to work to practice my C# and do the quizzes and ""Try it Out!'s"" in the book, not networking. 

I get irritated if someone calls me in for a networking problem, but I love debugging my own code. 

I know there are a lot of branches off of programming, just like there are networking. Because I don't have much networking experience (brief VB.NET in college--which I aced and enjoyed), I know that I need to start practicing code in my off-time.

So, some questions:

* After I feel like I have a pretty strong grasp on C#, I want to get a firm grasp on ASP.NET as I've seen those 6 letters in almost every online position to apply to. Should I stick with C++ afterwards, or should I move into more valuable scripting such as Python, Ruby, Perl, etc?

* Is there a collaborative article on the types of different job markets for programming, as well as critiques and nuances of each? I.E. gaming, web-development, etc?

* Is there a way for me personally to be able to figure out which brance of programming I'd like to go down?

* Is it easy to switch/transition from networking to programming? I mean, I'm young, but I'm not sure if it's practical.

Thanks! :)"

My major is in Behavioral Neuroscience and I am minoring in Linguistics. I am currently doing a 6 month internship at a lab, and I really love the work environment here, so as of right now, I am leaning more towards going into research and academia rather than the medical direction, but nothing is set in stone yet.

I would like to return to Europe to continue my education and I want to start looking into some programs to get a broad idea of which direction I want to go in. But I don't even know where to start for this. When looking for where to go to college, I pretty much based my decision on the location: I wanted to go to Boston and study neuroscience. I didn't really focus so much on what the program at my university has to offer, which I now regret because I find that the curriculum for my major does not really fulfil my needs and interests as much as I would have hoped. I don't want to make that mistake with my continuing education, which is why I am turning to you, Reddit. 

How do I start this process? I would like to be in Europe, which country is not really important. Preferably somewhere that speaks German, French or Dutch. But this is very flexible, since, as I said, my priority is to fit my academic needs. I'm interested in a variety of fields. I think I would ideally like to end up working in an area that combines my major and my minor. Language processing in the brain is something that I would love to learn more about. But I am also interested in sensory and cognitive processes. Are there any search engines that you can recommend to find graduate programs? And once I have a found schools with programs in my field of interest, how do I evaluate which ones are ""better"" programs? What do I need to look for? Basically, I want a step by step guide on how to find and evaluate graduate programs, and what I can do during my undergraduate studies to prepare myself for them (e.g. should I try to take graduate level classes that are open to undergrads as well, or focus more on broadening my education in undergraduate level classes? What courses are generally required to start a graduate degree in neuroscience?). I know that it is always different for everyone, because everyone has different priorities, so if you could maybe share your experience on how you chose which programs to apply to and how you prepared, that would be extremely helpful. Thank you in advance!"

What i will do is basically spray the color of the non-transparent pixels of a picture onto the Transparents. On my previous attempt i wasnt blur the color evenly, but i got a quite nice spraying pattern which would be OK for most cases.
Though i now want to know all 
to safe a (SFML) sf::Color object with its corresponing coordinates and then be able to find any value as fast as possible when i do know the coordinates.

At first i tried unordered_set but it figured it requires a hashing function for the Key/Element sf::Color and as i never did it before i first looked for a slightly easier, simpler, solution. Well not quite simple as i found out is unordered_map with a pair&lt;int,int&gt; following with a sf::Vector2u, which basically is a pair but with all operators overloaded by the authors.
On stackoverflow i found snippets i combined to:

    template &lt;&gt;
    struct std::tr1::hash&lt;sf::Vector2u &gt; {
    public:
            size_t operator()( sf::Vector2u val ) const throw() {
    			size_t h = ( ( val.first + val.second )*( val.first + val.second ) + val.first - val.second ) / 2;//something with x   
                 return h;
            }
    };
still says it cant find operator ==  in this case because of any ambiguity in SFML or sth like that
Nevertheless i thought you guys maybe give me a hint on either another way to solve the problem itself or this very sub problem.

19gamr,1,2013-03-01,"Advice for Senior with lots of theory knowledge, but little programming experience",csmathguy228,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/19gamr/advice_for_senior_with_lots_of_theory_knowledge/,"**Background:**

Sorry if this looks obnoxious, but I bolded the important facts so you can skim this section.

I'm a **fourth year**, double majoring in **math and CS**.  I've been **focusing on math** most of my undergraduate career, and in fact only 7 of the 15 classes I took to qualify as a CS major involved programming, most of which were in my first year.  I got the CS degree mostly because I was very interested in the theory side of CS.  I've got a pretty good GPA (3.7) from a top 5 university in math, but it's pretty average in CS.  **As a result, I know a lot about algorithms, combinatorics, logic, and complexity theory, but not a whole lot of the practical aspects.**

I applied to grad school for math, but I'm having second thoughts (mainly that I think after getting a PhD, I probably won't want to continue to post-doc, and be back where I am now).  So **I'd like to apply to some software engineering jobs** (or anything else that might fit my profile, if you have a suggestion).

Now, **I don't have a whole lot of programming experience.**  I haven't done much in the way of designing code around objects, or writing code in C++ or Java since before college.  **I can hack together most algorithms in python or Haskell (cause it's basically just math), but I don't have big projects to show off**, and probably don't know python's capabilities that well anyway.

**Questions:**
I'm confused about where to go from here.  April 15th is the deadline for accepting math grad school, so I would love to have a serious job offer by then, but more realistically, I'd like to have a better idea of what I want to do before then.

1. Where should I be looking for jobs (preferably in Chicago, NY or some other city in the northeast), and **what kinds of companies** would want to hire me?

2. **How do I make my resume look better?**  I have 3 summers worth of math ""research"" (in quotes, because that really consists of learning math on the frontiers of research, rather than discovering new results).  I don't have much in the way of even class projects to talk about.

3. What can I do to **improve my employability in the short term?**  My first step is getting on github and uploading code, but is there anything more specific to this?  Should I bother refreshing my C and Java, or try to learn new languages for jobs I want?

4. Everyone I know from high school seems to be getting into CS.  Is it a field that's quickly becoming too crowded, especially for someone with less experience?  This line of thinking is what makes me think getting a PhD might hurt more than help.  Also, how do I tell the difference between good jobs that will let me move up in the future, places where I'll clearly be outclassed, and places that won't offer much advancement or help me with future jobs.

5. **Data science/Machine Learning?** I don't know a lot about this, but it's been interesting me a lot, at least when it involves HMMs and other AI algorithms.  What kind of experience or knowledge do I need, and will it be as fun as the theory I'm learning in class?

6. **How much do I actually know?** Talking to people at my school, I think I know a good bit about algorithms and data structures. I aced the class pretty easily 2 years ago, but it's been a while, and we're not exactly known for CS.  Does that matter more or less than domain knowledge, and how should I take this into account when applying for jobs?

7. **Summer Internships?** Would it be a good idea to apply to them?"

I've been mulling something over and I was just wondering if I could get the advice of someone who has maybe been in this same situation.


I'm currently an intern at an agency, and things have been going well. However, I recently spoke to another agency who wants to fly me out for an interview.


Which is great. But that means I'm going to have to miss a couple of days of work in order to interview.


When I ask my current agency for a couple of days off, and they ask me what I'll be doing, do you think it'd be OK if I was up-front with them and told them that another agency wants to fly me out for an interview?


My current agency has maybe slightly hinted that they might be looking to hire me, but nothing concrete has been discussed. My bosses are nice people, but I'm not too sure if this sort of honesty would be appreciated.


Thanks.

This summer I was offered a programming internship at a local startup. It's very very small and nothing impressive, but the company is reputable in the area and I know the guys working there. Very smart dudes who I'm sure have a lot to teach me. It would take up 20-30 hours of work a week, but unfortunately it is unpaid. 

On the other hand, I was thinking of just relaxing and refreshing my mind over the summer before going to a real university. This is probably the only summer when I won't be taking classes, so I could finally spend time with my friends and family. Of course I would do some programming for myself, work on side projects from the convenience of my house.

So I'm not sure what to do. Take up a position that will take up ~30 hours of unpaid work per week, or take it easy and work on my own side projects?"

TL;DR I have a bachelor of science in economics, I want to work in philanthropy, but I'm willing to work in anything that will build up my curriculum.
---
I just recently returned to the USA after working at a family finance company in Chile. It was a fun adventure, but I'm at a loss as to where to go with my life.

**Work Experience:**

I graduated with a bachelor of science in economics back in 2009. All of my work experience comes from family companies, a finance company in Chile; a speech language pathology clinic that I started for my mother (which she now runs); and my father's photography/video studio. The rest is all volunteer work. I'm not so sure if my experience counts as much.

For your viewing pleasure, [Resume linked here](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0ByxUAtecVYuMbVNRYjZRemN3aE0/edit).

**Wishful Thinking:**

My dream job (read: unrealistic expectation) would be to work in a philanthropic organization like The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, a place dedicated to improving the well-being of people all across the globe. I realize that I have to have quite the resume to do so, and I simply do not have it. Looking for internships, I ran into this recommended places to volunteer page at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation:

http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Jobs/Volunteering

Now, the only place I've heard about on that list is the Peace Corps. It somewhat overwhelmed me when I looked at all the possibilities. Do any of you have any recommendations as to where I should focus my volunteering efforts, so as to build a resume to someday work at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation?

**Questions:**

1. I'm willing to work at any place that I could use as relevant experience as an economist. Where do you suggest that I begin my search? Internships are fine.

2. If I cannot find work soon, I was considering joining the Armed Forces. Which branch will leave me with the best opportunity to get a job when my service has come to a close? I'm thinking of either the Air Force, the Navy, or the Coast Guard."

They were the first to get back so I obviously told them I needed more time to think about my decision.

It seemed to me (maybe just the way the guy tried to almost like sell it to me) that it isn't worth it, but maybe it would be better then nothing to put on the resume.  

What are everyone's thoughts?

Like...really fucking afraid of just about everything.

It's not that I don't think I'm smart enough to do the work...I believe I am. But, I'm *kinda* lazy/a procrastinator. I know I need to change that, and I've got about 3 months to do so (I start my first graduate class in June).  Now, I know that the kind of work you have to look forward to will probably depend on your program, and for me, mine will be Human Sexuality Education, and later on (if everything goes well and I'm accepted into the other program) I'll be adding another Masters in Social Work. I've always been the kind of person (for better or worse) that finds it hard to be invested in something I'm not passionate about, which is kind of what scares me...if I can't bring myself to kick ass in this field (sex therapy), I don't know if I'll actually be able to handle anything ever- I've never been more passionate about the prospect of any other career than I am this one; I truly cannot imagine myself doing something else. And yet, I'm still worried that I'll fail :-/

So, I want to hear from you all. If you've been or are currently in graduate school studying something you love, how do/did you make everything work...jobs, internships, teaching, friends, significant others, everything? How did you manage your time? What was your work load like? What are some ways I can light a fire under my ass and kick everything into high gear to make sure I don't flunk out of school? 

I *know* that I have to want it bad enough, and I do. But for some reason, I just don't feel that I have enough of that hardcore work ethic, and I'll constantly play catch-up, and it's only a matter of time before that fails.  Also, I know I'm worrying about something that hasn't even started yet, and that I don't know how I'll respond to just yet...I know. *sigh*...I don't even know what I want from this post. I guess I just want to know your experiences with graduate school, and how you're handling (or not handling) it all. Thanks everyone."

19fyfs,6,2013-02-28,Should I Drop a Class?,spl1080,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/19fyfs/should_i_drop_a_class/,"So with the withdrawal deadline for classes being tomorrow, I'm trying to decide whether or not to drop ECE-2026 from my schedule.  I did abysmal on the first test (47, which was the cutoff for getting a U for the progress reports, though strangely I had an S).  The next test is on Monday, which unfortunately is on the other side of the deadline.  While I've been studying and I feel confident this time around, it's basically a gamble at this point.  If I drop the class, no worrying about how I have to do on Monday, but possibly delay graduating by a semester (which sucks when you're on loans like me), or stay in the class, and risk screwing up on the test and killing my GPA and my chances at scholarships, internships, and GT-Lorraine.

I know it is completely my choice either way, but what do you think would be the best move?  I'm currently taking 17 hours (PHYS 2212, ECE 2020, ECE 2026, MATH 2403, and ENGL 1101), and have 23 credit hours counting last semester and AP exams."
19fy28,2,2013-02-28,Child of drug addicts trying to become whole. ,zefside_inc,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/19fy28/child_of_drug_addicts_trying_to_become_whole/,"There are many things I would like to get off of my chest. 

Growing up is an extremely beautiful and deeply painful thing to experience. When I was a kid, I thought growing up meant having your own car, no one to tell you what to do, you know.... But as a 22 year old female, the aforementioned barely scratches the surface of what it feels like to be grown. 

Being grown means that my grandmother who saved me from my drug addict parents when I was 12 and raised me is getting older and not getting any healthier. She could die any day and I never see her. I always say I don't have time... but I do. I spend a lot of time doing things that add no value to my life (facebook, tv, etc.) but I can't seem to break away and go see her. She sacrificed so much for me... I was her first grandchild and the first girl she raised (she had 3 sons). Living with my grandma after being in a horrible home for the first 12 years of my life were rough. My grandma and I never saw eye to eye. I broke her trust when I was 13 and it devastated me. Finally, I earned it back. She paid for me to be in marching band in high school... those were the best times of my life. She always made sure I had everything I needed. She was a single mom for most of her life and didn't have much... still doesn't... But she gave to me what she could. I wish I could of had a closer relationship with her when I lived in her house. I moved out shortly after my 21st birthday. I think of her often and wonder how she is doing. I only live 20 minutes from her but I only see her once or twice a month. She is always so happy to see me and she always beams and glows when I tell her about my accomplishments. I've come pretty damn far from a drug addicts daughter. I'm the first person to go to college (will graduate in may '13), I have an internship at a company that will possibly lead to full time after graduation. I've done so much for myself and she is so proud. She always brags on me to others. I love her so much and am scared that she will die without me taking the time to really tell her how I feel. I can't tell her how I feel... can't tell her how much I love her, how incredibly thankful I am for her sacrifices, how much I admire her and how much I miss her. I can't tell her cause I can't bear to see her cry... even if it is tears of happiness. I would break down and cry. I shouldn't be scared. I will tell her. I have to tell her so that when she dies, she will know how I truly feel about her. But when she is gone, who will I have to go visit on the weekends? Who can I tell my hopes and dreams to? Who will beam when I tell them how great I've been doing? It surely can't be my drug addict parents. 

My parents did meth for most of my childhood and teen years. They stopped it a few years ago but are now addicted to methodone and xanax. They try so hard to be good parents. They tell me (when they're sober) that they are sorry for the past. They know what they've done wrong. They want to be good parents to my younger brother and sister who still live with them. Some days they are good and we make dinner together and create good memories. Later that same week, they take too many pills and act like the most annoying and sad drunk person you've met. I don't feel like they are my parents. They are strangers... my siblings are strangers, too. My brother and sister have taken the same sad path as my parents. my little brother dabbles in marijuana and my little sister goes from man to man, trying to be loved. It's all too sad to take. Who are these people? Why are they in my life? I want to help them and have been trying. I used to be mad and angry and blame all my problems on them. I'm not angry anymore. I love them and forgive them for everything theyve done. They aren't bad people. Theyve made bad choices and sadly had children too young. They were sad, broken people before kids, and they raised sad, broken children. 

How do you become a whole person when you had a partial, misguided, and horrible childhood? How do you create, build, maintain interpersonal relationships when you are the child of an addict? You're expected to be normal like everyone else. But how? No one taught you how to love in a romantic way. no one instilled values or morals in you. You are half a person trying to become whole with very little direction. And by you I mean me. 

Some days it's way too hard to take. Others I think I'll be fine. Some days, I have wanted to die. Some day, I thought I could change the world. Today, I am somewhere in between. 

There is so much more I want to say, but I've ran out of energy for the night. Thank you for being here and listening to what I have to say.

I work full time (hourly job from home), go to school full time (local community college), and I want to pursue skills that can help me maximize the value I can create with my time.

I recently started an internship with a small local business marketing company and have been calling local businesses regarding our lead generation services. This is great! It's getting me out of my comfort zone and helping me gain skills related to what I care about.

I'm having trouble with my time management and priorities. I feel motivated and don't have an abundance of free time, and I'd like some help making sure that what I'm spending time on reflects what I care about.

I would like to share schedules and daily/weekly/etc goals with a buddy so that we can keep each other focused and motivated both in the present, and make sure that our actions are effectively supporting our goals. I would like to text status updates a couple to a few times throughout the day, and email every couple days to a week regarding big picture productivity and goals.

I want help guilting myself into staying focused and owning up to exactly how I'm spending my discretionary time.

If this sounds like the kind of accountability/motivational buddy relationship you're looking for, send me a message. Our goals don't have to match up precisely, but if we share the same general attitude and desired process we should be able to help each other!"

I had one internship last summer at IEEE, where I basically worked as a glorified tech position.  

I won't get into how I got into my situation now, as it isn't really important, but I have no passion for the field of Computer Engineering. I know it's a bit late to get into grad school right away, but I would like to get the process underway as soon as possible. I am going to look into taking the GRE as soon as possible, and look into different programs that are available at schools around the country. 

I am making this thread in hopes of getting any kind of advice on my chances of getting into a program that is different than my major, and on the process involved. I don't know why but I never even considered that it was a possibility until my friends brought it up, and they mentioned that having a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering, as well as with my good GPA, would be appealing to graduate schools. How true is this? I am very interested in studying either chemistry. biology or physics, however I have only taken Chem 1 &amp; 2 and Physics 1 &amp; 2 during college. Would I have to take summer classes or stay extra years here at Rutgers to take more classes?

I will be looking into a lot on my own as well but any feedback would appreciated, thank you!"

I would really love some honest feedback; from my resume to my video etc. Would a premier agency  be interested in picking me up as an intern? What else should I do after I've gone through the traditional application method?"

I am a great student (top of my class) with a strong resume. I really had my sights set on getting a Big 4 Audit Internship this summer, but ultimately never received an offer despite making it to the last rounds of interviews to two firms.

I figured, I need the experience now. Since I couldn't get a Big 4 internship, I might as well take an internship somewhere else, slap that on my resume and then try again next year for recruiting.

But that leaves me with a problem. Why do I want to join this local firm, if an interviewer asks? I can't say, ""the people,"" because despite going a number of accounting events (as a member of two accounting clubs), I have never seen this particular firm and thus have never met anyone. I just don't know a good answer. Any thoughts?"

It's too late to change majors so I'm finishing my degree regardless and am going to get on with my life.

Anyway I need an internship for my junior year summer and I was looking for an internship position in my hometown. I was looking around at WebDev firms in the area and none of them had official job postings or a place to submit a resume, so I decided to just email them directly thinking nothing would become of it. Well three of them emailed me back the day of and one even called me. However two of three asked for my resume and ""Portfolio"" one offered a unpaid internship.  

So here's my dilemma, I don't have a website up that I completely hand coded myself I've just recently (the past 2 months) been spending every waking minute of extra time reading CSS and HTML tutorials, guides, and code snippets (I find these most helpful). I'm computer literate to a core and know the hardware and everything but I know software is what I want to do. Today I almost missed two classes because I forgot time was passing as I was working on my website. But when they emailed my asking for a ""portfolio"" I didn't know what to tell them. I don't have a website that I built ground up. I have a wordpress site up and some hosting and whatnot but everyone knows that's not real coding, unless you custom build a theme. I'm going to get back to them tomorrow but I'm a little embarrassed of my skills. I'm no master designer but sure I could do HTML mockup and position things in CSS but making it look decent in a cohesive manner wont be happening on the first day. Idk what to really tell them should I be completely honest and tell them I'm pretty beginner or should I try to put out a site real quick and maybe get back to them in a week. What would an intern or entry level developer be doing exactly? I don't wanna get hired and them have me right code and take it and delete the whole thing and start over therefore being a burden on the firm. Any advice would be helpful thanks. 

TL;DR: What does a entry level dev job entail? How much do you need to be able to produce to not be a burden on the firm.

While these may not give you the exact experience they're looking for, they may get you in the door.  I figured I'd share how I personally gained experience, despite never landing an internship. 

**Student Organizations**

Join a professional student organization and dedicate yourself to it to gain leadership experience.  While becoming a member will help, the officer positions are what you should truly be shooting for.  Speak with the advisor for the organization and get in touch with the officers to find out how you can get involved.  Most universities have at least one of the following that you should join:

 * Finance Association

 * Investment Club

 * If your school doesn't have one, then start one! Schedule a meeting with the Head of your Finance Department and work with them.

**Competitions**


Join competitions related to your major that will give you experience in the field you want to go into.

* [Chartered Financial Analyst Challenge](http://www.cfainstitute.org/programs/cfaprogram/challenge/involved/Pages/get_involved_students.aspx)

* [Financial Planning Challenge](http://www.fpanet.org/professionals/EventsConferences/FinancialPlanningChallenge/)

This may seem obvious or redundant to you, but I've been shocked at how many students are unaware of these options.  Despite being from a non-target school, and what some may consider to be a party school, I've been able to get interviews off my leadership and competition experience alone.  This has been blatantly stated to me during interviews, so don't count yourself out!  "

So I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed. I'm in my last year at university, and I am part of a program that requires me to apply to lab research internships over the summer. I've completely dropped the ball. 

Out of the dozen or so I hoped to apply to, I've applied to ~3. The deadline for the last of them is tomorrow, and I still haven't finished. I have been ridiculously depressed since this winter, and one result of that has been a lot of procrastination and anxiety regarding these applications. I can't even begin to explain to the program director why, in the 3+ months I would have had to do this, I couldn't just couldn't manage. It's so stressful, and it's been eating away at me since mid-January. 

If I don't succeed, which seems likely, I think that I'll be kicked out of the program. For one, it would be humiliating. For two, I was really counting on using this to help me get into graduate programs. Applying for those promises to be even more traumatizing, and if this experience is any indication, it won't go well. Especially once I've totally eroded my support group and lost valuable letters of recommendation. My back-up plan when all else fails is to get into debt by applying to less competitive masters programs before pursuing a PhD. Not sure how I feel about that right now. 

So what do I need advice for? I'm not sure. This whole situation is just a mess, and I feel like I'm destroying my career before it even begins. 

tl;dr: Screwing over my chances at graduate school. At a loss.

So I've been married for 2 years, dated before that for 3, with a guy that I'm just now realizing isn't the kind of man I'm into. I use man pretty loosely, since at most I think people would consider him a boy... he's 29 and has no real goals in life except playing video games and not finding a job beyond his no-salary internship. And on top of that, he has a ton of insecurities, anything from how short he is to how fat he's getting to how lousy he is in bed...

It's gotten to the point now where I'm actually looking a real man, and I know that sounds so cliche, but just to be with someone who knows how to take charge and own a relationship. I've spoken to him about how much he's disappointed me and given him a million ways to make it up (tried exercising with him - he gave up; applied to a bunch of jobs for him - he never went to the interviews).
So now I'm ready to think about moving on, but to be honest, he's played the victim so often it's sort of got me thinking about seeing a new man even while I'm married to him. I've become really into the idea of him either suspecting or knowing that a real man is in my life, taking over and owning what used to be his. I know it sounds hurtful and what not and I know if I were any other person I'd look at my ad and think it was horrible, but this is where I am and I'm looking for someone who could help me with this.

I'm 5'4, of Asian descent, black hair and black eyes and keep in shape. I guess you'd say I'm beautiful, but I only really blossomed until after college, which is why I dated my now (sorta loser) husband."

First post on this sub, and I hope it's okay to post a question about my relationship. I'd really appreciate some perspective from you ladies because I'm having a bit of a ""gender role"" / woman-in-hardcore-career issue and I feel like you guys always give great advice about that sort of thing.

Boyfriend and I have been together for two years. A year ago and got a job across the country so we've been long distance since then. The plan was that I would finish my degree this May and try to get a job in his city. He's an incredible man and we're planning on a future together, and just so there's no misunderstanding, he absolutely wants me to do what is right for me, not just move to his city because it's easy for him.

In any case, I'm a bit unsure about what I want right now. Turns out I don't like his city and really don't want to live there. I've been working at an internship at a great company in my area, and I'd want to stay if they offered me a full time job. I'm also starting to entertain the possibility of grad school, and I'd want to go to a top-notch school, so I'd have to move. I'm itching to travel, maybe live in a different area, just be open to all the possibilities that are available to me at this age (22).

The thing is, I'm conflicted because of my relationship. I feel like I can't pursue all the things I want to do because I don't know how we would work it out. Take the job here instead of moving to his area? That's another year long distance until he can move back here (which he is willing to do). Want to go to really good grad school? There's a few more years long distance, unless he wants to abandon his career to up-and-move with me for a few years. I don't feel like I can explore all the job opportunities available to me because it wouldn't be just me moving to some weird area of the country, Boyfriend would need to find a good job there too.

Boyfriend is 100% supportive of me looking at any possibility I want. He doesn't want to limit me to choosing jobs and grad schools in His City or My City. But at the same time, I don't want to be in a long distance relationship forever while he and I pursue different things... we'll have to live in the same place eventually, and to do that, we'll need to compromise.

I am afraid that being in this relationship will make it harder for me to achieve my education and career goals, and that I'll compromise and regret it later. Not because he wants me to compromise, but because I'll just have to make decisions with another person instead of by myself. He's 30 and he's already got a good idea of what he wants. He doesn't have the same financial freedom I do to move all around the country and try new things with me. He's got an established career, so he's more tied down than I am.

I love him, but I don't want to be the girl who lets his career dictate our life together just because he's older and more established. I've worked just as hard as he has, I should have the same right to choose a career in a new city or an awesome grad school in a new place... but at the same time, when does this become so much that it's not worth it? It feels like our paths will just diverge and we'll never be able to live in the same place and not have one of us compromise on our career or education or whatever.

I think part of it is the age difference - he's 8 years older so he's a little more in touch with what he wants out of life. I'm only 22 and I still want to look at a bunch of different things. But I don't know how to balance this relationship and my desire to figure out what I want as an independent woman?

Not sure if this made sense, but I'd really appreciate any advice you guys have to offer about balancing a career with a relationship or dating with a decent sized age gap.

TL;DR - I'm 22 and wanting to look at all my opportunities for a career and grad school. I'm afraid I'll limit myself to make my relationship with my 30 year old boyfriend work. Help?

Thanks everyone!"

19j96f,35,2013-03-02,Amney,beforethewind,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/19j96f/amney/,"My uncle started hospice last weekend.

He is not terribly old. Of course, he is not terribly young, either. He is my grandmother’s brother, on my mother’s side of the family and he is dying. I am sitting on his bedside and outside, far away, police sirens are roaring. He was always our uncle, but he was more of a cousin, he was more of a peer. Uncle was a child at heart. With my brother and I being the only children in the family, he was our de facto cousin. He was the family friend we could relate to. He was not a condescending source of maturity; he was as ridiculous and optimistic as we were. The fact that he is dying destroys us. It destroys me. An obnoxious measure of sirens blots out my thoughts.

Adam is taking it with particular difficulty. He is the truest baby of the family and my younger (and only) brother. That is not to say that the rest of the family is coping any easier. Uncle Jack was the youngest of his siblings, as well. It is a terrible situation no matter how you word it. He would always be the one telling me, “John, you take care of Adam if anything ever happens to us,” meaning, the older relatives and my parents. That advice gives me little solace today.

Uncle Jack was a police officer for many years. He married a beautiful woman who we came to love as our aunt in his early thirties and that was probably the symbolic ending of our “peer relationship” with him. At that point, he was our elder. We were no longer arbitrary cousins. It ironed out the family. We knew who we were and what our family consisted of, at last. Adam was almost out of middle school when this happened and I was just graduating high school.

It is incredible what a decade can do to your being. Adam is now a police officer, very much so following in the footsteps of his beloved uncle. But Uncle Jack, dearest uncle… he is not nearly as thriving. He maintained a lustrous career in the New York Police Department and was looking forward to retiring by fifty. Instead, he contracted a rare cancer, probably due to a consistent bout of responding to emergency calls in this one devastated area of the city. You know the area: uprooted partitions of asbestos and every god damned carcinogen known to man were crudely molded into low-income housing. Now, every time some schmuck with a gun let a slug fly, these chemicals became airborne. These chemicals infected the lungs of the men and women who were there to protect the innocent bastards who were unfortunate enough to live in these areas, to live besides the walking scum of mankind that fought such petty wars. And now he was dying, before sixty years of age.

I will not get into the philosophy and utter bullshit that comes into play when discussing such matters. Would a just god allow a kind and fair person to die before the age of seventy? Would an omnipotent universe allow a schoolyard of young child to be slain at the end of a gun belonging to a madman? I am not one to even begin rationalizing these conversations and will sure as hell not begin to do so here. The fact remained: my uncle was dying and my family was preparing for the absolute worst. And we struggled against futile efforts.

Adam and I, we grew up and matured under almost direct-influence from my uncle. Of course my dearest mother and father crafted our personalities. Of course our friends and schoolmates helped to form our ideas. But, as far as anything beyond our genetic destinations, our uncle was probably singlehandedly responsible for our identifications as selves. From our profound interest in the afterlife to our preference to spending the weekends playing paintball in the mountains, he forged us. Honing in on the whole “afterlife” aspect of our interests, he gifted us one item that truly solidified our love for the macabre. When I was just beginning high school, however many years ago, our dearest uncle gave my brother and I a simple Ouija board.

It was a mass-produced and super commercialized item. We were, concurrently, super skeptical, but my brother was feebly open-minded and I was always looking for a way to spook myself and my family out. The silly board game even had a “glow in the dark” feature that added to the ridiculous nature of the whole ordeal. This led to Adam and I spending countless afternoons in the basement, sitting cross-legged on the floor in the dark, peering into the softly glowing, barely visible face of the Ouija board.

My skepticism had never left me and Adam was never particularly deft in the craft of manufacturing a storyline and characters of a fictional persona. So, when we began “meeting” otherworldly beings and dead humans through this board game, I was a little bit more than pleased and worried with our findings. Whenever we would ask their names, we would get a handful of random letters that only loosely resembled realistic names. But their backstories would always be spelt with the utmost of tact and grammar. While their names were gibberish, their explanations were perfect. It was a tad unsettling, sitting as the elder in the room.           

With all of this apparent fright, let it be known that I was never upset with my younger brother. I did not receive these paranormal readings as malcontent on his part. It just surprised me, at times in pride, at others in fear, that he could move the dial on the Ouija board and spell out entire life stories of people who had lived in the 14th, 18th, and 19th century. How did he, a public student living in 21st century America, know the politics of Luxemburg? How did he know that women in historical China would bind their feet? How would he, a boy who had barely begun to pick up the guitar, know what a mandolin was? I could not tell if it was my practical joking getting the best of him and I concurrently or if otherworldly forces were at play. Could this ridiculous board game actually channel… something else? Of course not. I refused to believe it. It must have been something about our subconscious or some other psychological phenomena that I could not explain.

Time went on and I found other vices to occupy my time. I found petty flirtations with girls my age that never came to fruition. Young puppy love and relations that never manifested themselves into an actual relationship. I was far too afraid to actually ask a girl out on a date, so these feelings only resulted in my confiding with my good friends. But I had not kept tabs on my younger brother. As where I had grown tired of playing with the Ouija board, Adam kept at it with his friends and even, at times, by himself. In the days that we had played with the device, we had “met” an entity known as Xenon. It was a completely ridiculous and unbelievable name, but she was supposedly an Asian immigrant of the Luxemburg storyline that I had previously alluded to. She was a servant of a household in the European micro-nation. She had also played the sitar. 
How my brother had created these characters, I have no idea. My imagination was certainly not at play and I, even as a younger teenager, truly did not try to disenfranchise the results of the board by creating my own metaphysical stories to frighten my brother.

I allowed them to play with the board without supervision for quite some time. He had shown it to various girls and boys from the neighborhood whenever I was working at the local craft store. As I had said, I was no longer interested in the game, but his young mind surely was. Life went on.

As we grew up a bit, we would cater to our love for the paranormal through alternative means. Fortunately for us, it became a topic of popular culture and many television series and specials were produced for broadcast programming. This allowed for our parents to become involved in our hobby. After a few episodes of a ghost hunting show on television, my mom confessed, with a slight bit of sarcasm and enthusiasm, that she had thought she had seen a “woman standing in our living room, late at night.” This was, of course, an appeal to my brother and I, an attempt at stirring our imagination. I nodded and worked on my dinner as Adam stared in amazement and swore that he, too, had seen such a manifestation. Our dog, a small Jack Russell Terrier, entirely white except for a splotch of brown on her head, took this opportunity to steal some food off of his plate. The little rat had always sat right behind Adam, sharing his chair and hoping that he dropped food.

Having been next in line for our creative development (behind my beloved uncle), my mother would consistently drop little story starters into our daily lives and never provide much more to go on. Much like the short story about the woman in the living room, she would give us a mental image and an out-of-the-ordinary situation, and let the ideas cultivate in our young minds. This continued for a long time and at certain points, I could not tell if she was merely being whimsical or actually telling stories which had occurred in her life. I remember when I was a freshman in college, visiting home for the winter, she swore that when she was working on her computer in the kitchen, our dog walked past her legs and into her bed which was typically at my mother’s feet. She reached down to pet my dog and realized nothing was there. A few moments later, after searching, she found the dog sleeping upstairs.

Weeks later, after watching one of these television series with the entire family, we found ourselves enjoying a scene, invariably scripted beyond oblivion, of the “paranormal investigators” utilizing a Ouija board and attempting to talk to spirits in the attic of an old house in Washington State. Adam sat there on the couch, with this knees held against his chest in rapt attention. It was pleasant to see that childhood enthusiasm alive and well. Although he had still regularly played with the board, seeing this television show had completely rekindled his love of the game. He asked that I would play with him that weekend when he had his friends over.

There were two boys and a girl. They were all around fourteen years old and, naturally, little shits. There is really no other way to put it. I am all but positive that one of them and the girl were a couple. He’d take every opportunity of physical contact as a grace-lacking attempt at touching a personal area of the girl’s body. Were this incident to occur today, modernly, there would absolutely be harassment issues brought up between the girl and the boy, their school’s guidance counselor, and possibly the police. But that is merely my age revealing itself. Unfortunately, the curse of young adulthood and piss-poor personalities did not keep its hands off of my younger brother.

Before we began the séance, we sat around the board and Adam gave the instructions, their objectives, and his “house rules” of sorts. The girl lit three candles and turned the lights off at his request. He warned his friends to be very serious in this exercise. He warned that it could be a lot of fun, but that they may end up talking to very powerful and sometimes malicious entities. He did not want them to display any disrespect or rudeness, because he frequently had spoken with “demons” who had initially introduced themselves as benevolent spirits. One of the boys asked what he meant and Adam, appealing to the annoying nature I had previously mentioned, told him that he would be temporarily cursed. Further inquiring to what Adam meant, he told him that “whenever he went into the bathroom, your face would be replaced with white eyes and a horrible screaming mouth” – I intervened and told him to knock it off. There was no point in playing with this if you were going to be a lying schmuck throughout the ordeal.

He laughed at my objectivity and apologized. The three others laughed nervously too: they still believed in my brother’s ridiculous warning. No such “curse” ever came about, so there’s always that. Ha.

Before long, we encountered an entity that refused to give a name. The boys teased, saying that it was afraid of us, and the board said, simply, “bullshit.” They asked if it was a boy or a girl and it did not respond, again. The group was quiet for a little bit, nervous, and the girl hazarded, “Are you a demon?” The room was still for a moment, then the dial moved, all of our hands on it: yes, you little slut. I chalked it up to the touchy-feely boy, but he looked as shocked as everyone else. They were a little upset. Adam looked genuinely worried at this point. He apologized to the board, for our rudeness and whatnot. It responded with a simple “fine” and the group did not really know where to go from there. One of the boys finally asked, adding an additional apology, if they could speak to someone else and the demon could be on its way. The board told us that he would not release the board to any other entity. We were going to speak to him and him only.

This seemed to really not sit well with anyone. I, well, I was interested. I held my smirk behind a straight-grit in order to keep the group still and petrified. Without asking another question, the dial moved once more and scribed a sentence that chills me to this day: tell that brother of yours to stop being a smartass. My eyes widened and I looked at Adam. Adam looked at me and then wore an expression of a man twenty years his elder, so far removed from the comforts of modern living. He wore the face of a parent burying his child, of a surgeon failing, of a war veteran outliving his comrades. He bore too much knowledge about the situation at hand, far more knowledge than anyone in the room. Essentially, this was not a joke. We had all removed our hands with this last insult and Adam motioned to return them, clearing his throat.
“Demon,” Adam asked. “Is that you, Amney?”

The familiarity and tone in my brother’s voice made the hair on my neck stand. Without a second to contemplate the situation at hand, the dial read “yes.”
“Listen, we were just interested in showing our friends how the board works. We mean no harm.”
“I know, you little fuck. I was just checking in. How’s the family?” The board wrote.
After the response, the dial rapidly shot to each corner of the board, to the decorative pictures that branded the extremities. Nonsense.
“We’re… we’re fine, Amney. I know we haven’t spoken in a while.”
“Good. Good.  Which parent do you love more?”
At this point, I picked up the little dial and clutched it tight, standing.
“No, we’re done. This is bullshit. Adam, I don’t know if you’re fucking with your friends, or… or what. But we’re done.”

The fucking thing tore from my grip and landed upright on the board. The candles went out immediately after and the girl screamed. I moved towards the stairs and turned on the light. The candles were tipped over and the wet wax smothered the board. Most of it was covered, except for the smiling sun in the upper left-hand corner.  The wax encompassed it and most of the mess was already drying. Adam looked up at me and told me he was sorry, a single tear running down his face. He sniffed, looked away, composed himself and rapidly stood, cleaning the mess. His friends never saw his tear.

We quickly packed up and that was that. We did not talk much about it. He was obviously bothered, but got over it by midweek. We played plenty of shooter video games and we even drank a little bit of our parent’s alcohol when they went away the next weekend. That Sunday night we watched a horror movie which focused around a demon. Upon realizing the story’s premise and hearing the word “demon,” I silently hated myself and prayed that it would not bring some shell-shocked flashback to my brother’s being. No such break down occurred; in fact, he calmly and happily brought up the experience after the movie. He simply asked, “Do you remember that whole ‘Amney’ bit?”
Of course, I said yes.
“Yeah, that fucker is creepy,” he smirked.
“You talked to him a lot?” I asked him.
“Yeah. I don’t really know how to explain it. Maybe those things are like… creative unlockers? You know? Like they tap into your creative invulnerabilities and just pour words from you.”
“I don’t know, man.”
“Well, I hope so, at least. He described himself to me one time. Real creepy stuff.”
“Like what?”
“Well, he was a demon. First of all,” he chuckled at this. He was nervous at first, then the seriousness caught his voice. “He was a demon, and he told me that the  most relatable thing he could call himself, the thing I would most understand, was the shape of a dog. Except instead of your typical ‘dog-shaped’ head, he said it resembled a mask. Like a large, porcelain, V-shaped mask. Mostly blank, besides large black eyes.”
I think of my mother sitting at a computer desk in the kitchen, thinking she saw a Jack Russell Terrier move past her feet.
“Weird, man,” I reply, offering nothing else.
“Yeah…” he cleared his throat. “What did you think about when he asked about mom and dad?”
“I,” I thought for a moment. “I didn’t.”
“Good,” Adam nodded. “He would have done something vengeful.

I did not know what he meant, but I did not want to pry. I was happy enough that we covered this topic without a breakdown of tears. We proceeded to watch some mindless programming for a few hours and he went to bed, happy.

Later that night, or rather, early that morning, I received a call from the police department informing me that my parents had died in a car accident on I-95. I did not tell Adam until later that day. He went to school, like any other day, and spent six or seven hours in ignorance. He went to his part time job at the grocery store and worked, happily and stupidly, like any other day. I had to tell him when he got home. Our uncle and grandparents were there. It was inevitable. It was not my choice. He had to know. Were it up to me, I would have kept him, to this day, ignorant of the fact that our parents died, one with the melted and molten iron and steel that cocooned their bodies. Their carcasses were inseparable from the frame of the vehicle that carried us to however many family vacations. The vessel that brought us to Disney World was now their tomb; the vehicle that brought us to the beach was now the same chemical composite as our parents. Were it up to me, I would have prolonged his revelation with bullshit in the vein of, “oh, they are traveling in Europe,” or, “they continued their weekend trip and their flights are delayed!” Bullshit. Ignorant bullshit that keeps the emotional mind at bay.

We mourned. The community supported us. I was on the verge of suicide for months. The thought of my brother being alone kept me going. Our uncle was our guardian for a while, although officially, per the government’s papers, our grandparents were our guarantors. I grew older, completed college, and watched my brother finish high school. The years that followed were uneventful. Adam got a community service commendation; I managed to break from alcoholism. I got a job in mid-management at the state health department; Adam earned an internship at the police department. We were the most typical fucked up brothers you could fine. That was until our uncle became sick.

Yes, I know what you’re thinking: oh, a family member was diagnosed with something malignant, aren’t you a special snowflake. Well, you can go fuck yourself. Uncle Jack is in hospice as we speak. I already told you this. Uncle Jack is in hospice and the sirens have been blaring all day. From all around our sleepy town in the middle of nowhere, crisscrossed by highways and interstates and roads that lead everywhere but here, the sirens have been blaring. Fire trucks and police officers from towns that never knew our name are here, portioning off an exit on the highroad.

Uncle Jack takes my hand. He looks me in the eye. The morphine is already terribly strong and it is getting stronger by the day. At this point, it is not to relieve his pain. It is simply a race against nature to cease his organ’s function. It is no longer palliative, but a challenge to god. Earlier this morning, he talked about cats I don’t own and family members that never existed, such as a sister who was “bringing him water” all day. His delusions were terrifying and pathetic. I could no longer bear to see such a loved person dealing with so much bodily failure and ultimately, pain.

Staring me in the face, he said, “Son, I appreciate everything you’ve done… but please, get your dog out of here.” At this, I was confused. I knew it was another symptom of the morphine, but I wanted to help him, however I could.
“Uncle Jack, we don’t have a dog. You know that,” I held back tears.
“Stop. Just close the door. Stop him from staring at me. Stupid… fucking… dog,” he choked.

I rose and closed the door. I could tell the end was coming. But it is never easy. It is never immediate. It is always a matter of hours, days, weeks. Sometimes, months. The sirens outside grew louder. On a day like today, no solace was spared. No grieving, nothing. Your problem was just another piece of rubbish in the mosaic that society is composed of. Little did I know that the sirens were clearing and helping sort out a pile up that was on the same interstate that killed my parents. Little did I know that my brother was driving home from classes this afternoon to help me take care of Uncle Jack. Little did I know that his sedan may have been involved.
“Son,” Uncle Jack cried. “You’ve always been as good as any child of my own that I could have prayed for. Your parents loved you. I loved you. And I could never have asked for anyone better to see me out.”

I will admit to having cried at this display.

“But please, close that damned door, that fucking dog…”
I turned to see the closed door and dropped my eyes to the floor. Poor, poor drug-induced illusions.

But, of course, he continues.
“He keeps asking me, John. He keeps asking, who do I love more, ‘Adam or John?’ Get that little bastard out of here.”

I tried some stuff on last night and liked [this](http://i.imgur.com/3Re5eSb.png?1) a lot. I wanted to interview w/o the blazer but it looks [worse](http://i.imgur.com/D785NSh.png) without so I'll leave it on. Main concerns: yellow too much? shirt too low? 

Alternatives: white collared 3/4 sleeved shirt that seems too [tight](http://i.imgur.com/1eqH4do.png); buy another white blouse (not a huge deal, that one doesn't fit me great); black slacks; black/grey stripped button-down short-sleeved shirt; 


I'm being interviewed by employers from the stated engineering-related companies with other high school seniors across the state; therefore, I was wondering how much lee-way I could have in the conservative department. 

Thanks! :)

I have a couple of interviews next week.  One of them is for an unpaid internship and it looks like the hours are more flexible.  It would be good experience.  Problem?  I'm pretty poor and need to pay rent.  I'd probably have to do some waiting or other menial job to make up for that.  Which raises all other kinds of questions about if someone in the customer service or dining industry can just disappear for 20 minutes for the toilet.  I'm guessing not.  

The second job pays.  And probably better than waiting.  However, I've heard the organization expects you out and about for 50+ hours a week.  To be honest I don't know if I can handle that.  What should I tell them?  Is there any chance you can cap my hours?  I'm afraid I just won't get the job if I ask that.

What about you guys?  How much do you chose to dispose?  Normally I wouldn't say anything, but times be tough.  Any input welcome. :)  "

Can I decline the job before I go in for the drug test? All I want to know here is how I can make sure my parents don't know the results of that test. Preferably, I wouldn't even take the test in the first place.

Advice appreciated,[deleted],confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/19j3au/i_keep_cheating_on_the_girl_i_love_advice/,"I've been in relationship for 2.5 years now with the greatest girl I've even known, (me, 22m and her 22f). We are both graduating college soon, and trying to figure out what to do with our lives. Most of our relationship has been from different universities an hour apart, we got to spend a couple summers together, but jobs and internships always seem to keep us in different locations. 

Anyway, I've got a problem. I've cheated on her 5 times now. And I cant understand it. First time, visiting a friend at a different school, got drunk and danced with/kissed another girl. I told her about that one, but she stayed with me. Then things were great for a year and a half. The last 6 months have been a different story tho. 

In the past 6 months, I had cheated with 3 more people 4 times, and they have been getting worse. They all seem to have a common theme  however. I'll go out with friends, drink, find someone I used to know om highschool who had a thing for me or I for them. We end up talking and hitting it off and then I cross the line and kiss/make out/fondling starts to happen. I've not had sex with any of these people, but thats not something to be proud of, because on several occasions I know I would have if the opportunity arose. 

I dont know what to do about it. Today, I've realized I need to take steps to do something. I dont want to lose my gf. She doesnt know about most of this, and if she did it would kill her. I want to spend the rest of my life with this girl, I want to marry her down the road. Yet if all that is true, why do I keep doing this? I dont know. All I know is that I am weak and lack self-control. Alcohol obviously doesnt help, so as of today I either have to cut alcohol completely, or only drink in certain situations. I'm not a big drinker, but as a college student, I probably drink 1 night every or every other week with friends. Alcohol may be the reason I lose my self-control, or it may be just an excuse for me to disregard it. Both are bad things. 

**tl;dr: Been with gf 2.5 years, hopefully many more. Yet I am a scumbag and have cheated on her 5 times. Dont know what to do.** "

I have a close friend with extreme depression and anxiety. She has medication but it doesn't always help. We are seniors at the same college and spring break is coming up and I have a trip planned. She can't go because of an internship and would be left on campus all alone for a week. She has never threatened suicide before but has said recently that she ""Can't survive a week alone"" and ""There's a chance I won't be here when you get back"". 

Im really worried about her and I know I should just stay on campus but this doesn't seem like a way to live my life, or for her to live hers for that matter. This goes beyond my boundaries for what I will sacrifice for a non family member. 

Plus we are graduating in may and probably living in different places anyway so I think she needs to learn how to get by alone. She knows she can call me.
I don't want to involve any authorities yet because she hasn't actually said she was going to do anything.

I do well for myself.  Music Therapy major; all around good student.

My mom and I have a very good relationship; but we differ about a couple crucial things:

-1. She doesn't want me driving any cars ever even though I have a taxi-drivers license.  I don't understand either but she thinks I'm gonna wreck every car.

And

-2. She thinks I should continue living on-campus my junior year and paying greater-than $4,000/SEMESTER to live in the same room as somebody else.  That and the $1,800/SEMESTER I pay for food; it's definitely cheaper to live off campus, right?

How do I prove to her that a year in an apartment or room-for-rent inside of a big house; and food would still cost less than that ridiculous amount I pay now?  And that if we *did* get me an apartment; I'd be able to take the extra money (or some of it, at least) and put it aside for my Music Therapy internship (with which I want to travel)?

We are planning on going on vacation together in September. We are both college students but his family has a lot of money. He earns some money through sport sponsorship and he gets ridiculous amounts of money for christmas and birthday, so he has enough on his bank account to pay for a flight to Bali or Florida (European here, those were actually his two suggestions). The only money I have is what I earn through summer internships, which means that even if I can afford such a vacation this year, I probably won't be able to next year. My parents can't support me and I don't want them to. He had already offered a vacation as a christmas present for me, which was like 2 months after we got together so I said no.

He only offered because he knows that I don't have that much money, not to show off with it and I know that he will never use it against me in an argument. He just loves surfing which isn't possible anywhere near where we live. He is kind of spoiled but is it my job to change that? His financial situation is probably never gonna change anyway.

btw my mum is strictly against letting him pay for the flight, my dad doesn't know.

Is it ok to let him pay for it since it's no problem for him? Or should I convince him to go on vacation somewhere in Europe even if that means that he can't go surfing? At what point in a realtionship is it ok to let the other one pay for such big things (I mean married couples mostly have joined accounts anyway so you can't say who is paying for what)?

TL;DR: My [19] boyfriend [23] of seven months offered to pay for flight in order to go on the vacation he wants, with me. Should I let him?

19irqn,11,2013-03-02,I think I might be depressed...Input? (LOOOONG READ - THIS IS A HARDCORE VENT),Throwaway2823916,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/19irqn/i_think_i_might_be_depressedinput_loooong_read/,"OK, so as the title said, I'm kind of trying to figure out whether or not how I feel is normal or if I should be seeking some kind of help. It'd be great if people who actually know about depression (either from being diagnosed with it or just having some kind of experience with it) could give me some input as to whether or not I might need to do something about this. Anyway, here's the situation, arranged by general topic:

I wish I was dead, or better yet, had never been born. I have felt this way for a while - the first time I can really remember feeling this way was around the beginning of high school. I mean, sometimes on a nice sunny day when I'm in a reasonably good mood, I'll think to myself ""I'm actually kind of glad that I'm alive today,"" but the feeling passes before long. The only time in the past several years that I can remember being truly happy was when I was with my then-girlfriend, but I'm pretty sure that was mostly because of the hormonal rush. Anyway, this mentality kind of shows up in some of the things I say - I often joke about death and don't take it very seriously. Not because I don't find the idea of dying to be intimidating, but because I view it as a respite. I feel like life is kind of a dumb game that I got forced to play and really don't see the point of. From how other people talk about and treat death, I gather that this is not a normal way of viewing things. Now, before going on, I should clarify that I am not suicidal, because suicide is against my beliefs and frankly I'm not sure I could ""pull the trigger"" even if I decided to. I have never attempted suicide, and I don't plan on it, although I have thought about it before (not thought about it as in considered doing it, but more like fantasized about it...if that makes sense).

I'm a 20-year-old male in college, and I just don't feel like the future looks promising. I'm a pretty smart guy (that's really the only big asset I have, honestly, because I'm not outgoing or athletic or handsome or even a particularly pleasant person to be around once you know me). I make great grades in school, but I have no idea what to do with my life. I don't know what I want to do for a career, and I'm getting to the point where I can't afford to be indecisive anymore. I feel like I could get somewhere if I could just get pointed in the right direction, but right now, I'm just treading water in a dull and fairly-common major that I have no passion for but at the very least has some decent job utility. I'm thinking of going to law school after I graduate (almost everyone I know swears I'd be a great lawyer), but I don't know if I'll be able to afford it or even if it's a good idea.

I haven't had any jobs yet, ever, and that's causing problems in multiple areas. First off, my parents have obviously been trying to get me to get a job for the past few summers. At first I just didn't want to and that was kind of OK because I was still young enough that it wasn't a huge issue and I didn't really need the money (my college costs are covered mostly by scholarship and the rest is paid by my family - my parents make a decent income and they view it as their responsibility to pay for the education of their children - and yes, I do realize how lucky I am to have parents that do that for me). But obviously, a 20 year old who's never been employed is not attractive on paper, so every passing year I become less employable. Add this to my social awkwardness, and you've got a recipe for unemployment. I couldn't get a summer job the past summer, and now my mother has told me that I am not allowed home this summer until I've gotten a job (a fair move on her part - I don't resent it). The problem is that I go to school out of state, so I can't really get a job at home without actually being there to get it. So I'm kind of freaking out about the fact that I may very well be homeless this summer if I don't work something out. Maybe it'd be good for me, who knows. Anyway, there's the pressure from home about the job. But there's also the pressure of my finances. I have had enough money saved up to cover random college costs (going out with my friends for pizza or whatever) up until now, but that's starting to run out. Then, there's the pressure of my own self-esteem. For quite a while, I didn't really understand when people talked about how a man's occupation is really a big deal for his self esteem. Now I do. Being a jobless parent-leech has had a much bigger impact on my self-esteem than I ever could have guessed. So I feel like shit for that. My university has a great employment network (internships and the like) that I could really use to my advantage, but since I don't actually know where I'm trying to go with a career, internships are kind of pointless until I figure out what the fuck I'm doing.

Oh, and while we're on the topic of jobs: in addition to feeling very pessimistic about my chances of being able to land a job in the first place, I also feel really pessimistic about my ability to perform well in whatever job I get. I mean, I'm academically-smart, but in the ""real world,"" I'm an idiot. I have no common sense at all. I feel like if I did get a job, I'd just make so many stupid mistakes and be so worthless as a thinking employee that I'd be fired. Basically, I don't consider myself a ""skilled"" or ""competent"" person. Also, I don't do well under pressure, so any kind of job with high risk for messing up is just a recipe for disaster as I'd panic from the risk, mess up, and the world would explode.

Moving on: girlfriend. As I said, I've had one serious relationship so far in my life. It was a 2-year-long, long-distance relationship, and during that relationship, I learned a ton about myself. The biggest thing that I learned was that I am a shitty boyfriend. I was absurdly controlling, over-protective, and paranoid. I suspect that the distance gap had something to do with that, and I know that my own insecurity had a huge role in it. I'm not trying to make excuses - I hold myself responsible for my actions, but I'm pretty sure that I would have been a lot better if I genuinely believed I was worth her love. Anyway, that relationship eventually ended in a mutual breakup, although after we broke up things went a bit south (but that's not too relevant so I'm not going into it). I know that in many ways I was a really awesome boyfriend, but like I said, I was insanely controlling and protective, and my strengths in other areas really don't compensate for that. So I don't feel very confident in my partner value. This feeling is compounded by my lack of job (as described previously) and my lack of any real plan for the future. The thing is, I really want someone to go through life with, but I really don't feel it'd be fair of me to get involved with someone in my current state. Like, emotionally, I really want a relationship, but mentally, I don't. I don't have the money to get into that right now, and I just don't feel like I have my act together enough as a person. Once I have a job and some form of career plan and have worked through my own personal flaws (some form of mental/emotional issue being among them, I suspect), then I'll seek out a relationship, but until then, no. The problem is that I don't see myself getting to the point as a person where I feel ready for a relationship any time soon, and that makes me really sad. I mean, especially in college, I see everyone around me being happy with their SOs, and it breaks my heart knowing I can't have that. I genuinely believe I could get a girlfriend if I tried, but again, I just don't think it'd be right to get involved with a girl knowing that I'm not even close to being to the point where I would be ready for a serious, long-term relationship. But that lack of girlfriend is just another straw on the camel's back, and that camel is starting to look mighty strained.

Friends: I would say I have 4 friends here at school (many more at home, but that's not that meaningful since I'm away from them 3/4 of the year with a big enough distance gap that I can't visit). We spend a lot of time together and I'm thankful to have them. My freshman year, I literally sat in my room by myself almost all day every day - even my roommate, who I get along reasonably well with, was gone most of the time, and that was possibly the most miserable year of my life. I'm not someone that likes to have a lot of friends (I prefer a few close friends to a lot), but having literally no friends that year was absolute hell. The problem with my friends, though, is that they are kind of assholes. We're all kind of assholes to each other (that's just how it is with a group of guys), but I feel like this goes a bit beyond the norm. Any time someone in the group says something that is even slightly wrong or against the opinion of the rest, a piranha-like frenzy occurs and they are verbally beaten down to a pulp. This happens to everyone in the group, not just me. Basically, we're very unforgiving of any kind of stupidity or wrong-ness (we're all pretty smart guys). Now, that's all reasonably forgivable, because we all do it to each other and it's never really taken too personally. But the thing is, the older brother of the friend I hang out with the most (who also goes to our university and is therefore around a lot) is a MAJOR asshole. Literally 90% of everything I say, he will either directly mock or argue about. Him and my friend are very close, so whenever I disagree with either of them, the other will immediately jump in. So while my friend is fun to be around when his brother isn't there, they both become an asshole tag-team when they're together. And this is only with me - they rarely pick on anyone else, which is why with this guy (the older brother who mocks me at every chance and is then joined by his brother, my friend), I take it personally. Now, I assume the reasonable thing to say here is ""I should just find new friends that don't treat me like shit."" The thing is, I'm a pretty shy guy. I don't make friends easily, so the last thing I want to do is ditch these guys and end up back where I started with no friends at all.

I don't really have any hobbies to speak of, aside from reddit (duh) and a few online games. While this isn't directly a bad thing (I'm never bored), it does make me kind of a dull person.

Finally, I have a variety of fun character flaws that I don't like about myself. I'm very whiny (the irony of saying that in a post on /r/depression is not lost on me), I'm lazy, I have a hard time motivating myself to do anything, I occasionally get really arrogant about my intelligence (I think this is me latching onto the one trait I like about myself because that's all I've got), and I seem to have an addictive personality. Currently, the only thing I'd say I'm addicted to is porn, but that's a really big deal to me. I feel like shit because of it. It's against my beliefs and I just feel like dirt when I look at it. I also consider it another detriment to my value as a spouse/partner. Note that I'm not trying to make anyone else feel judged or whatever - your actions are your business - but it does make a difference in how I view myself. If nothing else, I don't like that I don't have the strength to overcome my addiction.

I guess that basically sums up all the shit that weighs me down. So the point of all this is that I just feel absolutely miserable. About myself, about my future, about life itself. Some of these issues are more recent, obviously, but the general unhappiness has been around for a while. I walk around with a frown on my face all the time, not even intentionally but just because my face seems to have adopted that as its default position. On occasion, I've had people walk up randomly and ask me what was wrong because they thought I looked upset when nothing was out of the ordinary. Like I said at the beginning, I'm just not happy to be here (or anywhere). So my question to everyone who's somehow made it through that monstrosity of a post is this: am I just going through growing pains? Is this a normal way to feel at my age? Or do I need to think about seeking some kind of help? I was laying in bed crying the other night and I realized (not sure why it took so long for this to occur to me) that I may actually have some kind of emotional problem that needs to be addressed...after all, I'm pretty sure everyone around me doesn't feel this way. If they do, they're doing a damn good job of hiding it. Anyway, sorry for the seriously insane post you just read (or maybe skimmed - I don't blame you). Thanks so much for taking the time to read it, and I really appreciate any input you guys have.

**TL;DR: I wish I was dead. Am I depressed?** Seriously though, since the point of this post is that I'm asking if my thoughts/attitude are somewhat normal because I might need to get help if they aren't, please don't try to give any advice if you won't at least skim through and read what's going on. I more than understand if you don't want to read it all, but you can't make an informed suggestion without actually having some idea of what's going on."

Normally I wouldn't mind doing the CAP program, however I am currently an intern down at NASA's JSC center, and there is a program that is the main pipeline to getting hired where you apply during your second semester, and having UT Austin on my resume would look much better then UTSA.

Background: I ABSOLUTELY want to be a doctor; I can't imagine having any other job.  This being said, I've recently done a top down analysis of where I am on the road towards applying to medical schools, and I have been left with more questions than answers.  Here are some of them:

1.  This year I did not take chemistry. Since I am in the class of 2016; I am going to have to take the new MCAT which requires background knowledge of Chem, Orgo, and Bio-Chem (three years of chem).  Having not taken chem this year, would it be wiser to try and double up on chem courses one year (Orgo and Bio-Chem my Junior year) and take the MCAT my senior year or space out my courses and take a gap year?  Are gap years generally viewed positively by admissions boards?

2.  I really want to major in economics; but from what I understand, business related majors are frowned upon by medical school admissions committees.  I really don't want to look like I'm interested in becoming a doctor for the money, but I am fascinated by (and really good at) economics.  Is there anything I can do to convince the admissions staffs staff that I'm not in it for the money while still majoring in economics?

3.  This summer I have a research internship position studying cardiology at a major hospital. I am also planning on taking an evening EMT course so that next school year I can work as an EMT part time.  Aside from shadowing a doctor, what other ECs do you recommend?

4.  GW is not a school known for its math and science departments and isn't particularly competitive.  With this in mind, what would you consider to be a gpa that would make me a competitive applicant for most medical schools?

This is what I’d like to get http://www3.towerhobbies.com/cgi-bin/wti0001p?&amp;W=001995357&amp;I=LXXJX9&amp;P=K the Team Associated RC8B Factory Team RC Buggy (another site option towards the bottom).


Some background
I am a 19 year old male and a freshman in engineering college (majoring in mechanical engineering for cars). I got into hobby grade RC when I was a sophomore in high school with the 2wd electric slash, early in the year, then got the JATO near the start of that summer and loved it for 2 months then sold it after I broke and replaced the engine, and got the hpi RS4 3 EVO+ which I also love, but it is on road only (this now bothers me a bit because I want a 4wd off road nitro car). I paid for all of the cars and all of the parts myself (other than the occasional b-day present), did all of the repairs myself, and took my slash with me to college. I funded this hobby with caddying at my local country club over the summers during high school. I also did some upgrades to the slash which include the Velineon brushless system, 3s lipos and 1/8th scale buggy tires (there are also some other things which I think are less important and can’t remember). 
Why I want to get the Team Associated RC8B Factory Team RC Buggy


Reasons for getting another RC car in general
	I would like to have an RC that I can put on an off road track and have it do well
	If I live in Percopo next year (one of the resident halls at my college), I will have a massive field to drive it in as well as plenty of asphalt too
	I really want to do more RC stuff but the RS4 is only for on road and the slash is great and everything but is only 2wd and doesn't jump too well (hard to control in the air) but is very durable. Also, both cars feel a tad like a chore to use (mostly before I take either out but once they are out I really enjoy using them). Also, there is nothing to do to the slash anymore because of how durable it is and that it is electric. Nitro does have its drawbacks too like the after run procedure and that it can be a pain to start. However, there is plenty to do to it, like take it apart and clean it and mess around with the engine; another nitro car would mean a new set of parts. 
	It is a kit – similar to why I like Lego sets


Against
	MONEY – it is VERY expensive and my parents want money that I’d earn at a summer intern to go towards college loans that I will have
	Parents think that I should be getting into full size engineering and not this (mechanical engineer freshman at college) – I think this is bullshit because I enjoy this hobby and it does help me to figure out how to figure out what a problem is on a motor vehicle and I get enjoyment out of it

	
Why the RC8B Factory Team Nitro
	It has all of the upgrades on it already, saving potential money down the road for upgrades (might be bullshit because I only upgrade parts when they break but cannot find the original RC8B, but these upgrades mean that parts are probably stronger)
	Compared to other high quality kits, this one is less than all of them ($460 for the RC8B vs. over $510 for any other high quality kit)
	There are several reviews that I have found and none say anything bad about the car 
	Very good instruction manual for putting it together
	Don’t want more electric – nitro seems more me and there is more to do to the car
	It is 4 wheel drive
	It is very durable
	Out of all the other kinds of cars, this is what I think would fit me very well (monster truck, you can’t race at all/terrible on the track; already have a short course truck; already have an on road car; no desire for a 1/5th scale; truggies will break a bit more because of the longer A-arms and reminds me too much of my old JATO which I sold a while ago; 2wd buggy is like the JATO in my mind (ok on road in a straight like but terrible handling); buggy seems like the right choice for me right now)
	Fast but not all that it does
	Good handling and good on the track
	Good for jumping and other bashing


If I do get this kit, then I will have a car for the on road and off road track at my local race track and that seems like a ton of fun¬ (I really like the on road track and have tried the off road track with my slash and the old JATO and they couldn’t handle the track very well)


Because it is a kit, it does NOT come with tires (it comes with rims), servos (need 2: 1 for steering and 1 for throttle/break), engine, pipe, painted body (need to paint the body), radio (can get an extremely nice and new radio or stick with the venom one I already have and just get a $30 receiver)


Kit rather than RTR: putting it together myself means that I’ll have a better understanding on how it works and will be better prepared to fix it when stuff goes wrong, like a Lego set: my older brother doesn’t really know how some of the things I built out of Legos go together and has a harder time fixing it when it breaks. RTRs that I’ve had have not been very expensive due to not high quality parts like some of the plastics and the stock servos and also inexpensive engines/motor, and inexpensive radios. This will be VERY high quality in all ways (if I get the correct servos and other parts). 


The prices right now (2/28/13) are $460 for the kit ($300 at one place), $280 for the engine I’d like (most are either a little less (%240-$250) but are not as good), $87 for the exhaust system, $10 for a seemingly decent throttle/break servo, $50-$120 for a good to excellent steering servo (rather have a brilliant servo for steering), 2x$18 for the tires, $65 for the bump start system, $30 for a receiver or $270 for a new radio (a very good system).

Low end cost without tax is about $900
High end is over $1200 without a new radio system (I think)


If I can afford this on my own, I would LOVE to purchase this setup. I may end up getting the Airtronics radio separately and then the car to space out the price, if I decide that the radio that I have right now is no longer good enough for me. 


I NEED a summer internship for this to really be within my price range but the money that I make there is wanted to go towards my college tuition. I estimated that if I can get a job for $15 an hour and have about 25% tax, I can really afford this after only 2 weeks of working 8 hours a day for 5 days a week (about $450 a week after tax). I have also decided that I don’t need any more upgrades to either of my other 2 RC cars at all – the slash is already upgraded a ton and the RS4 has no real easy upgrades (all I could do to it is install a bigger engine and that would be a huge pain)


Lastly, I am hoping to show my parents something similar to this later in the year, but not too close to summer so that they will have time to think it over. 


Thanks for the inputs and keep on driving!"

This has become more prevalent recently because I live alone now I moved for an internship which I've been working at for 2 months and still know no one in the area.  recently my mind has been filled with negative thoughts.  I believe part of the reason I have been depressed lately may be because I have  a co-dependent personality.  for the last 5 or 6 years I have felt like there has been something missing from my life, and I honestly believed that it was because I was single.  I thought that if i had someone who i could love and would love me then it would be okay.  but I had the realization that I could get a girlfriend by some miracle and I may still feel this way.  I honestly hate myself (not that I'd ever hurt myself) I just wish I was someone else, I look around and see people who are talented and intelligent and despite the fact that I've always been told I was both those things I still don't believe it.  I dont even know if I want advice just kinda wanted to rant and get it off my chest! thanks for reading."

But my partner lost his job in 2009 when the business he worked for closed, and he has been in school since.  now, he is ready to start his new career, but it can't happen here.  In this town, the university and technical school flood the small market with free interns, so they never hire anyone.  We are selling the house and moving to Atlanta.

I'm not sure what I need to say to the neighbors- I want to let them know we are selling, and we like them- but they don't need my life's story.  What's a semi=personal way to tell them we are outta here, but thank's for not being bigots? "

Namely, *nothing shows up in hotbar slot 8*. I can't use Thermal clip pack consumables with him! (Even after rebinding the hotkey: the icon is literally missing!)

I tried this on the same game session w/ my N7 Fury; she was fine. *I reset my machine and restarted the game* twice: Once with Talon 1st, once with the Fury.

The Talon *never* had an option in slot 8, whereas the Fury always had one, regardless of key-binding.

Is this a known bug, or just another ""Oh Talon; you're why we don't let interns design classes!"" issue?

What will you do to make that happen? and Who's Legacy has left a positive impact on your life?,SoleilSocrates,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/19huvr/in_your_life_what_is_the_legacy_you_will_leave/,"1) **In your life what is the legacy you want to leave behind?** OR **What legacy have you began?""A couple of weeks ago my English teacher gave us this poem to read [In front of The Class by Bonafide Rojas](http://www.writebloody.com/store/pdf/book_preview/learnthenburn.pdf) and ask this question, now I am asking you. I hope you take it seriously.
  A *Quote from the Poem*: 

&gt;i tell them to use their connections,
intern somewhere,
learn to live, live to write
love to learn, write to love
this is the last day of your life
what are you going to leave behind?
what will be your legacy?
and they stare at me like 
a rabbit in the headlights
and say they don’t know
i tell them to open their chests
and let whatever falls out
let it fall on the page

2) **What will you do to make this happen?**  I am a 16 year old young woman, and my legacy is knowing that everyday when I go to bed I have made someone smile, laugh or feel better. 
My legacy is awareness of injustice, and inhumanity.
My legacy is freedom, knowledge, thinking.
My legacy is to make a change.
How do I make this happen? By smiling and saying thank you, to compliment someone on their outfit, to accept them for who they are.(and making post like this!;) 
So what are the steps you will take to make this happen? Or what steps have you taken to create your legacy?

3) **Who's Legacy has left a positive impact on your life?** 
It can be a parent, a friend, an elder, a fictional character(explain if so), historical leader etc... 
For me it would be my Mom. She is amazing and a strong single mother. :)

I hope these questions suit your needs. I look forward to your answers!:)

Things went unusually fast and within a week we said I love you. It started off as long distance but within a month I went to visit to him, it was perfect. We would talk all day every day. Almost 1000 texts to him every day. 


We had little ups and downs but it's normal. Then two weeks ago he gets busy because midterms are coming up. We go from texting all day to an hour a night. Then this week hits...I don't hear from him for hours at a time. Thursday comes and we talk and we come to the agreement of taking a break. He says he is too busy for me and wants me to be happy. I agree. 

Today hits and....he says all of his feelings for me are gone. He says his friend kissed him last night and he will be taking spring break to explore the option of being with her. The girl he assured me he had no feelings for. 

It sounds ridiculous because it was long distance and we were together for three months, but I loved him so much. We had plans..so many plans. Plans to have him take an internship by me so we could spend the summer together. We talked about goofy things we would do at our wedding. He was so loving and never showed signs of apathy until two weeks ago. 

I don't know if this is common or what... I should mention that I was his first girlfriend, he had never even been kissed. He was sweet and caring and never mean to me. This is all so sudden. Everything hurts. I can only think of the times that he told me I was his perfect girl, and that we were going to get a dog together some day. 

I want to hate him, I almost do, but at the same time I want him to be happy because up until this point he has been a good hearted person. 

Maybe I was wrong..maybe I didn't know him like I thought I did. But those memories won't go away..."

I'll never be strong enough to take the daily shit that you put me through. 

Mom, why can't you see that I'm trying? Why can't you see that... I want to be a star in your eyes like Z and K, but I can't... I can't. Everytime you look at me, I can see the look of sheer pity and disappointment. I know you want a thin, pretty, athletic daughter that you can put on a pedestal and have everyone bow down to worship. Yet you have a daughter that is obese, that is as ugly as a shit stain, and extremely antisocial. The things I like to do are things that you disapprove of. I don't join sports because A) I don't find joy in them, sure I'll run on my own time when we're not as busy here, but you ridicule me for it. B) If I did, it'd cost you hundreds of dollars for equiptment, and you wouldn't be able to pick me up or come to any of my games. I saw the way that you almost never went to any of Z's games because you were busy. Only once your fucking boytoy came into the picture did you even start going.

Mom, I hate him. He's evil, he has harmed my animals more than once, he's harmed the horses THAT YOU WERE TRYING TO SELL, he's harmed me. He's harmed my brother and sister. But do you see it? No. ""Oh, well him taking it out on your brother that way is much better than what your father is doing by making him pay 1700 dollars to fix his car that is almost exactly the same damage."" Mom. Wake the fuck up. 

Abuse:  Physical, sexual and/or emotional maltreatment. Child abuse and neglect is defined as any recent act or failure to act resulting in imminent risk of serious harm, death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation of a child

That is what you had divorced your last husband for, and every single boyfriend thereafter has been abusive. Do you ever learn? No. YOu don't. You never do. When he puts me and my sister down, you say ""He's just trying to fit in."" Nope. He's being a circlejerk. I have put up with the mental and physical abuse for the past year and a half, and you do nothing because ""I love him"". Well then, if you love him tell him to move his lazy, jobless, collecting unneeded unemployment, son of a bitch ass out of my house. His son is graduating high school this year, and that kid is moving as far from him as possible, and will break all contact with him after. Mom, LOOK AT THE DAMN SIGNS! He treats you like shit, he acts like it's normal and so do you. Please, for petes sake stop it while you can. 

Z, stop telling me to ""Join sports."" I know I'm fat. No, I don't like interacting with people. If I could, I'd move to Nome Alaska to never talk to anyone again aside for Reddit. I know you want what's best for me, but you need to stop. I can look out for myself, I know you're turning 18 this summer and I'll be turning only 16, but please, respect my wishes. I'm over harming myself, I'm doing okay. Call mom more often, and tell her you love her, or call me even. I miss you living here, and I hate that you live with dad. I want you to come home.

K, I hate that you're little miss perfect. Everything you do mom loves, and when I was your age, I was thinking of ways to save mom's money, but you get to join everything you wish. Oh, want a new horse? Let mom get you a new one. New saddle? Sureee! New boots? Let's go! If I ask for something like that she'll be like, ""No, buy it yourself."" I envy how you have friends who come over, I envy how you're mom's favorite. You can do whatever you so desire and I get blamed for all repercussions. I want to be special too.

AJ, I miss how you don't talk to me anymore. You used to laugh and have fun with me, what happened? Just because you have a new step sister that you're dating, or maybe even engaged to, doesn't mean to cut all ties with your sister. Are you cleaning up the past before you move on? I don't want to be the past, I want to be part of your present. I miss how you would come over almost every weekend and stay until late Sunday night, how you'd chug my entire mountain dew and let me paint your face juggalo style. I miss my big brothers.

A few confessions while I'm at it:

* I'm scared to death to start driving, the responsibility and everything that comes with it is daunting and yet... everyone's still psyched to get their permit. I want to drive and not worry about it, but I do. I'm scared of everything to do with driving. And I don't want to be.

*  I've been going onto Thinspiration again, even though I know it's bad for me mentally, I still go on there and wonder what else I can do to help me. 

* I want to be pretty, attractive but... I know I'll never be even close. I'll never be good enough for anything. 

Well that's all for now reddit, thank you for listening. 

EDIT: Even more that I wanted to add:

Why do we need interns mom? Seriously, with just 3 we did fine, I mean even that was pushing it. But no, you need 7. We can't afford that. We run through groceries like water, live off of spaghetti, and have no room. It's no a boarding house! They're running through stuff we were saving and demanding more, and you can't keep it up. It's like a damn sorority, (I don't have anything against sororities It's just a likeness) It's pissing me off. I'm just one intern away from having my sister move into my room because we need more space. Hell, why don't we furnish the basement and stack it high with bunkbeds! That'll probably be the next step. I'm sick of having all these faces pass through, of having to keep them strangers because if I become friends with them they get ripped away. There's nothing solid, and it's hard growing up like that. We have to go and make nightly trips to walmart because hey, they've run through an entire pack of toilet paper. I want summer to come so that they'll all just go away and I can breathe again. I hate internships. Yet mom still fells the need to fill up 2 more for every one that decides that she doesn't want to this. 

I'm not happy, I can't live like this anymore. I want to cry so badly... I hate it here. I want to move away. I want to go to college just so that I won't bother anyone here anymore. Hell maybe she can get more interns.

19lmic,1,2013-03-03,Exploring my tentative autism diagnosis,[deleted],autism,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/19lmic/exploring_my_tentative_autism_diagnosis/,"When I was a child, probably under the age of five during the mid 90's in Canada, I was labeled as ""possibly autistic."" I only know this as hearsay from my mom, who never really talked about it until I had asked her, when I found a document in our house outlining autism. I again, became really curious when reading Donna Williams' ""Somebody Somewhere."" As a child I was late to speak, had a speech impediment, and hearing difficulties (ingrown ear) and growing up having a difficult time socially. Having social difficulties has transcended to today, I am 21 and studying social work, coincidentally. The topic of autism has intrigued me and when reading about it, I can make some connections, social difficulties, math difficulties, highly intelligent in some areas, and not in others (anyone could generalize with this). What speaks to me, is finding the self, and the social fopaws I experience. Nowadays, I work hard at being more social and outgoing; I even have an internship with people who have developmental disabilities. My question is, do any of you share something similar like this. Is it worth the idea of exploring a diagnosis? I do feel if I was labeled (something I am highly adverse to) that I would had more educational and social supports which I needed. I also rejected this kind of help when growing up as well, seemingly because my parents too, had rejected the label."

Over the holidays I found all my bank statements since October 2002. At the time I was in 6th grade. I thought it would be neat to graph out my net worth from then to now and share it with y'all.

A little bit of background about myself [note this is a throwaway account]. I come from a upper-middle class family in the central United States. I would guess that I saved over 80% of my income in my younger years. In middle school and high school I held a twice-per-week paper route that paid about $50/mo. I also did chores around the house (mowing, snow removal, cleaning, etc.) and got about $20/mo. In high school I held the paper route for another few years, but during the summer I would work as a lifeguard and would earn $2,000-$3,000 per summer. I still did chores around the house year-round and such.

College rolled around and I did my shopping and found a very cheap out-of-state public school that gave me about a 75% full ride (I had a parent graduate from that state's university system so I received a very good out-of-state deal to start). In the summer 2010 I got an awesome paid internship with the U.S. Federal Government via the Student Career Experience Program (SCEP). I also got a part-time undergraduate research assistanceship in summer 2011. These two combined allowed me file my first $10,000 gross income in the 2011 tax year.

I was able to graduate college 2 semesters early (thank you, AP and university test-out credits!). Last summer I was able to finish up some undergraduate research paid at a graduate-level rate that included traveling to other parts of the country I've never been to. I got accepted into a graduate program at an out-of-state public university in Fall 2012 that gives me a full tuition scholarship, as well as a 50% graduate research assistanceship that pays just over $20,000 a year.
One regret I have is that I didn't open my Roth IRA sooner. I turned 18 in 2009, but I guess we all know that timing the market is impossible. Right now I have about 40% of my net worth in a Roth IRA and/or TSP accounts, and 60% in checking/savings. My checking account earns over 2.5% APY with certain requirements (direct deposit, 12 debit transactions/month, e-statements).

I've pretty much relied on scholarships and my talent in spotting and taking advantage of arbitrages in goods (iphone/ipad releases on ebay, event tickets, Mining and Technology stocks, etc) to keep money in my pocket + pay through college.  As a result, I have nothing tangible to put on a resume apart from the fact I've skirted the Dean's list for the past 5 semesters on and off, a 2200 SAT score, and what little analytical abilities I have.  I do eventually want to go to grad school and from what digging around I've done it seems like I should aim for a national lab or defense contractor to gain experience, but I'm a little overwhelmed as to how I should break into the ""real world"".

Physics/Math courses that I have taken:

Physics I-III, Calc I-III, Linear Algebra, Lagrangian &amp; Hamiltonian Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics I, Relativity, Introductory Solid State Physics, Introductory Polymer Physics, currently taking 300-level E&amp;M and 400-level Thermodynamics."

Date started: 1/1/2013

When an ad pops in the newspaper calling for someone to help a person go back in time, a magazine writer, Jeff (Jake Johnson) thinks it would make for a good story. Enlisting two interns to help him; Darius (Aubrey Plaza) - the woman with a fairly dark past, and Arnau (Karan Soni) - the 22 year old awkward virgin. Jeff's motives for this project aren't really about the ad, though, he's trying to track down one of his girlfriends from high school. So, while he's working his magic on his ex, Darius steps up to the plate and talks to our time traveling friend, Kenneth (Mark Duplass). Kenneth puts Darius to the test, and she wins his trust. He is a very sneaky man, but has to be, since he is being watched. As the film progressing, so do the plot twists and the questions. By the end, we still don't get a solid answer whether or not Kenneth can time travel, But that just makes the ending that much better.

The film is less about time travel, but more about the *idea* of time travel. But more than that, it is about love. The love of Jeff longing to be with the girl he's been thinking about for years, the love that is created between Kenneth and Darius through her training, and the love Arnau finally gets to make when Jeff takes him out on the town. Though I think that Jeff's story could have been played out a bit better, and Arnau's could have played out a bit longer, they were all done very good.

Overall, the whole story was good. The parts for Jeff and Darius were written specifically for their respected actor, which really helped bring the film together, even if I don't really like Aubrey Plaza that much. I wouldn't say this is a must-see, but it is still very good. It's on Netflix Instant, so I would say to give it a shot, if you have it.

I take my classes online so I can go anywhere, and my parents (and loans) can help me out with money so it's not too much of an issue as long as it's not too pricey and I find a part time job wherever I go. The only thing that's keeping me here is that internship offer, but I just feel like I'll still be extremely depressed and not even want to go (I have called off work in the past many times because of depression).

Professional artists out there, how did you start your career? 

 About Me
First, I've been rejected from a couple of schools and feel discouraged to apply anymore. This sucks because I would really like the opportunity to be in a classroom again, or have an internship at a game company.

Second,  I am from NYC, but currently live in the Netherlands working as a nanny. This is a McJob I took because I don't speak fluent Dutch. I moved out here to be with a guy. Stupid heart.

Third,Here is my website full of some of my artwork. www.AliseSnyder.com . If you look you'll find some portraits of friends and family, but not a lot else . :(

I have been watching FZD tutorials and am waiting on a snazzy book about perspective drawing from John Montague this week so I hope to continue to teach myself drawing skills at home.

19k7mp,2,2013-03-02,Need help deciding between jobs,medicalixx,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/19k7mp/need_help_deciding_between_jobs/,"Just so you all have an understanding of my background, I am a computer science student who is graduating from college this spring. I have always wanted to work as a web developer of some sort. I even have a current internship that allows me to work as a web developer as well as work with amazing people.

However, I have a dilema. Recently, I was offered two jobs for when I graduate school. Both jobs have pro's and con's, but I am having a hard time choosing. Here is a little information on each job:

Job 1 - My current internship has offered me a position in which I would be brought on full-time. I would be able to continue to work as a web developer, as well as have the freedom to work on projects that I choose (assuming that they are relevant and useful for the business) and would have the opportunity to learn a much broader range of knowledge. I also know the people I will be working with, because I have worked with them for a year now... So I kind of know what to expect with this job. I also want to throw it out there that I absolutely love my current internship. Overall, this job is offering me responsibilities that are beyond most entry level jobs because I would have the chance to offer vision and insight to this company to change it for the better (it's a relatively small company).

Job 2 - I was offered the opportunity to work as a software engineer consultant for a well known corporate consulting firm. This firm is very well regarded on an international level, and I truly believe that I will have no problem boosting my career if I work here. Also, I would be sent through their own few month long training program, so I would learn their ways of doing things. I believe I would also be able to gain a better professional network by working in this company because I would be surrounded by different companies multiple times in a year. Also, I would have the opportunity for up to 100% travel with this job and gaining frequent flyer miles, rental car points, and hotel points would be very useful (and cool) in the long run as well.

As a comparison between salary/benefits, Job 2 has a more impressive offer.

Overall, I am torn between a company that can offer me more in salary and reputation but could lack on giving me ""fun"" projects, or a job that will offer me freedom and broader sense of responsibilities as well as a great work atmosphere that will never get boring to me.

What should I do?

tl;dr: Should I go with a job that offers me more money and has a great international reputation, or a job that will allow me to have a greater personal development?"

Sometime. He hasn't taken any initiative in planning...just a ""whatever you pick will be fine."" Ugh.

We kind of live together at my parents house. Kind of. He part-time lives here.

Anyway, I am heading to Asia for 6 months this year for an internship.  During this time, I'd love if he could show a little independence and perhaps find some roommates or a place to stay closer to where he's working...and then maybe discuss when we get back.

He wants to sit there, presumably at my parents house, waiting for me to get back so I can come along and find us a place to live and take care of everything. 

The thing is: I don't know what I want. I want to live in a house with awesome friends as roommates. I don't know if I'm ready for this, I mean, what happens next? If we move in together, the only way it can go is breaking up or ...getting married? So I'd never be able to try it on my own?
Perhaps I'm just romanticizing the whole ""living with roommates"" thing. Maybe I just watch too much TV. I just don't want to miss out on anything or have to make choices for my own life in the context of how it will affect someone else. Will I be able to pick up and teach in Korea like I want to after graduation? What if my career takes me to another part of the country?

Our relationship has a ton of ups and downs. I get so frustrated with him and his purposely-enraging behaviour on a daily basis, but we also sometimes have fun together. He shuts down a lot, can't really speak what he's feeling. Contempt. I think the point is that I'm totally confused and I don't want to agree to this plan. Our families and lives are so intertwined, my group of friends from my hometown includes his relatives. What do I do? 

I'm sorry this is so ridiculous. This post..what a mess. 
I don't have a ton of close girlfriends, and the ones I do are very close with him as well so I can't talk to them. 

TL;DR: Boyfriend wants to wait until I get back from Asia to move in together, refuses to show independence, will most likely mooch of my parents for a place to stay while I'm gone. I don't know what I want.

After she proposes a break and quickly withdrew the notion, I'm a bit confused.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/19k4f7/m21_has_been_dating_his_girlfriend_f20_for_35/,"It is as the title states, I have been dating my girlfriend for three and a half years and never thought against it but one day she said she needed a break. I asked her why and she replied that it would allow ourselves to miss each other and evaluate our love for each other. 

I try to talk to her but realize and just tell her that I'm for whatever she wants. She then tells me that she feels like thinking that way was a mistake. I asked her if we are ""together"" to which she replies yes. 

I understand that she has been under a lot of pressure (school, work, trying to land an internship) and she had to move a bit further from me due to some family circumstances. However, whereas she used to cry and tell me how much she missed me, now she doesn't really tell me much about the relationship. When I asked, she said that she has said it so many times that saying it doesn't matter anymore. I make the effort to hang out it seems. 

Any help guys? I love her, I really do. I want her to feel comfortable but I can't spend every day second guessing a relationship I have invested a lot into. 

TL;DR After a suggested break, I am confused what to think.

**EDIT**: I realized after re-reading the post that it is slightly vague and would benefit from better explanation. I will proceed to do that.

Our relationship until this point has been great, we have been pretty much inseparable so far as to be called the ""cute"" couple of our friend group. We have also lasted the longest until this point (3.5 years, as stated above). Were both commuters in college but commute in different directions to different schools. We both hold down part time jobs to supplement the costs of college and to buy nice things like tacos and sweaters when it gets cold. 

Still living with parents takes its own toll on the relationship, but its mostly things we deal with. She has a mental block about having sex with people in the house, which I could totally understand. We lost our virginities to each other and being that we have been on this journey together, I have been very considerate and supportive of her sexuality and what makes her comfortable and what doesn't. We also have family obligations and since we both have rather large families, this can come up quite frequently. 

When Hurricane Sandy hit, we both had to relocate but found places with our families in opposing directions. This has taken a toll on us and has successfully limited our interactions to once a week or so. She calls me whenever she can, usually when in the car, in the morning, and before bed to mention a few. We text, but it tends to go stale because it seems very impersonal. I must confess that lately I have been planning much of the hangouts. That kind of bothers me. It's temporary, though, as we are both having our houses rebuilt and will be moving back into the same town to again be five minutes from each other. 

We are both very driven academically, but are in different fields so the way we express this is different. I, being an aspiring educator, take my field experience seriously and tend to spend much of my time reading and planning lessons. She's on the accounting track, and her idea of pushing towards her goals is trying to apply for internships. We are supportive of each other and have said that its education first and relationship second. With that mutual understanding, we have moved forward comfortably.

What she exactly told me wasn't, ""We need a break"" but more along the lines of ""I think we need a break because we've been apart and I feel like the flame is gone. When I'm with you, its there but I am just really lonely,"". She is in a town with no friends, and really doesn't have many school friends. After we talked (twice) and the idea of going through with the break has come up, she tells me that she hates everyone but me and that she doesn't want to break up. She gets stressed VERY easily, and with the loss of her home as well as the tough classes at school and a demanding work schedule I don't blame her. I am a bit more emotionally resilient than she is, so I am usually ""the rock"". 

I would say I believe that she is fooling around if I didn't truly know her and felt that all of this has been a product of her loneliness and her inability to deal with much stress. She has never stopped saying ""I love you"" and got mad recently when I said that, ""If you really value the relationship, a break wouldn't help anything. What matters is how much you give to this relationship and depending on that will depend on whether it will work or not,"". I also trust this girl, and know her policy on cheating. She pays for most of her stuff herself, so she needs the hours at work. 

TL;DR #2 : Explanation of the situation in a bit more depth.

19k0fs,5,2013-03-02,"I work the front desk at a hotel in a busy ski resort town, and my boss has entrusted me with all aspects of the  website and social media accounts. Looking for advice.",vtaznj,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/19k0fs/i_work_the_front_desk_at_a_hotel_in_a_busy_ski/,"Hello /r/marketing.

Im fairly new to the hospitality business. Im a 20 year old college student working the front desk at a hotel. During the summer I was a marketing intern for successful financial recruitment agency and resume writing service in NYC. I had a lot of fun working there and learned a boatload. I am now trying to apply what I learned during my internship at the hotel, but it's tricky because they are two totally different industries. So I have a few questions. Also any other suggestions and comments would be greatly appreciated.


**What kind of facebook advertising campaigns should we do?** Drive Likes, promoted posts.


**Should we consider advertising with Google?** Or will social media be enough?


**Should we consider SEO (search engine optimization)?** I recently read an article that SEO is going to become a thing of the past soon.


**Who is our target audience?** Couples, newly engaged couples, newly weds, families, large parties (ski/snowboard trips), age, city/location, country.


**What other social media outlets should we explore?** Twitter, Google+, Instagram, Pinterest.


**What kind of reports should we generate?** Conversion rates, impressions driven from social media, growth rate (number of likes, mentions, shares, retweets etc.), sales driven by social media.


**Who are our competitors in the area?** In the town Im in there are many different types of hotels ranging from large 4 Diamond Resorts to small BB's. I'd say my hotel is right in the middle as it is fairly small (35 rooms) and we don't offer things like concierge or valet parking.   **What should we keep track of?** Posting frequency, number of likes, ease of use

The owner of the hotel paid a lot of money for a simple wordpress site (which sucks). We are going to keep wordpress but the site deparatley needs to be upgraded. Message me if you want to the the site and I'll send the link. I'm not sure how my boss would feel if I posted the link...

**The tools I have at my disposal are:**

*A server where the site is hosted 


*Inntopia account (used for online reses - not my favorite).


*InnLink/Travel Lynx software (we use this as our main booking engine for our website and is tied directly into our hotel computer system) InnLink has a facebook app that lets people book directly from our facebook page.


*Not an unlimited advertising budget, but almost any expense can be covered - with in reason.


*A Constant Contact account, which I plan to use for email marketing and surveys that guest will fill out after they have left the hotel.


I learned how to use HubSpot when I was interning. It's an awesome tool, but would I be going overboard if I convinced my boss to invest in it? It's quite expensive. Are there any cheaper/free tools like HubSpot I should know about?


**Content**

What kind of content do you think I should post?


Thank you so much reddit!


**Edit:**Thanks to everyone who gave me advice!!

Before going to school I had no relevant work experience in my field. During the summer before I graduated I did a 4 month full-time internship with the government, where I gained significant experience. 

I've been putting out resume after cover letter after resume. I've gone to job fairs. I'm trying to learn extra skills at home through coursera and duolingo. I don't know what else to do. I'm thinking of maybe volunteering in my respective field, but it's difficult to do considering volunteer positions go to high school students here (they must fulfill a certain amount of volunteer hours before graduating), and I feel people would see that I have my Masters and pass me up. 

Every job I look at asks for minimum 2yr experience, 5 yr experience, 10 yr experience, etc. So when applying to these, it seems I'm being passed up for more experienced veterans.

When I apply to lower level jobs (e.g. data entry or the like) I feel like my ""Masters"" label causes employers to pass me up because I'm over-qualified. In reality, I just want *something* to help me start sharpening my skills. (Before working for my internship, I had only ever worked minimum-wage jobs. Even now I'm working part-time in a brainless job where I interact with no-one... so my social skills are going downhill and I have no busy-brain work to keep me going).

I'm feeling a little deflated... especially since throughout Grad school my professors hyped up the fact that I would be employed with a 6 figure salary straight out of school.  I was also told not to sell myself short by working for free.

What else could I do while I sit and re-write my resume everyday to make myself more appealing to employers?"

19jshv,1,2013-03-02,Story and what most internship interviews are like,rukkiu,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/19jshv/story_and_what_most_internship_interviews_are_like/,"I'm at a community college and about to finish my AS in Computer Science. I have experience in C++, Java, Python, and html. While I would not consider myself very experienced(I haven't had a lot of time to do sideprojects between work and school), I am a hard worker or that's what I've been told by several people. I'm wondering if this experience I had with my first internship interview is what others are going to be like.

I applied for an internship with a local company for a programming internship, no phone interview, they just asked me to come in for a test. So I was like, sure, they asked me if I could come in the next day and I said ok. They said to make sure to have about 5 hours free to interview, tour the place, and test. I should have asked for a later date because I hadn't done any C++ for awhile(what they wanted), but hey it can't be that bad right? It's just for an internship

So I show up 10 minutes early, get asked to wait in the lobby. I'm like ok, patience, I'll just read all the info about the company in here which is probably what they want me to do. (I had already researched them online and been on their website.) Get told they are still setting things up after I read everything. Wait 45 minutes sitting in the lobby, finally they bring me to the back, get handed a sheet with the test on it and told to go ahead and get started. They were not specific what the rules or objectives were. I mean I knew what the objective of the test was, but I didn't know if I could use C++ reference sites or what. I'm kind of shy so I asked an hour or so into the interview after I got really stuck.  

5 hours or so later, I end and they do a code review of my program(I had issues compiling, syntax errors, etc.). But they told me I was the only person to try and solve the problem using classes. They gave me a 5 minute interview after that. Then send me on my way saying they will contact me later. (They called later saying they couldn't find a place for me)

I felt like they were not even interested in an intern(2 of the 3 people anyway) or just weren't interested in me. I also felt like they were a bit rude.

Is this on par with what most internship interviews will be like? 

EDIT: This was for an unpaid internship"

I was an intern at Valve a little while ago. It's the best place to work even if I didn't get paid. I've followed my dad's footsteps in the gaming industry and he eventually got my foot in the door.

I was fresh out of college and still green to the world. This would eventually get me in trouble at Valve. So college was a blast and pretty easy for me since I've been studying game design and have been an active gamer for pretty much my whole life.

So I happened to be on /r/gaming when I get a beep that says I got a new e-mail. I got called in for a 1 on 1 with my boss. Ugh..

I guess I was in trouble for browsing the internet too much (we're allowed to take intermittent breaks during the day so we can ""freshen up our minds"") So I hesitantly walk over to the office and knock on the door. Lo and behold Gabe is sitting in the chair. Now I see him every once and a while around the building but it's only a little hi and bye so this was scary and exciting.

He sits me down and the first thing he says to me as he turns the monitor around, ""So is this what the internet thinks of me?""

Apparently they saw some Gabe meme from monitoring my net usage. My voice cracked and I whispered, ""um, I guess..""

Gabe bursts out laughing so hard and I let out biggest sigh of relief. Well then he told me to keep on the project we were working on and try not to ""take breaks"" as often.

So now every once and a while I get an email from him with some meme about him and it kind of became our inside joke. I'm pretty sure he's a Redditor now since he would always send me stuff that I just saw earlier that day. And I thought I only had to deal with this on FB.

By the way, Gabe gets the 3 jokes. 3/3/13"

I'm trying to decide whether or not to accept an internship offer from Amazon this summer. This would be my first internship there and I'm not really acquainted with the different teams. I was assigned to the Transaction Risk Management Systems team which had an interesting blurb sent along about them, but I wonder if any former interns (or current employees?) could shed light on this opportunity a bit more for me. Any comments or suggestions about Amazon in general would be helpful in making a decision, even if not specifically about the TRMS team. Also, I'm in talks with the Amazon subsidiary 'A9' which handles their search. They seem interesting, but I know very little about them as they don't seem to take many interns. If anyone can comment on A9 as well, that would be great.

I waste a lot of gas just getting there for making such little money and I ended up working basically every day.


There are 7 servers total (3 work a shift). I, along with three other college-aged servers, requested off the next week for our Spring Break since none of us are from the college town so we can go home and see our families. Understandably, they just told us last night they aren't allowing it. Though, I already had three of the other servers confide to me that they plan on quitting if they ultimately aren't allowed off.


I feel bad and hate to put the business into this situation but at the end of the day, I have to do what is best for myself. If I stay, it will only be worse through more work, more hours for a job I already dislike and I'm not planning to hold in a little more than a month anyway due to an internship opportunity back home over summer.

I understand the professional two week notice but my ride home is leaving this Thursday and the managers poor timing in just telling us last night for what was written on the calendar off weeks ago doesn't help.

I hope someone who's looking to adopt sees this.

I am currently in possession of three cats. One of whom is mine and I take full responsibility forever for him. He's cool (the black and white one in the pics, btw)

The other two...well, long story short, a friend of mine was abruptly fired. She had to leave the state to take up an internship, and was freaking out about her cats and lease. I mentioned I could temporarily take over both, and we agreed she would get the cats when the internship ended/she had a more stable living situation (that situation is actually way more complicated than I can explain here). I guess that day is not coming.

I'm leaving the state soon, living situation TBD, and taking my weird cat with me because he can handle our strange life. However, the other two...if no one is interested, she will need to **drop them at a shelter**.  I'm pretty unhappy with that, but there is no way I can afford/shelter these cats after next month. 

So my offer: One gray-ish tabby male cat, one creamsicle female cat. 
They are siblings, but they don't need to stay together, they mostly ignore each other. They are very friendly and pretty quiet. Honestly, I'm not sure they're adorable on contact enough to have a huge chance of adoption.
If you think you might have a place for these guys, please let me know! They come with cat carriers and they've had all their shots.

Should I quit before everyone else does?,mttwldngr,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/19nqjx/im_in_college_working_parttime_should_i_quit/,"I'm in college with a lot of free time in my schedule this semester so I picked up a part-time job in the beginning of January. When I was hired, I was promised schedule flexibility and was making $8/hour for only 2 hour shift days as a server at a retirement home. Honestly, the job sucked from the beginning. I waste a lot of gas just getting there for making such little money and I ended up working basically every day.

There are 7 servers total (3 work a shift). I, along with three other college-aged servers, requested off the next week for our Spring Break since none of us are from the college town so we can go home and see our families. Understandably, they just told us last night they aren't allowing it. Though, I already had three of the other servers confide to me that they plan on quitting if they ultimately aren't allowed off. 

I feel bad and hate to put the business into this situation but at the end of the day, I have to do what is best for myself. If I stay, it will only be worse through more work, more hours for a job I already dislike and I'm not planning to hold in a little more than a month anyway due to an internship opportunity back home over summer. It's my first job and have never quit before. I understand the professional two week notice but my ride home is leaving this Thursday and the managers poor timing in just telling us *last night* for what was written on the calendar off weeks ago doesn't help. We had new sets of managers hired a couple weeks ago so any chance of a reference was pretty much moot anyway (if even needed at all). Can anyone please help me out in this predicament?  

Edit: Also, I'm only scheduled this week to work tomorrow night but I'm sure they anticipate me working a lot next week if/when everyone quits. I planned on fulfilling my shift tomorrow but it being my last (although I have to go in on Wednesday to get my paycheck). "

I'm a super shitty premed, with 3 Cs under my belt I'm doubting med school is even an option. I'm considering switching tracks to PA or the like, but for now I'm still premed and pursuing a career in healthcare.

For the summer, as if I haven't fucked my grades enough. I have absolutely no idea what to do. I've missed most of the opportunities for stellar internships, research and other stuff because of laziness/procrastination and the usual. Now with it being March and spring break coming up I'm freaking out on what to do!

Currently I'm a sophomore, English major. Yes I know English, I'm sorry Reddit. I originally thought it'd be a good idea to go with a non-science major and premed to stand out and be different. Plus I'm really good at my English classes. Of course the problem now is that every place obviously wants someone pursuing a BS, not a BA even if I am double minoring in two sciences. Furthermore my grades suck, (like a 2.7 cumulative right now?) so my application is just laughable.

I have no experience in research or anything. I've had a job lifeguarding for the past six or seven years but other than that I've never had a paid job. The only experience I've had in the medical career has been my volunteering at a hospital during this school year and last summer.

Anyone know of steps I should take to pursue healthcare careers? I'm desperate at this point and in need of some serious advise!"

I'm looking for a place to sublet for the summer, ideally June 15th to September 1st, although the dates are flexible. I was recently accepted for a marketing internship in the Financial District and will be working 60+ hour work weeks for the duration of the internship. I'm looking for some place safe and clean to live for summer. My boyfriend is also looking to move to SF, preferably with me but for now I am looking for housing independently. If you're willing to accommodate a couple, we're definitely willing to pay more. Our range is $800-$1200 a month.

About me: I'm a lady in her early 20s that's quite excited about moving to the city. I enjoy video games, trying new foods, going to museums, and splitting a fifth over a bad movie. My boyfriend keeps to himself for the most part (plays lots of video games/ works on personal projects), but he's also very charismatic and friendly. 

If we/I sound like someone you'd like to live with or sublet to, send me a message. Looking forward to hearing from you!"

19nkzf,53,2013-03-04,Olivia's birth story!,serendipidouspickle,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/19nkzf/olivias_birth_story/,"So, labor did not go as planned or happen when I thought it would, but now I realize thats absolutely no surprise. 

From at least week 37, I was dilated to 3 cm and 60% effaced.  I stayed like that for another two weeks, then went in for my 39 week check-up and my doctor told me I was 4 cm and 70%.  She was fully on board with me waiting until 42 weeks to be induced because I wanted to avoid it, but my blood pressure was a TINY, and I mean TINY, bit high (140/82), so she had me go to the hospital to be monitored.  The other doctor in her practice couldn't believe she was sending me and everything ended up being fine at the hospital so I got the hell out of there fast because I didn't want to be induced.

At 40 +6 weeks, I went in for my normal check-up with my doctor.  I was having weekly NST tests, so she hooked me up and checked me for dilation.  I was 5 cm and 70% with bulging waters. I couldn't believe it! Keep in mind, I hadn't had any discernable contractions at this point, just some minor period like cramping.  She said she would be okay with letting me go into labor on my own, but Olivia's heart rate was dropping every time I had a ""contraction"" that they could see on the NST test.  Queue my panic, then  queue me being told I had to go to the hospital and get induced.  I freaked out. I talked to the other doctor to make sure this was really something I had to do. She agreed. 

I stopped at my parents house to get my hospital bag and have some food before I went in. I was freaking out. I called my SO and he started freaking out and couldn't believe I was going to have the baby that day. Everybody was freaking out! I was the type of person who just wanted her to stay in there forever-I was extremely afraid of labor. Sadly, that was not a choice. haha

We got to the hospital at around 2 pm. They asked if I wanted to go straight to my room or if I wanted to stop in at check-in. I said I would go to check-in because I wanted a few extra minutes to process what was happening. That took 20 minutes, then we were on our way upstairs. We got to the room (which was a LDRP suite so I never had to change rooms during the entire hospital stay) which was nice and big and had a nice bathroom. It didn't feel too medical at all.  I changed into my gown but refused to take my underwear off until I absolutely had to, and the nurses thought it was hilarious. I am a really modest person. They hooked me up to the monitors and of course, Olivia was registering fine, so I really didn't need to be induced, but at this point, apparently my doctor made the decision and wouldn't let me leave easily.  I was extremely pissed at her for that.

I was GBS+ so they hooked me up to antibiotics and took some blood.  I sat around for about an hour to see if anything progressed, but nothing really was.  I agreed that they could break my water.  It took her what seemed like forever to break it, and then she told me the sac was really thick so she doubted that it would have broken on its own.  I hated that part.  The constant gush of water every time I moved or got up was disgusting to me. I'm also squeamish about bodily fluids. At this point it was about 4 pm.  They let me sit around like that until 6, then started talking about pitocin.  I was extremely against this because I wanted to avoid and epidural and knew that pitocin made contractions almost unbearable, but since they broke my water I really had no choice.  The nurse promised she would put me on the lowest drip and not move it up unless I agreed. 

She started pitocin and about 20 minutes later I was having TERRIBLE back labor that was almost constant.  It was basically a contraction that lasted at least a minute every 30 seconds.  I have never been in so much pain.  At one point I went to the bathroom and pooped (DO THIS IF YOU CAN, sorry TMI) which made me feel a lot better. Also, use counter pressure on your back! Make your SO or your labor support (I had my mother and my boyfriend both there) massaging my back as hard as they could and someone was holding my hands. At one point I told my boyfriend I thought I would die if he stopped massaging my back.    

At 8:30 pm I started thinking about pain medication.  I wanted to have a natural birth and I really really didn't want an epidural, but I was to the point where I didn't think I could handle it anymore.  I told the nurse I was thinking about IV pain meds, but she wanted to check me before she gave me anything.  I was 9.5 cm! Thats where shit got intense.  She literally said ""Holy shit I have to go call your doctor right now."" and ran out of the room. I had no option for pain meds at this point and was very thankful for that.  I knew that I could make it without it at that point.  What I have been told I found was true-when you get to the point where you just don't think you can do it anymore, you're probably almost to the point of being fully dilated.  I tolerate pain pretty well, though.

At this point I'm laying there freaking out.  I yelled at my mom she had to go get the nurse because I was feeling like pushing and couldn't not push.  It seemed like she was gone for an hour but it was really only a few minutes.  The nurse came back and luckily my doctor was with her.  At this point I really hated my doctor.  She walked in the room and had the audacity to start chit-chatting with the nurse about her kids! I was like BITCH I NEED TO PUSH WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU! It was like nobody was taking me seriously and I was pissed.  She kept telling me to work through contractions with my eyes open. I just said no. I'm laboring the way I want to! I couldn't believe she walked in and tried to tell me how I should work through the pain. At that point I knew how to handle it. 

At 8:45 I started pushing.  That shit was HARD. My mom was holding one of my legs up, my boyfriend was holding the other one, I had a sheet draped over my legs (yes, I still wanted to be as modest as possible), and I had to grab my thighs every time I needed to push.  I am fairly certain I said ""I can't do this"" about a million times, but I did.  It literally feels like you just took the best dump of your life. It's so hard because every time you push near the end it makes things hurt worse because you are stretching, but you just have to work through it and know it's only temporary.  At 9:30 on the dot I pushed her head and then the rest of her body out.  The put her on top of me and I was in shock. I couldn't believe that I just pushed that little girl out of me! The doctor stitched up (what I think, since my doctor is a bitch and wouldn't answer any of my questions) was one first degree tear that was going towards my urethra.  I then pushed out the placenta which was hilarious-it came out in two pieces and the first piece shot out at my doctor and splashed her, the nurse, and the intern that were there.  I did delayed cord clamping, so after placental delivery my boyfriend cut the cord. 

There is much more to the story but I have to get back to my LO, so I will be posting later about my experience after birth and all the things I've learned in the past two and a half weeks. Thanks for reading, ladies!

**TL;DR: Olivia born on Valentines day at 9:30 pm after 4 hours of labor, ~45 minutes of pushing; 6 lbs 14 oz, 9/9 APGAR.  Pitocin and broken water, no pain medication. First degree tear, just a few stitches.**"
19nijf,16,2013-03-04,Some tips,shaggorama,OfficeScripts,https://www.reddit.com/r/OfficeScripts/comments/19nijf/some_tips/,"I'm an experienced developer, but I built most of my chops developing tools to automate tasks specific to my work (not specifically programming in python). Here are some general tips to find things you might want to automate:

1. What are some things that take up a lot of your time? 

2. Do you have any tasks that require following sequences of clear steps that you have to repeat over and over again? Maybe moving in between programs, or manipulating a file, or making changes to several files? Or maybe repeating a series of steps in one program? Better yet, in a program for which a python API exists (like maybe excel)?

3. Do you have any menial labor that you were considering outsrourcing to temp labor or interns? Like manual data entry, web scraping, simple report building, or client emailing?

These kinds of projects are the kinds of things that should raise red flags that, hey, maybe there's at least some element of this that I could streamline or automate via programming. It might ultimately be more trouble than it's worth but hey, it might pay out. 

Here are some useful libraries to be aware of (obviously your mileage may vary):

* os
* sh
* pandas
* cx_Oracle
* sqlite3
* BeautifulSoup
* Requests
* urllib2

If you're not into that, so be it.**

I'm a senior in college studying Computer Science, and I'm expecting to graduate in December of this year. This summer, I got a paid internship making quite a bit every hour. During the internship, I'll be living at home, so I won't have rent to worry about. The only thing I'll really have to pay for is lunch, gas and maybe the occasional night out. 

So, by the end of the summer, I'll have a bunch of money saved up. Here's my options:

* Save the money. This is the safe choice, but also the boring one. 

* Buy a Canon 300mm f/2.8 (version 1) used. 

* Buy a Canon 400mm f/4 DO. 

* Buy into the Fuji X system. Camera and two lenses (Body: XE1 or XPro1, not sure yet. Lenses: I'm interested in all the primes). 

* Buy a Canon 5Dmk3.

I currently have a 5Dmk2, 16-35, 24-70 and 70-200. I know I will be shooting a lot of sports during my last semester, and I will be able to make at least $75-$100 bucks a weekend shooting high school football for my local newspaper. If I buy a 300 or 400, I can give more reasons to increase my freelance rate. 

I plan to keep freelancing when working as a software engineer after graduation. It gives me a way to relax and push myself. It's a hobby I get paid to do. 

If I get the Fuji X cameras, it'll be more of a ""fun"" thing. I can use these for non-sports freelancing, and fun shooting. There's not a huge monetary reason for me to get those, but damn, it would be cool to have. 

The 5Dmk3 would let me have a two-camera setup. Currently, I'm pretty much a speed demon when it comes to changing lenses, but nothing beats having two camera bodies. 

Anybody have opinions about what I should do? I'm just looking for general advice. 

**TL;DR what should I buy: 300mm f/2.8L, 400mm f/4DO, Fuji X, 5D3 or nothing?**

I have only had intermediate accounting 1/2, cost, and income tax. I won't be taking audit or any other specialized accounting classes until the fall of 13 and spring of 14.

How about a BS in Finance to go with my Accounting degree? A master's in a more specialized field of accounting, such as taxation? Maybe an MBA in a more general field in case I want to go private and possibly segue into a non-accounting position?

I can't help but feel it was a trap because I was denied initially.  But ultimately, I do what the development position.  I have no work experience in the software field, no internships, and have already graduated.  Should I have answered honestly and said I want to apply for the internship?


Should I just bite the bullet and take the Customer rep job and work my way into development, or be straight with them now and say I want to be a developer.

Thanks!"

",Hello92932,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/19n0kd/i_feel_like_a_highly_qualified_failure_i_have/,"I can't seem to get a steady job. I'm lucky, I know I am because my family are great and I have always worked since graduation but every job is only for a short period. I'm constantly on the edge - people talk about ""losing their job"" being a big issue, but I basically lose mine every few months, have to work unpaid or - at best - I am always only ever 1 weeks notice away from losing my role. I'm young - yes - but I have rent and bills to pay too, and maybe i'd like to take a holiday? Maybe I would like to decide on a few days off, rather than just take off the random few days I can in between jobs. I can never decide to take 2 weeks off because I need to take whatever job I can that comes my way, otherwise I might lose out and god knows what will happen then. I just want a rest - a real rest - a rest where it's a few paid days holiday where I don't have to worry about finding work or the fact that i'm working unpaid.  

I'm well qualified and I have top experience, but ultimately i'm never as good as the person who gets it. People say there's no fault in my CV but ""I was just unlucky somebody with highly relevant experience happened to also apply"" - the only problem is that whenever I get an interview, it's always the same - this shadow mystery person also applies, and just so happens to have years of highly relevant experience, despite it being a graduate role. I can't help but notice that rich people are everywhere and they don't even seem ashamed that their contacts got them there. It's like if you're wealthy, you need less than everybody else - you don't need to spend the time or money, or even have the qualifications. If you're 'normal', however, then you must remain trapped. At first I was told that in order to get the job I wanted I would need ""relevant experience"", but then I found out that this meant ""highly relevant"" - which included working unpaid. Now i've been told that it's actually  ""you need to have worked in the role before you can get the role"". I can't take it anymore!

I've invested thousands in myself, through a postgraduate qualification and numerous internships and it's depressing to see that even if I did get a job, it'd pay me roughly the same as somebody working in retail. Everything in me screams to just 'get a job' doing something and getting a decent salary - like my family - but I want to do something i'd enjoy.

I've had interviews, but I never seem to do well. I can't stand the interview structure where people ask you pre-scripted questions, forcing you to mash whatever you happen to know or have done into whatever shape you can. Why can't they just ask me to talk about myself, my experience and how i'd do the role? Why wont they ever tell you what the actual project is before the interview!? Why do they leave it as some mystery, forcing you to research everything you can around them, and then they reveal the topic - as if it's something magnificent mystery. If you're lucky, you've read into the topic and if you're not lucky, you haven't. You might have read into everything else, but if you've read everything but that one thing - it doesn't matter. Why is it that people who interview never seem to understand how to interview? Why not just ask the candidate how they'd do the role? Why does it matter if I have specific experience of organising X or researching into Y. If I did have experience of those things - and did them well - then you're accepting that people can do good things without having done them before. Just give me a chance. 

I've now worked unpaid for a while now and I don't have my savings anymore; no deposit for a flat, no paying off my tuition loans, no holiday and no nice things - i've worked unpaid because rich people think it's ok to get poor people to give everything they have, to make them richer - because that's just what happens. I've paid all of this for nothing - there's no job for me here. I feel like a failure. I'm trying to hide it all.  "

My name is Matt. For the last year I have been working in the voluntary sector making films for charities, community groups and social enterprise organisations in my city. Prior to this I mainly made short fictional films while studying, although I still do this in my spare time.

This last year I have been unemployed but volunteering full-time in some very rewarding and worthwhile roles in deprived areas of the city. I originally worked in the wonderful establishment of Subway while looking for work in film or tv. Of course there was none that I could get and regardless of my experience it was made even more difficult that I did an Audio/Video electronics degree rather than something with media in the name.

The transition into voluntary work was the best thing I ever did and came at a time when I feared for my physical and mental health working night shifts in Subway. The projects I have worked on up until now have been fantastic for gaining experience and doing something positive with my life that helps others. Of course I have had to move back in with my parents and can only afford a fairly meagre existence.

My current position is with a small charity organisation that has an even smaller studio to produce media for the events and projects the charity runs. After volunteering full-time for the last 6 months, a government funded internship within the company was secured to give me paid, professional experience for 3 months. - a reward almost for my hard work - After this I would be established and experienced enough to gain stable employment in my area of expertise.

But the madness comes in with the controversial work programme that we have here in the UK. I have been referred to this programme recently and although I have not actually started it, I am considered to have done so because the work programme partners have received their fee from the government. This has been done despite being in a full-time voluntary position and notifying them of my intention to secure this internship.

So instead of continuing my important work in a full-time paid internship that will set me up as a professional, my employment agency will have me writing CVs/resumes and no doubt make me work for peanuts in Tesco.

Why?

Because of money.

The work programme is run by private organisations that are goverment funded and receive additional money if they can stuff me in a basic job for a few months. Although I have not started it yet, they have had their money and the government will not fund the internship now. Nor will they simply cancel the work program that I will gain nothing from, because the private partners would sue them.

Although this internship has been in planning for months, you are secretly ineligible to do it if the unemployment agency signs you up to the work programme. It should be noted that at no point during the application and organisation process of this internship is the work programme even mentioned. And so right at the culmination of all my work and experience leading up to this point, I have been sent back to square one by the government.

The nature of my work requires constant involvement to progress and as such I have severely neglected family involvement to focus on my career. To be involved with the work programme now would completely remove me from the game and I could not face, or afford, starting all over again.

I am at a loss with what to do just now. Having to leave my voluntary position and seeing my placement go to someone else will be heart-breaking. Needless to say my enthusiasm for the work programme will be tough to muster.

Any questions about my situation just ask."

We don't really fight, but there is a lot of tension and irritation. She asks me to help clean around the house, and goes for a meeting. I pause the game (Borderlands 2) and go do the dishes. When the kitchen is almost done, the faucet explodes. By the time I run downstairs to turn the mains off, water is raining on me through the ceiling. took me another 2 hours to soak the water in the kitchen and downstairs and to temporarily plug the now-exploded faucet.

I was sitting on the kitchen floor, soaking wet, alone, cold and depressed. A cigarette pack is on the table next to me.

19mmcc,7,2013-03-04,Friend [20F] is constantly negative and driving me [21M] and all her other friends away and I don't know what to do.,IThatAsianGuyI,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/19mmcc/friend_20f_is_constantly_negative_and_driving_me/,"I am 21M, the friend in question is 20F, and everyone else relevant to the story is in the same age group. I'll try and condense this as much as I can.


The story begins about a year ago now. The friend, lets call her J, was going through some relationship problems with her then-bf (now ex). At the time, I wasn't particularly close with her as we had just met. Over the course of the next 4 months, we began to grow closer but not close enough for her to talk about relationship problems with. 


Long backstory short, J and her bf eventually broke up. It was a pretty messy breakup. Initially, I wasn't aware of this breakup as it never came up in conversation. However, towards the end of summer (July-August, some 4-5 months after we initially met) she started talking to me about her breakup. I thought nothing of the out-of-the-blue conversation about her now-past relationship at first, as it's pretty normal to confide in others during times of hardship. This is, I think, important to note. I'll expand on this later.


I have, in the words of one of my friends, ""the patience of a saint"". This probably comes from my belief in not diminishing a person's feelings and the incredibly varying ways people deal with grief and problems. So in specific regards to J's situation, and how she started talking to me about her feelings of grief, the way I decided to be there for her was to simply be someone she could rant to, offering my brand of advice only when she asked for it. Essentially, the message I was trying to tell her was that it's okay to have the feelings that you and that I strongly believe in working through these emotions. If J had a specific question about what to do in this situation, and asked what I would do, I would offer up my opinion. Otherwise, I simply let her talk and try and sort through her emotions. 


Between September and the first week of January, I had a full-time intern position as well as a part-time job, often times working from 7am to 11pm (including a 3hr commute each day). Unlike in the summer, I wasn't as readily available to talk with J. So naturally we aren't as close as we once were. Nothing wrong with this right? Especially considering she seems to be getting better and moving in the right direction (no longer crying at the mention of her ex, can keep herself together and composed when talking about it, etc). 


Actually, no, this is when she turns the crazy up to 11.  Over the course of our limited conversations from Sept-Jan, she tells me a) She can't sleep, b) According to her, the slightest bit of caffeine can still affect her body 12+ hours after initially consumption (...of green tea), c) She's taking 120% course load, d) she's relapsed and gotten incredibly obsessive over her ex-bf (checking FB statuses and pictures all the time to ""see how he's doing without her"", asking friends about him, etc.), e) is taking on *extra* responsibilities at her University's College Residence, f) volunteering at the hospital, and all this while going to a commuter school (3+hrs a day round trip). 


Needless to say, she was pretty stressed out. It was during this time that she started to really ask for advice on what to do, so I gave her my opinions. The stress of juggling everything in her life was obviously getting to be too much, so I told her to do the obvious things first and drop down to a 100% course load (or lower if needed), stop drinking any caffeine, get some rest, etc. As for the relapse and crazy, this was coupled with severe self-esteem issues and depression in that she kept thinking everything was her fault, she had no value, etc. Funnily enough, multiple guys seemed to want to try and court her during this stretch too, but I digress. I told her that she really should try and find a therapist for dealing with these issues, as I'm no professional and the things she was telling indicated to me that she should seek professional help. From January to present day, she either blatantly ignores my advice or half-asses her attempts so much that she might as well have ignored it all together. She doesn't try and get some sleep (doesn't even go to bed, saying things like ""I cant fall asleep, so I might as well stay up and try and get some work down"") and is therefore tired all the time, which hinders her ability to keep up with her classes, adding to her stress which prevents her from sleeping...She drinks caffeine despite the side-effects she claims it has on her, and doesn't see a therapist at all. Needless to say, she was and is miserable all the time. These conversations repeated themselves so many times I've lost count. It's gotten to the point of being absolutely insufferable and a serious drain just being around her. It's gotten so bad that recently, I've completely shut her down when she tries to have another repeat conversation by saying things like ""Look, we've talked about this before. You know what I think.""  


A few weeks ago, me and my group of friends arranged a hang out. We all went out for dinner and then off to play pool on a Friday night. Important things to note are that I go to University in a different city from all my friends, so I had to commute back for the hangout, and that it just happened to be during a blizzard which made my normal 1.5-2hr trip back to the city end up taking 6 hours instead. I had also worked out the morning of, after my 8:30 class so I was pretty beat by the time I met up with everyone. Throughout the night, I apparently did things that bothered her a lot. Some of the specifics I remember her giving me are, a) when we were moving to a larger table to accommodate everyone, she moves her stuff while preventing me from moving mine by blocking my path (and moving back and forth constantly). So I just stand there looking bemused/bewildered. I thought I was giving off a playful ""Really? Are you serious right now?"" look. Apparently though, I had instead gave her the dirtiest glare. b) made fun of her appetite (she's tiny, like 4'11""), c) kept making fun of her. 


At the end of the night, as we were leaving the pool hall I turn to walk down the street, while she tries to go the other direction. We all need to get down to a specific road in order to take the bus home. She thinks going her way is the right direction, I thought she was wrong (as that'd be going in the direction opposite to the way we came). I let her know that, and then she exploded at me. She essentially yells at me saying I've been rude to her all night, letting me have it verbally with the points above. Exhausted, I just let her and our other friends know that I'm sorry if it seemed that way and that I didn't mean anything by it, but I'm going to go the way I think is right and not have this fight. So I walk away. 


We haven't talked since. 


Now, back to the point I mentioned earlier about not really thinking much about her talking to me about her problems. I have heard from mutual friends that since she stopped talking to me, she has started talking to one of my closest friends (20M) instead. He shuts her down just as much as I did, except significantly faster as his patience is a lot lower than mine. Our other female friends also similarly dislike talking to her now because she all she ever talks about is herself and her problems.  I have also learned that prior to talking to me about this stuff, she drove two other friends up the wall nuts with her problems before they completely removed themselves from the emotional drain she was begin. 


So now, basically, I have no idea what to do with J. She's always being negative and self-centered, and it's working towards tearing her from our group of friends. Everyone is tired of putting up with her because she just won't listen. I don't want to lose a friend, but it's already starting to happen and I don't know what I can do to prevent it from going down this way. 


**Tl;dr; Friend is being incredibly negative all the time and is a heavy emotional drain to me and my group of friends. Prior to our group, she drained other friends so much they cut her out. She won't listen to anyone, despite always asking for our opinions, and then has constant meltdowns as a result of her actions (or lack thereof) which leads to coming back to us for advice. It's made her damn near impossible to be around. I don't want to lose her as a friend, but I don't know what else I can do to help her. Any advice?**"

To name a few issues: 

Switching from quarters to semesters (from ~3 classes for 10 weeks to ~5,6 classes for 15 weeks)- damaged several major programs and has cut back on the social environment that the school was known for

Screwing over some of us flagrantly in the switch to semesters which will not allow us to graduate on time (you cannot receive financial aid for extra semesters) or fulfill second majors

Taking away room phones and replacing them with an ""internet phone system"" which is useful only for students with smartphones

The administration continually sending out surveys and asking for feedback that they say they will take into account, which they never actually take into account

Most recently, making a house of us pack up our rooms just for the week of spring break because, SURPRISE, other people will be living in them! The other group was notified at least 2 weeks ago and we found out 5 days in advance in the middle of an intensive teaching internship with several large projects due before the break.

19mgby,0,2013-03-04,Stuck at a fork on whether I want to continue being a Mechanical Engineer.,ChrisLauJoseJr,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/19mgby/stuck_at_a_fork_on_whether_i_want_to_continue/,"So heres the deal, I enjoyed Calculus in high school, Calc and Physics in college was relatively easy, but now as I am going into the mid-upper division classes, I am finding myself losing interesting in all these equations, and as a result, have fallen behind. I'm considering switching to computer science, because I feel like the work might interest me more, and the less limited to military. 

The question is, as an engineer who DOES enjoy designing things and problem solving, 

should I just muscle through my classes and finish it? 
What do entry level engineers / internship work consist of?
What else is there other than cars / planes / military weapons?

[Are you a vegetarian or just make sure your food comes from places like free range farms?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyiai?context=5)|I think that there are less cruel methods of getting meat. But in the end I feel the absolute best action we can take for the animals sake is to go vegetarian. I also want to add that even when a package says free range or cage free mutilated without painkillers. Piglets are castrated, have their teeth ripped out with pliers, etc.)
 |As far as with Walmart, all we are asking them to do is stop confining pregnant pigs in crates so small they can't even turn around.
[*I also want to add that even when a package says free range or cage free mutilated without painkillers.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyt43?context=5)|""...or cage free the animals are usually still mutilated..""
[Have any companies changed their practices specifically because of you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyihm?context=5)|The Walmart pork supplier that we investigated was also linked to Costco and Kmart. The night before we were set to release the investigation Costco and Kmart both came out and commited to phasing out gestation crates. We were also recently successful at getting Kraft Foods to do away with tail docking, which is the practice of slicing off a calf's tail without painkillers.
[Are there any companies who you feel are especially humane in their treatment of animals?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyihm?context=5)|I think there are companies that are making strides in the right direction, but none that I would promote as being humane. I think the only way to be 100% humane is to go simply stop eating animals. With that said, when it comes to the issue of gestation crates Costco, Kmart, Kroger, Safeway, Mcdonalds, Burger King, Wendy's and a pretty long list of others have committed to doing away with them. With that said, all that means is the pigs will be given enough space to turn around, lie down, and engage in some natural behaviors. Far from ideal. But still a big step in the right direction.
[How do you get from place to place and why are you dressed so fancy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyiti?context=5)|We have a little Toyota Corolla that we drive around the country. It's packed to the brim. I also want to add that we almost never stay at motels. We have done 92 stops with this campaign and have probably stayed at a motel 4 times. We stay with local volunteers and people I have met over the last couple years on my travels. Every now and then we use the website www.couchsurfing.org.
 |We dress up because people take you more seriously when you are dressed up. And since we feel this is a serious issue I wear a suit and tie everyday.
[What was it like being undercover at the pork supplier? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oys2k?context=5)|I have never gone undercover. One of our former investigators did one of these. It can be found here. [Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/147bjg/i_was_an_undercover_investigator_documenting/)
[How did you manage to get your video and evidence?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oys2k?context=5)|Our investigators take a job at these facilities and go to work everyday wired with a pinhole sized hidden camera and audio equipment. They basically just document what they see.
[What was Walmart's reaction to the release of your findings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oys2k?context=5)|Walmart is dragging it's feet. They have made no commitment to phasing out gestation crates even though almost every other major food provider has already done so.
[What other undercover investigations have you been a part of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oys2k?context=5)|Our organization has done over 20. You can learn more at www.mercyforanimals.org .
[Has Wal-Mart tried to stop you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyikh?context=5)|All of our protests are set up on a public sidewalk, which means they are completely legal. Every now and then the management will come out and talk to us. And it's pretty awesome because they are almost always sympathetic to the cause!
[Has anyone ever bothered you while protesting, such as physical or verbal assault? If so, was it from the buisness you were protesting or people passing by?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyozt?context=5)|The response from the public to our protests is overwhelmingly positive. We get a lot of honks of support, thumbs up, waves, etc. Every now and then we get an ""I love bacon,"" or a middle finger. I actually think it's kind of funny.
[Do you think the ag-gag laws that are currently being debated and passed will impact your work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyl6w?context=5)|The main thing we are worried about them impacting is our undercover investigations. Without undercover investigations there are no effective watchdogs protecting animals on factory farms and in slaughterhouses. And we think that lawmakers should be working to prevent and prosecute cruelty to animals, rather than making it harder to expose.
[Well done, factory farming is possible the worst mass-scale animal abuse in the 21st century. Do you think people still shop and buy meat from Walmart because of ignorance or because they know about it but don't care?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyqwp?context=5)|I think public knowledge about factory farming is growing which is why we are seeing lots of people going vegetarian, cutting back on meat consumption, and also seeing laws passed in some states to get rid of some of the worst factory farming abuses. But I think there are still a lot of people that really don't know. The meat industry does a pretty good job of hiding their animal abuse from the public.
 |A good video to show friends who don't know about factory farming is www.meatvideo.com .
[Blunt question but how do you grow to care so much about animals we are going to kill and eat anyway? Not condoning the gestation crates, just curious. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oypre?context=5)|Farmed animals experience pain and suffering just like dogs and cats. I think the best thing we can do for the animals is go vegetarian. But in the meantime we can all agree that these animals deserve to at least be able to turn around. And since most people are opposed to animal abuse, I think most people are on our side with this issue.
[What does this do to prices? I see lots of people protest things tags they don't like and assume that the buying public should absorb slightly higher prices to cover the change. Most of the actual improvements that seem to become widespread enough to be meaningful involve someone working with the industries to make sure that the changes are price neutral so that they're not just adopted by a limited crowd willing to pay for it. Any success on this front?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oypmb?context=5)|Iowa State University conducted a two-and-a-half year long economic analysis of the issue and found that that a group housing solution resulted in a weaned pig cost that was 11 percent less than the cost of a weaned pig from the individual stall confinement system.
 |But I really think we need to change the way we view animals. Animals are living beings with needs and wants of their own. If we are really opposed to animal abuse I don't think we should be looking at their welfare in terms of cost.
[What do you vision for the future of the food industry, especially the fast food one. Do you see these big corporations exposed and forced to change or will things continue to get worse?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oym4h?context=5)|Most people are horrified when they learn about the tiny cages farmed animals live in, the mutilations they endure, and the brutal slaughter they are subjected to. When they learn this they don't want to support it. And a lot of corporations are realizing this, which is why many are beginning to offer more vegetarian options.
 |I do think things will get better. We just have to work smart and hard.
[What made you want to help the animals in the first place?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyrff?context=5)|I grew up with a dog. She was my first connection with animals. And I saw in her first hand that she had her own personality. She experienced emotions. And she felt pain. When I got older I started questioning what the difference was between a dog and pig. I got a leaflet from Vegan Outreach a few times. And then came across a video similar to the one at www.meatvideo.com. After that I decided to go vegetarian and advocate on behalf of farmed animals.
[Of all your encounters with individuals and the media, which stands out in your mind as the most successful? Why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oympy?context=5)|Both encounters were on different campaigns. 
 |I was leafleting at the university in Orlando, FL when a girl took a leaflet from my friend Vic, read it for a few minutes, then threw out the bacon and egg sandwich she was eating. She talked to us for a while and said she was going vegetarian.
 |I was on the Farm to Fridge Tour a couple years ago. You can read more about it at www.farmtofridgetour.com. The local FOX affiliate in Fort Myers, FL did a pre-story on our demonstration there. They said it got more viewer responses than any other Sunday night story in the history of the station. So they came out again the next day, did a live shot earlier in the day, and then did another story at night. All 3 stories were amazing!
[How do you think your strategies differ from those of previous activists who have had little apreciable effect?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyl82?context=5)|One thing we do at MFA that I think is really important is maintain a professional image. People take us more seriously because of it.
[How do the people working at a location usually try to handle the situation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyonv?context=5)|They usually don't even come out and talk to us. Every now and then they will. But after speaking with us for a couple minutes they actually end up being sympathetic. A lot of them are shocked Walmart is still using gestation crates after so many of their competitors have committed to doing away with them.
[Do you honestly think your campaign is going to make a difference? If so, how? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyp7z?context=5)|This campaign has been so successful with garnering mainstream media attention all over the country and getting public support that I think it's only a matter of time. The longer Walmart waits on this issue, the worse they look.
[Often times, I see organizations point out faults in a system, but come up with no solutions to the problem. What are some of your solutions to better animals' living conditions, while also producing at the same large scale farming that needs to be done?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oysj3?context=5)|Smithfield, one of the nations largest pork producers has already moved toward alternative housing with much success. We feel pregnant pigs deserve to at least be able to turn around. This is something a number of systems support, which would include group housing, outdoor hutches, or even just larger individual pens.
[Are you familiar with the documentary ""Food Inc.""?  I have changed the way I eat because of that, what's your take on that movie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oywkb?context=5)|That's a really good documentary. And I'm glad it's become so mainstream. I have met so many people all over the country who have watched it. I do also think it's pretty tame and doesn't show just how bad the animals are treated on factory farms. If you ever have the time you should check out Mercy For Animals 12-minute documentary called Farm to Fridge. You can watch it at www.meatvideo.com .
[What can I do to help raise awareness to this issue? I am fresh out of giant inflatable pigs last I checked, but I think this widely-accepted abuse needs more attention.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oysw9?context=5)|Thanks for wanting to help out. You can share the link on your facebook.  www.walmartcruelty.com . You can also sign the petition there as well.
[Where do you see the meat industry going in the future? Will more people decide to become vegetarian?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oz0m9?context=5)|[Link to www.mfablog.org](http://www.mfablog.org/2010/10/vegnism-a-growing-trend-among-college-students.html)

[As a bacon lover. What can I do to ensure that I am eating cruelty free bacon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oysup?context=5)|Good question. I think the only way to be cruelty free is to not eat bacon. With that said, there are less cruel ways of getting bacon. Really the only way to know though, is to actually go to the farm and see for yourself.
[What is your opinion on PETA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oz01k?context=5)|Mercy For Animals is a completely separate organization. We see eye to eye with them on a lot of things but their tactics are sometimes different than the way we go about things. We try to maintain a professional image as well.
[Who have you investigated with positive results? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oypvk?context=5)|All of our investigations are done completely at random. But every time our investigators come out of these facilities they have footage of horrific cruelty. There is almost always sadistic abuse. But the real horrific cruelties are the standard practices. Practices such as confining animals to cages where they can barely move, mutilating them without painkillers, etc. are considered standard practice within the industry. To learn more check out www.meatvideo.com.
[I started watching meatvideo.com and I wonder how ubiquitous these practices are. Do you have any idea or have you simply been made aware of some farms?  Edit: I found this informational site: Link to www.depts.ttu.edu.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8p1938?context=5)|Since isn't 1 federal law in existence that protects farmed animals during their lives the abuses documented at www.meatvideo.com run rampant in facilities nationwide. Most of the abuses shown, such as confining the animals to tiny cages where they can barely move, castrating them or slicing off their tails without painkillers, and slitting their throats (many times while fully conscious) at the slaughterhouse are considered standard practice within the industry. These abuses aren't just a few factory farms failing to meat industry standard. The abuses are industry standard.
[Who's paying you rent? It seems protesting is your full time job now, which is admirable, but not very profitable.  How are you getting by?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8p0ssh?context=5)|I no longer have an apartment. I'll be subletting from someone anytime there is a break between tours.
[What are some of the best alternatives to meet the demand for this popular product (meat in general, pork in specific\)? What are our choices for ethically maintained animals?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oywhf?context=5)|I don't believe there is a way to ethically kill and eat animals. There are definitely less cruel methods. But that means there are just differing degrees of cruelty. The only completely ethical choice is to leave animal off our plates. There are lots of meat alternatives from companies like Boca, Morningstar Farms, Gardein, etc. I would suggest trying numerous products to find the ones that you like.
[ of all, let me say that I love that you are doing this.  Any victory in the husbandry practices of our country is a huge one!!  That being said, how do you actually film these videos?  In other words, you seem like an animal lover and I just don't know if I could watch what is going on on these farms, etc.  How do you ""keep your wits about you"" when taping a video and stop from vomiting, cringing, etc??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8p1hlg?context=5)|I have never personally done any of the investigations. Our investigators take a job at the facility and just go in wired with a pin hole sized hidden camera and audio equipment. Then they just document what they witness. After every investigation the investigator comes out of the facility with images of horrific cruelty.
[Why should I stop eating meat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyu2k?context=5)|Www.meatvideo.com.
[What are your thoughts on horse meat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oynna?context=5)|I think all animals feel pain and suffering and deserve the same respect. So the same reason I won't eat a dog, I also won't eat a chicken or a horse.
[What do you hope happens from your protesting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyox1?context=5)|We're just calling on Walmart to follow the lead of Costco, Kroger, Safeway, and a ton of others and commit to phasing out crates that prevent pregnant pigs from even turning around.
[How do you know if you are buying meat from a source that treats its animals well? I have no intentions of becoming a vegetarian, I love meat too much, but I don't want to support of company that is okay with animal cruelty either. What should I know when buying meat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyrce?context=5)|Thanks. I was asked a similar question earlier and this was my response: [Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oz20l)
[What do you think of synthetic meat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oz2ot?context=5)|Are you talking about in vitro meat? I am in full support of it because there would be no suffering involved in making it.
[Do you get an income doing what you're doing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyrir?context=5)|Yes. I'm not raking in the big bucks though. I do this work because I'm passionate about reducing the amount of suffering in the world.
[Piggybacking off that question, how did you start doing what you do for a living? Was it a transition from intern / volunteer to paid employee?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8p13os?context=5)|I did a lot of volunteering for various organizations. ie. Vegan Outreach, the Humane League, HSUS, etc. I eventually got offered a job at Vegan Outreach. Through doing all this work I met people who worked for Mercy For Animals. When they thought of the first idea for a tour they asked me if I was interested. And I've been with MFA since then.
 |FYI The first campaign I went on can be found here: www.farmtofridgetour.com .
[What have been some of you favorite places to eat while on the road? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8ozkk6?context=5)|We hit up a lot of really good vegan and vegetarian restaurants. Green in Phoenix, Spiral Diner in Dallas, Chicago Diner in Chicago, Govinda's in Philadelphia. There are so many good places to eat all over the country. We also go to Chipotle quite a bit. We try not to make a habit of going to Taco Bell, but sometimes we are just in a hurry on our drive to the next city. You can veganize anything at Taco Bell by replacing the meat with beans and saying fresco-style. Fresco means no dairy.
[If it pops, will you just pack up and go home? Or do you have like closets of these things. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8p0q2f?context=5)|Since it is constantly being pumped with air by a blower a little hole probably wouldn't even do anything. I bet there are probably little holes in it right now that we don't even notice. If the hole is a decent size we would have to repair it.
[Does being an animal rights advocate and vegan/vegetarian ever make you feel alienated?  And if so, does it sometimes get to you and how do you deal with that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8p4426?context=5)|It used to. And I think it had a lot to do with how abrasive I was. And I think it's understandable when others are abrasive regarding these issues. The suffering is so immense and it can be crazy to see so many people participating in it. But being this way is not helpful to animals as it just pushes people away.
 |I try to not be judgmental anymore. And I try to be very encouraging of small steps others take toward veganism. I have seen more people close to me go vegetarian since becoming this way. My entire family, and many in my extended family have actually gone vegan.
[Who is your favorite volunteer EVER?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oykg4?context=5)|Haha I love you Chris! I want to come back to Orlando. It's snowing in Kentucky.
[Would you rather fight a 10 ft. tall inflatable pig or some Reddit AMA trope?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oym6r?context=5)|I tackle and body slam the inflatable pig everyday in order to deflate it when we shut down the event.
[What's your favorite kind of animal? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyles?context=5)|I'm pretty fascinated by monkeys.
[Why do you target wal mart instead of the meat suppliers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oywku?context=5)|Since Walmart has such enormous purchasing power, if they end the sale of crated pork, their suppliers will all be forced to change.
[Have you ever been harassed due to your views?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyr0k?context=5)|After having over 100k one-on-one interactions when I leafleted for Vegan Outreach I've gotten pretty good at dealing with people. If someone comes at me very antagonistic, within 2 or 3 minutes we are usually shaking hands, laughing, and becoming friends.
[Have you been to the Sioux Falls South Dakota location?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8ozsdt?context=5)|Unfortunately no. We tried to fit it into part-1 of this tour. But we had to decide to either go through ND or SD. We ended up going through ND. Hopefully we can make it through on a different campaign in the future.
[I have a question and I don't mean to be rude or offensive in any way, it's simple curiosity: If animals were euthanized humanely, treated properly and weren't subject to any form of abuse during the course of their lives up until they're turned into food for humans, would that be better? From reading some of the other comments, I'm getting that you're on a vegan/vegetarian diet. If animals weren't killed inhumanely would you still consume them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8p54vo?context=5)|That would not be anywhere near as bad as the way it is typically done today. But since there is no need to consume animals I would still not do it.
[Any other retailers we should be wary of when buying meat products?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kxrg/ive_been_touring_across_the_country_with_a_10_ft/c8oyn8r?context=5)|The investigation into the Walmart supplier did find pretty awful stuff, but the reality is that the practices done there are pretty common in the pork industry, e.g. ~80% of pig farms use gestation crates (extreme confinement), it's completely legal to slam piglets to death, castrate w/o painkillers, clip teeth, and so on. So the easiest way to ensure you aren't supporting this horrific animal abuse is to simply not eat meat.

There is far less cruelty involved. I have met many hunters over the years, especially when I used to do a lot of pro-veg leafleting, and even most of them are opposed to factory farming. But I think that since eating meat is not necessary for us to survive I still wouldn't endorse hunting.

Since the number of farmed animals suffering on factory farms is so huge, and the suffering so horrific, I see advocating on their behalf as the way for me to have the biggest bang for time and money spent.

19mdad,1,2013-03-03,I try to avoid my problems by simply not going to university and failing most of my classes ,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/19mdad/i_try_to_avoid_my_problems_by_simply_not_going_to/,"(English is my second language so I apologize in advance).

It all started when I got into a very good university here where I live, to study Economics. I've always enjoyed the subject, and I'm now very confident that this is what I want to do for my life. However, I've failed a bunch of classes, mostly because I don't show up in class. I don't know what gets to me, I hate myself for doing this, but I think I have a tendency to try to escape from my problems, besides being ridiculously lazy. It all started when I got in university and from the very beginning I didn't get along with my classmates. I don't know, most of them are nice people but I was never able to make a connection. And this was strange to me, because I'm not an antisocial person, I have a ton of friends from high school and a girlfriend for 2 years and I'm very happy with these relationships. For some reason though, I didn't make any friends in my university, started to get really isolated, and I felt really bad about it. My first semester I did ok, passed all my classes, but the second semester I failed the two most important classes. I just didn't enjoy going to class, and felt really bad. On the third semester, I decided I wanted to change schools, but I mistakenly thought I should also change majors. So I went to study Marketing in another school. That was also very bad for me, and at this point I was feeling miserable. I felt really depressed about life, but I mistakenly never saw a psychologist or something. I also don't have a good relationship with my mother, and she didn't help me. I live with her (it's the norm here in my country), and she got really mad at me, so I didn't feel supported. 

Well, I decided to come back to economics, and things started to get better (this was early 2011). I was enjoying more my classes, I started dating my current girlfriend, and was taking courses and stuff. I also started an internship which I really like, and I'm still there and people really enjoy my work. But I don't know what gets to me, I simply started to skip classes again, and said fuck it. So now I'm here, the semester starts tomorrow morning, I'm retaking a bunch of classes I had failed, and I'm having trouble sleeping. What's worst for me is what people will say about me still taking classes from the 2nd semester, and my graduation is going to be 3 years late, and only if I pass basically all my classes now. I'm very confident this semester I'm gonna change it all, and I HAVE to. I'm retaking 3 of my classes for the 5th time, and if I fail them, I get expelled. I'm very worried about it, but I'm with the right frame of mind and I want so bad to do it. I know I can. I just hope I don't get away again.

Thank you very much for reading this, I feel better already. I'm nervous, but confident. Also, what's been terrible for me is that every morning I get up, hit the snooze button and go back to sleep. I do this kind of unconsciously, and any tips for getting up would be much appreciated. Thanks again."

Obviously things like my GPA and school, but asides from that i don't really have any pertinent information IMO. I am math-econ double major and hope to intern for a bank (just to see what it is like and what not) over the summer. I have taken statistics courses, math courses, and a comp sci course, but am I to say that I have taken courses like that? Or should i instead just focus on what i've done for those classes such as but not limited to doing a regression analysis and then writing a paper about it, creating my own text based adventure, researching and writing about the trends of a given company based on their financial statements as well as investor reports (i forget the technical terms for it)? I've also worked at my dad's business as a front desk clerk among other things for the past like 4-5 years. But i don't know how that really pertains to interning at a bank or really anywhere for that matter.
TL;DR: what should i put on my resume?"
19ma6y,17,2013-03-03,Paralegal Work &amp; Education: Frequently Asked Questions (USA only),Namtara,law,https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/19ma6y/paralegal_work_education_frequently_asked/,"This post is mostly in response to the high number of inquiries this subreddit gets in regard to paralegals. With the legal job market the way it is, the interest is skyrocketing and many firms are hiring to increase caseloads without hiring additional attorneys.   

----   

**GENERAL INFORMATION**  

* **What is a paralegal? What about a legal assistant? Legal secretary?**  

They are all pretty much the same thing, with different levels of reverence depending on the title.  

A paralegal is a lawyer's right hand. Because of the insane amount of overhead in most law firms, lawyers often have to focus on efficiency as their #1 priority when handling a case. In order to avoid spending their own time on the more menial work, they assign any simpler or repetitive work to paralegals.  

This may seem demeaning, but it's far from it. Paralegals are the backbone for good lawyering. Attorneys with shitty paralegals or no paralegal are often overworked, don't make much money, or have generally unhappy clients. Attorneys with good paralegals learn to be grateful, because a paralegal that doesn't feel appreciated for excellent work will make it known or just leave.   

*  **So what exactly can paralegals do?**  

In general, paralegals can do just about everything a lawyer can do except...  
1) represent clients in court;  
2) negotiate fees;   
3) enter attorney-client relationships;   
4) offer legal advice; and  
5) join the state bar.     

*IMPORTANT QUALIFIER*: The above list varies by state, but is generally a good rule of thumb. For example, some states (like WA) allow for paralegals to represent clients in very limited circumstances or to even join the state bar after apprenticeships, without law school degrees. However, there are also specific RPCs (Rules of Professional Conduct) that explicitly state what a paralegal *can't* do, because it's anything a non-lawyer can't do.   

In short, don't do something stupid after reading this and try to blame me for getting in trouble with the law. Do your goddamn research for your state. If you can't handle that, you'll be a shitty paralegal anyway. I won't even pity you.  

* **What do paralegals do in every day work?**  

It totally depends on the size of the firm and the lawyer you work for.   

In large firms, you may work for several attorneys and have only a few specific jobs. Perhaps you'll specialize in research and spend most of your time on Westlaw, LexisNexis, or hitting the books. You could also be a drafting monkey. At worst, you could be stuck scanning and copying files, but at least you'd have a full time job.  

In a small firm, you're likely to be the glue holding everything together. You'll do intake calls, schedule meetings, draft pleadings and letters, take dictations, communicate with the courts, research, deal with calling the government, cover reception, and just about everything the lawyer needs except talking to the judge and giving advice to the client.  

The personality of the lawyer matters too of course. The more trusting and busy, the more work you get to do. The more paranoid or lax, the more the lawyer will likely take on.  

* **Do I need a license to be a paralegal?**  

To do a paralegal's work, there is no such license necessary. A license is permission from the government or an organization to do or have something.  

That said, some states are increasing their control over the industry by implementing regulations regarding the titles. These regulations are typically done through standardized tests and education requirements. *They are completely unnecessary to beginning a career.*  

That said, there are also unnecessary tests and titles you can get to make your resume better.  

* **What is a paralegal certificate?**  

A paralegal certificate is a professional degree from any higher education institution that has a paralegal program. They are usually 6 month to 4 year programs that offer training for paralegal work.  

The only programs that are reputable are ABA approved programs. There are no guarantees for any other programs whatsoever. The firm hiring you has no idea what your education included unless you have an ABA approved certificate.   

ABA approved programs train you in legal theory, legal research &amp; writing, and civil procedure. Those three are the backbone to paralegal work. If you can excel in those classes, you will be a good paralegal. ABA approved programs tend to be hands on and very thorough. They also require a few electives.  

The length of the education is not that important. ABA approved programs are typically 2 years if you don't have a 4 year degree. If you have a 4 year degree, you'll have the option to take a short program (Advanced Paralegal Certificate) since you'll have covered the general education requirements. The only difference between the two is how many electives you take. The core is exactly the same.  

The cost of your education is unimportant. I took a 3 quarter program that I could have finished in 2 quarters had I gone full time. It cost me ~$5,000 at a community college since I didn't get any scholarships. I was trained with Westlaw, was trained at a public law school library, and every single one of my teachers was an attorney teaching his or her own field. Most of the attorneys were part-time teachers because they still had their own practice. I was employed 2 months after completing the program, mostly because I procrastinated for 1 and a half months due to moving. You don't need to go to some hoity toity private school to get good training or a job.   

* **What is a Certified Paralegal?**   

If you have a paralegal certificate, you are a *certificated paralegal*. Nothing more.  

After you complete your paralegal education, you'll have the opportunity to take locally, state-wide, and national-level exams that test your knowledge regarding paralegal practices. The incentive for these exams is the ability to call yourself a particular title, such as a Certified Paralegal, Registered Paralegal, etc.  

These exams are not necessary to starting a career, and most of them require experience in order to even take the exams. However, they are good for beefing up your resume and to use as leverage for pay increases. They reflect your skill, experience, and knowledge.    

* **How to I start my paralegal career?**  

While a paralegal education and the exams for titles are great for a running start, they are not necessary to start. Look for job ads for legal assistants, legal secretaries, and receptionists. In many smaller firms, these are the exact same job as a paralegal, though receptionists obviously will also be running a front desk and in charge of the phones. The receptionist in my firm did more than I did for two months before my training was on par with hers, and only then did I start learning things she had no clue about. They will have lower pay than many paralegal positions, but they'll have room for growth and more responsibilities, especially in medium size firms in large cities. Big city jobs also tend to have great benefits from the start.  

Look high and low. Check craigslist, job websites, linked in, and ask attorneys working at paralegal programs. Network. Ask paralegals and legal assistants to lunch so you can ask them where they found work in your city. Apply for things you're under-qualified for (within reason). If they ask for 1-2 years experience in a specific field, apply anyway and learn quickly. Intern and ask questions whenever you get the chance.  

The paralegal job market is expanding, but it's still a crappy economy. Do not allow yourself to think it's easy to get a job. Work your ass off, sell your skills, and never stop learning. Learn every kind of word processor, learn Excel and spreadsheet programs, know Adobe PDF backwards and forwards, and study your state and local government. You will learn a ridiculous amount in your first two months in a paralegal job, but if you learn that stuff ahead of time, it will give you an edge.   

* **Are there any more resources you can give me?**

The [National Federation of Paralegals](http://www.paralegals.org/)  (NFPA) hosts the Paralegal CORE Competency Exam, which gives the title CORE Registered Paralegal. Their test has education minimums, but no significant experience minimums. The less experience you have, the more education required to qualify for the exam.  

The [National Association of Legal Assistants](http://www.nala.org/) (NALA), which offers the Certified Paralegal exam, granting the same title. You need either education as a paralegal, a 4 year degree and 1 year experience as a paralegal, or high school education and 7 years experience as a paralegal.  

There are other professional paralegal associations, and many states have their own associations as well. They typically offer networking, career advice and opportunities, Continuing Legal Education (impresses the boss and helps you learn a field you lack experience in), and resources if you've been swindled in the job. All of the associations typically offer membership perks and lobby for paralegals, so they're worth looking in to.  

* **This all sounds kind of boring, and this is a huge wall of text...**  

Congratulations, you'd be a shitty paralegal. If you can't handle reading this little with at least minimal formatting, you can't handle the legal profession. Apply to be a receptionist or find another career path. Go away.    

--------

**NITPICKY DETAILS**  

Because if there was a profession for bureaucrats, it'd be the legal profession.  

* **What is the point of an ABA Approved paralegal program? Lawyers don't seem to like the ABA that much.**  

An ABA approved program meets certain requirements. Those requirements are listed in the process guide on the [ABA site](http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/legalservices/paralegals/downloads/paralegalguidelines2008.authcheckdam.pdf) (WARNING: PDF).  Important requirements include:   
1) Paralegals *and* lawyers must be included on the committee overseeing the program.  
2) Any electives covering a specific legal field must teach current substantive law, not theoretical or philosophical law only.   
3) Legal research training must include electronic resources, whether online or paid legal services such as Westlaw or LexisNexis.   
4) The school must have a law library that is sufficient to teach the fundamentals of research and civil procedure. Specific requirements include up-to-date and complete state statutes, state caselaw, a legal encyclopedia, practice manuals, form books, local and state bar journals, legal dictionaries, and other relevant legal texts.   

In brutal honesty, the ABA requirements are very general and very easy to meet. The costs incurred in qualifying are often due to growing the program, since the program must have graduated students for two years, must be an independent department with a full-time head and some full-time faculty, and the school must offer financial aid services to those applying to the program. That is where the money comes in.  

Any school not willing to spend money on the program to meet those requirements is not going to spend the money on resources, faculty, or refining the paralegal curriculum. It's not a matter of ""well, they didn't pay the ABA off to get the approval, so they must have spent it on the program!"". It's that they didn't want to improve the program to meet the ABA's standards.  

* **All these job postings want 5 years experience in X field, and I don't even have a certificate yet. Why bother going to school?**  

You don't need the experience to get started. You see those ads more than any other because experienced paralegals can be picky about their job. If they want to move and have more than 5 years experience in any field under their belt, they can move to any big city in the US and find a job in less than a month. Firms may also be looking to hire another paralegal so they can expand their caseload, and paralegals are much more cost-efficient than attorneys as new hires.  

Look for jobs requiring 0-2 years experience and little to no education. They exist. Hiring rises and falls depending on a legal field's busy time during the calendar year. Don't get discouraged because the economy is crappy, but also don't get overly optimistic because paralegals are finding jobs.  

* **Why should I bother with the associations' exams and titles? Why bother with CLE?**  

Associations like NFPA and NALA are icing on the cake. They make you look better and they make your career a bit easier by letting you know what the current environment is like for paralegals. They keep you in the loop on hot topics, like the new WA law that allows paralegals to do some legal work directly for clients in family law matters. They offer CLE courses to help you learn about new fields or something that may improve your work in your current field. They cost money, but if you're shrewd about which ones you take, they're worth it. Work for a PI lawyer? Take some CLE on discovery and investigations. Work for an IP lawyer? Take some CLE on copyright law.  

Lawyers love it whenever you learn how to do something for them that they think is tedious. They like when you do something for them that they'd rather not do. They will pay you money, give you benefits, and treat you well because they hate it that much. *Learn how to do as much of that shit as you can.*  

For every lawyer that is an ungrateful asshole about it, there's other lawyers who would think you're the best thing since IOLTAs. Never work for an ungrateful asshole. Find out which ones are ungrateful by seeing how they react when you take CLEs that make you better at your job. (Important: CLEs that have nothing to do with your job don't count.)

Do you have more questions? Ask away, I'll answer them as best I can and add general questions and responses to this thread. Same for anything other paralegals wish to add or have counterpoints to. "

I have a high GPA (3.5/4) and taken tough courses outside of my particular engineering discipline.  I have four semesters (coop and internship) of field experience across two different industries.

So when I got an interview, then a second, then a third, then an offer...I jumped on it.  Now, a couple of months later, I may be getting an offer from a company I would much rather be with. 

 IF (always ""if"") I did get the offer from Company B, how would I break it off cleanly with Company A?  I don't want to burn bridges.  I liked the people there, but this other company is more in line with what I want to do.

If it matters, Company A is 12 hours driving from my family, and Company B is 3 1/2 hours away.

EDIT: and, yes, I signed saying that I accepted the first offer.  But I haven't sent a single piece of paperwork since.  I only signed the offer letter, not any of the benefits packages or other things."

19m5yz,4,2013-03-03,Going from paid intern to full time employee--How should I negotiate my starting pay?,minerva_qw,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/19m5yz/going_from_paid_intern_to_full_time_employeehow/,"About two months ago, I started as one of several paid part-time graphic design interns at a small advertising agency.  They were impressed with my work, and soon asked if I wanted to come on full-time.  

Naturally, I'm thrilled.  However, the subjects of pay, benefits, sick days, vacation time, and all the other practical topics of employment have not been discussed at all. I'm worried that if I don't bring it up myself, I will be stuck with my intern wages, so I've decided to discuss it with the owner.

All the articles I've browsed through about how to ask for a raise suggest waiting until you've been with a company for at least a year before bringing up the topic of a raise. This seems like an entirely different situation, however, since I am going from being an intern to a full-time employee.  And the wage I was making as an intern is far below what I've discovered to be the regional average for someone with my experience.  

So just to confirm--This is a reasonable situation to ask for an increase in pay, right? It feels strange, because I'm not exactly a fresh hire, but they've shown a lot of confidence in me and I do feel like I should be compensated accordingly.

And if so, what is a good way to breach the topic? It's a small, still fairly new company. Although they seem to be doing well, I don't want to ask for something they can't afford to pay me, but I don't want to undersell myself either. How can I make sure I get paid at a fair rate?

Any other tips on negotiating salary and having a general conversation about the terms of my employment? Any advice will be much appreciated!"

How Can I Start Preparing Now For a Smart, Frugal Future?",[deleted],Frugal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/19m3mt/studenttoindependent_transition_soon_how_can_i/,"After reading some of the posts here, I know you all likely have the best advice for this kind of situation. Anything would be appreciated.

I am currently a sophomore in college, living in Washington, D.C. Thanks to federal aid and my grades, my student loans are pretty low, although that will change come graduate school.

I have never obtained a job (I nearly got one during high school, but my anxiety kicked in full force and I screwed up the interview), although I am fully intent on getting one in the summer (since I again screwed up on getting internships). 

I don't have a bank account (due to having no prior source of income), nor can I drive (living in D.C., having a car is almost inconvenient).

Of course, I plan to get a license during the summer, along with a job. But I also want to start preparing for independent living now. Of course, once my four years in undergrad are done, I'm on my own and will have to get out of the D.C. area (expensive as hell here). 

To cease rambling, my basic question is how can I start the transition into frugal independent living? I do plan to live as frugally as possible, as my family has always had difficulty financially, and I want to live as smartly as possible and save as much as possible (both because I do not want to burden my family any longer and I want to save money in case tragedy strikes).

I suppose some specific questions I have are:

1.) How can I start building up credit now so I can rent an apartment once I begin living independently?
2.) Do you recommend a bank or credit union given the circumstance?
3.) What do you do to save money?

And any general advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and regardless of whether you reply or not, have a blessed day (or a great day if that suits you better).

TL;DR See Title."

19lyde,1,2013-03-03,I [20M] could use advice regarding dating and a female friend.,[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/19lyde/i_20m_could_use_advice_regarding_dating_and_a/,"Hi. 

I'm a college student (currently Junior) in a kind of weird personal situation at the moment. Honestly I'd like to get some stuff off my chest and get some fresh perspective on whether I should pursue dating. I'm not sure how best to provide context, so I'll start with a personal timeline (apologies for the length) of relevant events:

1) Around early Sep 2011 (1.5 yrs ago) I realize that I had developed feelings for a very close female friend (let's call her X). After hesitating for a couple of weeks, I ask [X] out. She is the not the first person I've ever developed feelings for but definitely the first that I ever expressed them to - because I think there's a good chance she might feel the same way about me. She gently lets me down. We remain great friends but I feel down/awkward and put a little distance between us (I stopped hanging out with her alone anymore, and stuck to only group interactions).

2) Around late Oct 2011 I begin a committed relationship with a different girl, let's call her [Y]. [Y] was pretty much all of my firsts (first date/kiss/sex/etc.) and our relationship was awesome for about a year. 

3) Around Jan 2012 (2 months after I began my first - and to date, only - relationship, with [Y]) one of [X]'s close family members passes away. [X] goes on hiatus for a year, so, I don't see [X] again until Jan 2013. I had brief e-mail contact with [X] in Jan 2012 but then I begin to develop signs of depression around Feb/Mar 2012 and abandon contact entirely for almost a year.

4) I continue dating [Y] through this. I hide signs of my depression, and close out my semester (May 2012) without failing anything. [Y] gets an internship near where I live for June-Sep 2012 (we live in separate countries as I'm a foreign student, so this is a big deal; no LDR over the summer).

5) [Y] gets minor depression from an unsatisfactory internship combined with an unfamiliar country with a different language. I support her as best as I can. She loses her housing after quitting the internship (Aug 2012), and spends the last couple of weeks with me at my parents' place (my parents are awesome). 

6) Due to differing study abroad plans, me and [Y] begin long-distance from Sep 2012. We potentially would not be able to see each other until Sep 2013.

7) I begin to get really depressed. Around late Oct / early Nov 2012 LDR contact (Skype) with [Y] becomes infrequent and then dies out. At this point I confessed my mounting depression, which had begun to snowball on me personally, professionally and academically. [Y] understands and gives me space. The relationship isn't dead, but in limbo.

8) My depression gets worse. With no one around (all my close college friends were in different study abroad locations) I slowly sink. I close out my semester but am forced to cancel my own study abroad plans. These plans would have put me in the same place as [Y] between Jan and May 2013. Instead we remain apart. [Y] manages to visit me for a weekend in early Feb 2013. We have a great weekend, but there is an understanding that our monogamous relationship is over. We part on good terms.

9) [X] came back from hiatus around Jan 2013. We only met in Feb 2013 when we wound up in the same seminar. We begin to hang out again and catch up. During the last year [X] had sent me several e-mails which I hadn't responded to (I had begun to isolate myself from almost everyone except [Y] and family when my depression manifested and still do to a degree) so it had been a while since we last talked.

10) We now hang out on a regular (almost daily) basis. [X] frequently mentions wanting to hang out with me more. She's begun to take an interest in my hobbies - she started to show up for the meetings of a small student club I run, and she ended up baking cookies with me in a communal lounge after she found out that I bake. The one seminar we have in common has begun to have small group work that we end up doing together. We've shared a lot of e-mail correspondence that began as academically oriented but became general conversation. I've kept details of my depression light, mentioning to [X] that I'm dealing with personal issues. She mentioned that her door was always open if I needed someone to talk to. 


Honestly, I feel slightly awkward around her. [X] was - and is - stunning, smart, and a wonderful person, and I'm definitely attracted to her. On the other hand, I'm still dealing with depression. Moreover, even though things ended amicably with [Y], I still feel sad, insecure and vulnerable, especially since that was my first - and only - relationship. I don't want to unload that kind of baggage on anyone, neither in a platonic nor romantic context. 

Furthermore, [X] has refused me before. I might simply be mistaking the intentions of a caring friend for possible romantic interest. She was - and still is - one of my closest friends and I'd hate to endanger that by asking her out a second time if it isn't wanted. I also doubt if I'm ready for a second relationship, esepecially since it's only been a few weeks since the ""official"" demise of my relationship with [Y]. 

So I was wondering if you had some advice, observations, or could help me decide on a course of action. Am I reading too much into small things (I probably am, damn this post is long)? Should I risk asking her out a second time? Or should I just wait for her to make a move and express overt interest if there is any? (I'm currently doing this) 

Alternatively: Is there a way to communicate all of this to her without negatively affecting how things are between us or forcing her to make a decision she may or may not want to make? The last thing I want to do is hurt her in any way.


**TL;DR** - Pondering whether to ask out a close female friend. I have asked her out before (1.5 yrs ago) but was gently let down. Since then we've barely seen each other due to outside circumstances. In that time I've been through a long-term relationship with someone else, as well as developed (and begun to deal with) depression. We've only recently begun to hang out frequently. I might be mistaking her being a good friend for signs of romantic interest.

Well like most guys here those high expectations were drowned out almost immediately, but then I started to talk to people who were no where near me, just to chat. 

This started off mostly with some American redditors who visited my page when I asked for a critique, messaging them when I'd catch them continually creeping my profile. Then I started talking to other people around Europe, because why not? 

Now I have conversations with a girl from Helsinki, and Vienna, Prague, Athens, 3 in Denmark, 2 people in the US (both redditors and both adorable and fun to talk to), one girl near where I'm from in Canada, and I just spent the night having an especially deep conversation exchanging WALLS of text with a Dutch girl in Utrecht. 

It's amazing simply knowing these people and I feel so open with them and from our conversations I feel that they're really relaxed when talking to me too. Hell, I even hooked up one girl with a possible internship with one of my previous bosses.

19qkf6,1,2013-03-05,"I have all but been offered a position, but I think I low balled myself. Need advice.",lowballin,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/19qkf6/i_have_all_but_been_offered_a_position_but_i/,"Backstory: In the fall, I interned with a small 6 employee company doing motion graphics projects and a little web design / application development for diversification into a related sector. I accepted the internship with the understanding that it was more of a trial period for a full time position which would begin at the start of the new year. I did a great job and made a fantastic impression on everyone, but towards the end of the internship it was clear that the spin-. The projects I was working on were put on indefinite hold while the company restructured. In December, I departed on mutually agreeable terms (I wanted to look for other opportunities, they couldn't justify hiring me without having a real position for me available) and have been searching / freelancing in the mean time.

One of my freelance projects was a website for said company. A few days ago, I was asked to come in for a meeting about the site, which went smoothly. Afterwards, the head of the company took me into his office and essentially offered me a position within the newly restructured company. I was not prepared for this, and the issue of minimums came up. Regrettably, I answered on the spot saying that I needed roughly 35,000 to make ends meet (which is true, although it's looking like that figure may have been a bit low since I was not considering my 1k/mo of student loans which just started) and that I was hoping for 40,000. I have been all but been offered the position for 40,000.

The position I'm being hired for is in Manhattan, and the responsibilities are essentially managing all graphic design related issues (website, print articles, social media, branding), along with managing the development of mobile apps (e.g. interface design), and possibly some software development for internal use. A large part of the role would also be writing requirements for said items and delegating tasks which I can't perform myself (e.g. heavy programming) to our freelancers.

From my research and best guess, this offer seems to be significantly below average for the position. Basing this off my general feel for salaries in Manhattan, plus some searches on job sites, along with the AIGA's design salary survey, I feel that the position *should* be offering 50-60k or more. It's a bit difficult because the role is not clearly defined in the sense that it is multiple roles. Now, it's notable that the only experience I have is said internship (besides freelancing and my degree), and that this position is slightly above my level of experience, but we discussed this and they seem to genuinely want to hire me. I certainly have the generalized skill sets (good design basis, web / technology, some programming) for the position, just not the experience to back it up.

Whats more is that I have been told by a recruiter that I should expect to make *at least* 45,000 for a job in Manhattan for someone with my skill set. All considered, I feel they should be offering me 45-50k, and I think I low balled myself by mentioning the 40k. An important factor is also that during the restructuring they let several employees go and are trying to run bare-bones, so I am uncertain what kind of salary they can really offer me. I'm kind of at a loss for how to handle this situation.

TL;DR: Company I interned for offered me a permanent position a few months later; told them 40k which they have basically offered me, but the position is more of a senior designer / pseudo-management position and should be paid around 50-60k."

2. Before May I was being paid $10 a day working the same hours under the banner of ""intern"". My duties and responsibilities went well out of the scope of ""intern"" and I have my email record to prove this. 


3. I've been working there since December 2011. 


4. Based on the companies FS, they earned a net profit of 300K+ for 2012. 


5. There are other employees in the same company (10 in total including him and his wife) that are being paid the same way. One other staff member who has been here the same time as me, has been working for 10 dollars a day since December 2011 and just recently (November) got a ""raise"" to 30 dollars a day...

Story behind weight loss, if anyone cares: Was about ~212lb at my heaviest, only 5'7, never actually expected to lose weight. When I was 16 I went to Florida (Currently living in NJ) on a 2 month internship over the summer to do coding for a security company, and while I was down there I didn't really eat much. Not because I didn't want to, but there was just about never anything good to eat. By the time I returned home everyone was shocked because apparently I had lost a bunch of weight. I was just like .... uh wut. But then I was like ""Shit, if it was that easy, might as well keep going."" I went from a ""not really eating much"" diet to a healthy living style, and the weight just fell off. It was pretty cool.

(LONG),panderr,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/19q58j/clueless_about_what_to_do_with_a_windfall/,"Hi guys. Made this throwaway because people on Reddit (other subs) know me IRL and this is something I'd rather keep to myself/family for obvious reasons. 
First of all, I hope this is the right subreddit, if not, I apologize, and hope you can point me in the right direction because I have **no bloody clue** what to do here, and am feeling very stressed and overwhelmed. *Until now, I’ve been using money like a child (earn/spend)*

As the title says, I've had a windfall of cash (inheritance) and I want to set up a plan to protect myself now and in the future. I’ve read a few PF books but I’m not quite sure how to apply them to my situation (are there any great books that are specifically about strategies for situations like this?)
My parents’ best advice has always been “don’t worry about money, you have enough” (but they did teach me to be debt free, so hooray for that). 

Here's The here's a little **background**: 

* I will be 29 in a few months, and I have some pretty serious health issues that can prevent me from working. I do have insurance but my medical bills are high (I wasn't able to work for five months in 2012 and 8K of my earned income went to medical bills after premium/deductible was paid). I'm not a candidate for disability insurance (I've had the medical issues since childhood, and when I'm working, I'm an independent contractor, so no group plans for me)

* I live in a high COL area (not exactly a choice I made; both my family and quality medical care are here, moving away to save money would be possible but it would compromise quality of life). I don't live lavishly, I have zero debt. Last year I moved in with my significant other which drove up my COL, but it is still pretty low for the area (NYC; $1200/mo goes to rent + insurance + utilities + food).

* My standard income would be about $32K if I were working full time on my own (as an independent contractor). The full time dependent jobs I would qualify for range from $20-60K in pay (my 2nd language skills can provide big bumps in pay, but jobs requiring those skills at my education level are not many). I contributed to my IRA when I could (some years I didn't make enough to contribute after my medical expenses were deducted). Right now lack of earned income is my biggest stressor (I am feeling relatively well but am having trouble finding work). I do not have a college degree/specialized training (more about that later, r: what to do with my money). 

* On my own I have just about $150K in savings. I have always been terrified about not having a safety net so I’ve saved everything I could have and put it into this stash (every gift, bonus, and 90% of my paycheck when living with my parents… we are immigrants, not strange in our culture to live with them until marriage). This is held in MMA and a few CDs at my local bank because of liquidity. I **know** this is too conservative but I don't know what to do with it and still be prepared for the worst case scenario.
*I am perfectly aware that based on this info alone, I have both an income problem and a retirement savings deficit* 

Now for the real money: *The Windfall:* **I now have about 600K sitting in my lap.**
*Not literally, though it might be fun to pretend to be Scrooge McDuck swimming in $1 bills (hmm. actually not that appealing on second thought: nasty filth on the old ones, risking paper cuts with new ones). But back to the task at hand…*

I've waited a year to do nothing with it and let it sink in before I did anything stupid with the money (thanks Suze Orman) but it still feels like an *incomprehensible* sum of money to me, that **I am scared to do anything with**


In addition to the money, I also ""inherited"" a portfolio manager. *Every. Single. Person.* in my extended (non-blood relation) “family” uses him for their retirement (four family units I know trusted him with their retirement funds and now are retired and living well, many others are using him for retirement planning).

     I've met with him several times.
     I do not like him, and am not sure whether i can trust him.
     He seems very smarmy to me, and wants to sell me on single stocks and annuities.

I don't know anything about investing, but I know it is a *bad* idea for start-up investors to do that, and while he is not, I am. The money I don’t have immediate access to has been put in tax free municipal bonds (I felt comfortable agreeing to that, and if nothing else is keeping up with inflation, while MMAs are not). I could dollar cost average a bunch of that money over funds, bonds, etc. with various return drivers, but it just all screams wrong to me (because I don’t understand it!). 

**I want to be able to understand where the money is going and what I should expect the money to be able to do for me.** (hell, I said it above, I'm scared to lose the money I earned, let alone this sum that I didn't even lift a finger to deserve, which is way more pressure).
I’ve also read (Dave Ramsey) that until you hit an absurd amount of money (he defined it at $10M iirc), that you should be able to handle it on your own (that said, I also trust the independent accountant who does my taxes with my life, but I only see him 2x a year r: income tax). 

I know it’s a *lot* of money, but it is not “I should buy a boat”/aka eff you money; I've read the ""I Have $[X] ... What Do I Do With It?!"" link and here is what I’d like to have happen with it:

* Provide me with a safety net for life (medical and living expenses when I’m really sick; help me manage my condition so I’m a fully functioning member of society, i.e. permanent full time with benefits employment, which until now hasn’t been possible). 
*  Following the above, to be able to go to school worry free: those specifics are entirely another can of worms (which major, school choice, etc.) but basically, I’d like to be able to not *have* to work through school so I could take unpaid internships, study abroad and other university related things, should those opportunities arise (obviously, if there aren’t any, a regular old retail job will be better for my currently crappy cv). 
* Eventually, I’d like to be able to put money towards the purchase an apartment (something that I didn’t think I’d be able to do in my life prior to the windfall).
* I’d also like to be able to take a vacation somewhere for a few weeks. Relax, shut my brain off and not worry about my stressors and just ENJOY things (I'm sorry if that sounds spoilt and stupid, I feel like I'm in a constant state of panic when i think about my health, income and future).


*So reddit, after all that, what should I be doing to not fuck this up?*  **Where do I begin?** 

**TL:DR;
Currently 28, low income, zero debt, some savings, ongoing medical issues.
Got a massive windfall that can seriously change my life for the better. 
I had no idea what to do with my savings before that, and now I’m totally lost.
Where do I start?**

Thanks in advance to everyone willing to contribute!

I'm a junior currently looking into possible locations for grad school, and I had a question about the age old ""don't go to grad school where you did your undergrad!"" mantra that I've heard  ever since I started school.  See, I attend Indiana University, a really overall fantastic school.  I'm a psych major, counseling minor.  In looking for good graduate schools, I have of course found plenty of supporting evidence (outside what I already have heard from the department!) that IU's masters program for counseling is one of the best (EDIT: for what I am looking for in an institution).  I have a lot of incentive to stay, then, such as outstanding internship placement, in state tuition, and the ability to get a great education.
However, should I be wary of this since I would be staying at the same school, and thus perhaps not getting the widest theoretical background?

Most of the careers advice I see for women is useless stuff like “Don’t wear a skirt above the knee at a job interview” with lots stock images of women in business suits sipping coffee in a conference room. There’s not much that actually tells women how to navigate the work world and assert themselves in the workplace.

I just got a promotion at work so I’m feeling in the mood to share what I know. We had a great thread for careers advice a while ago and I think it’s time for another one. How about we all offer 2 - 3 tips about interviews, workplace behavior, getting promotions, etc? Good experiences or bad ones? Things you’d do differently? Giving your age and/or position type and your field/general area would be helpful. If you don't have any tips, ask questions instead!

I’ll go first...


Age: 31, management

Field: media, nonprofit

* **promotions:** Be honest with your supervisor about your career goals. I would never have had the confidence 5 years ago to tell my boss I was unhappy with parts of my job (involves outside clients, nothing he can control) and that I was applying for an open position at my organization’s other location. But I did this just 2 weeks ago, and my boss said he was really glad I talked to him because he’d already noticed I was unhappy and was thinking about what he could do do to help. He told me he didn’t want to lose me so he created another position for me here, which I happily accepted. I found the confidence to tell myself I was valued, which is a struggle for people in the workplace in this bad economy, especially at small cash-strapped organizations like mine.

* **current college students:** I hire and train interns, mostly college students. All of them took the initiative to email me and say that they were interested in learning more about my organization and they would love to set up a time to talk to me. When I met with people I looked for enthusiasm, good questions, and people who had some prior work experience: summer secretarial job, Applebee’s server, whatever. 4.0 GPAs and honors classes were nice, but not essential: I wanted to know you could handle an office/collaborative environment. I love working with college students and our interns are awesome. Whenever full-time positions open up our interns always apply, and they are often our first choice because they know us and our systems. I highly recommend internships for my field if you can get them. Work experience in general while at college is crucial.

* **something I’d do differently:** there are plenty of workplaces that pay lip service to valuing employees but in reality they don’t give a shit. I stayed at that kind of place for too long and ended up being difficult to work with and bored and tired. Once I started working somewhere that valued its employees, I wasn’t afraid to invest time and energy into what I was doing. Interestingly enough I also became more assertive, and I felt no guilt about taking allowed time off or ignoring emails during evenings and weekends. At my previous employer, the more I hated my job the more I worked. I know now that the economy can change on a dime, so I want to make sure I’m having a life while I’m working in case something bad does happen.

Please share your tips and advice, and let’s get a good thread going! There’s no one-size-fits-all advice for careers and the modern workplace is hugely diverse, so please chime in.

My questions are about the 'off days'. I'll be doing a M/W/F type of training schedule starting this April, and according to the FAQ/other posts I've read, it sounds like T/Th/S/Su I should still be working out (just not running).

However, what if I am unable to schedule time 7 days a week to work out? Between juggling work, graduate classes, and an internship I am just not sure if I can guarantee that every day I'll be able to schedule in that time. How bad is it to have an actual day off with no workout?

Or what about just walking? I am/will be without a car, so I literally walk everywhere I go - usually at least 2-3 miles a day, occasionally more. Could that suffice for those 'off days'? 

I just want to be certain that I'm understanding what exactly an 'off day' means and that I complete the program the way it's meant to.

I could never admit it to him because it makes me feel like such a bad person... I get so jealous of him. Not jealous of him with other girls or anything, no, I am jealous OF HIM. 

He goes out, he has fun, he litteraly lives halfway across the world, he meets many people, he travels, he sees so many great things, he lives adventures, and he goes to places that I always DREAMT of seeing...

In the meanwhile, I am stuck at home, I had to go back to my parents' home (for some internship), I don't see my friends, I never go out, and I struggle a lot with my studies. I am living one of the worst year of my life so far (him being away not helping...), and he is probably living the best one of his. I am so jealous. I feel like I will never experience what he's living. I don't have enough money to travel, nor enough time. And I will never study abroad for a year like him. I am stuck here. I feel like a such loser compared to him... 


There is some other thing that I hate because of this... I also feel like him visiting all those wonderful places means that we will never go there... together. I mean, why would he spend 2000$ to go with me some place he already went? And I dream of us taking a trip there, discovering all those wonderful things at the same time. I am so sad that I won't ever have the chance to go there with him (there is a place in particular I have in mind, that I've always dreamt of seeing, and it's breaking my heart that I will never do that, not with him anyway)

He've noticed that I regret not being able to see the things he sees. But I joke a lot about it, I try not to make it such a big deal in front of him. I could never admit the truth. I should be so happy for him. Instead of that, I'm just being a huge selfcentred b*.tch who can't be happy for the person she loves. I feel so bad.. 

Can anyone relate to this ? How do I stop being jealous like this, and start be happy for him and mean it? I hate feeling this way, I almost feel like I don't deserve to be with him.

**TL;DR : I am jealous of my BF, who's abroad for the year, because of all the great things he is living, while I am stuck at my parents' house. I am jealous and I feel like a loser, I will never do anything that amazing in my life.**"

    Risk Control 

I'm leaning towards applying for the enterprise or risk control track, but I'm unsure of what would be the best for me. Ideally, I would like to transition in to investment banking (yes, I know this is insurance). I have to land an internship to graduate so I'm kind of throwing my eggs at as many baskets as possible right now.

I am a Junior here at FSU, and run my own Internet Marketing businesses since 2006. I have an office on S. Monroe Street, 5 minutes from campus.

We are looking for someone who can do some intern work for us, specifically with the skills in HTML, PHP, Web Design, PhotoShop, CSS, etc. This job would obviously come with pay. Some tasks would be designing pages, fixing pages, changing some minor designs for testing, etc.

If you are interested and have the neccessary skill-set, please PM me for more info! We can most likely set this up through FSU where they would recognize this as an internship/class.

Thanks,
Jake"
19pv6k,5,2013-03-05,"I think I'm turning into ""that guy"" because my wife is becoming less attractive to me [m27] due to her [f27] weight.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/19pv6k/i_think_im_turning_into_that_guy_because_my_wife/,"First, a little bit of background: my wife [f27] and I [m27] have been together for almost 5 years, and have been married for 3 years in July. We started dating in college. She had 1 semester left (fall), I had 3 (fall, spring and summer). She moved away after her semester, and I stayed in school until the summer, when I moved to the same city for my internship. During the spring/summer, she put on extra weight (think size 8 to size 12), and I didn't notice until it was very obvious. Almost her entire immediate family has weight-related health issues due to lifestyle choices, so I'm very concerned about her (one cousin just had stomach reduction surgery, her mother has had 2 knee replacements due to weight, her father is borderline diabetic, etc.).

Fast forward to this past week. Normally, I try not to think about her weight. I don't want it to become something we argue over, and I want her to know that I love her for who she is, not what she looks like. But one night something just changed. All of a sudden, the issue that I tried to not care about was almost disgusting to me. She hadn't changed any, but I had. We're normally very affectionate, but that night I started to clam up. I tried to play it off, but wasn't able to. She noticed almost immediately, but didn't say anything for a few days. Finally, we sat down and had the conversation I didn't want to have as it made her weight a factor in our emotional and physical relationship. She's understandably upset, and by the end of the conversation has called me shallow several times. Things are better now (a few days later), but things are not the same as they were. No more showers together, and no lights on in the bedroom. She also feels obligated to go to the gym when I do, even if I don't say anything about it. Unfortunately, she doesn't seem to really exert herself when she's there, so it feels like she's only there to make an appearance for me. If she's going to try and be healthier, I want her to do it for herself, not for me. I don't want this to be something she resents me for, but at the same I can't help how I feel (I've tried repressing it for years).

TL;DR: I don't want to be the asshole husband [m27] who says his wife [w27] is too fat, but at the same time I can't help that I'm becoming less physically attracted to her and it shows in our relationship, and she doesn't seem to be interested in doing anything on a serious level about it."
19puuc,3,2013-03-05,I'm beginning to regret all of my decisions...,throwawaynojob,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/19puuc/im_beginning_to_regret_all_of_my_decisions/,"I studied music at University, graduated in the Summer but I'm struggling to find a related job, even though I graduated with above average grades.

I did an internship after graduating but I was clearly being exploited (working on expenses only) and not being developed in any way, so I left.

Whilst I was studying (and interning) I was involved in a band that got hired for a lot of corporate gigs and I made some money from that. I was relying on it to pay my rent once I graduated while I started up some other bands and dedicated the rest of my time to the reason I studied music in the first place: songwriting and performing my own material.
Turns out they decided I wasn't good enough, after helping the group achieve it's current high profile status by dedicating 4 years of my hard work (at least the first half of which unpaid!) to it. Now, I have nothing.

I can't teach in schools without spending money I don't have on getting a Teaching Qualification, so I started teaching from home. It was going great for the first week, but then the 2 students I had never came back or bothered telling me they weren't gonna come back. I get inquires all the time and I reply quickly. I have lowered my rates, which were previously on par with what others in my area charge, but that hasn't changed anything. And I haven't had a student since my first (and last) two. So I started applying for any jobs...

First, I'd apply to any part-time work I could do during the day, like coffee shops or sales positions. Occasionally I'd find a good music related position, that I am more than qualified to get, and apply for that too. As the time progressed I started applying to anything at all. Today I applied to a kitchen porter job (amongst others)... which I will no doubt never even hear anything back from. After countless ads replied, application forms filled, CVs sent, I have heard from a total amount of 1 company (mobile phones, sales position), who gave me a phone interview, called back to say I was still in the run, then never called back or replied my calls or emails.

I feel like I am the luckiest person when it comes to my incredible parents, who have been helping me out financially. I know I would be in a much worse situation if it wasn't for them, but I feel really, really terribly bad for putting them in this situation, as I know they are not having the best time (financially) either, even after working all their lives.
I also have the most loving and nurturing SO anyone could hope for and I feel it's unfair that he is the only earner in our household, especially when he often struggles to make ends meet as well.


I'm so sick of feeling trapped in this stupid situation. I am hard-working. I am competent. Or maybe not? Maybe I've been wrong all this time and I'm actually shit at everything I do?

I feel so hopeless and so powerless... I don't know what to do anymore. I'm beginning to regret my decision to follow my dreams instead of studying something that I would hate, but would get me a job. I find myself wishing I could just disappear...

You're my best friend...so much so that in my sad life, I'm creepily dependent on you. I don't hang out with people from school...I work with a bunch of people 20-30 years my senior, and my siblings all have friends and girlfriends they want to spend their time with.

I get it. You have a life. I, unfortunately, don't. Between work, school, an internship, a committee, grad requirements, social anxiety disorder, and relapsing depression, I can't seem to find time, energy, and enthusiasm for a life.

So when you say in January ""we should go to Cozumel for your last spring break!"" I got my hopes up. I did. I was genuinely excited for the first time in a while. And when you came to me two weeks later and said ""there's no way I can get a whole week off for work,"" I understood.

And time goes by. And in that time, I've covered bills for you, loaned you my car for the 2 hour drives to see your girlfriend because you ""couldn't afford the gas in your car."" I've bought you food, comforted you when you were depressed, supported you when you tried to quit smoking, didn't judge you when you started up again. I've tried to be a good friend.

Then we get to last week. Last week when you told me that ""everything sounds gay coming from [my] cock-sucking mouth."" I know, I know. You were joking. But considering that the last person who made some homophobic comment to me did it with a broken bottle in my face, while you were watching, I'd have though that you would have some sense of courtesy and avoid this bullshit.

And now, tonight. Tonight you cut me off in the middle of a story to tell me about your day, when you convinced your boss to give you a week off so you could go to Cozumel. In May. With your girlfriend.

This isn't about the fact that I just paid more bills for you. This isn't about the $60 I gave you so you could schlep out to the boonies to see your girl. This isn't even about the fact that you are taking the same girl on vacation that I have spent hours listening to you complain about, after her mind games, and her habit of talking to you about her past fuck buddies, or the fact that you think she thinks your ugly.

This is about the fact that I will be spending my last spring break working in the Midwest to undoubtedly buy you more shit, and in a few months, while I'm cramming for a test so I can get a job in a field I hate, you'll be laying in the sun next to ""the girl of your dreams.""

Sad thing is, I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at me. I don't even know why, but when I think about you and your fucking vacation, I hate myself a little bit more."

If it's so fucking great, it should be worth it, right?

I just don't know what to do now. I don't want to go to college and even if, I wouldn't even know what to study. And how. And when. And why.

And there's nothing else I can do. Nobody else is offering jobs and there's no sense doing stupid internships for ages... especially since I will definitely have to move this time and I can't fucking do that if I don't get paid... I don't have a lot of money and neither does anyone else in the family. I can only do this one thing - I jsut don't have the knowledge and encouragement to do anything else. And honestly, I suck at everything else. So, there's no alternative.

I'm stuck. I wanted to go and have this job so badly. It was the first step. I can't even date without it, just because I don't feel confident enough. Heck, what if the girl of my dreams suddenly does leave her boyfriend? I can't even try to date her, living at home, not earning money and all.

Wow, the money thing. I can't afford anything. I'll have to keep my shitty clothes, can't buy games, can't do anything, really. But worst of all, I'm not gonna live on my own. That's the worst. I just want my own place, where I can do what I want after I come home from work. Have my own furniture, decoration. Make the food I want to eat. Invite people. Invite girls. 

Have a life.

I'm curious about a few of your decisions and I'd love if you'd humor me with some insight. I was going to send this as an email on the website  but then I found this subreddit and made an account just because I hope other people are just as curious as I am. 


 I was going to try to organize some of these questions by category with a little explanation, but it got difficult to still make sense , So instead I'm just going to shoot a bunch of questions and hope for any answer.  



When do you realize you were going to design a waterpipe? 


From original concept to the first consumer ready product how many different designs did you go through? Especially with the computational fluid dynamics and designing the diffusion system.  Was there always a front runner design that preformed better that you were trying to perfect or was it just pure trial and error? 


I believe precision in manufacturing was the motivation for going with acetal in the base , but I'm curious though why not a glass tube? Was the motivation to go for durability in the whole piece after the base and other parts were made practically bullet proof?


Did you guys consider looking for the best way to create a piece out of glass using engineering ? This question is my big one and one that has been eating away at me for a while. I love seeing what glassblowers can do with new types of diffusion and new percolator designs. I always wonder but can never find any sort of documentation on what makes one diffusion method better then others or even the differences between the many different types of percolators.This has always made me wonder if there is any rhyme or reason beyond aesthetics in typical glass pieces and the types of percolators they have.



Final question: You guys need an intern this summer?  
  

P.S. I'll edit this with a review once mine comes in the mail. I can't decide if I'm more excited to disassemble it then reassemble it or to actually use it.   "

Lance Spitzner, en instruktøren på SANS Institute, en Baltimore-basert garanti forskning og utdanning firmaet, anbefaler å slå på full-disk krypteringsverktøy som kommer som standard på de fleste aktuelle operativsystemer. (På Windows-baserte PCer, funksjonen kalles BitLocker, på Macs det kalles FileVault.) Aktivere funksjonen tar bare et få minutter; en gang på, det vil kryptere hver fil og programmet på stasjonen med ingen merkbar ytelse lag. Men det er en catch: krypteringen gjelder bare når brukerne er logget ut av datamaskinen. Det betyr at hackere kan fortsatt angripe gjennom virus og malware mens systemet kjører. Innstillingen datamaskiner automatisk logger etter 15 minutter uten bruk hjelper håndheve dette tiltaket.

Verste fall hvis du ikke følger disse prosedyrene? Du kryptere ikke stasjoner, men en djevelsk hacker gjør. Ved å bryte inn i nettverk og kryptere bedrifter data, har noen cyber kriminelle holdt selskaper gissel nesten, krevende en løsepenge i bytte for passordet.

Sikre maskinvaren.

Av Seattle-området-selskaper som ble hacket, hadde mer enn 40 sine fysiske lokaler som er brutt opp av innbruddstyver som tok elektronisk utstyr. I ett tilfelle nappet gjengen mer enn $300.000 i servere, bærbare datamaskiner, mobiltelefoner og andre elementer. Overvåkningskamera registrert dem ved hjelp av Håndkjerrer for å hale massevis av utstyr til en van firetimers tildelingsperioden.

Tyver som ikke er skremt av av sikkerhetsalarmer og bevegelsesdetektorer, gjør fysisk låse ned datamaskiner jobben sin tøffere. Få folk mate en kabel gjennom datamaskinens Kensington lås porten (små metall loopen funnet på de fleste bærbare og stasjonære enheter) å sikre den til deres pulten. Jada, de er relativt enkelt for en tyv å omgå, men den ekstra innsatsen kan spissen oddsen i din favør. ""Som litt tid er noe kriminelle vanligvis ikke ønsker å ta,"" sier Cullen. ""Tid er fienden for noen bryte inn i en fysiske lokaler.""

Gjøre nettverkslagring tryggere ved hjelp av Kensington-låser eller ansette mer robust løsninger, som rack-montering maskinvare og holde serveren dørene lukket og låst. Vancouver, Wash.-basert CRU-DataPort gjør flere servere som kan være sikret med låser, USB-sikkerhetsnøkler og selv isenkram-basert krypteringen, sikrer at hvis stasjoner er stjålet, vil de være ubrukelig til tyvene.

Det er også sporingsprogramvare - viktig hvis bedriften din drives av mobile bærbare i-feltet. Sporing firmaet Prey bruker en rekke metoder for å finne alt fra en mobiltelefon til en server, passord-sikring maskinen hvis den går mangler og selv knipser og sende bilder av tyven hvis den stjålne enheten har et webkamera. Lav per måned priser gjør små, skjulte programmet en må-Installer for alle enheter som kan få tilgang til data og selskapet bedriftsnettverk.

Låse nettverket.

Mange hacking ofrene er kompromittert via Wi-Fi-nettverk, gjennom en teknikk som kalles ""wardriving."" I biler utstyrt med kraftige antenner, hacker gjenger kjøre rundt byer, skanning for ulåst eller dårlig beskyttet nettverk. Når en sårbar Wi-Fi-aktiveringspunktet er funnet, er skurkene så god som i selskapets inngangsdøren, scouring maskiner på nettverket for passord og økonomiske data.

Det beste forsvaret mot utnyttelser som wardriving er å ha ingen trådløsnettverk i det hele tatt. Kablede nettverk, mens mindre allsidig, er sikrere, fordi brukere har tilgang til dem ved enten koble til fysisk utsalg eller hacking modemporter. Men hvis firmaet må ha et trådløst nettverk, kan du deaktivere funksjonen service set identifier (SSID) kringkasting på den trådløse ruteren. Dette skaper et usynlig eller skjulte nettverk, usynlig for casual Wi-Fi snoops og tilgjengelig bare for brukere med det nøyaktige nettverksnavnet. Små bedrifter som kafeer kan også gjøre dette - bare periodisk nettverkets endringsinformasjon og plassere en liten sign nær registrere deg med gjeldende nettverksnavn og passord.

Hvis du bruker Wi-Fi, kan du oppdatere det til den for nyeste krypteringen. Noen Seattle wardriving ofrene hadde aktivert Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), en enkelt sprakk algoritme som falt i unåde nesten 10 år siden, og tenkte nettverkene var sikker. WPA2, den gjeldende standarden, har en lengre krypteringsnøkkelen som er vanskeligere å bryte seg inn i. For å gjøre dataene enda sikrere, kan du opprette en tull passord med store bokstaver, tall og spesialtegn. Sier Cullen, ""De ville trenger en datamaskin jobber med det for en million år å knekke koden.""

Installere anti-malware og anti-virus beskyttelse.

Når wardrivers er vellykket i cracking et trådløst nettverk, kan de logge inn og infisere tilkoblede datamaskiner med skadelig programvare eller virus. Men det tar ikke en Wi-Fi-tilkobling for å plante denne programvaren; spam e-post og skadelige nettsteder Skyv den til datamaskiner hele tiden, og hvis innsatsen er vellykket, malware kan installere kode som kjører i bakgrunnen, fange tastetrykk og påloggingsinformasjonen og videresending det for hackere. Ifølge Verizons studie, malware ble brukt i nesten halvparten av data brudd i 2010, og var ansvarlig for nesten 80 prosent av poster stjålet.

""Det er sannsynligvis nr. 1 money-generere teknikken skurkene bruke,"" sier SANS Institute's Spitzner. ""Hver gang du besøker alle typer nettsted som krever et brukernavn og passord - Facebook, banken din, lønn, uansett - malware vil høste din informasjon og sende den til slemmingen,"" sier han. ""Skurken vil ta til høyre rundt, Logg inn som du og gjøre alle hans onde ting.""

De fleste malware installeres gjennom nettverket sikkerhet hacks, men å være årvåken om cyberkriminalitet er like mye om å forutse trusler som det er å forsvare mot dagens. E-phishing, etterligning og apps som tilgang til sosiale medier-kontoer er dukker opp med økende regularitet. Lasting anti-malware og anti-virus beskyttelse på maskiner - som går for mobile enheter samt-- og kjører det etter hver software installert kan bidra til å sikre disse truslene ikke ta. Også, holde programmer og maskinvare oppdatert--fra oppgraderer til nyere rutere og datamaskiner å umiddelbart installere nettleseren oppdaterer--blokker skadelig ormer som trives i eldre utstyr og utdatert programvare.

Utdanne dine ansatte.

Hvis en datamaskin på nettverket blir svekket--om inntrenging kom fra en intern fantasy-fotball på e-post eller via en skammelige Facebook-app som administrator HR klikket på lunsj - er hele operasjonen i faresonen. ""Du ikke skal være eneste årvåken om å beskytte din og din kundenes opplysninger,"" sier Symantecs Cullen. ""Ansatte skal være på utkikk, og du som en small-business eier bør være der for å gi dem noen retningslinjer.""

Beholde ansatte informert om trusler gjennom kort e-post eller på periodiske møter ledet av IT-ekspert. Det første trinnet, er imidlertid å skrive ut en formell company Internett policy, innstillingen akseptabel og forbudt nettbaserte aktiviteter for ansatte, en øvelse som en distressingly liten 10 prosent av selskapene følger, i henhold til Symantec/NCSA. For eksempel forhindre ansatte fra åpne e-postvedlegg eller klikke på koblinger som ikke hører til Selskapets forretning. Eller begrense personlig e-posttilgang til personlig smartphones via den ansattes trådløs forbindelse, ikke selskapet Wi-Fi.

Leie sikkerhet.

Verve ekspert utenfor kan forbedre dine sjanser til å avlede et angrep. Selv om det kan virke counterintuitive, kan små bedrifter begrense sin eksponering til cyber kriminelle ved å signere på med Internett-basert datasikkerhet leverandører--spesielt som kvaliteten på skybaserte forretningstjenester utvikler seg. ""De kan avlaste mange av byrdene som en liten bedrift, ærlig, ikke vil håndtere,"" sier Cullen, som drev sitt eget selskap før han begynte i Symantec. ""Jeg vet det var ikke noe jeg ønsket å bruke to minutter tenker.""

Men gjør leksene dine: lese leverandørens vilkår og betingelser for å avgjøre hvem som er faktisk er ansvarlig for å beskytte dine data. For eksempel, med online kredittkort-prosessorer, kontroller at de overholder betaling kortet industrien Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) krav; ellers, du kunne være på kroken for kundenes skader hvis du få hacket.

På ekstreme slutten, kan du flytte ansvar for teknologiinfrastrukturen til en administrert tjenesteleverandør (MSP) som vil opprettholde og sikre selskapets systemer eksternt. MSP vil være ansvarlig for sikkerhetskopiering av filer på sine servere, oppdatere brannmurer, kryptere data og gjør at alt er knirkefritt.

Og når ting går dårlig, det vil ta hit for skader.

Tilbake i Seattle, politiet endelig nab gruppen bak utslett av cyber tyverier. Og de gjorde det gjennom gammeldags detektivarbeid. Ett medlem av gjengen ble fanget ved hjelp av en stjålet gavekort, løftet under en office-innbrudd. Han ble arrestert på en vinbar og førte politiet til en antenne montert Mercedes, og til slutt til hans to medskyldige. Dømt sist sommer, tre nå betjener et kombinert 22 år i fengsel, og vil måtte betale oppreisning til ofrene.

""Utover svindel og fysisk skade, er det kostnader uten en prislapp: brudd på følelse av sikkerhet for sine kunder, ansatte og eiere,"" bemerket rettsforfølge U.S. advokat Jenny Durkan. Ikke å nevne drømmene om de mange gründere som ble satt ut av business.

Du har blitt hacket. Nå hva?

Advarselen tegn er klart: Hvis du ser en stor pengeoverføring skal en konto i Russland eller et annet sted der du ikke har virksomhet (i ett Seattle tilfelle, var det North Dakota), ta kontakt med banken din umiddelbart. ""Jo tidligere du identifisere en hendelse, jo mer sannsynlig vil du få tilbake pengene dine eller minimere skaden,"" sier Lance Spitzner, en instruktøren på Baltimore's SANS Institute.

Hvis selskapets datamaskiner er stjålet eller tuklet med, kan du ringe det lokale politiet. De kanskje vet om lignende hendelser, kan undersøke dypere og vil kontakte aktuelle myndigheter, inkludert FBI og Secret Service, som opprettholder en electronic kriminalitet task force. Men det viktigste, ved første tegn på alle forstyrrelse, endre din passord og hold et øye med din saldoer, fra business midler til ansatte og personlige kontoer.

19p3yy,1,2013-03-05,Negotiate an Internship Salary?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/19p3yy/negotiate_an_internship_salary/,"So I've been in talks for a Process Engineering Internship position within a Fortune 500 company, and they called this afternoon to say that they want to hire me, and to call back next morning. I assume this is to discuss salary and relocation before the initial offer, so should I try to negotiate a better offer? 

Some background: I'm one of very few candidates if there are even any others as this Internship was not ever listed on the company website, nor did they do any formal ""On-Campus Interviews"". I met a recruiter at our career fair and was called a few weeks later. After that the process went really quickly, with a phone interview, in-person a week later, and then a week after that this call. This is my only offer so far, although I have interviews planned with a few other not as good companies, and would be a great opportunity. However, I have heard that they tend to underpay their Interns (who wouldn't).

So, TLDR, would it be improper to negotiate for an Internship Salary? And would there be any risks to them withdrawing from negotiations entirely? How would I best go about this?

Thanks for all the help in landing me this offer, guys! The Fall Recruiting period didn't go so well for me but all the advice on this SubReddit really helped me out for the Spring and it paid off!"

I will be graduating with my M.S. in geophysics this May (I have a B.S. in petroleum geology) and I have been offered an amazing position as an exploration geophysicist. The company that offered me the job is giving me a 25,000$ sign on bonus and is paying slightly more than six figures with great benefits.

On the other hand I have roughly forty thousand saved up from two summer internships and all the time in the world. I would love to grab a backpack and hit the road for two or three years. My father always urged me to travel growing up, but we were too poor to do it. He said it was the best experience and knowledge a man can get. I would love to do a circuit of Europe, spend a year in India, Pakistan, and Nepal and see South America.

Anyways Amazon is a giant company so I'm guessing a few of you guys work there. I was recently offered a software development position there but I had a few questions. I'm just about to graduate and enter the workforce so this will be my first real job(not counting a previous internship). 

I know Amazon is a very innovative company but I've heard people are often driven to the ground due to so much work. Someone actually described it as a ""white collar sweatshop"". This is probably an exaggeration but just wondering if there is any truth to this.

Now I'm pretty new so I don't really know what they'll expect from me but I was wondering if anyone had any input about the work culture, etc. I have an offer from a different company that is very laid back but I feel like I should take the Amazon position career-wise as it is in my opinion an industry leader.

I'm just wondering if anyone had any input or info before I make my decision. As a new worker I'm obviously going to try hard and work hard but I'm also not sure how well I would do in a stressful environment. Just trying to get a better idea of how stingy and stressful the workplace is or am I just blowing it out of proportion. I know it's a big company so every team is going to be different but I kinda want to start my career on the right foot.

I was her very first boyfriend. Both of us are still well aware of how compatible we were for each other, we're two extremely similar people, we've never had a real argument, and we get along amazingly in person, and we've had so much fun together. Neither of us had ever met anyone so similar before and we'd never been so comfortable around anyone else before. I can go on endlessly of how grossly comfortably we were around each other and how similar we are... we truly were one. It feels awfully weird and depressing talking about this in past tense.

Anyways, I'm a senior in my final semester at a university roughly an hour away from her. Depending how busy we were with school, we'd see each other usually three days a week, so the distance was never an issue. I find travel to be extremely gratifying and I'm extremely passionate about it, but ever since I've found her I've come to the conclusion that the happiest place for me is by her side. So I've been seeking to further my career closer to her and to move in together. This has kind of a big change of plans on my behalf.

She's a self-centered advertising major, always hungry for internships, and any chance to better her marketability. She's stated that had she been in my shoes, she would be unable to reciprocate anywhere near as well as I do. Her career comes first; I come second. She feels that I'm not career-driven enough to be in this relationship and that we're only holding each other back from our true passions in life. She's inconsistent and unreliable, always changing her mind, and always unsure of her decisions. As selfish as she sounds from my description, breaking up was no easy feat for her as well.

This same argument has comes up from the depths of every little argument we end up having almost once every three to four weeks, since December or something, and this time, she's finally decided to follow through with breaking up. I'm a god at diplomacy. Every time we've had a minor or major disagreement, I've always put forth so much effort to alleviate things. I take her very seriously, and I value her as I do any best friend or immediate family member.

Sometime in January we briefly broke up over this very reason, but weren't ready to say our goodbyes just yet, and were still dreaming of a future together. As of a few days ago, we were still planning on signing a lease together. Is this a legitimate call for a break up and to cut a soulmate out of your life? What should I do? I'm really not sure what to make of it all... I still really love her."

Hvordan å beskytte små bedrifter mot en Cyber-angrep cruse associates tips and reviews

Seattle hacker kjørte en svart Mercedes. Han eide en Rolex. Han likte å hyppig en sentrum vinbar. Mens det er lett å tenke på cyber kriminelle som ansiktsløs, digital lommetyver i fjerntliggende land, realiteten er at er de blant oss. I ett beryktet tilfelle kompromittert en banditt og hans gjeng cyber crooks minst 53 Seattle-området-små og mellomstore bedrifter mellom 2008 og 2010, stjele nok data til å forårsake $3 millioner i erstatning til selskapene, sine ansatte og deres kunder.
""Dette var ikke typen kriminalitet som vi forventet,"" sa tech selskap ansatt Alec Fishburne på en pressekonferanse (der Seattle ofrene avtalt å bli identifisert, men spurte at deres bedrifter være anonym). Gjengen hacket Fishburne firmaet fra en annen kontor i høyblokk. Han ble klar over brudd etter å merke noen uvanlige finansielle transaksjoner. ""Det var svært urovekkende for en liten bedrift... å lure på om det var noen interne misligheter eller underslag skjer, sier han til pressen.
	
En annen Seattle selskapet ble hacket etter sin gamle bærbare PC var stjålet i en office-innbrudd; om en måned senere, var det overførte midler gjennom falske lønnskontoer. Et tredje offer hadde identiteten til nesten alle sine ansatte stjålet når hacker gjengen sprakk selskapets nettverkssikkerhet. ""Det er enraging, fordi du tror du har et system som er til å fungere,"" sa selskapets president. ""Disse gutta er virkelig smart og ambisiøse, og det er en tøff kombinasjon.""Bo Smart.

Au!

Designet for den gjennomsnittlige computer brukeren, denne SANS Institute e-nyhetsbrev (Registrer deg på sans.org) fokuserer på en trussel per utgave og gir folk bør gjøre for å beskytte seg. Det er en utmerket arbeidstaker bevissthet verktøy.

På minst at selskapet hadde en network security plan. Mange andre ikke. Ifølge en 2012 landsomfattende studie av små bedrifter av digital sikkerhet har fast Symantec og National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA), 83 prosent av små bedrifter ingen formell cyber sikkerhetsplan, mens 69 prosent mangel selv en uformell. I mellomtiden, 71 prosent er avhengig av Internett for daglige operasjoner, men nesten halvparten tror data hacks er isolerte hendelser som ikke vil ha innvirkning på sin virksomhet.

De kunne ikke være mer feil. Ifølge Symantec/NCSA forskning fra 2011 - den siste år med tilgjengelige--cyber-angrep koster små og mellomstore bedrifter et gjennomsnitt på $188,242, og nesten to tredjedeler av utsatt selskaper blir tvunget ut av business innen seks måneder for å bli angrepet.

Det trenger ikke å være på denne måten. Det beste forsvaret mot nettkriminalitet gjør hackere svette for sine Kandahar. Ifølge en Verizon studie av data brudd i 2011 var mer enn 80 prosent av ofrene mål av opportunity - noe som betyr at de ikke beskytte sine Wi-Fi-systemer med passord og ellers hadde dårlig sikkerhet, hvis noen i det hele tatt. Så gjør deg selv en vanskelig mål og sikre bedriften med disse seks trinn.
Å kryptere dataene.

Enten det er banken ruting sifrene, kredittkortkontoer eller Ansattes personnummer, er denne typen lang-gestating selskapet holdt informasjon hva hackere bruker å stjele penger. – Når som helst du lagrer viktige data, når dataene er i hvile - noe som betyr at det ikke er som overføres over Internett liksom--du ønsker det kryptert, sier Steve Cullen, chief administrerende direktør av worldwide markedsføring SMB og.Cloud på Symantec, som setter ut Norton anti-virus programvare.

Lance Spitzner, en instruktøren på SANS Institute, en Baltimore-basert garanti forskning og utdanning firmaet, anbefaler å slå på full-disk krypteringsverktøy som kommer som standard på de fleste aktuelle operativsystemer. (På Windows-baserte PCer, funksjonen kalles BitLocker, på Macs det kalles FileVault.) Aktivere funksjonen tar bare et få minutter; en gang på, det vil kryptere hver fil og programmet på stasjonen med ingen merkbar ytelse lag. Men det er en catch: krypteringen gjelder bare når brukerne er logget ut av datamaskinen. Det betyr at hackere kan fortsatt angripe gjennom virus og malware mens systemet kjører. Innstillingen datamaskiner automatisk logger etter 15 minutter uten bruk hjelper håndheve dette tiltaket.

Verste fall hvis du ikke følger disse prosedyrene? Du kryptere ikke stasjoner, men en djevelsk hacker gjør. Ved å bryte inn i nettverk og kryptere bedrifter data, har noen cyber kriminelle holdt selskaper gissel nesten, krevende en løsepenge i bytte for passordet.

Sikre maskinvaren.

Av Seattle-området-selskaper som ble hacket, hadde mer enn 40 sine fysiske lokaler som er brutt opp av innbruddstyver som tok elektronisk utstyr. I ett tilfelle nappet gjengen mer enn $300.000 i servere, bærbare datamaskiner, mobiltelefoner og andre elementer. Overvåkningskamera registrert dem ved hjelp av Håndkjerrer for å hale massevis av utstyr til en van firetimers tildelingsperioden.

Tyver som ikke er skremt av av sikkerhetsalarmer og bevegelsesdetektorer, gjør fysisk låse ned datamaskiner jobben sin tøffere. Få folk mate en kabel gjennom datamaskinens Kensington lås porten (små metall loopen funnet på de fleste bærbare og stasjonære enheter) å sikre den til deres pulten. Jada, de er relativt enkelt for en tyv å omgå, men den ekstra innsatsen kan spissen oddsen i din favør. ""Som litt tid er noe kriminelle vanligvis ikke ønsker å ta,"" sier Cullen. ""Tid er fienden for noen bryte inn i en fysiske lokaler.""

Gjøre nettverkslagring tryggere ved hjelp av Kensington-låser eller ansette mer robust løsninger, som rack-montering maskinvare og holde serveren dørene lukket og låst. Vancouver, Wash.-basert CRU-DataPort gjør flere servere som kan være sikret med låser, USB-sikkerhetsnøkler og selv isenkram-basert krypteringen, sikrer at hvis stasjoner er stjålet, vil de være ubrukelig til tyvene.

Det er også sporingsprogramvare - viktig hvis bedriften din drives av mobile bærbare i-feltet. Sporing firmaet Prey bruker en rekke metoder for å finne alt fra en mobiltelefon til en server, passord-sikring maskinen hvis den går mangler og selv knipser og sende bilder av tyven hvis den stjålne enheten har et webkamera. Lav per måned priser gjør små, skjulte programmet en må-Installer for alle enheter som kan få tilgang til data og selskapet bedriftsnettverk.

Låse nettverket.

Mange hacking ofrene er kompromittert via Wi-Fi-nettverk, gjennom en teknikk som kalles ""wardriving."" I biler utstyrt med kraftige antenner, hacker gjenger kjøre rundt byer, skanning for ulåst eller dårlig beskyttet nettverk. Når en sårbar Wi-Fi-aktiveringspunktet er funnet, er skurkene så god som i selskapets inngangsdøren, scouring maskiner på nettverket for passord og økonomiske data.

Det beste forsvaret mot utnyttelser som wardriving er å ha ingen trådløsnettverk i det hele tatt. Kablede nettverk, mens mindre allsidig, er sikrere, fordi brukere har tilgang til dem ved enten koble til fysisk utsalg eller hacking modemporter. Men hvis firmaet må ha et trådløst nettverk, kan du deaktivere funksjonen service set identifier (SSID) kringkasting på den trådløse ruteren. Dette skaper et usynlig eller skjulte nettverk, usynlig for casual Wi-Fi snoops og tilgjengelig bare for brukere med det nøyaktige nettverksnavnet. Små bedrifter som kafeer kan også gjøre dette - bare periodisk nettverkets endringsinformasjon og plassere en liten sign nær registrere deg med gjeldende nettverksnavn og passord.

Hvis du bruker Wi-Fi, kan du oppdatere det til den for nyeste krypteringen. Noen Seattle wardriving ofrene hadde aktivert Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), en enkelt sprakk algoritme som falt i unåde nesten 10 år siden, og tenkte nettverkene var sikker. WPA2, den gjeldende standarden, har en lengre krypteringsnøkkelen som er vanskeligere å bryte seg inn i. For å gjøre dataene enda sikrere, kan du opprette en tull passord med store bokstaver, tall og spesialtegn. Sier Cullen, ""De ville trenger en datamaskin jobber med det for en million år å knekke koden.""

Installere anti-malware og anti-virus beskyttelse.

Når wardrivers er vellykket i cracking et trådløst nettverk, kan de logge inn og infisere tilkoblede datamaskiner med skadelig programvare eller virus. Men det tar ikke en Wi-Fi-tilkobling for å plante denne programvaren; spam e-post og skadelige nettsteder Skyv den til datamaskiner hele tiden, og hvis innsatsen er vellykket, malware kan installere kode som kjører i bakgrunnen, fange tastetrykk og påloggingsinformasjonen og videresending det for hackere. Ifølge Verizons studie, malware ble brukt i nesten halvparten av data brudd i 2010, og var ansvarlig for nesten 80 prosent av poster stjålet.

""Det er sannsynligvis nr. 1 money-generere teknikken skurkene bruke,"" sier SANS Institute's Spitzner. ""Hver gang du besøker alle typer nettsted som krever et brukernavn og passord - Facebook, banken din, lønn, uansett - malware vil høste din informasjon og sende den til slemmingen,"" sier han. ""Skurken vil ta til høyre rundt, Logg inn som du og gjøre alle hans onde ting.""

De fleste malware installeres gjennom nettverket sikkerhet hacks, men å være årvåken om cyberkriminalitet er like mye om å forutse trusler som det er å forsvare mot dagens. E-phishing, etterligning og apps som tilgang til sosiale medier-kontoer er dukker opp med økende regularitet. Lasting anti-malware og anti-virus beskyttelse på maskiner - som går for mobile enheter samt-- og kjører det etter hver software installert kan bidra til å sikre disse truslene ikke ta. Også, holde programmer og maskinvare oppdatert--fra oppgraderer til nyere rutere og datamaskiner å umiddelbart installere nettleseren oppdaterer--blokker skadelig ormer som trives i eldre utstyr og utdatert programvare.

Utdanne dine ansatte.

Hvis en datamaskin på nettverket blir svekket--om inntrenging kom fra en intern fantasy-fotball på e-post eller via en skammelige Facebook-app som administrator HR klikket på lunsj - er hele operasjonen i faresonen. ""Du ikke skal være eneste årvåken om å beskytte din og din kundenes opplysninger,"" sier Symantecs Cullen. ""Ansatte skal være på utkikk, og du som en small-business eier bør være der for å gi dem noen retningslinjer.""

Beholde ansatte informert om trusler gjennom kort e-post eller på periodiske møter ledet av IT-ekspert. Det første trinnet, er imidlertid å skrive ut en formell company Internett policy, innstillingen akseptabel og forbudt nettbaserte aktiviteter for ansatte, en øvelse som en distressingly liten 10 prosent av selskapene følger, i henhold til Symantec/NCSA. For eksempel forhindre ansatte fra åpne e-postvedlegg eller klikke på koblinger som ikke hører til Selskapets forretning. Eller begrense personlig e-posttilgang til personlig smartphones via den ansattes trådløs forbindelse, ikke selskapet Wi-Fi.

Leie sikkerhet.

Verve ekspert utenfor kan forbedre dine sjanser til å avlede et angrep. Selv om det kan virke counterintuitive, kan små bedrifter begrense sin eksponering til cyber kriminelle ved å signere på med Internett-basert datasikkerhet leverandører--spesielt som kvaliteten på skybaserte forretningstjenester utvikler seg. ""De kan avlaste mange av byrdene som en liten bedrift, ærlig, ikke vil håndtere,"" sier Cullen, som drev sitt eget selskap før han begynte i Symantec. ""Jeg vet det var ikke noe jeg ønsket å bruke to minutter tenker.""

Men gjør leksene dine: lese leverandørens vilkår og betingelser for å avgjøre hvem som er faktisk er ansvarlig for å beskytte dine data. For eksempel, med online kredittkort-prosessorer, kontroller at de overholder betaling kortet industrien Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) krav; ellers, du kunne være på kroken for kundenes skader hvis du få hacket.

På ekstreme slutten, kan du flytte ansvar for teknologiinfrastrukturen til en administrert tjenesteleverandør (MSP) som vil opprettholde og sikre selskapets systemer eksternt. MSP vil være ansvarlig for sikkerhetskopiering av filer på sine servere, oppdatere brannmurer, kryptere data og gjør at alt er knirkefritt.

Og når ting går dårlig, det vil ta hit for skader.

Tilbake i Seattle, politiet endelig nab gruppen bak utslett av cyber tyverier. Og de gjorde det gjennom gammeldags detektivarbeid. Ett medlem av gjengen ble fanget ved hjelp av en stjålet gavekort, løftet under en office-innbrudd. Han ble arrestert på en vinbar og førte politiet til en antenne montert Mercedes, og til slutt til hans to medskyldige. Dømt sist sommer, tre nå betjener et kombinert 22 år i fengsel, og vil måtte betale oppreisning til ofrene.

""Utover svindel og fysisk skade, er det kostnader uten en prislapp: brudd på følelse av sikkerhet for sine kunder, ansatte og eiere,"" bemerket rettsforfølge U.S. advokat Jenny Durkan. Ikke å nevne drømmene om de mange gründere som ble satt ut av business.

Du har blitt hacket. Nå hva?

Advarselen tegn er klart: Hvis du ser en stor pengeoverføring skal en konto i Russland eller et annet sted der du ikke har virksomhet (i ett Seattle tilfelle, var det North Dakota), ta kontakt med banken din umiddelbart. ""Jo tidligere du identifisere en hendelse, jo mer sannsynlig vil du få tilbake pengene dine eller minimere skaden,"" sier Lance Spitzner, en instruktøren på Baltimore's SANS Institute.

Hvis selskapets datamaskiner er stjålet eller tuklet med, kan du ringe det lokale politiet. De kanskje vet om lignende hendelser, kan undersøke dypere og vil kontakte aktuelle myndigheter, inkludert FBI og Secret Service, som opprettholder en electronic kriminalitet task force. Men det viktigste, ved første tegn på alle forstyrrelse, endre din passord og hold et øye med din saldoer, fra business midler til ansatte og personlige kontoer.

I am deciding between, University of Toronto, McGill, Queens and University of Western Ontario, all for first year general engineering.

First of all, how important is prestige when getting an undergrad? I've read that most curriculums are very similar, and when it's all said and done, an employer will care more about your experience than your university. At the end of the day everyone gets an undergrad degree, the school's prestige is only taken into consideration for graduate studies. Is there any truth to this? Will I be held back looking for internships or graduate work if I attend Queen's over U of T?

Additionally, what do you know about each of the schools? I'd rank them UofT, McGill, Queens and Western. (I know Western isn't in the same class, but I chose it for a dual degree option). Are these schools all solid choices, what is the engineering industries opinion of them?

U of T is ranked very highly, and McGill is also considered to be quite good. How do the higher rankings translate into the actual undergrad program? Do you notice better labs/equipment and teaching at UofT, or does it just have better research and more respected profs? Say I choose Queens or a lower ranked school, will I use similar labs and have comparable lectures?

And if you have any experiences with these schools what should I know about them?

You're my best friend...so much so that in my sad life, I'm creepily dependent on you. I don't hang out with people from school...I work with a bunch of people 20-30 years my senior, and my siblings all have friends and girlfriends they want to spend their time with.

I get it. You have a life. I, unfortunately, don't. Between work, school, an internship, a committee, grad requirements, social anxiety disorder, and relapsing depression, I can't seem to find time, energy, and enthusiasm for a life.

So when you say in January ""we should go to Cozumel for your last spring break!"" I got my hopes up. I did. I was genuinely excited for the first time in a while. And when you came to me two weeks later and said ""there's no way I can get a whole week off for work,"" I understood.

And time goes by. And in that time, I've covered bills for you, loaned you my car for the 2 hour drives to see your girlfriend because you ""couldn't afford the gas in your car."" I've bought you food, comforted you when you were depressed, supported you when you tried to quit smoking, didn't judge you when you started up again. I've tried to be a good friend.

Then we get to last week. Last week when you told me that ""everything sounds gay coming from [my] cock-sucking mouth."" I know, I know. You were joking. But considering that the last person who made some homophobic comment to me did it with a broken bottle in my face, while you were watching, I'd have though that you would have some sense of courtesy and avoid this bullshit.

And now, tonight. Tonight you cut me off in the middle of a story to tell me about your day, when you convinced your boss to give you a week off so you could go to Cozumel. In May. With your girlfriend.

This isn't about the fact that I just paid more bills for you. This isn't about the $60 I gave you so you could schlep out to the boonies to see your girl. This isn't even about the fact that you are taking the same girl on vacation that I have spent hours listening to you complain about, after her mind games, and her habit of talking to you about her past fuck buddies, or the fact that you think she thinks your ugly. 

This is about the fact that I will be spending my last spring break working in the Midwest to undoubtedly buy you more shit, and in a few months, while I'm cramming for a test so I can get a job in a field I hate, you'll be laying in the sun next to ""the girl of your dreams.""

Sad thing is, I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at me. I don't even know why, but when I think about you and your fucking vacation, I hate myself a little bit more.

It's all for fun and glory. For the details and how to enter, I'll copy you the email sent out by the coordinator:

Well, here we go again. It’s time to celebrate college basketball’s craziest stretch with the planet’s zaniest picks contest. For the 12th consecutive year (except the one we skipped), The Jerome is ready to take over your life.

What started as three guys picking games for beer money has grown to regularly include more than 200 folks. We've gone from the TAAC to Twitter, from Carmelo to Oladipo. Lifers could have picked TCU to win the WAC, Conference USA, the Mountain West, and now the Big XII.
Somehow, Rick Barnes has coached Texas this entire time.
 
How does this work? Glad you asked. The object of The Jerome is to select winners in 30 of the Division I men's college basketball conference tournaments contested between March 5 and March 17, 2013. You pick one team per league and earn points based on how far your squad advances. Again, please select ONE team for each league.
If your team reaches its tournament final, you earn two points. If it wins the tourney, you win three more points, for a total of five. There’s a chance for bonuses, too. Any selected winner that 1.) Entered its tourney seeded third or lower, AND 2.) Plays no more than two conference tourney games on its home court, gets you an extra two points. In the case of conferences that seed by division finish, all teams except the No. 1 seeds in each division will be eligible for the bonus. So, you can earn a maximum of seven points in some of the tournaments. Bonus points do not apply for teams that make the finals and lose.
Now, the hard part, especially for you deadline types:

By Tuesday, March 5 at 6 p.m. (EST), we need your selections for the America East, Atlantic Sun, Big Sky, Big South, Colonial Athletic, Horizon, Metro Atlantic, Missouri Valley, Northeast, Ohio Valley, Patriot, Southern, Summit, Sun Belt and West Coast.
 
Our Jerome interns have created an upgraded form to make your first-batch selections. You can access said form here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1hqQaerckavIX5zzKFJ7pU4teTpfIDDwXvzGNkEChziA/viewform

Questions about or problems with the form can be addressed by writing to this e-mail address or tweeting at the interns (@SendIt_Interns).
 
By Monday, Mar. 11 at 6 p.m. (EST), I'll need picks for the remaining 15 leagues -- Atlantic Coast, Atlantic 10, Big East, Big Ten, Big 12, Big West, Conference USA, Mid-American, Mid-Eastern Athletic, Mountain West, Pac-12, Southeastern, Southland, Southwestern Athletic, and Western Athletic.

With the second batch of picks, we also need you to send us tiebreakers. Here’s what we need for that:
Tiebreaker No. 1: Total number of conference tourney wins for the following teams — Oklahoma, Michigan, Notre Dame, Miami, Fla.
Tiebreaker No. 2: Total number of conference tourney wins for the following teams — Tennessee, Arizona State, Colorado State, LaSalle
Tiebreaker No. 3: The leading individual scorer (most total points) in the 15 conference tournaments in the second batch of picks.
Please send one name, not one name per conference.
 
We will send another form soon for the second batch of picks and the tiebreakers.
Please send all questions and selections to me, Dave Curtis, at this e-mail address (senditinjerome@gmail.com). You can also get me on Twitter at @TheJeromeXII. All decisions I make in regards to any matters Jerome are final.
If you’re going to join us, please follow us on Twitter, as we will distribute most information through that medium.
Best of luck to all.

This was the only place I can honestly say I liked all my coworkers, and liked what we did as a company, and our day-to-day operations. Sure, there were times when we all wanted to kill each other during the Holidays, but it's stressful work. Even if I was ever mad at a manager that never gave me concrete advice, or sellers that had no respect for their clientele, or customers that were assuming and had zero respect for hard earned money. I loved them all at least once during my job. At least it wasn't McDonalds where hardly anyone respects your service. At least I wasn't picking up dog shit for a boss with anger issues and a coworker that insists there is only one way to do things right. At least I wasn't cold-calling people that told me to kill myself. 

But regardless, it's gone now. Your demands for this ""internship"" were entirely feasible, but just not for my company. And even when you insisted they could be swayed as they had been before, my company insisted they wouldn't change their mind and never had before. So I listened to you and didn't quit up until my manager told me that it was absolutely impossible. After I gave in my two weeks, then is when you found the time to contact HR and realize they were right all along. 

So now I'm without a job, and if I don't find another ASAP I'll be out of this class.

So seriously, fuck this college. Fuck college entirely. Drop out and do something to benefit a person or group rather than pour money into the pockets of wealthy nobodies. They get rich, you get debt and a piece of paper to prove it."

19ojlw,44,2013-03-04,Discussion on the Growing Need for a Masters Degree in Accounting,potatoriot,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/19ojlw/discussion_on_the_growing_need_for_a_masters/,"This is a long read, but for those of you currently in school, I feel this issue needs to be discussed with the extent of advice given here about how to achieve the 150 hours. As some of you know, I currently work in public accounting with a regional firm, but I also am very active with recruiting in the southeast. I work closely with recruiters from all of the Big 4, as well as the national and regional firms in my area. Being CPA eligible and becoming a CPA is beginning to no longer be enough anymore.

The consensus I have come to for my region (population over 5 million) is that some of the Big 4 are now starting to require Master degrees of an MTx/MPA/MAcc/IT Audit/Forensic Accounting for entry level positions in the Audit and Tax practices, while others are favoring those with these degrees. This is just starting to develop, however with the growing number of higher education students, Bachelor degrees are starting to lose their value and I have no doubt this situation will continue to rise. With the economy being weak the last several years, more students have been targeting degrees that give them financial security, which has created an influx in Accounting majors, making the field much more competitive.

That being said, with more Accounting students for the firms to pick from, they are able to increase their hiring standards. The Big 4 have begun to be able to set their standards of only accepting Graduate students for full-time positions and offering internships only to those intending to pursue Masters degrees while still being able to meet their hiring quotas.

**Here's the Pros and Cons I see with going the route of a Masters degree:**

***Pros***

* Allows for the highest level of recruitment opportunities. Firms target graduate programs harder than anywhere else and are focusing on hiring students with more education.

* Creates expert knowledge in your field, allowing you to jump-start your career with a higher knowledge base.

* MPA/MAcc Students - Prepares you for the CPA exam which greatly reduces study time necessary to pass each part.

* Increases promotion ability and demand for a higher salary, ends up paying for itself and more over time.

* Distinguishes your name, increasing your credibility and ability to promote yourself to employers and clients (You're not just John Doe, CPA...you're John Doe, CPA, MTx). Clients will feel extra secure as well as feeling they are receiving more value knowing your advanced education accomplishments.

* Networking opportunities - You will meet other highly devoted individuals in similar situations, work hard together through the program, and create long lasting professional connections in the field that can benefit you in the future.

***Cons***

* The cost.

There is a significant number of benefits towards doing a Masters program, and the only real factor I see against it is the cost. However, most people don't seem to realize that there are ways to fight the cost of Graduate school. If you are determined to be active on campus, particularly in the Accounting program, you can work your way into becoming a GRA or GA and have tuition waived by the school. There are tons of scholarships out there as well that most people don't bother applying for. You wouldn't believe what the scholarship award rates are due to students not bothering to apply. Some scholarships are awarded to as many as 40-50% of those that apply.

So, those of you who are currently undergraduate students, this is something to take into consideration. Getting a double major or taking community college courses to hit the 150 might seem beneficial now, but you need to consider what is the appropriate investment for the long-term. Do you want to take that avenue to reach 150 hours and later realize you want to go back for your Masters degree anyways? With the costs of education continuing to rise, this is something that requires serious thought. In decades past, education wasn't very expensive and it wasn't a big deal for a professional in the field for 10-15 years to decide they want to get their Masters. Today, it's a serious investment and something you may not be able to afford later in your career.

For those of you in the public accounting field and active with recruiting, I'd like to hear your input for your regions as well. I think mainly Big 4 are the only ones actually restricting positions to Graduate students, but I have noticed many firms are prioritizing their hiring towards Graduate Students over the Undergraduates with 150 hours."

My background is mostly architecture, VLSI/digital circuits, and software at this point. Now, I interviewed for the position and got the job - it was obvious I didn't have much background in board level stuff, trust me - so I'm not overly concerned. I'd still like to learn the basic concepts to hit the ground running this summer, though.

I've been looking at board design/high speed digital books, and most of them seem pretty heavy. I looked at the [black magic/johnson book](http://www.amazon.com/High-Speed-Digital-Design-Handbook/dp/0133957241/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_y), and he describes that as an ""advanced reference for experienced designers."" It sure reads that way too. Another one called [Signal Integrity](http://www.amazon.com/Signal-Integrity-Designers-Vikas-Shukla/dp/0982136900) looks okay, but has some poor reviews.

Anyone have anything better or any other advice?

I know they have NSERC awards in the summer, but I'm going to be busy with an internship this summer and won't be able to work full time. 

Can I get research experience working just weekends over the summer? I really want to decide whether or not to apply to grad school by the end of the summer, and I figure getting some research experience is the best way to figure it out! But I'm not really sure where to start...

Any tips/advice would be appreciated! :)"

I went to work for the first time since getting sick two weeks ago. It was boring as usual but at least I got caught up. Then I went to class. I realized that it was sad that I didn't even know what the room number for the class when we're three weeks away from finals. Whoops! Oh well, at least I actually went and I understood pretty much everything that was going on. I stopped smoking as of yesterday. I'm mainly just thinking about it a lot. I hope this'll continue and I'll just stop thinking about it all together, but I fear I will also develop a few signs of physical withdrawals. 

I've had to eat: a burrito bowl (healthy version) and some saltines. Wow, it seems like I've eaten more than that but I guess I haven't. I need to stop eating the saltines though...they may taste good but they're empty calories. 

Currently, I'm sitting in the library. I plan on eventually getting around to studying (studying? what's that?!). Hopefully I get a good 2 to 3 hours in and it helps me on catching up with my Macro work. And I just got back from the bathroom. I ended up slamming my head into a door while I was in there. Good times!

After that, I plan on going home, changing, lounging around a bit, being awkward around people as usual, and then going to the gym. Hopefully I'll be able to do the stair master when I get there. I really hope it's open this time. It never is! They need more than just two stair master machines that work. Oh well. I'll probably spend an hour and a half to two hours total (including walking there, working out, walking back, and showering). 

Then I'll go ahead and settle down and work on grading the essays I need to grade for my peer review bullshit. It's annoying but whatever. I'll get over it I'm sure. After that, I'll work some more on the final draft of my own essay, with ample break-time in between. 

I'll finish up my tasks for the day by filling out applications for the internships due in April, and hopefully starting a cover letter for my top internships. 

To wrap up the night, I plan on listening to more calming music to help me relax and sleep. It worked out really well last night, so let's hope it does tonight as well! Whenever I find things like this to help me sleep my body tends to change and the remedies I come up with are no longer effective.

Obviously, the University of (State) college is a better pick academically, and it's not one of the more prestigious schools, but it is in the top 100 Nation's Best Universities. It's at a much higher tier than the State University, which is not even on the top 100 list. 

I'm a junior and I've transferred schools twice already. I didn't really want to go to college after high school, so I was accepted to a college and didn't do well - my GPA plummeted. Regardless, I did significantly better as the semesters went on - even made it to Honors (4.0 GPA that semester). I transferred to the State University and I liked it there. It was in the heart of a big city, so naturally there are a lot of corporations, companies, opportunities and internships around there. 
It would be significantly easier to find a full-time or part-time job while studying just because of the sheer location. On the other hand, I'm currently attending the University of (State), where it's in the middle of nowhere and since it's a college town, I feel like I'm in a college bubble. I feel like I'm not really gaining any real world experience, and I don't fit well into the college town atmosphere. I don't like cliques, and I'm big on diversity. There's less of that here. The State University is also closer to home so I can look after my mother (who is pretty much alone at this point) if needed, and it's cheaper. The University of (State) is an hour + drive away.  


My question is - is it even worth it at this point to transfer back to the State University? Life here has made it absolutely miserable for me, and I've tried to be social, but many people have already made their ""groups"" freshman year. I've been sucking it up for a semester, but I don't think I'll be happy with another 2 years to go (that's how long it'll take to finish what I'm going for). I'm also concerned with just how it'll look on a future resume. Will a State University and University of (State) make me get or lose a job even if I work really hard and have a good GPA? I made a full, lengthy and drawn-out list of pros and cons if anybody is interested. There's too much detail to put all of that in one post. "

I didn't get the job. 
I have a BA from a very prestigious university, was top in my class, completed internships, have traveled ALL over the world, can use the whole enchilada of Microsoft products (except for CRM and Sharepoint) and guess what? NO INTERVIEWS. 
I realize that I have a BA, can't program, and wasn't smart enough to get an engineering degree and am consequently less than dirt, but is it too much to ask to work as a  secretary?? My mom got a job as a secretary right out of high school having only babysat and worked a summer at Dairy Queen before that. I realize times have changed, but come on. Don't you people think you're being a LITTLE bit ridiculous? Now to get a job like that, I'll have to spend more time and more money at school just to be qualified to get someone's coffee, answer phones, file papers and use Microsoft Office. 
I'm not asking to be a corporate hot-shot or anything, just a job where I can actually sit down between the hours of 9am and 5pm and not have to be verbally abused by customers on a daily basis would be nice. But apparently, I and the hundred and fifty other BAs I know are not good enough for you people, so I suppose even that small ambition is too much to ask. 
Even if you people think we're unqualified, here's an idea: TRAIN us. Oh wait, my bad. I forgot. Training costs MONEY and god forbid you spend any for that purpose. Better just let the lackeys attempt to read your minds as to what you're all looking for than to actually invest any hard-earned, precious company assets to mould the next generation of your employees. If we weren't intelligent enough to be engineers and doctors, we automatically won't be intelligent enough to learn how to juggle phone lines, file papers and be professional.
 How the hell do you expect to get applicants with 3-5 years' experience if none of you will give new graduates the chance to GET any experience in the first place?!? I work in retail, and all of my coworkers are BAs, lab technicians, accountants and teachers and guess what? They're not good enough for you people either. 
You must be waiting for the Rapture or something, so that you can all scramble all over yourselves to hire Jesus and the Archangels to answer your phones and run your lab equipment and teach your children. Because after a year of trying to be good enough for you people, that's the only conclusion I can come to. If it was just ME who was fed up, I would assume that, well, it's just me. But it's not. It's HUNDREDS of us. And we're angry. And underemployed. And historically, that's been very dangerous for societies. 
Sorry if this rant makes no sense, but I'm seriously fed up with corporate hiring managers expecting applicants to present a resume on a gold platter. It's not even like I'm applying for jobs for which I'm not qualified. I check the qualifications very carefully before applying and make sure I meet all of them. But it's like I'm sending my resume into a black hole. 
Are any of you out there looking for work? How long have you been looking? Want to share your frustrations? 
Are any of you reading this hiring managers? What exactly are you looking for in your employees? Because I'm really at my wit's end. 

TLDR: Can't find a good job despite being qualified, frustrated and angry. Other job seekers and hiring managers, please share your thoughts. "

I've heard back from some places, including some very big names, but not nearly as many as I'd like. The main problem with my resume is lack of a true internship, I'm trying to make it represent my skill set the best it possibly can to get past the HR filters.

I usually come across very strong in an interview. I'm personable and have advanced knowledge of data structures, algorithms and other common interview areas. Frankly, I think I have potential to be a really great developer. It really burns me to keep getting rejection emails for jobs that I seem to fit the bill for, and honestly know that the employer is missing out by not looking at me.

For instance, one place sent me a programming challenge, I got the answer and with right Big-O sort of algorithm, there micro-optimizations that could be made, which I found out about only after I researched the problem(after completing it), but for never seeing it before my solution was very well thought out and showed a good use of data structures. I never heard back for some unknown reason. 

Another place sent a set of interview questions on one of those job quiz sites saying ""we just want to know about your thought process"" and proceeded to ask factual questions about java,sql, and hadoop- I don't even claim to know Hadoop and they said it was for an entry level position,wtf? I mean I don't want to work for a place that thinks asking ""how do you write the syntax of this sql query?"" is a valid or interesting measure of candidate anyway.

I may be artificially limiting myself, because I don't apply to any front-end web jobs that seem to be so prevalent right now. But I have no fucking interest in Javascript/Jquery/css/UI/UX and all that, its simple boring work to me and plenty of people can without a CS degree can do it.

How can I convince real technology companies that I'm top notch? I've done interesting projects that push boundaries in a real algorithmic sense, may be publishing a paper on one. I've gotten a high GPA, I have a very strong grasp on the entire body of knowledge that goes into a CS degree. I know I sound arrogant but I really think I should be doing better than fighting over Java jobs to make a web server talk to a database with people who never had an original thought it their life.

Basically, I think I'm pretty damn good when it comes to CS, how can I make my resume portay that and get to the point where I can be evaluated by people who will see how good I am?"

Here's what went down.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/19slv1/i_recently_got_a_job_at_amazon_heres_what_went/,"As stated in the title, I recently (2ish weeks ago) accepted a job at Amazon.  I thought some of you might be interested in how that happened.  

In January, there was an event called CUSEC (Canadian Undergraduate Software Engineering Conference) held in Montreal.  This was a 3 day event that included presentations, coding competitions, speakers and a career fair.  At this career fair, I met recruiters from various companies (Microsoft, Morgan Stanley,..etc).  After briefly speaking with the Amazon recruiter, I was referred to one of the Amazon engineers also standing at the booth.  I spoke with the engineer for a few minutes, at the conclusion of which, he asked if I would like to do a small impromptu ""technical interview"".  The problem he gave me was mildly challenging and had both naive and optimized solutions. I gave both solutions and explained the differences between them.  After a few minutes of discussion, he took down my information and told me that Amazon would be in touch.

I didn't think much of it at the time.  The recruiters were seeing hundreds of people per day and, while I did think my solution was alright, it was nothing special.  Three weeks later, to my surprise, I received an email from another Amazon recruiter requesting that I attend an interview at their Seattle office.

I was pretty stunned.  After my brief encounter at the career fair, I thought that they MIGHT contact me for a phone interview but that would probably be it.  To be immediately asked to fly out to Seattle was a bit of a shock.  I confirmed that I would be attending and patiently awaited the date of my interview.

The interview itself was very coding heavy.  I can't really go into specifics but, by the end of the 5-6 hour interview, I was exhausted.  At that point, I honestly did not think very much of my performance.

Two days after returning home (on my birthday, no less) , I received and email stating that Amazon was going to extend me an offer. Again, I was stunned.  I have been rejected by a few other companies after having performed (in my opinion) much stronger interviews.  Long story short, I accepted the offer.

Now comes the part that might encourage some of you.  My GPA is nothing special.  I have a 3.1.  I do not have any interesting side projects to speak of.  However, I do have 2 short internships under my belt.  I hope this story helps, in any way possible, to those of you that will be soon graduating.  

tl;dr - 3.1 GPA dude with no side projects but some internships gets offered a job at Amazon

19siqs,7,2013-03-06,I (21M) can't stop thinking about relationship with girl(20F) who broke my heart,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/19siqs/i_21m_cant_stop_thinking_about_relationship_with/,"Reddit – I need your advice and wisdom. Thank you in advance for taking the time to read my story.

My freshman year of university, I became best friends with a girl. Initially I wasn’t attracted to her and viewed her only as a best friend (we shared a lot in common and laughed often together), but I realized I was falling for her at the end of freshman year, and asked her out. It was a powerful, intimate relationship from the beginning, as we knew each other well and were comfortable with each other from being best friends for a year.

Fast-forward to sophomore year. We dated throughout sophomore year, and although the new-relationship thrill had faded a bit, it was still a great relationship filled with trust, love, respect. To put it simply, we were in love. However, I would be dishonest without mentioning the fact that towards the end of the year, a big part of me wanted to experience single life and its freedom, and sex with other girls. Perhaps a case of the grass being greener on the other side? You decide.

At the end of sophomore year, another summer was approaching, and while I was staying at the university taking classes, she was doing an internship in North Carolina where she knew literally no one. We wouldn’t be able to visit each other, but we planned to Skype/call and she had told me she wanted to stay together over the summer.

When she actually got to North Carolina for the internship in late May, she was miserable. She knew no one and called me crying on the phone. I comforted her, told her everything was going to be OK and to try and make new friends. Over the next few weeks, she grew increasingly distant towards me, responding to my texts/calls less frequently, not saying I love you back, stuff like that.

 One day, just a few weeks after her internship had started (early June), she called me and told me that she had cheated on me. I was taken aback, hurt, and broke up with her over the phone. She made no attempt to salvage the relationship, texted me saying that it was too hard to be apart, wanted to keep in touch over the summer, and that we could “see where we were at in the fall”. I told her that we wouldn’t be keeping in touch over the summer, as I was hurt, confused and trying to sort things out. She ended up dating someone she met in North Carolina less than two months later (I’m assuming the guy she cheated on me with) – I checked her Facebook one day and it was right there – posts from her new boyfriend, etc…When I found them, I became physically ill for a day. To put it bluntly, it was a hell of a summer.

She didn’t contact me until the end of the summer, when she got back home from North Carolina. I spoke to her for the first time since that phone call at the beginning of the summer – I asked her what happened. She said the only person she connected to was a guy there. I asked if she was still dating the guy, she said yes. We got off the phone. She tried calling me a bunch in the weeks afterwards, before school was starting. I didn’t respond to any of them – I had made up my mind that I was moving on.

We got back to school at the beginning of this year. She had broken up with her boyfriend and wanted to get back together with me. I said absolutely not. She wanted to be friends, platonic, anything. I said no to that too. I wanted no contact. It was hard for her to accept that.

We haven’t talked for a while now. She sent me a letter last semester detailing how much increasingly sad she has become without me, handled everything badly, and how (basically) she was still in love with me. It was the good side of her – humble, honest, and forthcoming. It was a powerful letter, and seemed like it was truly written from the heart.

The pain and anger I felt during the summer has subsided, and I am tempted to see if there is a future with us - if she really has changed. I haven’t been able to find the connection with another girl since.

What do I do Reddit? I’ve hooked up with girls at college since then. I’ve had some time being single. I think about her every day (we dated for a year and its been eight months since the breakup) and even though we don’t talk, part of me wishes that we could start up a relationship again, and I’m fairly certain that she does too (although I don’t know for sure – all I have is that letter written months ago). How do I find out if she has changed or not? I can’t seem to stop thinking about her.

TL;DR: Girl treated me badly, and I can’t stop thinking about the good stuff, and whether we have a future together.

Edit: I am proud of the way I have handled everything so far (i.e. not talking to her during the summer, not getting back together with her/being friends, etc...). I have my head held high for that. But I feel ashamed that I feel as though I'm still in love with her and don't know what to do about it..."

I've lied to teachers; I've said I was sick, had an interview, or had to drive a friend to the hospital.  But really, I've just been staying inside and hating myself.  I feel almost as if I'm forced to lie, and I feel like I can't face them, or my peers, or class.  Just the thought of class seems to tire me out.

Today, a very nice TA stopped me on the street and asked me what I was up to.  Without smiling, I said I had an interview and walked off.

I know I've been acting like an unethical twat.  I've been beating myself up over these encounters.  At the same time I am overcome with panic and stress at having to deal with socializing with people while dealing with schoolwork.  I am going to a well-known university for my electrical engineering degree, and I have a heavy course load, as well as a job as a research assistant.  I also have a research project I have not started.  

I've yet to find time to apply to internships and jobs over this summer.  This is pretty important because my resume isn't very good, in part because of my depression in college.  My depression now is much more manageable than it used to be, although recently it feels like I've been walking on the edge.

Mostly I'm overcome with panic at all the stuff that is due, and the panic contributes heavily to my procrastination habits as well as making me an antisocial jerk.  I don't really know what to do, because my professors probably think I'm just a jackass, and I'm wracked with guilt and shame and feel like I can't face them.

TLDR; I'm a university student who has trouble coping with depression, and I'm alienating people around me because of my inability to cope with the stress of my responsibilities, which are making me depressed.  I am asking for coping methods and some advice.

I might seem like a jerk.  I know I've been acting like one.

Apologies if this post seems disjointed, writing's never been my strong suit.

*EDIT*
Some depression history: Tried to off myself a few times, have been struggling with depression ever since I can remember.
I'm currently seeing a therapist.  I'm seeing a psychiatrist soon for medications."

Another issue is that I'm currently in the process of applying/interviewing for internships back home in DC, so it's possible that I may need to make phone calls (I know I can use Skype, but I'm only bringing a tablet, so not sure how reliable that would be on shaky hostel wifi)

Any recommendations on what to do? Either way, wouldn't be using the phone that much, just would like to have one. Cost per minute/text isn't a huge issue."

(long)",panderr,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/19sc5i/stunted_adult_in_the_weeds_where_to_start_picking/,"I read the board a bit, and I see that most of you are students, and I realize that this might not be the best place for the questions I'm asking, but I do know administrators, and admissions officers do hang around here sometimes. If this forum isn't the best place to get the answers, I'm looking for, can you point me towards where I should be looking?  

So, Here goes. 
I'm an adult and need education. I have had some issues in my life and am pretty much stunted (ie all of this should have been taken care of when I was in high school, not 12 years later).
I have a terrible high school transcript, there's no way I'm getting into a decent school (small public HS with ~40 people in each grade, no specialized classes or major, high absence and low gpa unless weighted and then its average).
One reason my transcript is so bad is health issues (still dealing with them). I do qualify for disability services, but that's besides the point (that fact will not get me into a school or help me pay for it). That said I'm not dumb. I've always been told by my teachers, doctors, bosses, people I meet at parties etc. that I'm really smart, and everyone I meet is surprised I'm formally uneducated. This is in part because I value knowledge and information (I read a lot).


What I want to get out of the time at college is a decent paying job with benefits (having comprehensive insurance is a HUGE deal to me because of my health issues) and be comfortable financially. Until now I've made enough to get by, but i'm nowhere near financially secure: I need skills and and education to change that. I also want to keep the costs low (I'm OK with spending some money but I do not want to be $60K in debt after, unless it will be very likely that I will be able to pay that off relatively fast). The school's reputation is also important to me as I wish to live abroad for a period of time.

I know community college is probably the way to start to make up for the transcript, but isn't it better to go to a 4 year school straight away because of the opportunities available (internships, research, connections, etc. to put on the CV)? If not, what (besides work) can I do to make the application to a 4year school stand out so I end up with school with even better connections and opportunities (internships and above, plus job placement, alumni network), and ultimately, a better job? 


My dream jobs are probably ridiculous, as many people want them, they are highly competitive and for most people, pay poorly: buyer for a store (aka merchandising, I've spoken a bit to a retired buyer for a national department store and this seems like a great job IF i can get in, which is very hard),editor for a women's magazine, interior designer, traveling food writer/critic (I know a lot about the subjects but there are no concrete examples to show someone, and it is at an amateur level). These interests point to a humanities major/liberal arts degree but this is the one of the worst majors for employ-ability (when you are not counting internships, experience, etc.). I am fluent at a native/professional/university level in two languages, conversant in another, and can read but not understand spoken/write two others (same language family as my non English native language, its not that much of an accomplishment, just chance).
My math skills are atrocious, but I also credit this to missing so much school (I had to learn a lot of it via non specialized tutor, in condensed time to pass the school years on time), forget about physics (never had a class). My study skills are probably a joke at this point (so long out of school, and my old habits weren't good), but those can be learned.

Given my unconventional needs and background, how do I choose a course of study/major and subsequently, the school?


FWIW, i've always lived in commuting distance to NYC and recently moved to the city to be with my significant other (I am not a full resident so I can not take advantage of CUNY/SUNY programs that exist). I would consider moving anywhere for school though. 

Thanks in advance for taking the time to read this and comment. "

Yet I think it's ridiculous that she's going around socializing with all these big shots and VIPs and getting to know company CEOs, some from local businesses, some from Fortune 500 companies.

She has joined a shit ton of academic clubs, classes, activities in the past (just because she can), but also complains about the lack of time to do homework (which she needs to do and eventually does, at the cost of sleep).

I'm a musician and freelance audio engineer. I went to school for audio engineering and it's landed me just about $10k in debt from loans. I have been putting a deferment on these loans for nearly 2 years now. As you know, this is some stressful shit.

I left to go to school in December of 2009, which is also the same month I quit my job. I had this job from 2004 to 2009, and was part time. I cleaned hospital equipment and filed papers. I hated the fuck out of it. I was also working with my mom.

Ever since I finished there to go to school, even after completing school, I haven't had a steady job.

In 2009 I moved from AL to AZ for this. Being lucky enough that my mom cosigned the major loan for me. I got $80 every 2 weeks for food and gas. I was usually behind on my rent but luckily, my roommate was a good friend, so he helped until I could pay him back.

During the time of living in AZ, I applied for roughly 250-300 jobs. I only had one interview at Pizza Hut, and I didn't get the job because my car wasn't up for the task of delivery.

Finally, finished up school 8 months later and moved out to Nashville, TN. Began interning at a studio, which closed down a month later. After that began interning at another studio soon after.

During my time in Nashville, my wallet got stolen (right out of our house) I wrecked my car, was living off $40 every 2 weeks, and about 4 months in, couldn't afford rent. Again, my roommates were cool enough to let me stay for free.

During my stay here, I was extremely focused on my internship. I didn't want to lose any time working there, because of the random off chance that I could get a job there. So, I wasn't looking for work. Eventually, my roommates had a talk with me, and said I need to find a job. So, I started applying again. I probably put in 150 applications in about 2 weeks. Got a call from Walmart a week later, and started working as a cart pusher.

I only worked there for a month and a half and quit. Still a huge regret. The only reason that I quit is that, it was interfering with my off chance of being employed at a major studio. I obviously didn't get the job at the studio. Since I didn't, I had to move back in with my parents.

And here I am, ever since May 2011.

I had one job in 2012 that I quit (was about to get fired). It was for hotel maintenance. The person I was replacing didn't like me and was constantly treating me like a 5 year old because he'd been doing this work for 30 years and I had barely any experience.

Now, after all this, I need a job. Really, I just need money, but that shit doesn't just fall out of nowhere. I'm on oDesk, but the audio work is so scarce, that it's barely enough to pay my phone bill.

Every time I start to look for jobs, I get hit with severe depression and suicidal thoughts just roll in. I don't care about money. I just don't. I guess it's because I rarely have it, or it's just an excuse to try to not make any. But I don't give a fuck about it. And that's a bad attitude for anyone living in this culture.

I apologize if I sound like a whiny bitch (I'm sure I do). I just don't know what to do about this situation."

19rzm1,4,2013-03-06,"I stopped smoking today, and I'd like to share my thoughts with y'all. ",[deleted],stopsmoking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/19rzm1/i_stopped_smoking_today_and_id_like_to_share_my/,"So yeah, smoking. Yeah... 

To be honest, I'm not sure why I picked up smoking again. It's just something that sort of happened. I know why I started in the first place though, and it's pretty lame in retrospect. I worked for a company that cleared out houses and apartments that were repossessed, and everybody smoked there. I sporadically smoked weed at the time, and I picked up smoking when I noticed that everybody else got to take short breaks so they could smoke. It's not like I was not allowed to take a break, but I had nothing to do when they did. Everyone had ciggies on them, so my gateway was there, so to speak. I quit when it got too expensive, started again when I got stressed at my internship (I'm a student teacher, and my students were the devil incarnate), then quit because it got too expensive. I'd quit for about 4 months before I picked it up again. 

The reason I picked it up the last time was because I was stressed out and I felt that smoking would relieve some stress. My dad just had a heart attack and I had relationship troubles, so the smoke seemed like a good choice. It probably was an act of defiance too, because my girlfriend HATED smokers. I stopped smoking weed for her (I haven't smoked weed in a long while though, and I haven't felt like picking it up again), but this seemed like something I could do to sort of walk that edge. I threw away the pack after smoking two cigarettes, because I didn't want her to find out. When she broke up with me two months later, I started smoking sporadically. I made it a point to only buy one pack a month, just so I wouldn't get addicted again. 

We're about 6 months later now, and I've decided I wanted to quit. Today. I smoked my last few cigarettes during my break, threw out my lighter and I've committed to not smoke ever again. I've never felt embarrassed about smoking, or at least I thought so, until I bought my last pack this Monday. My commitment to lasting a month on a pack was thrown out the window a long time ago, and I could barely last a week on a pack. The only reason I didn't smoke more was because I didn't want people to find out. I never smoked around the house because I didn't want my family to find out, and I didn't smoke around my friends because I made this big point of quitting the last time and I didn't want them finding out. I hated it. 

The breaking point was reached this Monday. I was listening to a song on the radio about relapsing, and I felt so ashamed of myself. I was dedicated to quitting, but I wasn't strong enough to pull through then. I just really wanted to quit doing this. So this morning I was walking to work with a colleague who also smokes, and I light up my second cigarette. He notices and says ""Geez, I never knew you were a chain smoker."" and that's where I broke. I had become a chain smoker. I just felt so thoroughly and utterly fucking embarrassed that I made a vow I'd quit. For good this time. 

So I smoked up my last ciggies during break, threw out my lighter and here I am. I'm hoping that spewing the innards of my brain will help with me quitting, because I don't want to be that guy. I don't want to hide and I don't want to be stamped a chain smoker. My body likes the nicotine, but my heart can't stand the embarrassment. 

My lowest point is probably something that happened a few months back. I was visiting a friend who was trying to stop smoking, and I offered her a cigarette saying ""You don't have to quit cold turkey"". She's back to two packs a week now. I'm disgusted just thinking back to it. 

So yeah, here I am. I'd say that I'm trying to be a new me, but I'm actually just trying to go back to my old me. Here's to not puffing ash. 

Sorry for the wall of text.      "

19rvuj,3,2013-03-06,[Internship] Management Information Student BBA seeking summer internship in gaming or tech industry,mrgibons,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/19rvuj/internship_management_information_student_bba/,"&gt;A lot of kids growing up in my generation wanted to make video games, but very few stuck with it. Most push it aside as a pipe dream or a waste of time, I did not. I have me making games since I was 12 years; furthermore I have been selling my games since I was 14. I would burn a bunch of my games on to disks and sell them at school to combat teachers blocking game websites, a feat which landed me in trouble a few times I might add. Eventually, when I reached the high school level I had acquired friends with a similar interest and skill in game creation. This led me to start a little publishing group that we called “UberStudios”. Together we would create games and I would sell them, this lasted my entire freshmen year. At this point flash games were the most popular since they had the easy and mobility of the internet behind them. The group was disbanded, though only professionally we will remained friends, and I started a series of web site portals that would link students to the best and most popular games on the web at the time. My love of games allowed a rural Wisconsin community to experience the thrills of the industry, a thrill I have kept with me since. 
I started my college education at Western Technical College where I studied programming. I enjoy programming, I love the logic and mindset that follows programming. I feel that having a background in programming enhances problem solving. At the end of my second year of college while working on a group project, I found one of my old games. It was a titled called “Kyle’s Adventure”, a game that followed our friend Kyle as he crash landed on an island full of living evil vending machines. The concept was bizarre, but I was able to convince my partners in the project that we should recreate it for the XBOX for our assignment. This rekindled my love of leading a group, while I love programming I feel my strong vision and charisma better suits me for producing. I took a semester off and then transferred to Viterbo University in pursuit of my Bachelors in Management Information Systems (B.B.A). I feel that for the area I’m in, that this degree focus will help me get to where I want to be in the industry. I am currently set to graduate from Viterbo in 2014 at which point I will continue on to the SMU Guildhall in pursuit of my Masters in Interactive Technology with a focus on Production.
I really prize myself in taking projects from concept to reality. I have a passion for games, the game industry, and I love to better myself.  I have found that there are very few internships that deal with publishing or producing and if given an opportunity I would not waste a second of it. 

Thanks you for your consideration.

I just am so tired. 

It just seems that no matter how much I do or try or what ever it is never enough to get out of my hell. Fate just keeps throwing more and more and more and more and more and more at me and I just want it all to stop.

I just need a job that uses my talents and skill sets but no one will hire me. I cant even get an unpaid internship. I'm sick of doing work for free and trying to use community events i help with to make some sort of connections to find a job. I'm sick of all of this crap. 

I have helped organize a bunch of TEDx Talks that brought people from all over the world. I have done video production from multiple trade shows for my own portfolio of stuff. I can't even get anyone to give me a fucking in to a paid git anywhere. I'm a IT media professional and i can get any jobs anywhere No matter what i get the phrase ""We just don't think you will fit in here"" WHat the fuck is that supposed to mean.

Sorry i'm having a mini rant break down just thinking about all of this. How do you get out of a hell that you can't even afford to get out of.

This occurred to me after re-watching ""Jeff, Who Lives at Home,"" and realizing that what the movie really is about isn't this wacky slob living in his mother's basement, but rather a goofy idealist trying to make his family have hope again. A similar theme shows up in ""Safety Not Garunteed,"" which also could have very easily been a movie poking fun about a weirdo who thinks he can time travel, but instead it's celebrates the weirdo. Every character in that movie overcomes their own person cynicism by the end of it. For Mark Duplass' character is the belief that he'll never find someone who understands him. For Aubrey Plaza's character it's the belief that nothing original or exciting exists in the world. For the dorky intern beliveing no girl will ever want to be with him. And it's especially true of Jake Johnson's character. At the start of the film he's nothing but the embodiment of cynicism, everything about him is calculated but by the end of the movie he's nothing but raw emotion.

These two films are the main examples that come to mind, but I think you can also see this downfall of world-weariness in the years blockbusters. People could argue about the ""marketability"" of The Avengers all they want, but I honestly believe the reason why it beat The Dark Night Rises was that it's a movie about hope, teamwork, the best mankind has to offer. Whereas The Dark Night Rises is a dark, depressing movie about the worst of humanity. I'm not coming down on the film, but the characters are all brooding, joyless, and hopeless. This isn't anything new for the Nolan Batman universe, but I just think America is done with the whole dark thing. That's why the movie didn't beat Avengers. Not because Bane's voice sounded funny.

Other examples I can think of to support this are: **21 Jump Street:** An earnest celbration of friendship disguised as a cynical cash grab. **Silver Linings Playbook:** The idea of a silver lining is in the freaking title. And, though it's not the best financial support for my argument, **John Carter of Mars**. If you ask me part of why the marketing of this movie was so bad, is that they tried to dress up such a heart-on-its-sleeve adventure movie as a tough, ""cool"", action movie.

How did you cope with it?,danimal24k,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/19rets/have_people_from_your_past_ever_seen_you_working/,"This is a very personal story/struggle in my life, and I'm sharing it on Reddit.

I had been unemployed for 2.5 years, after being underemployed for 1 year, after graduating with a B.A. in Art Education. I was hoping to become an art teacher, but state budgets for education have shrunk in recent years, and I couldn't find work in my desired field. Now, I'm underemployed again, accepting donations at a thrift store in my hometown. Every month, I save about $600, and spend the rest. 

In 2009, after I got my degree and credential, I moved back home and started substituting part-time at a nearby district. In Spring 2010, I was given an opportunity to be the long-term substitute teacher for an art teacher on maternity leave. This art teacher - we'll call her Kim - was an old schoolmate from high school. She was a sophomore when I was a senior, but she got her life together much sooner than me.

Substituting for her classroom was a great experience. I gained the confidence to teach middle schoolers, and the students learned a lot. And I left the classroom in very good shape for Kim's return. I went back to substituting part-time.

I was hoping that I would land a full-time art teacher position somewhere for the following 2010-2011 school year. But that never happened. And I stopped getting calls to substitute in December 2010, and lost contact with Kim as a reference.

As a Plan B, I took up a part-time internship at an art gallery to learn about marketing and art curation. But it was non-paid, and it never materialized into a job with the gallery. So I left in January 2012 to find real work. And I remained unemployed until last October - and not a moment too soon, because I lost a lot of hope for the future. 

Donations is pretty much non-skilled, dirty, manual labor. It's a step above a garbage man - I do deal with a lot of trash, but also a lot of sellable goods. On a weekday, about 100 cars drop off their donations at the thrift store. I don't mind the work, except that it's in my hometown.

Today, to our mutual surprise, Kim pulls up to drop off a donation. It was friendly and brief, but super awkward with silent pauses. Inside, I wanted to die from my shame and embarrassment. But I wore a smiley poker face till she left. And now, I left to assume the worst... Is she laughing at me? Is she going to share my current status with old students? With old schoolmates? With colleagues at the middle school where I substituted?

After work, I tried giving her a phone call to admit my guilt and shame (and potentially, control the damage), but she didn't pick up. So now, I'm on Reddit, seeking empathy.

**tl;dr**: An old schoolmate (who is way better off in life) caught me working at a thrift store. It was super embarrassing for me."

**791** Soda Jerks for **2 years**!

I love soda.  I don’t make a secret of that.  Circle K Thirstbusters or Polar Pops or whatever they’re calling them these days are heaven-sent.  If you save your cup, you can get a 44 ounce refill for about $0.85, depending on what the tax rate for your locale is.  While I happen to like [one particular brand](http://i.imgur.com/dQiNk.jpg) of soda more than the rest, there are many delicious sodas out there.  Even I need to change it up once in awhile with some root beer or Dr. Thunder.  Yes, I said Dr. Thunder – I may have the sophistication of a redneck, but I am very snobby about my soda choice.

/r/soda is dedicated to all sodas and soda related things, such as [soda-flavored Hubba Bubba](http://i.imgur.com/fn3JVZq.jpg), [Pepsi Blue](http://i.imgur.com/EpvlGMT.jpg), [Salty Watermelon Pepsi](http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc6/253156_286670278101486_89162301_n.jpg) and a discussion on how [Crystal Pepsi](http://www.reddit.com/r/Soda/comments/1353oz/i_miss_crystal_pepsi_twenty_year_anniversary/) is missed.  They even discuss soda tasting parties.  Oh, I suppose you Coke-heads think I should post something Coke related to be fair.

Well, then, you should have joined our internship program and beat me to this feature.  Link for said program is right in the sidebar.

Okay, [fine](http://i.imgur.com/OAnpKn7.jpg), but don’t say I never did you any favors.

I sat down with the /r/soda mods to ask them questions about their wonderful subreddit.

&gt;#1. What made you want to be part of this subreddit?

&gt;&gt;**OddDude55** I actually found the subreddit abandoned! I thought it would be fun to be a mod, so I went to the mod maintenance people and asked to be given control. That was about 2 years ago and back then there were about 30-40 subscibers.

&gt;#2. Is there anything in particular you expect from the community?

&gt;&gt;**OddDude55** One thing I love about this community is its steady growth and enthusiasm for all things carbonated. I always enjoy seeing posts about people wanting to learn how to make their own soda, posts about independent soda brands, or posts about soda flavors from other countries. I expect to see these kinds of posts increase as we grow larger.

&gt;#3. Do you have a favorite soda?  What is it?

&gt;&gt;**OddDude55** If I had to choose a favorite name brand soda, it would have to be A&amp;W rootbeer. I really enjoy its more creamy taste. My favorite off brand would have to be Americana Huckleberry. It's very sweet and has a unique and familiar flavor at the same time!

&gt;#4. Do you think soda wars are tearing apart the fabric of our society?
&gt;&gt;**OddDude55** These so called ""soda wars"" are just a fabrication of the Big Coffee industry to keep our eyes from the truth that coffee is trying to invade and take over our way of life! Wake up, DPeople! Fight the grinds! Drink a cola!

&gt;#5. Is there anything else you would like to add?

&gt;&gt;**OddDude55** Finding this sub and watching it grow to 25 times its size over the past 2 years has felt a lot like what Rick Moranis felt in [Honey, I Blew Up the Kid](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104437/). It's been tons of fun and I can’t wait to see what comes next!

Thank you for that interview!  I'm going to kick back with a Pepsi Throwback and I hope the rest of you enjoy some soda this fine day."

I'm a third-year undergraduate mathematics major who is trying desperately to get himself motivated to study to be an actuary. I've been flirting with the idea since graduating high school, but now it's time to get serious. I took a course on probability / applied statistics that I am told parallels the P Exam well last semester and got an A-, but I know I wouldn't pass the P Exam if I had to take it today. So, now I'm going back to the books to brush up on the stuff I supposedly learned and then some. 

Now for the question:

What textbook would you recommend for this exam as a learning and study tool? The course I took used [Mathematical Statistics with Applications by Dennis Wackerly](http://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Statistics-Applications-Dennis-Wackerly/dp/0495110817/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362542458&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=mathematical+statistics) textbook and I am told it covers the P Exam material essentially in full. But before I actually commit to buying a copy, I wanted to know what you recommend. 

Also, if you have an advice for someone in my position - that is, someone graduating spring 2014 and wants to work on becoming an actuary - let me know. I'm afraid a summer internship is out of the question as I'll be studying abroad this summer. I'm also concerned about whether it is even possible to get two exams under my belt by next May (I am told 2 exams passed + 1 internship = competitive entry-level candidate) but we'll see what we can do. 

Thanks in advance.

I am fortunate enough to be in a coop program where I get to spend some time working as an intern at various companies/firms and over my last two terms I feel as though I have become sightly disenchanted with the field as whole.  I have learned that it is very important for me to work with people individually and on things that really matter (not just the next new gadget or toy), something I didn't consider before going into engineering.  

I have spent some time volunteering at clinics/hospitals and I feel like medicine is something I really enjoy being part of.  The only problem is that for me to apply to med school I have to take a variety of pre-med courses that are outside of the standard engr curriculum, adding another year to my degree, which is also expensive, and while I realize that if I get into med school it would be worth it, if I don't (which is quite probable) then I will have wasted time/money etc... 

The other major issue is the grading, engineering tends to be very demanding and as a result what is a very respectable GPA in my faculty is considered average in the other faculties, I don't want to make it sound like engineering is harder than traditional premed, because it isn't, I find that the profs just tend to care less about grading because the majority of their students don't have aspirations outside of engineering (""A b+ is a great grade! good for you....."" style of thinking) How can those grades compete to get into med schools with those who average A/A+'s, I have taken courses outside my faculty and ended up with A/A+ marks. 

In conclusion I am asking two questions: 1)Do you think that Engineering students have a higher chance of getting into med school?  2) Do you think it is worth it to take the pre-reqs for med school, regardless of me getting in or not? and just hope for the best?  

EDIT: I am a Canadian student looking at Canadian med schools."

I am a recent graduate in engineering. Well, I graduated last spring, went to grad school and then dropped out because funding fell through and I couldn't afford it. But that's another story. 

I've been looking for work in my field. I've participated in some prestigious projects, been recognized for them and really, really love my field. I've had internships in both industry and the government, and have done lab research. I have work experience outside of my field (inlcuding customer service) and have extensive volunteer work in my industry and outside of that too. But I feel like none of that matters because of my appearance. 

Yes, it's male dominated but I fear that the way people treat me isn't  because I'm female, but because I have a few rather 'extreme' facial piercings. That is, both my ears are stretched to 1"" and each nostril to 8ga, or about 3.3 mm. I wear plain black jewelry in them, and I feel that they are very understated and elegant. 

After graduation, I cleaned up: I learned to apply makeup, dress like an adult and even got my first professional hair cut. I had convinced myself that these, plus my impressive resume and passion would make people over look the piercings. 

I finally admitted to myself that they won't. This past fall, I went to a conference in the southern US (I'm Canadian) and they didn't really even bother to try and hold back the staring and contempt. The people who make decisions still aren't going to want to take a chance on a new hire who has gone out of her way to make herself look physically different in a way that isn't considered professional. 

So, I took out my nose rings today. I know it's the right decision. I just feel like I'm ""selling out"" a bit and betraying myself. 

Have any of you ladies had to make tough choices about how you present yourself to further your careers? I'd love to feel like I'm not alone here :)

I've been searching for a suitable position for around a year now. I have sifted through countless vacancies to find employers willing to hire and train those who are inexperienced.

I was disappointed, yet unsurprised when my application for a highly-competitive internship was rejected last month for ""stronger candidates"". I used to think internships were an opportunity for people who wanted to learn and be moulded into their desired professions, but don't have enough experience to acquire a job. Of course, I can now see that this isn't necessarily true. I haven't had a response from the numerous companies I contacted.

I've posted a ""For Hire"" on Reddit a month ago. The feedback I got was positive, but quickly disintegrated. The three responses I received so far: 1) First person have not replied to my PM nor logged onto Reddit since he/she responded several weeks ago. 2) Second person PMed me over a week ago. He wanted me to send him my Curriculum Vitae (résumé), but wouldn't disclose basic information, such as the name of the company he's representing, the position he's offering me, the location of the office, etc. All I've managed to find out is his first name, his Gmail address, and that the internship will be initially unpaid. I refuse to pass on my personal information to people/companies I know little about. It seems rather ""dodgy"" and makes me more self-aware of my safety and security. Sending a CV to an unknown stranger and [possible] fictional company is outside the normal job application protocol. 3) I was PMed by the director of a startup company about a possible internship placement yesterday.

19qyt6,1,2013-03-05,Reality &amp; Discouragement.,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/19qyt6/reality_discouragement/,"I am looking for a paid internship, freelance or part-time work in the field of journalism. I've been searching for a suitable position for around a year now. I have sifted through countless vacancies to find employers willing to hire and train those who are inexperienced.

I was downtrodden, yet unsurprised when my application for a highly-competitive internship was rejected last month for ""stronger candidates"". I used to think internships were an opportunity for people who wanted to learn and be moulded into their desired professions, but don't have enough experience to acquire a job. Of course, I can now see that this isn't necessarily true. I haven't had a response from the numerous companies I contacted.

I've posted a ""For Hire"" on Reddit a month ago. The feedback I got was positive, but quickly disintegrated. The three responses I received so far: 1) First person have not replied to my PM nor logged onto Reddit since he/she responded several weeks ago. 2) Second person PMed me over a week ago. He wanted me to send him my Curriculum Vitae (résumé), but wouldn't disclose basic information, such as the name of the company he's representing, the position he's offering me, the location of the office, etc. All I've managed to find out is his first name, his Gmail address, and that the internship will be initially unpaid. I refuse to pass on my personal information to people/companies I know little about. It seems rather ""dodgy"" and makes me more self-aware of my safety and security. Sending a CV to an unknown stranger and [possible] fictional company is outside the normal job application protocol. 3) I was PMed by the director of a startup company about a possible internship placement yesterday. This sounded quite exciting and it was (almost) just what I'm looking for. So I responded soon after I read the PM. Unfortunately my questions about the company made him have a change of heart.

I do a few on-campus recruiting events a year for my company, mostly recruiting ME's and a few EE's for entry-level positions and summer internships. I'm interested in what students and people who just entered the job market are expecting and hoping for in their first full time job offer as I'm seeing a lot of variation in expectations. I've asked this question of the people in your career center as well as the career centers at UH and LSU, and the numbers I've received have been all over the board. My own company's HR department has their own number they want to work off of as well. As a hiring manager we have some discretion to make a fair offer, so I'd like to know what this subReddit thinks that is.

For comparison's sake, let's assume this job is for a large company in the Houston area. Standard medical/dental insurance, 401K, and other benefits. You as a candidate have good grades, a summer of internship experience somewhere, and this job is not in the oil/gas field. (So you're not expecting to set the curve.)

**Questions**

1) What would you hope for in salary for your first offer? (What's the high end target?)
2) What would you take and consider a fair offer?
3) How many interviews and offers are good candidates getting nowadays?

Believe it or not, when I graduated in the late 90's and the economy was going like a freight train I had so many interviews and offers I was turning down interview requests. Some of the people we hired 4-5 years ago told me later we were their only interview or offer at all. How's the market for entry level engineers today?

Thanks for your help."
19qvqw,3,2013-03-05,Advice on applying,ba1018,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/19qvqw/advice_on_applying/,"Hey everyone. 

I'm an undergrad (4th year but going on to a 5th) double majoring in math and biology. I've been considering grad school for quite some time now, and recently started doing research for an enzymologist at my university. I've always been interested in the mathematical side of biology (biophysics, systems biology, computational neuroscience, biomedical engineering, etc), but have never been able to whittle down the list of ""interests"" to focus on a field in which to specialize and pursue research. 

Unfortunately, I've recently begun to suspect that ""interest"" isn't enough motivation to apply to pursue graduate education. The research I've been doing is mainly protein crystallization and enzyme kinetics, and involves a lot of pipetting and other tedious forms of bench-work and is taking up more time than I expected. I've begun to fall behind in my classwork, and I'm sacrificing more and more downtime to keep my head above water (I may have overloaded this semester taking 5 classes. That might be contributing to the problem.).

I was under the impression I was making the research project a top priority until the professor sat me down and suggested that I might want to reconsider pursuing a PhD because it seems I'm not wholly invested in the project. That's when all of these doubts were planted, and they have only grown from there. I'm reconsidering my entire future, and it looks uncertain. 

I'm not sure what else I want to do. I've always loved STEM subjects and thought I should make a career out of using my scientific/mathematical knowledge and skills. But now I'm not so sure. I've had no trouble grasping upper level material and enjoy learning, so I'm sure I'm intellectually qualified. But I'll admit that working at the bench is not all that fun. I haven't exactly reached the data interpretation portion of the scientific process, so I don't know if all this work is worth it yet. 

Having now given some context, I guess my post boils down to these questions. You can answer all or just one if you'd like:

* Is it possible to be a good scientist and not sacrifice your life outside of work? So can I do science, have a family, spend time with friends, and maybe even go on holidays? Would working outside of academia with a PhD/Masters allow this flexibility in my life? I don't want to be this overworked forever.

* Is it possible I'm not working in the right field? Does the character of research vary from one area to another? Again, I think the subject of enzymology is incredibly interesting with respect to all the kinetic models scientists have developed and their implications for drug design and physiological function, but it would seem that I find the process of hashing this information out less thrilling.

* What other routes can I take? I feel like it's late in the game to find another career path since it seems so many people my age have done internships and planned ahead to find a job. I've done nothing but study what interests me which I doubt employers value.

* Can I go back? If I decide to not go to graduate school now, is it possible to ""get back in the game"" if later in life I discover science is something I really want to do?

So, yeah. Any advice, stories, comments, etc are much appreciated. I just want to get some perspective. I apologize if I don't respond promptly. I have a big immunology exam to study for, and I likely won't get back to any responses until later tonight.

**P.S.** - For anyone wondering why I started research so late, it wasn't for lack of trying: I was rejected from a multitude of professors asking to work in their lab for about a year and a half to two years previously. "

19qvd8,5,2013-03-05,Starting a Roth IRA. Is this a good allocation? (+ a couple small questions),[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/19qvd8/starting_a_roth_ira_is_this_a_good_allocation_a/,"I'm 25 years old. I have zero debt. I have about 16k in a low risk mutual fund (VASIX), which I placed there because I was starting a PhD and frankly had other priorities than investing.

I live pretty frugally - I at least break even with my PhD stipend, but even if I saved 10% of my salary, that's only ~1500 dollars pre tax. Sometimes I intern in the summers, which means an extra 4k towards savings, after taxes and expenses associated with living in Silicon Valley.

Post graduation I will make ~100k. Could swing low (~70) if I go into acadmia, could swing high (~120k)

Since I have no 401k right now, I'm establishing a Roth IRA to invest in. (This way I can pull money out if I want to retire early... at least, pull out the principal that is)

I plan to set up my Roth IRA with the following allocation at Vanguard:

* Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND): 20%

* Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI): 50%

* Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund (VXUS): 30%

These are all low fee ETFs, so my logi is that if I hold them a long
time, and while I might not make as much as actively trading, the lesser
fees will balance that out and get me a decent rate of return.


I also had a couple other small questions:

1. I saw online mentions of ""late contributions"" - basically I could put
money in before April 15th if I earned it during last year's tax
season... would that be applicable to me? What dates are the cut offs for doing this? (Or will Vanguard stop me if I try to contribute too much?)

2. Is it true Roth contributions will be maxed at 5500 for 2013?

3. Should I put this money in all at once, or space it out so that eventually I'll be able to put 458.33 in each month? Or does it not matter?"

And since these companies give no feedback, I have no idea what I am doing wrong. I am not saying I am acing all the interviews, but my Amazon interview went pretty well,but still I got a reject. So I am feeling that I am definitely doing something wrong, but I do not know exactly what. So I am not sure what to work on. I was wondering if there are any technical interviewers in here who are willing to volunteer and take a mock phone interview with me. I just want them to be very critical and point out my mistakes so that I can work on them. If anyone is willing to volunteer 30 mins-1 hr of their time to help me out on this, I will be very grateful. You can keep your identity secret.

I was told to check the 500+ numbers on this one document the day after I was told to make some changes to the same document.  While I was checking these numbers, I noticed some of what I was supposed to do before wasn't done, so, I fixed it, thinking I had missed something.  Little did I know, these were changes my boss had made, and when the boss found out, they freaked the fuck out and were super pissed off at me and I scrambled and trembled to undo what I had done.  This is bullshit.  It seems like if you are an intern, or do some other ""entry-level"" work, they make you do the dumbest, most rote bullshit possible and then expect that everything in a massive spreadsheet that no one is going to use has to be 100% correct.

Why the fuck is it so fucking difficult to just get a decent job/internship where you are expected to use your brain?  Are older motherfuckers so ""above"" everyone else that they honestly think that all a person is capable of is the dumbest most menial shit ever?  So, then if they fuck up it is this big motherfucking deal because, OH, they're not good at shit NO ONE wants to do NOR cares about.  Why the fuck is it that just because you are new at a job, you should essentially have no discretion, creative outlet, nor ability to make suggestions? I thought I was an employee hired to help out the organization, not a peon to do useless tasks for hours each week.
I should have stayed making espresso, because I have fucking news for your ass, all of you cunt bosses out there.  Your job is NOT that difficult.  You think it is because you are incompetent, and are told that your job matters because you exercise authority.  FYI, humans are VASTLY capable of SIGNIFICANTLY more things than you would think.  We are not stupid incompetent animals. We are PEOPLE WHO WANT TO FUCKING WORK, NOT DO THINGS MACHINES CAN MOTHERFUCKING DO.  
Management should be cut and workers should be allowed to flourish.  I am tired of this bullshit.  Maybe I should just focus on the COMPANY I as an INCOMPETENT worker FOUNDED on the side of GRADUATE SCHOOL.  Did I mention that a high-school diploma is all you needed to do my boss's job when they were hired? Yes, but NOW you need a motherfucking Ph.

I am 16 and a half year old sophomore in a community college who loves brains! I took a neuroscience class and I was fascinated by how the brain works. At first, I felt a little disappointed at the fact  that every feeling we ever had was a command from the brain for releasing certain different substances.  (well. It is more complicated than that. That was just a thought of mine at first) I dare to compare living creatures to robots. Very different but alike in behavior. While taking the class, I found myself researching about neuroscience and reading book like incognito: the secret lives of the brain; brain rules, etc 
**My problem:I do like books about neuroscience. I am extremely curious about why people act the way they do. I am even more curious because I have been around a lot of people that have severe psychological problems like both of my parents and grandparents. Am I interested working in the neuroscience field?  reading about something and working on a field is very different, I figured 2nd problem: I have finacial aid. However they recently passed a new policy that after six years students won't receive more than 25% of their tuition. Both of my parents aren't in a position to help me financially and I am currently working with my older sister to support our family. I am considering loaning money for my studies but I want to stay away from them as long as I am allowed. Therefore, once I choose a career path, I am really scared of regretting it and change my major and go back. I have grown to be scared of money and all the problems it comes from it.

What kind of jobs are there for neuroscience majors.? what is it a day like working in this field?  are there any internships for undergraduate students in California?  Are there volunteering oportunities for undergrad students?  how long did you take to graduate from college (bachelors/AA/PHD)?  How is/was your (financial experience)*?

Normally I would just cross the bridge when I come to it but does anyone have any advice in terms of ways to deal with it, what to expect etc.

Essentially all they really want from me is to help them move their WordPress site to a new server and some minor coding ect.

Now their current host is a nightmare. Its a foreign host reseller with only one U.S. ""office"" that no one ever seems to hear from. No back-end access, no cpanel of any kind and apparently the journal had to fight just for FTP access. I got into an email argument with their support over getting a copy of the database because they block all scripts and plugins that attempt to get that information.

I finally got the database from them, and today I come in to download the actual files themselves so I can create a development server to implement new code or changes without having to do them live on their slow site. When suddenly every file transfer starts to fail. I realized soon after not only could I not access our own website but I could no longer access the website of the host either. I checked and it was only down for us, using a proxy I was able to confirm that they put an IP block on us, preventing us from reaching our own content.

I email and call and I get nothing in return, just silence. Anyone have any practical advice for me?"

Dear Louie,

First of all, sir, fuck you a little bit. And I mean that in a way like if we were friends having a beer, where it's mutually understood and allowable to call each other on our shit. Since we are not friends, I fear this will be read as desperate attention grabbing hate mail, but I strongly insist the intention of this letter is to offer constructive feedback from a perspective you no longer empathize with.

On an appearance with Jay Leno, you set up a dialogue, about the unhelpful generation of twenty year olds, stating that truthfully you hold a prejudice towards us. Surely you remember this not only from that “conversation” but as a featured bit in your 2010/2011 standup act. In this particular telling of the joke you say, “You're twenty, you've done nothing. You've just been sucking up resources, and just been taking food and love and education and ipods and just taking it and judging it.” I laughed at this when I saw it because to a point it's true, agreeing that some people my age are spoiled pieces of shit. But then I thought about it, and honestly it's kind of bullshit to be sitting where you are sitting saying that twenty year olds shouldn't complain.

Because from where we are sitting, the future for twenty year old's looks kind of shitty. And frankly it is more justifiably me who should be prejudiced against you. The economy is fucked because of people older than me were greedy as fuck. Not just bankers on wall street but every fucking person who borrowed more than they could pay back so they could have an extra jet ski. The fallout from that is a fucked up job market where people older than me aren't willing to hire and aren't willing to retire, i.e. Jay Leno. The government is fucked. Period. And it's run by old white rich men who sit around incessantly bickering like, well, twenty year olds. They don't give a shit about me, these are men who act only in the service to their own wealth and power. Men who basically enslave my peers to do their legwork free of charge, and call it an internship. And every time a fiscal deadline approaches congress, they raise the debt limit and push off their obligation to pay it off further into the future that they won't be around for. My generation isn't valued because our future isn't valued. We aren't represented because how could we be, we're only twenty.

You saying what you are saying only adds fuel to the flame. Saying we shouldn't be angry is demeaning, it's the boot pushing our face further into the pile of shit you took. My generation should be mad. Because when some fat fuck (not necessarily you, but not necessarily not you) comes into our Starbucks in the middle of the day with no sensitivity or patience to our having a shitty job, why should we be the bigger man? You are the older one. Our future is being gambled away, and excuse me for saying it, but fuck you a little bit for saying we shouldn't complain.

The next line is when I stopped laughing and got thinking, when you said, “If you are twenty you have definitely never done a thing for anybody.” Obviously this is meant to be a punchy bold statement for the sake of comedy. But come on, man. Are you joking when you say your are serious or do I really have to tell you the things me and my peers have done? Because when you insist that you actually think this way, in comedy we take it as you being “real” and not an act.

Ok, then. So I have this friend who went abroad during college, which you also mocked, and he literally designed and built a freshwater collection system in Rwanda with an engineering team. They used money they raised, and he personally wound up spending a lot of his own money going there separately from the program and taking a semester off of school to live there for three months. He did this to learn specifically how their culture works so that they could design the best possible system. Because as you have noted, some people think they are helping but once they leave it goes back to the way it was. Conscious of this, he did something to make sure that wouldn't happen, to actually affect positive change in people's lives. I'm sorry sir, but fuck you a little bit.

Another one of my good friends majored in psychology, and before she graduated (which she still did) she founded an online company that fosters anonymous online help for peers suffering from any kind of mental stress. How it works is you submit a written statement of whats going on and how you are feeling and she finds someone who has suffered from the same kind of problem who will then email back advice within twenty four hours. Using technology she cleverly came up with a welcoming and safe system for people to open up when they would have been otherwise too afraid to. Her nonprofit company is now built into student resource programs on many major college campuses and with the help of another friend of ours she has a beautifully designed website. The company she built has literally prevented numerable suicides from happening. Fuck you a little bit.

The things I have accomplished pale in comparison to what many of my friends are up to. I'm merely a seasonal gardener. I love to read and write. I have a degree in Biology, and I enjoy working outdoors. You know what I do in the winters? I shovel snow in fucking Wisconsin. Consider that for a moment. I'm one of the youngest people at my job and complain the least. If anything people get more bitter with age because things haven't changed for them. I'm positive and hopeful for the future because I know people like my two friends I have mentioned are out there. I'm hopeful, perhaps ignorantly so, but fuck you for thinking that. I'm just some dude in Wisconsin, and if I have friends like this, you don't think there are people like that everywhere?

I could blame the job market for the limited work I am able to find. That would be totally reasonable. I could resent all the rich old white men in congress who act in consistent disregard for my future, with only their personal wealth and power in mind. That would also be reasonable. But I can't blame older people in general, that would be ignorant and childish to take issue with an entire group of people. It's too easy. Just like saying twenty year olds have no value, which again, fuck you a little bit for saying.

Everybody is a product of their upbringing. I think you get that, and I suspect being a father scares you with how to raise your girls. It should. Obviously you are aware that your kids are privileged and your fear is that they will turn out like the caricature you assume we are all like. And I think your bit is nothing but a reflection of that fear which has turned into real resentment. 

But might I also suggest that you consider the implications of this prejudice not just morally but financially. Your decision to cast aside my age group seems especially ill-conceived because we represent a major demographic that has gotten behind you in your recent climb into the national spotlight. We love you. We sell out your shows, we travel for you. We like how you think because you are honest and you don't give a shit. But at the same time we like you because you are reasonable and down to earth and generally kind in an otherwise hostile world. Older people think you are crass or too liberal. Seinfeld was the greatest sitcom of all time because the show was about real life situations. It reminds us of the humor in our everyday lives (because ultimately it's all about us right). Today a lot of people have picked up a scent that whatever fame does to people it did it to Jerry. In his latest broadcasting effort he is seen driving around priceless antique cars trying to pry esoteric conversations out of comics who still get what “real” is. Your audience is much smarter than you think, and we will detect you the minute you're a fraud. Be careful with us, because if we turn on you nobody spreads information faster.

To briefly conclude, obviously I know that you are a comic and it's supposed to be lighthearted. But there is something truthful and meaningful in comedy that is equally as powerful as the emotion we feel from drama. In that same bit you recognize the scale of the stage you have, and the importance of what you say—you said “It's a heavy responsibility. A lot of jobs you affect one person at a time, but I affect sometimes thousands of people.” Well, this is me taking you seriously. I truly enjoy your sense of humor which is why I felt compelled to stick up for my peers. Because I think we have potential.

My generation is going to have to be unified, more so than yours was. We can't be as greedy for material wealth or as negligent of environmental health or as insensitive to foreign cultures. The ramifications of the actions of the past are starting to be made present. We can't keep living in complete excess and we can't keep pushing off problems. My generation was born into this fucked up situation that we didn't create and a lot us are acting to undo the things we see as wrong through means both extremely creative and thoughtful.

Again, fuck you a little bit and regards. The next beer is on me.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/19un5o/company_announced_that_companywide_compensation/,"I started with my company as an intern in June 2011 at $15/hr and became a full-time employee in May 2012 at $45k/yr as a web developer. I feel that with my current salary and responsibilities, I'm being under-compensated, but took the initial salary of $45k/yr, because it was my first opportunity to work as a developer.

From my first start as an intern, I've been working on important projects that have been directly sold to customers as flagship products (something I wrote almost 2 years ago and was shelved will be implemented in a future product starting in a few weeks). **So despite only being a working professional for less than a year, I feel that my development experience at the professional level is almost reaching 2 years.**

When compensation talks begin, should I take my experience as an intern into account and try to leverage a salary more close to that of a developer with almost 2 years of experience? For what it's worth, I'm aiming for $63-64k/yr, and while it's a big jump, I'm with a successful start-up that is doing quite well financially and only has a staff of 11 total (only 3 of us are developers).

Is my salary range reasonable by your estimate and what do you think I can do to make that request more of a reality for when these compensation talks begin?

Just like saying twenty year olds have no value, which again, fuck you a little bit for saying.
	Everybody is a product of their upbringing. I think you get that, and being a father it scares you with how to raise your girls. It should. Obviously you are aware that your kids are privileged and your fear is that they will turn out like the caricature you assume we are all like. And I think your bit is nothing but a reflection of that fear with has turned into real resentment. 
	But might I also suggest that you consider the implications of this bit not just morally but financially. Your decision to cast aside my age group seems especially ill-conceived because we represent a major demographic that has gotten behind you in your recent climb into the national spotlight. We love you. We sell out your shows, we travel for you. We like how you think because you are honest and you don't give a shit. But at the same time we like you because you are reasonable and down to earth and generally kind in an otherwise hostile world. Older people think you are crass or too liberal. Seinfeld was the greatest sitcom of all time because the show was about real life situations. It reminds us of the humor in our everyday lives (because ultimately it's all about us right). Today a lot of people have picked up a scent that whatever fame does to people it did it to Jerry. In his latest broadcasting effort he is seen driving around priceless antique cars trying to pry esoteric conversations out of comics who still get what “real” is. Your audience is much smarter than you think, and we will detect you the minute you're a fraud. Be careful with us, because if we turn on you nobody spreads information faster.
	To briefly conclude, obviously I know that you are a comic and it's supposed to be lighthearted. But there is something truthful and meaningful in comedy that is equally as powerful as the emotion we feel from drama. In that same bit you recognize scale of the stage you have, and the importance of what you say—you said “It's a heavy responsibility. A lot of jobs you affect one person at a time, but I affect sometimes thousands of people.” But then you go on to say some thoughtless agist shit. I truly enjoy your sense of humor which is why I felt compelled to stick up for my peers. Because I think we have potential.
	My generation is going to have to be unified, more so than yours was. We can't be as greedy for material wealth or as negligent of environmental health or as insensitive to foreign cultures. The ramifications of the actions of the past are starting to be made present. We can't keep living in complete excess and we can't keep pushing off problems. My generation was born into this fucked up situation that we didn't create and a lot us are acting to undo the things we see as wrong through means both extremely creative and thoughtful.

Again, fuck you a little bit and regards. The next beer is on me.

It's not the neatest video, I'm not looking at the camera and the sound is bad. But I know this so spare me the criticism.

However, Ive been aspiring to become a copywriter for three years and have interned over the last two summer's. I need as many 'like's' of this video as part of a competition the organization is holding.

19u6db,3,2013-03-07,Question about references.,not_a_creative_alias,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/19u6db/question_about_references/,"Hey guys.

I'm currently working with some recruiters to help me land a job. I recently finished up my degree in Dec 2012 so I'm a new grad to the job market in Toronto. Anyway I had 3 ""internships"" during my undergrad, the first two of these were unpaid, and the only real one I did was my most recent one last summer which had some pretty good work. 
So I was literally working with one person in an office during my last internship. My boss said that he would be happy to write me a reference letter after I left. He hasn't done it yet because he forgot, and I didn't want to remind him until someone would actually be asking. I have a potential lead now with a recruiter and the recruiter said they would check references at the end. My only real reference could be from my last internship and that's only a letter because my boss is a busy guy and is out of town a lot. He may not always be available. The other two unpaid internships I did, I'm not sure if the folks I worked with would remember me. I'm pretty sure that I could get my boss from my first unpaid internship to confirm I worked with him, but not sure about the second one. 

Anyway I'm just concerned about what I should do because it doesn't seem this is good enough. How well does a reference letter work? I'm sure people would have their suspicions of it being fabricated and stuff. Also how should I handle this if I have multiple potential jobs asking for references? Because I'm not sure how my previous bosses would react having a bunch of people calling them asking about me."
19u56e,8,2013-03-07,A budding relationship and a possible job. About to make one of the biggest decisions of my life...,askgbthrowaway,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/19u56e/a_budding_relationship_and_a_possible_job_about/,"Background information: I’m 22, he’s 20. I’m in my senior year of college and he’s a sophomore, and we go to rival universities about an hour apart. We met online (OKC) in mid January, and for what it’s worth, he initiated contact. 

We skyped a few times and texted quite a bit, and we went on our first date in early February. We’ve continued to chat on a fairly regular basis, and we had another date last week. I had a long weekend, so we were able to find some time that fit with our work schedules. I went up to visit him and the plan from the beginning was that I was going to spend the night. He mentioned something about hanging out with his friends for awhile, which I was fine with but I wanted to spend the majority of the time with him. When we were heading out the door to go to the ‘party’ (in the loosest sense of the word, it was pretty lousy), he asked if I could drive because he didn’t have much gas, and so that he could drink as well. I said that it was fine, and then he requested if we could stop and get a bottle of liquor to take to the party. I agreed (it’s a douche move to show up to a BYOB party without booze), and so we stopped to get a decent bottle of vodka and some mixers. We got to the party at about 10 and ended up staying til 1. I didn’t know anyone there other than him, and he was pretty buzzed and everyone else was tanked. I wasn’t angry or anything, but I was getting kind of frustrated that we were spending so much time there and that I wasn’t able to partake in the drinking. 

We finally left the party and he was coming down from his buzz, and we had a pretty good discussion on the way back to his place. We talked about our previous experiences (we’re both pretty new to the game) and candidly discussed previous dating issues that we’ve had in the past.  Neither of us had any sort of major issue or anything, and we both talked about how previous dates have led us on and agreed that no matter what happened, we would tell the other person if we weren’t interested even if it meant being a bit blunt. We just got back to his apartment at that point, and so we went upstairs with the bottle of vodka and mixers in tow—it wasn’t opened at the party, so he grabbed it on the way out—and each poured ourselves a drink. We both got buzzed, and chatted again for awhile and started to watch a movie. We were on the couch in his living room and I leaned in for a kiss, and so of course we had the requisite makeout session. He suggested moving into his room “for cuddling”, and I figured that was probably a good idea because his roommate was going to be coming home soon. We made out and cuddled in there for a bit, and things escalated a bit. We took off our shirts and were just in boxers for awhile, kissed and groped a bit, and then a hand job. We never did BJs/anal though, and didn’t go all out because I suggested that we wait for a future time to do that; some time when we were both sober. He was okay with that, and we kissed and cuddled for another hour or so before finally falling asleep in each other’s arms.  We woke up about two hours before I had to leave the next afternoon, and spent about an hour and a half of it cuddling and making out again before we got in the shower, tag teamed breakfast, and then I left to drive home at the same time he had to leave for work.

We’ve been chatting almost daily since then, and we’re on spring break right now so I was hoping that we’d have a chance to hang out again but it appears that that’s not happening this week. He was in my city today for an appointment and a job interview, and I knew about this on our last date and asked him last night if he wanted to get coffee or do lunch after he was done with his errands, but he said that he’d rather spend the day with his parents. That’s fine and dandy, and I’m totally fine with it, but then he started texting me later this evening saying that he was bored and wanted it to be summer. I didn’t bring up the topic of hanging out tonight since he already declined, though, and figured if he wanted to, he’d do it. Then he asked me what I was doing (filling out applications for other jobs relating to my major and working on internship planning), and we discussed that for a little while (more on that in a bit) but he only replied with one and two word answers.  I got busy doing some other stuff and so we ceased conversation for the night. Again, not that there’s anything wrong with this, just providing some context for tonight’s events and what’s going to be impacted by a major decision that I have to make shortly. 

Here’s where the job/internship stuff comes in.  I graduate in May, and then I have an internship over the summer that is set up through my university. The internship is required for everyone in my major and it’s technically a graduation requirement even though it takes place after the official graduation date.  We’re allowed to pick the company with which we want to work, and I’ve narrowed my preferred choices down to my top three: one in my city, one in a big city about two hours away, and one in his city. It’s at this point that I need to add that I was considering the job in his city before I even knew he existed, but I am definitely more interested now that I know he’s there. There’s also a very strong chance that I will be hired by the company with which I do my internship, as about 90% of graduates of my degree are snatched up right after the internship.

Now that that lengthy litany of background information is done, I have several things on which I would like to hear some advice:

1.	When is a good time to bring up the conversation about being exclusive? I have dated a few guys before but I have never been in a legitimate relationship, and he has dated a guy for about a month before but has never had anything long-term. We both expressed interest in going for a long term commitment in the past, and I’m still pulling for it.

2.	I’m really undecided about my internship. I’m okay with working for the company in my city, but it’s my third choice. My first choice is the job in the big city, and I know a bunch of friends who live there as well so it would be a blast. The company in his city is my second choice, it’s a very good company and he’s there, but I don’t really know anyone else up there. I only know one other person from there, and we dated for a little while last year but then he royally fucked me over. Part of me wants to take the position in the big city, but the rest of me wants to take the job in his city, especially if we end up in a long term relationship. If I take the big city position, though, we’ll be three hours apart and that just isn’t going to work out in the long run.
 
3.	How should I approach the situation regarding him and the internship? I’m concerned and I don’t want to come across as being desperate or clingy, but this is a pretty big decision.  I want to ask him his opinion on the internship sites, and I am indeed interested in the job that’s in his town. Is it wrong of me to want to be in a relationship with him or at least have it blatantly clear that it’s part of the reason why I’m considering this position over the other one? I still have two more weeks to think about the jobs before I have to submit my final paperwork for my internship, but that really isn’t a lot of time. I honestly can’t decide which position I want right now—the big city vs. his city are in a dead tie right now."

But my goddamn phone has a wallet case, with my cards and IDs in it. The only non expired ID I have right now is my green card, in my phone. To replace it, I'd need my UK passport, which expired. My learner's permit also just expired. So I was basically fucked and at risk of deportation.
Freaked out for an hour in my office trying to figure out what to do. Looked for the phone everywhere in case I missed it. Nothing. Suddenly I remembered the ""find my phone"" feature that came with iCloud, used it... It was in the fucking building the whole time; I found it on the floor under some canvases, so it must have slipped out of my pocket. I'm typing on that phone now.

More importantly, I had a major panic attack over basically nothing for a whole hour in front of my boss, my intern, and a board member. My boss even fucking tweeted about the ""crisis"" afterwards. I think it's safe to say I need help treating this because it is becoming a detriment to my life.

I just feel so embarrassed and ashamed and humiliated that they all know about my ""crazy"" and I'm worried it'll affect our interactions in the future.  And it's 5 hours later and I keep getting bouts of tensing up, hyperventilating and sobbing for really no reason at all. I can't take this, it's awful. All I have is Klonopin from the last time I attempted to get medical help and that isn't helping at all.

We all come from different experience, we all make mistakes which shape who we are today. It is really hard for me to write this, probably because after nearly five years I still obsessively think about a mistake I made. I constantly obsess about it ruining my life. I realize this is unhealthy, and I have done my best to move on. I hope that writing about it will help me move on.

Background info: when I was 20 I shoplifted and was arrested because I also had marijuana and a pipe on me. I hope someone can relate to this but I was a completely different person back then. I was struggling with severe depression, and was attempting to recover from a fairly severe eating disorder which lasted a total of about five years. I was still some what malnourished and also suicidal. That young version of my self had completely forgotten about the consequences behind my actions because I did not believe I would be alive at 25. I was planning on killing myself, so I think a part of me decided that I could ride on any impulse until I carried out my plan. When the incident occurred, I was given a second chance. I completed probation, told my psychologist about my plan to kill myself, got more treatment, and literally turned my life around. It was the best and worst thing to ever happen to me. I was not convicted, my file is ""sealed"" and all cases are dismissed and the guilty plea is withdrawn.

Fast forward five years, and here I am. Constantly worrying that this will ruin my life. I was accepted into a few graduate schools. I did not lie on any applications. I disclosed the incidents when it was necessary, and on others it only asked about current indictments or convictions. It is my understanding that I did not need to disclose the incident. I was careful about this.

My dilemma is this: one school which I got into is more expensive and not my top choice, however they accepted me knowing my situation. An internship is not required. But this school is far more expensive. Another school which accepted me is my top choice, however an internship is required and the school did not require me to disclose the incident. It is affordable, but I am worried about the small chance that upon trying to complete the internship no one will hire me worst case scenario. I would not be able to complete the program if this happened. It is hard to judge how likely this is or not.

Am I making a bigger deal about this than I should be? Which school would you choose? In the end would I rather have alot of student loans and have a degree (it could total up to 100k), but I feel as though the risk is small if I chose the other school it is a better fit by far. I did not lie on the application so they could not dismiss me because I did not fully disclose.

I don't know how I can not feel ashamed about myself even though it happened five years ago. The circumstances are true, but I feel as though people will always be judging me negatively. When I think about my past I feel like I was my body and mind was hijacked. I am not that person any more.

I appreciate any type of feedback or perspective.

Don't ask me why but walking into somewhere in the domain and just asking for the most expensive thing on the menu makes me feel like a boss. If anyone around my age would like to go to dinner with me then post a reply. Of course if you want any proof that I'm genuine then send a pm.
I already know that if anyone actually read this they would be skeptical as fuck. Which is understandable, but I'm just a lad that really just doesn't care very much for eating alone all time. 

Edit: Should probably something a bit about myself. I've played drums for the last 12 years. A lot of experimental rock. Music you could only love if you where on lsd... :D yeah.. other than that I make video games. In Ireland I study in the University of Limerick. Video games development is the course but it's basically just computer science. I some how managed to get an internship for a few months in North Austin and so far it's been fantastic but meeting people hasn't been overly easy. After work I just get very bored. Weekends are worse. Just trying to reach out now anyway.   "

I am 17, a junior in high school and I do not have a job. However, I have a paid internship coming up over the summer for 8 weeks (~$1200, though most of it will go to saving), and hopefully that will be followed by a job. Of course, I am not going to have money any time really soon to get a pricey contraption sent down by the Gods to give beautiful coffee. 

I have an AeroPress and a French Press, in addition to my mom's Keurig that I occasionally make a quick cup with the coffee I grind in my Mr. Coffee burr grinder. I am looking into an espresso machine...

Now, I don't have a specific price range, other than *low*. Try to catch the notion that for $100 to get a *good* machine vs. $150 for a **great** machine, I'd go with the latter. I'm ok with waiting to save up money, but I need a good espresso machine that will get the job done *well* and is known to last. Fancy flair, gold paint and flames aren't necessary if you catch my drift. What should I look to save up for?

All opinions welcome, I'll look into anything you point out. Thanks a lot everyone."

19th04,1,2013-03-06,Just want to know if anyone else feels what I do,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/19th04/just_want_to_know_if_anyone_else_feels_what_i_do/,"Hi, Reddit world.
I've been struggling lately with a few things that I've self-diagnosed as something between social anxiety and perfectionism. The only person I really talk to about my struggles is my boyfriend, and as supportive as he is, I don't want to overburden him, so I figured I'd try sharing here. 

I'm in my 20s, in college and generally really happy with my life, which makes it hard to articulate exactly what's wrong. I guess I'll just start with small things and hope it paints a picture of what I'm going through.
I work for my university in a job related to my major. Before that I worked at a series of really great jobs that look awesome on my resume. And at all these things I've been successful, but I'm almost always miserable about work. Ever since I was little I've had perfectionist tendencies. I hold myself to really high standards and have always been bad at dealing with criticism, real or perceived. As I get older, and become more and more successful, my self-doubt and anxiety about not being regarded as great at my job, the best student intern they've ever had, a person that other students respect, etc. is only growing. No matter how good a day starts, I can get thrown off by the slightest thing. For example, I've had nothing but positive feedback so far at my job, but any time I have even the smallest interaction with my boss I obsess over what I should have said or done differently or what he thinks of me. If he responds to an email in a way that seems shorter than usual or he doesn't compliment me on work I submit, I feel awful for the rest of the day, unless I do something to distract myself.

I hope I'm not coming across as arrogant, because in reality I feel the exact opposite. Well, it's weird. I have this strange combination of confidence in my abilities but then sometimes crippling self-doubt. I'm extremely ambitious, but that's not to say I always work hard. I can be kind of lazy actually. I don't go to class. I'm not graduating this spring even though it's my fourth year. But professionally, I've done more in my field than most other students. I'm ready to get started on my career and just hate wasting time in GE science classes.
Along with this stuff about work, I've also withdrawn socially over the past year. I have some friends but prefer to be alone and with my boyfriend. Maybe that's not such a bad thing, I guess it just stands out to me because I feel like I've changed and live a lot more in my head than I used to. I used to be a lot more social but now being around other people just makes me anxious. Though I've always been a pretty awkward person around people I'm not comfortable with.

I don't know, I guess what I'm looking for is a. confirmation that I'm not the only one in the world who struggles like this. and b. maybe some help in stopping the cycle of negative thinking that turns what should be a good day into a bad one.

Since reddit has helped me so much with self improvement, I thought I can share my experience with prospect and young Chemical Engineers. I left some [comments] (http://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/zn56f/what_kinds_of_hobbies_or_activities_build/c80omhw?context=3) before, and here is a bullet pointed summary of those comments.

Looking for a descent job in industry after undergraduate.

* Internship or Co-op experience
* GPA around or above 3.5
* Proof of good social skills. (gets involved in AICHE, academic and social fraternity.)

Looking for a descent graduate school

* Research experience in undergraduate
* GPA above 3.7 (for at least top 10~20 schools)
* 3 Recommendations (build a good relationship with professors.)

Looking for a perfect Resume.

* Intership, Co-op, Research experience.
* GPA between 3.95-4.00
* An executive position in some organization. (i.e. AICHE, student government, Omega Chi Epsilon, Alpha Chi Sigma)
* Teaching Assistant (it was only offered to high GPA students at my school.)
* Win awards. such as in Undergraduate Symposium (where you compete by presenting your research)
* Join all the honor society (including the ones that you don't even need to attend a single meeting or initiation.)
* Get Summa Cum Laude, Distinguished Honor (must do senior thesis), and Dean's List
* good recomendations


Planning for semesters

* 1st semester: build your network which will be your foundation for getting an executive position. drink hard, study hard. Attend all the AICHE meetings.
* 2nd semester: Look for research for the summer. Experimental graduate student usually want to get a lot of data during the summer by abusing undergraduate (but it's a win-win). Hit professors with e-mail that you are interested in his/her research and you would like to build experience.(I may post another about how to write e-mail to professors about getting a research position.) If you don't get a position, take summer classes to get ahead of other students. (summer classes are often easier to get As and a good opportunity to get lead of gen ed. classes.) Also, if you can, get an AICHE position, or whatever organization you are involved in.
* 3rd semester: If you could, continue your research. Work hard, drink hard. look for organization positions. develop leadership.
* 4th semester: If you were able to maintain high GPA with research + AICHE position, you may be eligible for internship at the end of sophomore year. When in doubt, write your resume including your high school stuff. Get it proof read at the career office at school. get elevator pitch ready with nice professional suite, and hit the career fair (usually in early spring). If you get an internship, great for you. If not, sophomores usually don't get an internship position anyway (good learning experience.). Either spend summer doing internship or research + classes. Also keep your eyes open for TA opportunity. You may talk people in the department office to ask how they run TAs for undergraduate.
* 5th semester: You will probably have less time for drinking now, but some people sacrifice their studying time to drink. It's fine to do that. I think memory is as important as your GPA. Do the same things over and over.
* 6th semester: This semester is crucial because this is when undergraduates get internships and co-op. Do the things that I mentioned above(resume checked, elevator checked, suite checked, company background checked), and hit the career fair. Socialize, and get a position in an organization. Look for Teaching Assistant opportunity. If you have been doing research, you may get an opportunity to participate in Undergraduate Symposium. Do it! spend summer meaningfully
* 7th - 8th semester: If you have been researching take Senior thesis. Look for jobs.

Tips

* Do your best to maintain high GPA. It all comes down to how much passionate you feel towards academics, and your capability to cope with stress.
* Socialize, build your network. It's a small world, and there are so much possibilities that you will benefit from your friends.
* Focus for Graduate school: Research, high GPA, academics, independent study 
* Focus for Industry with bachelor degree: Internship, 3.5 GPA, social skill, leadership

I know there are a lot of successful chemical engineers out here in this sub-reddit! I know you are great and you should help other young engineers by adding tips on comments!

Corporate Trundle

Model: Business Suit, sunglasses, hair patted down with excessive amounts of hair gel, very sleazy appearance overall. Uses a rolled-up newspaper as a club.

Q- Rabid Bite: Trundle grabs the enemy and yells in their face-
""GET BACK TO WORK!""
""WHERE'S THAT REPORT?""
""YOU'RE ON THIN ICE!""

W - Contaminate: sewage pipes appear over the area -
""The smell of big business.""
""Gotta put our garbage SOMEWHERE.""

E - Pillar of Filth: A model of a skyscraper appears, with a model of a city block over the slowing area -
""I think I'm gonna build seven of these!""
""I need this NOW! RIOT PLEASE!""
""Going up!""

R - Agony: Trundle throws a bunch of cell phones and pagers onto the target, which ring repeatedly.
""YOU'RE WORKING OVERTIME.""
""Gonna need you to come in on Sunday...""

Passive - Decompose: If trundle is standing still and his passive goes off, have a chance of him pulling out a cup of coffee and sipping it -
""TOOK LONG ENOUGH.""
""At least these interns are good for SOMETHING...""

Joke - ""Don't hate the player... unless I pay you to that is!""

Taunt - ""You think you're that strong? Maybe I'll just ring up my friend Morello and let him know how you feel...""

Hidden passive - Corporate Mundo's q does 1 bonus true damage to Corporate Trundle. Corporate Trundle's q does 1 bonus true damage to Corporate Mundo. Triggers Quotes -
Mundo - ""GET BACK TO MAIL ROOM.""
Trundle - ""I'M THE BOSS NOW, AND YOU'RE FIRED.""

What I need to know is will they interview me before they test me? If I fuck up the interview (perhaps even unintentionally; I don't really want this job in the first place), will they just tell me ""thanks, but no thanks"" and send me away without testing for drugs?

Ultimately it's my decision whether or not I work there, and I'll shoot it down if there's a reasonable chance I'll still be tested. But, it would look suspicious to my parents if I'm so eager to get out of it, rather than leave my options open. And to be clear, I'm not choosing weed over a job I want or need, this offer isn't even relevant to my major in the slightest (plant sciences/ethnobotany), and it just happens to have the fatal disadvantage of gov't-funded follicle testing.

I've been a lurker on /r/chemistry for a while now. I took a glance over at the rules and I don't think this is breaking any of them, but if I am please let me know.

Anyway, I know this is an out of the ordinary approach, but I'm looking for an internship doing some sort of chemistry this upcoming summer. I'm based in New Jersey, so it would have to be somewhere around either NYC or Philadelphia (I can do either city). A little about me: I'm currently finishing my sophomore year at a major university in Massachusetts. I'm a Chemistry major and a Environmental Studies  minor. I've finished General and Organic Chemistry with lab, as well as two semesters of Physical Chemistry.

I can submit a resume and fill out whatever forms would be required, as well as give you any sort of additional information. I had to be pretty vague in this post, for the sake of anonymity, but if you'd like to learn more, just send me a message.

So, if you can help out a fellow redditor, that would be awesome. Like I said, I don't know if this kind of post is allowed, but can you blame me for trying? If you can't help, if you could comment on how you obtained your undergraduate internships, that would be extremely helpful to me. Thank you all!"

19xeb4,1,2013-03-08,Question on intern hours post PharmD.,pharmathrowaway88,pharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/19xeb4/question_on_intern_hours_post_pharmd/,"I have a long complicated story which I won't go into. Basically, I am a pharmacy student working for a major chain in the US and I'm about to graduate. I've had issues logging my hours and went to a faculty advisor who hit me with some pretty odd information.

He said basically if the chain I work for knows if I have a PharmD, they would no longer let me work as a tech for them after I graduate.  A point to note here is that I was not hired as an intern for their company (due to the chain's financial position apparently) so I was put into the system as a regular tech just so I could work.  The way my advisor put it was that (at least in my state? EDIT: Pennsylvania) **that people with a PharmD are not allowed to work as technicians.**  I wasn't sure if this was just policy of the chain or in general but he seemed to make out that this is the case elsewhere too.  That sort of irked me.  Why would a PharmD *limit* someone from being a technician if they wanted? Sure it's not nearly going to pay as much, but to not be allowed to work because of that credential seems silly.  A PharmD technician would be just as good as any other tech. I thought I remember hearing of a pharmacist who, later in life, decided to become a tech because financially they could, and they wanted less responsibility. And what of people who don't have intern hours upon graduation? Sure it would delay getting licensed, but post-graduation would leave plenty of time to make up the hours you're missing.  Was what I told completely wrong? Did I just misunderstand?  Otherwise, this just seems wrong to me.  "

Who do I talk to? LA or DC Recruiters?
Do I wait until I get an offer near the end of the summer (if I get one at all, but 90% do)? 
Are big city transfers common, DC to LA, NYC etc. - I feel like they must have demand in all those cities so is it really that big of an issue?

I graduated from Georgia Tech in December 2010, and spent over a year unemployed. I've been underemployed for the last year, and I hate the world and everyone in it but I am really just angry at myself, blah blah, a familiar story. I have gotten advice and reviewed, rewritten, revamped, retooled, incinerated and wholly rebuilt my resume numerous times in the past two years and then some, and I've never had any success whatsoever. I have not gotten so much as a single interview outside of a few minimum wage jobs.

So, all that said, I am simply at a loss, and thus have turned to /r/resumes for critique on the current state of my resume.

Here is the resume and a couple of notes: 

https://www.dropbox.com/s/4uygwakjpemnklv/Resumeforreddit.pdf

Yes, I changed all my contact information, and I have only once used the Pisshands moniker in applying for a job. It actually got me in the door for an internship interview, but I performed horribly in the interview, didn't get the gig and subsequent resume note, and now here we are: at home during the day on a week day, crying into a grilled cheese.

Additionally, the final section of my resume is for jobs within the gaming industry only. I would think this obvious, but there you go. I axe it when applying outside the industry.

I have been looking for technical writing, marketing and video production/editing work, primarily within the video game industry. 

Yeah, fairly niche. No wonder I'm not finding work. And sad. And poor. And fat.

19xcq3,1,2013-03-08,I [24M] recently broke up with the girl [22F] I love over differing dreams and ambitions. Have I made a mistake? [X-Post from /r/relationships],lovemeorleavemeplz,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/19xcq3/i_24m_recently_broke_up_with_the_girl_22f_i_love/,"I have been dating this wonderful girl for 7 months until recently. I lost my job a little over a month ago, which has caused extreme stress in our relationship. I was relocated to Chicago after my job and have never quite managed to fit in to the place. With grad school and other options, plus the fact that I want to return home to NY (She is from Chicago), we have recently been on a very rocky road.

She is beautiful. A talented musician with a promising band. I enjoy her company. Although our passions and hobbies are not identical, we understand and respect each other's. The sex is fantastic. She is kind and generous. I am madly in love with her. At the same time, she is headstrong (so am I). She is constantly broke. She dreams, whereas I am realistic. Oh, and loyal, she is so incredibly loyal, which is very important to me.

While I do believe that she is very talented at music, and could in fact make something of herself there, she seems to only have ambition to this dream and not anywhere else in her life. Her 3 day work weeks are not enough to pay for her rent. To make matters worse, she spends every penny she has until her debit card declines her. On her third year of college, she decided music wasn't for her and dropped out. She claims she would like to return so that she can become a veterinarian or train animals (both things require a lot of schooling that she never got as a music major.)

I know that I am not a perfect person either. I too can be self centered and difficult. While I do spend money myself, it is what I earned. I worked a high paying job with long hours and I tend to be frugal. My ambitions and goals are related to my profession and hobbies (and wishful hobbies like flying). I lost my job and am now applying to Grad Schools as well as internships and jobs (In NYC and Chicago)

Losing my job has placed a tremendous stress on us. For one thing, the stress of not knowing where I will be in 2-5 months has been causing us to treat each other terribly. Glances that used to cause instant happiness now incite anger and resentment. Another reason is that I feel that I must look at her as future-wife-material. If I were to bring her to NYC, it would be no different than putting a ring on her finger. And we both feel that we are too young to get married. (Though I have had a few serious girlfriends in the past, I have never considered marriage until her.) She says that I don't look at her the same way and cherish her as I used to. While I know that she is right, I don't know if it has more to do with assessing future-wife-material vs normal relationship aging dynamics.

And so now, I don't know what to do. We broke up recently, and though I thought she would break up with me, I think I broke up with her. (God that sounds so teenager haha) But I have to wonder whether I am doing the right thing or wrong. If you really love someone, when do you draw the line on your own personal needs and wishes for the other person to be? Can I expect that she will change and become more responsible for herself, or am I right to call things off now, before I fall harder for someone that has the opposite values as me?

TL;DR Boy loves girl and girl loves boy. Boy's dreams and ambitions do not match girl's. Should boy love girl and overlook her flaws or find another girl?"

19x10m,1,2013-03-08,Fantastic article by Jack Baruth on the Geneva Motor Show.  Posted on ttac.com,[deleted],cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/19x10m/fantastic_article_by_jack_baruth_on_the_geneva/,"Really wanted to share this.  I'm in no way affiliated with TTAC.com.  Unless being a reader/commenter is affiliated.



Full disclosure: While my business-class compatriots were living it up in Geneva, I was sitting at home in Ohio, waiting anxiously for the Fed-Ex-mishap-delayed arrival of something called a “Modern Eagle NOS Brazilian” and letting my three-year-old son watch The Lost World in HD. I’d forgotten that there was a part where the T. Rex bites a hapless civilian in half. “There’s meat inside people, if you’re a hungry dinosaur and you can’t find a ‘ceratops to eat,” the boy opined upon seeing the scene. Oh, well. Nature, red in tooth and claw, and all that.

It’s reasonable, therefore, that I might be personally bitter about the latest auto show and my failure to snag a seat on a charter flight to same. No surprise there. What is surprising is this: the people who went weren’t excited about the product either. Sure, they took Facebook pictures of their triple-seven sleeping pods and eighty-euro mystery dinners, but when it came to the actual rolling stock, the lack of enthusiasm among the professional enthusiasts could be viewed from space. Assuming, of course, you have an Internet connection in space and are willing to use it to read auto blogs. The closest thing to a universally acclaimed car at the show was a diesel version of a sporty hatchback. That’s like getting worked up over Diet Dr. Pepper.

The responsibility for this dismal state of affairs can be clearly laid at the feet of three companies. Porsche, Ferrari, and Lamborghini were given a chance to render automotive equivalents of Miss Alex Morgan in steel, aluminum, and carbon fiber. Instead, they chose to give us Honey Boo-Boo’s mother, Snooki, and Janet Reno in a Predator mask, respectively.

Start with the reprehensible new 991-generation 911 GT3. The press is experiencing a collective aneurysm regarding the mandatory PDK, and well they should. The excuse given by the truck-builders at Stuttgart that PDK is faster around a racetrack doesn’t wash. Nobody buys a GT3 to go quickly around a racetrack, unless they are suffering from dementia. The list of cars that will handily embarrass a GT3 around a racetrack includes:

    Pretty much every $15,000 dedicated race car ever, including those ones with the V-twin snowmobile engines
    Fox Mustangs with big wings on them
    The Nissan GT-R
    A little thing that Americans like to call the CORVETTE Z06
    Vipers
    and many more!

GT3s are purchased for two reasons. One, they’re fun to drive, so the mandatory PDK in the new one kind of stabs that in the proverbial ball sack. Two, they have traditionally had the old, hyper-durable, GT1-based engine. The new GT3 makes do with an uprated version of the new-gen boxer which makes great numbers in the current 991 but has yet to prove itself as a lasting proposition. This is good news for anybody who owns a 997 GT3: you probably just joined me and my 993 in the Land Where Depreciation No Longer Applies In Any Meaningful Sense. Congratulations. I’ll see you at the next PCA open house. Remember, when you see a Z06 behind you, be sure to wave him by with disdain. We’re told that the new motor makes up for its dirt-cheap construction and totally plebian roots by having all sorts of titanium and whatnot in it. As an experienced Porsche owner, I read that as a warning rendered in sixty-foot tall neon-lit letters, and the text of the warning is

HOLY SHIT THIS IS GONNA COST MONEY WHEN IT SUFFERS FROM SOME WEIRD ENGINE FAILURE THAT SOMEHOW NEVER AFFECTED ANY GENERATION OF THE GEO METRO

The banners flapping proudly in front of Porsche’s corporate headquarters will be cut down and cunningly fashioned into clothing for puppets acting in plays that will re-enact the shame and humiliation involved in telling your Viper-owning neighbor why your titanium-coated titanium rods didn’t make it to the ten-thousand-mile mark. Let’s not even discuss the electronic rear-steer, which is something even the Japanese couldn’t make work reliably and is therefore an almost certain bet to be disconnected and/or removed by the Porschephiles unlucky enough to be unable to afford a 997 GT3 instead of this contraption fifteen years from now.

The reviews for the new car will be spectacular, but we all understand that is because Porsche’s PR department won’t permit anything else and don’t you want to fly business class to Europe? Oh yes you do.

At least the GT3 is priced within greedy-fingered reach of the working Goldman Sachs intern, something that can’t be said about the ridiculous “LaFerrari”. Someone forgot to tell the Maranellians that hypercars are supposed to be more desirable than supercars. The LaFerrari looks like a 458 with a thyroid disorder. It’s far from beautiful but it isn’t beautiful from far. Instead, it’s merely aggressive to a fault.

I have a theory as to why the new LaFerrari and its competitors look the way they do, and it is this: Even if you don’t completely buy into the romantic old notion of Seventies supercar buyers as wealthy, educated playboys and/or aristocrats, it’s certainly true that the men who bought the Miuras and Daytonas appreciated beauty. They wanted something gorgeous, and they wanted to be seen driving something gorgeous. There’s something about a Miura or even a original LP400 Countach that just brings out the car fan in people who normally despite things like Corvettes, Mustangs, or Porsches. They are statements of beauty. They’re expensive and impractical and difficult but all of those flaws are in the service of the goal, the same way we all understand that an Edward Green captoe cannot be used to kick-start a Honda CB550 too many times without splitting the leather. If you didn’t understand that, I’m telling you now, from miserable experience, okay?

Most people will forgive excess in the service of something beautiful, whether that something is a home, a dress, a watch, or an automobile. We may be jealous, we may carp about the environment or some garbage like that, but we will forgive. The problem is that the one-percenters of the globe no longer want that forgiveness. They don’t even want admiration. Rather, they want to impose the crass fact of their historically unsurpassed collective wealth and power directly upon our retinas. They demand aggression in the 44-ounce size, God damn it, and they want you to be as shocked and offended as possible. The LaFerrari isn’t beautiful on purpose. Ferrari knows how to build gorgeous cars. This is meant to be in your face. It’s a primal scream of wealth meant to be heard over the overwhelming Arabian din of AMGs and Panameras and Gallardos common as Corollas and every other gauche toy it’s possible to acquire with the limitless proceeds granted our betters by corrupt governments and tilted markets and insider information and thick, poisonous fluid left half a mile beneath your grandfather’s tent by the predations and expiration of Tyrannosaurus Rex himself. Beauty doesn’t enter the equation; the buyers wouldn’t recognize it anyway. If you want a vision of the future, imagine a four-story-tall press stamping aluminum into an inhumanly unattractive fascia — forever.

We are left in the position of the hapless radio listener who was once permitted a tiny slice of audio dynamic variation in his pop music, a quiet section of “Stairway” or the changes of “A Day In The Life” and now is given the inhuman 105dB compression of IMMA BE IMMA BE IMMA BE IMMA BE. The LaFerrari has to be louder than everything else around it or it has no reason to exist. We all knew the Enzo was ugly as sin compared to the F40 (let’s just pretend the F50 didn’t happen, okay?) but we forgave it because there was something lovely about the technical merit of that car, the simplicity and the performance. No longer. The LaFerrari. Menacing a Moscow valet near you.

But here comes the hotsteppin’ irony! The LaFerrari isn’t hideous enough! There’s a “misshapen gap” — and Ferrari is on the wrong side! Because the Lamborghini Veneno exists! The Veneno, which is named after the general concept of venereal disease, attempts to replicate in metal what it feels like to have the burning sensation of penile infection. (Sadly, your humble author can only guess at that particular sensation; my lack of business-class trips to Europe forces me to consort with relatively decent American ladies.) It’s all sharp edges and gaping rectums and Batmobile-inspired stupidity. It isn’t even really shaped like a proper car, not even in the general sense. With just 750 horsepower, it will be easy prey for hopped-up GT-Rs and nitrous-fed 1980 Thunderbirds, but that hardly matters because the sole purpose of this vehicle is to announce the owner’s ability to absolutely and completely waste three point nine million dollars.

The silhouette of the Veneno will be displayed in PowerPoint presentations throughout Estonia as each new generation of high-priced prostitute is rigorously drilled on how to distinguish this ridiculous but potentially profitable contraption from stealth fighters, unwanted Roy Lichtenstein sculptures, and head-on collisions between a vinyl-wrapped Murcielago and a Sportback-equipped Pulsar NX. Seventy-year-old hedge fund managers will vie via proxy bid process with tattooed Yakuza honchos for the privilege of dislocating their hip with each monstrously undignified entry and exit. Somebody will make a kit that turns late-model Chevy S-10s into Veneno lookalikes, but due to a mistake in the Solidworks file the resulting machine will be considerably more graceful-looking and thus completely unacceptable!

Geneva gave us a Porsche optimized for a track time slower than that of a used Viper, a LaFerrari more properly titled the LaMentable, and a syphilis fever dream of a Lamborghini. But none of that was really given to us. It was given to the Masters of the Universe, the Eloi who converse in an increasingly tortured and meaningless dialect of exaggerated symbols and amplified display. We, the humans occupying the unwanted portions of the planet, received a diesel hatchback. So we can burn a fuel more amenable to CO2-centric regulations and still have red stripes on the grille. Except the GTD doesn’t seem to have any red stripes. Enjoy your diesel hatchback, you proles. No red stripe for you. Too much exuberance is bad for the environment and the polar bears and all the other stuff that depends on you cutting your consumption of plastic party cups but is, I swear, completely unaffected by the giant Eye of Sauron in China cranking out iPods in the suicide-inducing millions. Make sure you watch TV so you know how to vote next time, too. Try not to make a fuss or occupy any parks while you’re at it.

Luckily, the antidote for all this stupidity is probably reasonably close to your home. Go over to your local Chevrolet dealer and see if they’ll cut you a deal on a close-out six-speed manual “narrowbody” C6 Corvette. For forty thousand bucks or so, you should be able to pick up one without the frills which, frankly, don’t cut it in that car anyway. In your dedicated and properly-trained hands, it should be able to stay in view of any of the above-mentioned fopperies. If the engine died for no reason, which ain’t gonna happen by the way, you could get a new one at a junkyard. It’s not gorgeous, but it has a visual dignity all its own and some of the detailing is quite nice.

If the Vette isn’t your cup of tea, you could try a Mustang GT, which is even cheaper and is charming in its own way. Or a Challenger SRT-8. Or a Nissan 370Z. Or a Genesis Coupe. Or, yes, a Scion FR-S. There’s a lot of good metal out there for people who aren’t obsessed with humiliating their neighbor in a driveway faceoff or winning Cars and Coffee on a technicality. It’s never been cheaper, faster, or more reliable that it is right now. That’s the real story behind the Geneva show, and it’s one you can verify for yourself this weekend, right at home."

As of right now I will be entering in my last year of college and majoring in computer engineering, I've had internship and experience so I believe I will be hired shortly after graduation. I've also been working part-time at an engineering company for over a year while also attending school so I have a good income at the moment.

All my expenses right now are paid, my parents are kind and pay for my rent/expenditures, I also have scholarships that cover school. So right now everything I've made at has been put into a savings account with some ridiculous low interest rate


Any advice on what to do with my savings account? It's basically been sitting like that for over a year.
Sorry if I haven't provided enough information, I'm kind of new when it comes to Personal Finance.

19wzxx,28,2013-03-08,Approaching a crossroad....is photography really right for me?,replicat0r,photography,https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/19wzxx/approaching_a_crossroadis_photography_really/,"Hey guys, recently discovered this subreddit and has been hanging out here for a while, its been pretty awesome so far. The reason I made this post is for the veterans and the established photographers out there. 

Here is my short story..back in 2010, I was accepted into an international exchange program in sweden. Before I left, I knew it was gonna be an experience of a lifetime, so I used up most of my savings and bought myself a T2I DSLR with the 18-55mm kit lens. When I was overseas, I discovered that traveling there is relatively cheap, so I started going to places with my DSLR, I was quite novice at the time, armed with only basic knowledge of how to take pictures, such as the relationship btw iso, aperture, and shutterspeed. I did not know much about compositions, color etc. It was fun for me to take picture of the beautiful things around me. My interest in the subject started to rise, and I started to read books about photography, editing etc and went on more trips. I also started to invest in some more entry/mid level lens. I bought an 18-135mm to replace my kit lens, a sigma 10-20 for some landscape and a cheap tripod. During my travels, I met a austrian photography on one of my hiking trips and he was doing a star trail pictures. Now this really peaked my interests and I started learning things about taking night pictures, I became obsessed with filming the milky way. I have tried several times, and only have been successful once or twice to capture the magnificent beauty. I was quite proud of myself the first time a clear but grainy shot of the milkyway came through. I feel like I can really unleash my creativity and explore the world through the lens of my camera. 

Last year, I had an internship in south africa, I knew there was going to be a lot wildlife and my trusty 18-135mm will not be sufficient. So this time I invested in a 70-30mm Canon L lens. During my time in Africa, I went on several safari trips and took some amazing shots with my new lens. It is a mixture of euphoria, delight, excitement when your shot turned out better than you would have imagined in your wildest dreams. I often check out photography sites and blogs for inspirations, some shots that people have taken is really really amazing and it really makes me earn for my pictures to turn out like that! I realize that the picture counter on the camera does not measure much, its only been over 12000 shots for me. When I look back on it, it has been improving, but there is only somewhat of a handful picture that I am really proud of. Which brings me to question some things.. I really want to explore this subject more and invest in another lens, but part of me feel like I may not have the talent, or good enough to have those amazing shots that I see on photography sites and I may never be as good as them. Now I realize that its very natural to have 4 or 5 pictures out of 100 picture to be really good, but I sometimes feel that all those amazing shots i took are nothing but flukes.. and it was really just me being lucky instead being skilful. What I wish to do in the future is to go semi-pro, do this as a hobby but it can also generate a moderate amount of income. I would also like to build myself a nice portfolio to be really proud of when I look back to. 

So for the veterans out there.... what made you to walk on the path you walk on now? did you ever feel that you dont have the talent, or you are not good enough? or that one amazing shot you got was just a fluke and it may not happen again? 




Edit: Okay.. to give you guys a better perspective or idea..I have uploaded some shots of mine that I feel are decent, and are not ashamed of.. here it is

Does anyone have any suggestions? "
19wx9m,3,2013-03-08,Basically just need to output my thoughts and feelings. Thought this would be the place.,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/19wx9m/basically_just_need_to_output_my_thoughts_and/,"This post doesn't really have a point to it except getting out everything I'm thinking and feeling at the moment. I usually write my thoughts and feelings out in a word document or an email sent to the future (futureme.org) or something and it usually makes me feel a lot better, but lately I've done it a lot and I don't feel any better. I figured if I posted it publicly it make have a greater effect, knowing at least one person might skim through it and know what I've said.

I don't really know where to start. I just feel negative. I can't help it, I've tried telling myself I'm being irrational and I'm just in a negative state of mind but it isn't helping. Its like no matter how hard I try to rationalise myself happy again its no use. It makes me feel like I have n o control over my mood and its all caused by an imbalance of chemicals in the brain which I can't change, and that is a scary thought for me. It makes me feel hopeless, like no matter how much I remind myself of everything there is to be happy about and how my fears or worries are silly, I'll never be able to break out of this mood.

I've broken out of this negative mindframe before... I've felt on top of the world and I've told myself ""Wow, I feel great...I'll never feel like I did again!""... But I always do. I don't know what changes to make me feel so good, but its like I forget why I was so happy... Like its all to just to do with processes in the body as if I'm some sort of computer and I can't change it just by trying to be happy and grateful.

While I'm on this subject...I don't feel alive. At all. I mean, it just feels like my senses are numbed. Like I'm in some sort of life simulation where the human emotions module hasn't been coded completely. I don't feel my surroundings. I don't get joy out of anything anymore. I achknowledge that something is funny but I don't laugh at it. I don't feel like any of this is real so I don't have motivation to do anything...Because I don't really feel happiness or reward or anything, why would I have motivation? Motivation is all based on feeling some sort of gratification at the end of whatever you're doing, but right now I feel nothing. 

Its like I'm desensitized. Things that should make me feel happiness, like being with family and friends and walking outside on a warm sunny day, don't even register with my emotions. And things that should make me feel sad, like reading on sad stories on the internet or in the news, they don't effect me either. Its like I'm just reading information but I don't feel it. Everything is just numbers and facts and I process them but I never take them in. Nothing seems real. I spend a lot of time daydreaming. I feel anxious about life and the world, so I retreat back into my daydreams where I can be anything and I don't have to deal with the things on the outside. But I do have to deal with things on the outside, because I can't stay in my daydreams constantly, I have to keep waking up and dealing with the consequences of the life I've neglected whilst I was thinking about something obscure and irrelevant. 

I skipped a couple of classes this week... Told myself it was for my own good as it would give me time to compose myself and sort my head out which is more important, but I just spend that time drinking coffee, surfing the internet, daydreaming and masturbating. So I basically lie to myself, try and justify not wanting to go out. 

I'm learning German and I am currently taking optional classes at University. I never do any work outside of class even though I know I should. Learning a language is hard, it should be a full time thing but I just seem to float through it... Dreading the two-hour lesson at the end of each week, sitting through it and feeling relieved at the end of it and happy that I have another week until I have to do it again. Then I just put it to the back of my mind until 7 days later and I've not done any work for it and I haven't done the homework so then I feel anxious about going. I just skipped going today because I felt so shit. I tell myself I need to do more work for it but I never get round to it so then I feel guilty for not doing it. I want to learn the language, I'm hoping to do an internship over there next year and I know it could be the best time of my life if I only put the work in. I know its good for me, so why don't I have the motivation to do it? 

I seriously feel like I'm wasting away. I feel shit for neglecting all this important work that may basically define how well I do and the job I get in later life. I feel shit for not sticking to a regular exercise regime, and not sticking to a good diet and not sticking to budgetting my money. I know I need to do all these things now or else I'll feel shit about it later down the line. But I slip. I'll feel great at one point, make loads of changes in my life, but I'll have one bad day, everything goes down the drain and then I'm left feeling even shitter about letting everything go and I feel like I'm going down a spiral until I reach the point that I'm at now. And then I'll eventually pick myself up, perhaps from talking to someone about how I feel or maybe even writing this reddit post. I'll feel better, and I'll try and pick up from the situation I let myself get into (falling behind on work etc) and I'll slowly work myself back into a 'healthy' state of mind. But its never really solved, because sooner or later I have a bad day and I'm back down the spiral.

I just hate feeling negative and whiny and ungrateful. I'm a perfectly healthy, young, gifted, intelligent young man who is privileged to have been born in a country where I don't have to fear being killed everyday, where I'm not starving, where I the possibility to be whatever I want without any social restrictions holding me back. But yet I find things to moan at, and that just makes me feel even more guilt. I'm not making the most out of what I've got...If anything I'm wishing for more, which is pathetic. I just want to feel content. But I don't feel... anything. I just feel like everything is pointless. I think things over way too much. I think too much, about everything. I question everything. I'm too self conscious. I've got low self esteem. But I know I could do anything if I put my mind to it, and if I just simply forgot everything that holds me back, I could do whatever I wanted.

I don't know where to go from here. I still feel kind of empty. I know I'm going to close my laptop lid and everything I'm still upset about is going to be in my head. But I guess I feel a little weight off my shoulder.

I feel a little pathetic. I feel like I let myself and other people down by not having the strength to just be. I feel I'm not very likeable in my current state but deep down I'm one of the nicest people I know. I just don't have the will to show my real self. I don't think I currently possess the strength to stand up for myself or anything I believe in. I feel as if my opinions don't really matter, and I don't have the courage to voice them as I'll always be wrong, or people will try and counter my arguments and I'll have to stand my ground. 

I've always liked writing...Being creative. But I feel embarrassed by it. Because I don't think its what I should be into. I wouldn't be able to stand up and say that it is what I enjoy doing and it is what I'm interested in because for some reason I'm ashamed of it. I was never into sports or anything like that. I felt I didn't fit in to the 'guy' subculture at school or anything and just felt I shouldn't admit I was into writing because I'd be laughed at because I shouldn't be into that kind of thing and I should be into football or whatever. But I could never do football or sports or anything. I'm naturally clumsy but I'm also naturally creative (I have something you might not have heard of called Dyspraxia.) 

I know, or at least I think I know, I'm naturally GOOD at writing because numerous different teachers emphasized it. All the way through school, my English teachers would set assignments and I'd do them without really thinking or making a huge effort but they'd always make a big deal out of them and read them out in class and I never knew why. I guess I always kind of thought they were just trying to boost my confidence because they knew I was a bit troubled or whatever. But now I look back I don't think that was the case. My point is...well I don't really know what my point is. I hardly ever write, and I've never really written for pure pleasure and for someone to read my piece. I don't have the confidence, and I wouldn't have the will to follow through and finish something. I never seem to finish anything, not just writing.

I like writing because I find it fun, and I feel I have great original ideas. But I'm scared to be put down or not to live up to my own and other's expectations. I know being a fiction writer is a very ambitious and unconventional career path, and I've chosen a degree subject with absolutely nothing to do with it (so the path I'm currently taking has absolutely nothing to do with what I actually want to do). But I can't get it out of my head, and it seems everyday I feel guilty for not following what I really want to do. And at the same time I'm not following what I don't want to do either. I feel like I'm floating through life without reason or aim or focus. I feel there is no point to me. I feel worthless and I feel like nothing I do has a point to it. 

If you actually took the time out to read this in its entirety, and I don't suspect many people will, then thank you. There isn't really a point to it except for me to get it off my chest and perhaps make me feel better so it must have been difficult to read. if you did read until the end then I invite you to be completely honest with me. I personally believe honesty is one of the most important things in life, even though I'm not always honest myself. Even if you want to call me a whiny little bitch, then go ahead.

**tl;dr:** I'm not really a very happy person."

About six years ago I met this girl at uni and we hit it off in an acquaintancey kind of a way - we never really hung out much but I liked her and wanted to be friends with her. Our course and subsequent internships that we did were crazy intense and I ended up falling out of touch with her, although we remained Facebook friends. I hardly thought about her for nearly six years.

Three years ago I moved across the world to the UK, and then a year ago I moved again within Europe. I get a message from her best friend/work partner (who I know as well) to say that they are coming to Europe and we end up all catching up in my city. Good times were had. They then moved to the UK.

I went to London for Christmas and unexpectedly ran into her on the street. We go for a drink, just the two of us, and I end up feeling like I've just been on the best date of my life. Since then I have not been able to stop thinking about her and I hate myself for it. 

To make matters worse, this is my very first legit adult crush (i.e. not a fake crush on a boy, celeb, or straight girl). There is no point in pursuing this and I know that I need to stop Facebooking with her, but it's hard and I don't want to, even though it's making me crazy. 

I was in London last weekend and hung out with her, and while nothing happened of a romantic nature, nothing has changed in my scumbag brain. The worst part is that I would move back to London in a heartbeat if I could, but I can't get a visa for the UK. 

I don't want advice or anything, I just wanted to tell some Internet strangers about my dumb problems, because my poor best friend is sick of hearing about it.

19wjvz,9,2013-03-08,Aquaponic Introduction,[deleted],aquaponics,https://www.reddit.com/r/aquaponics/comments/19wjvz/aquaponic_introduction/,"Aquaponics 101

Written by a beginner.

Basics

Aquaponics gets its name from and is a combination of two sciences. These sciences are aquaculture and hydroponics.

Hydroponic growing is the science of growing plants without soil. It is most commonly seen in three forms, deep water culture (DWC), media beds, or nutrient film technique (NFT). There are endless variations and many systems combine the different forms.

Aquaculture is the science of raising marine or freshwater animals in some sort of controlled environment. To understand how and why these sciences are merging to form the new specialization we call aquaponics we must first understand the major problems associated with these sciences.

In traditional hydroponics plants are grown in a nutrient solution manufactured to maximize the growth of that plant. This nutrient solution is traditionally made up of fertilizers that are manufactured from oil and high in salts. This makes them expensive and the salts that are not absorbed by the plants accumulate until they become phytotoxic. The response to this problem for traditional hydroponic growers is to drain and flush the system. If the system is a media based system, the salts accumulate heavily in the media. In order to flush the salts out of the media it takes roughly 3 times the volume of the media bed in clean water drained to waste in order to remove the salts. That salt rich water rinsed from the hydroponic system must be disposed of responsibly.

Aquaculture encounters a similar problem with waste accumulation becoming toxic to the system. Fish continually produce ammonia (and urea). It comes out of their gills when they breath, and they excrete it like any animal excretes waste. This ammonia becomes toxic over time, and like the hydroponic salts, must be removed from the system. Aquaculturists employ elaborate filtration systems to minimize the amount of water used, however they cannot escape the need to drain waste heavy water from their system and replace it with clean water. Again, as in hydroponics, this waste must be disposed of responsibly. That means paying to have it removed.

So now that we understand the problems we can look at how combining the industries benefits each of them. Rather than waste and replace water, aquaponics recycles water. In a well balanced system roughly 1.5% of the system water volume will need to be replaced daily. Aquaponic systems have no weeds and the water surfaces are covered to minimize the amount of evaporation. That means almost all of that 1.5% of water that is being replaced daily is being used by the plants. Nothing more, nothing less. That water efficiency is what I believe is the most important aspect of aquaponics.

    Also, aquaponic systems are inherently organic, even if the government has a copyright on that word. A well established aquaponic system is a well established ecosystem. The larger the system, the older it is, the more well balanced and stable it will be. That stability is based on a complex ecosystem of life that includes not only the fish and the plants but also the bacteria that do the work of converting the ammonia, or fish waste, into nitrogen, our essential element to plant growth.

    If you are interested in more information about aquaponics, I can recommend a number of places to start. I would caution that when researching aquaponics be wary of the difference between being ‘loud’ and being correct. By that I mean there are a lot of people on the internet saying a lot of things, and just because they say it a lot doesn't make it true. As a young field, there is a lot of information out there. What I have found is that if you want to get to the bottom of something, you have to really ask the right questions and figure it out yourself. There is no substitute for actually building a system and trying to grow plants. Plant them, move them, eat them. Eat them some more. Eating them is awesome.  

Additional learning?
    The internet is obviously a great place to start. These are personal recommendations of mine based on personal experience.

If you “look inside” on this book on amazon you can read most of the text for free.    

More of the hands on type? Build something! Nothing can substitute for doing it yourself. Find an aquaponic or hydroponic farm and get a job. Experience on a commercial farm will be beneficial in a variety of ways, even if its not directly related to your individual end goal. After that seminars and trainings are a popular way to become educated on aquaponics. As a professional I’m not going to personally recommend or warn against any of these. I caution anyone considering a training to consider your source and judge the cost to you against the value of your own time. It may be worth it to you to pay for a 3 day training rather than 3 months on the internet. You’ll probably spend that time on the internet anyway, however you’ll be more directed.

Many people offer unpaid internships in places like Hawaii. I participated in one of these and would caution against them. Be sure you know what you are getting into before you go. There are a few that will actually pay interns, use this as a sign.

If you are really serious about aquaponics work somewhere or go to school. All the people doing research and the most successful people are scientists, MBA’s, engineers, and doctors. Use aquaponics as a tool to figure out what really interests and motivates you, and go to school for that. It will lead to bigger and better things!

19wikc,4,2013-03-08,What is the best (and shortest!) method for preserving formatting when parsing a text file?,Pianoplunkster,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/19wikc/what_is_the_best_and_shortest_method_for/,"I mainly use C++ and Unix shell at my internship, and I'm semi-self-taught (the first couple of weeks were fun... heh). I often have to parse/ edit text files where the formatting is SUPER important-- eliminating a space or numbering rows incorrectly will render the file unreadable by the programs that use them. 

That's not an issue when I only need to do one or two (I just cheat and do it by hand :P) but lately I've been given tasks where I needed to automate the editing because I had to do 200 or 300 files. When it's a matter of just deleting lines, that's not an issue-- I can just grep -v the unwanted lines in the shell. When I have to edit the lines, however, that gets tricky, and that's when I have to use C++, which can get cumbersome.

I really should learn how to write bash shell scripts, and I've been looking into Python. But any other tips would be forever appreciated. :)

This is a snippet of a file I've been editing. My most recent task involved removing every line with an H and re-numbering the columns (most of these are MUCH longer). I needed to preserve the first four lines exactly as is, however, and I don't want to re-write the files, but save them as new (similarly named) files. Awk and grep are sufficient for most of this, but I haven't figured out how to do the re-numbering, and for some reason the space in the first row of every line gets deleted."

I'm confident that I will take some coursework at a local Community College. Not sure if I want to get an Associates Degree or not (not really sure they're worth much), but my two options are pretty simple.

I plan on applying for internships at local web security firms, and then going back and getting a BS in CS, or getting a CS related MS. 

Ultimately I'd like to get into Web Security, as I've heard the job prospects are good. 

I'm learning Web Programming in my spare time and trying to learn as many computer languages as possible. 

All of that being said, it is a gamble. I have my BA in Language and International Trade. There are no job prospects in my area for this degree (since we moved). Anyway, tmi. I just wanted to get opinions on the best strategy. 

Comm. College + BS in CS

or

Comm. College + MS in CS-related major

or

??? Let me know what you think.

Thanks for your advice!"
19wgy9,4,2013-03-08,The CEO and technical genius of my startup does not recognize the urgency or potential of our opportunity,[deleted],startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/19wgy9/the_ceo_and_technical_genius_of_my_startup_does/,"I recently got hired at a startup company at my university as an intern basically as a jack of all trades. 

The founder of the company is a much older professor who appears to be unable to think like an entrepreneur.  However he is behind a startup company with what I think is pioneering technology that can without a doubt deliver six figures of measurable value to each of clients in our market.

What is frustrating is that our product is incredible but we are moving way too slow.  My university has shelled out tens of thousands of dollars patenting our technology, doing studies, and allowing us to use their facilities to test, field study, fine tune, and compare our competitors to our technology for free.  During one field study we even met a client who said he was ready to purchase.  There is always something to improve however and *major* events take weeks, months, and in one case years to make happen (hiring, moving out of the lab and into the office, meeting potential clients).    

Our CEO however is stuck in academia thinking.  He gets defensive when investors and potential clients try to compare our technology to our competitors (which is what is happening with our first *real* potential client).  He also has an academic case of perfectionism and wants our technology to be *perfect* before finally getting clients.  He simply cannot wrap his mind around the idea that it is actually a good thing to receive constructive criticism and to make mistakes during our initial launch.  It's not so much that he doesn't want to fail as much as he does not want to get embarrassed. 

It boggles my mind at the opportunity presently being wasted.  I honestly think other startup founders would absolutely kill if they could be in the same position as our CEO.  Almost everything has been handed to this startup company on a silver platter.

In practice, I've been reading selections from Henry V and have spent the last two weeks memorizing monologues and soliloquies by myself. What kind of practice regimen and techniques work for you when approaching a new piece? For example, by recommendation of my professor, when I played violin I would dedicate 1-3 hrs a day to practice. Dividing up my time I would spend most of the time was on scales, then sight reading and then on the music that was assigned. I worked really well for me. 

What do you guys do for acting?

I emphasize that I'm doing this alone because I'm in Washington D.C. for an internship and classes until May 27th and I can't find the time for any formal class and I don't know where to begin looking for a group of actors who get together for practice. I'm lucky enough to live down the street from the Folger theater and have seen the current production of Henry V three times already and I'm ushering tomorrow, so I'm lucky to be able study their great performances.

You guys win. You guys gave a pretty compelling case and got me pumped. Reason for choosing is people were telling me how things have been pretty shitty at MSU and the nerd scene isn't to vibrant. Thanks!

EDIT:

Thank you very much for responding to this thread. You guys are making a pretty strong case for Depaul. 






Hi!

I recently got into a few universities however I'm hardcore on the fence on which school I want to go to (It's between Depaul, MSU and Purdue. Depaul and MSU offered a lot of money). So, what I am asking for is if you guys can answer a few of my questions.

After a bit of threadstalking, I see that Senton Hall and U Hall are the most social dorms. I'm a proud otaku/nerd however I am somewhat of a social guy (even though I like to spend most of my time on the computer &gt;.&gt;), will I fit in well with those dorms? If not, which dorm will suit me the best? 



How are roommates assigned? 



Is it better to room with a friend or with (a) stranger(s). 

What are the attitudes towards marijuana and alcohol on campus? Are there severe punishments for being caught drinking or smoking? Should I just leave my pot at home and not bother? 

Is it worth having a car?



How is the internet at Depaul? 

I have a massive gaming computer that I built recently. I love this thing to death however a lot of my friends say that I should sell it and buy a gaming laptop for class. My idea is that I buy a cheap notebook off newegg for class use so I can still have my gaming computer. Thoughts? 



Next, what clubs and student organizations are there at Depaul that suit my nerdiness? Is there a Starcraft 2 team or Dota 2 team? Also, what is the reputation of the Atheist Organization. I am somewhat shy of being open about my rejection of faith primarily because of the flood of /r/atheist threads that liter the front page which tend to be douchey. Lastly, although this is going to sound strange, is there a heavy lifting club/crew? 



What is Computer Science like? Primarily, what is its reputation? Are internships easily acquired? 



How many classes does a typical student take a semester and what are some of the gen eds.Knowing that Depaul has a requirement for a theological class (or at least that is what I heard) what classes are offered?  Also, could I knock out a few gen eds with my ap credits? I got a 4 on the Psych and Euro ap exams and a 3 on the Environmental science. 

How active are students on campus meaning, is being on campus fun or is it a bore? 



What is the overall nerd scene like at Depaul? 

What is the overall stress level of a student at Depaul from school work? 

Also, how much can I slack off second semester? So far I am getting a C in AB Calc, C in Psych, C in Apes, B- in English, A in Animation Honors, A in Euro. This is opposed to first semester were I got As and Bs. 

So yeah, here are the few (lol) questions that I have. Also any additional information that I should know would be awesome. Thanks in advance!

My dad is a Hemotologist/oncologist in the States. Hemotolgy and Oncology are both complicated fields, as my father is the medical director in his division. I've done some internships w/ him and I've talked with him extensively on the topic. Oncology doctors essentially diagnose and treat tumors/cancers. However, the practice is much more touching and hands on than one would imagine.

I spent some time with my dad at work for a few weeks, and truly saw the morbid reality in his job. My dad works for a Catholic institution, meaning he deals with all types of people and he cant refuse a single patient. On a daily basis he has to tell people they are going to die. It really gets to me. It's shocking how he can live with himself everyday, as he is an extremely energetic and optimistic guy. 

It's crazy how common death is, and how much he has to deal with it. On his regular day, he sees an average of 25 patients (when he isn't on-call) which is a decent amount. From those 25, 5 will be diagnosed with cancer; 2 of those five having stage four cancer. The first time I'd seen my dad break the news, I'd never though he was my dad. It's crazy to see the reactions on the faces of both the patient and his/her family.

The most morbid of them all, was my dad trying to tell a specific patient she had a life expectancy of four weeks. She had stage four breast cancer, and couldn't take it in. We spent a good hour in the room trying to comfort her, it's sad this happens every day.

Sorry if this was a block of text, but I though sharing cancer from the perspective of a doctor would be pretty morbid. My first post on this subreddit too, although I've been following for a while. I can provide proof to mods if necessary. 

Edit 1:

Thanks for sharing and support. It's nice being able to speak about mature topics as adults here. That's what I like about this subredddit, the majority of us are a mature culture who care about eachother.

Thanks for the continued support"

What can I do to up my chances of finding a job after I graduate?

* My GPA is in the top 5% for my college.

* Like I said, I have had one internship and will either work at the same company again this summer or find an internship here in Boston.

* I will be graduating a semester early, not sure if this would be helpful

* I will be going to study abroad in Spring semester of my junior year. I'll be interning in something marketing/advertising-related.

Really happy with the gains!  
I know it is mostly fat, maybe just a pound or two of muscle, but damn happy with that.


Exercise: first 2 weeks I had access to a nice gym.  Did a quick SL routine for the few weeks, and also followed the ""pavel fighter pullup program"" (almost daily pullups).

This last week I started a new internship that'll last 3 months... Stuck being a desk jockey... Trying to take ten minute breaks and walking the parking lot.  So it's been home gym week


Been doing my pullups 6 days a week, and slowly but steadily going up the pull up ladder.  Today I did 5, 4, 4, 3, 2... I feel that after taking a day off I'll b able to do 6 on my first set.


Also doing 5-10 1-minute planks ever other day. Day 1, after my first two planks by Lower back hurt so bad, I figured I was doing it wrong.  Googled, nope... My core was just to weak to even do planks.  Ha.  Now I do them with confidence, maybe even comfort.... 
Random  amounts of pushup here and there


And....Goblet squats!  And since my balance is very poor and my bar squatting was still pretty low, I'm not even losing that much weight on the goblet squats... Using 51 pound dumbell.
Also doing shrugs with with 51 pound dumbells. 5 sets of ten reps.
Today I'll also try some random dumbell lifts... Curls maybe.
If the weather gets up to 45, I'll re-setup my garage gym (bench+squat stands+iron).


Diet: I've been paleo/primal since sept.  Started getting takeout from the brazilean steakhouse almost daily.  And drinking lots more milk and kefir (nowhere near gomad)


So breakfast is either a 2 scoop shake with berries, banana, and whole milk... Or 2 hard boiled eggs for breakfast...
Snacking on nuts and carrots all the time...
Drinking milk and kefir.lunch is usually brazilean takeout(lots of meat and salad)... Plantains and sweet potatos for carbs....
That's it for now.


  Time to squat, plank, and drink milk"

I desperately sent out some e-mails last week to some startups in the Bay Area after stumbling on the HackerNews thread [here]( http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5304169), expressing my interest in getting my first software engineering internship (I'm a 3rd year computer engineer). 

Chances like this for me are rare since I'm not in my school's co-op program; where I live (Vancouver) has less jobs available for SE. 

I really want to make a good impression but what I foresee happening, or am nervous about anyway, is that they'll mention a bunch of technologies I've never touched and I'll be at a loss of words as to how I can potentially contribute. Like MongoDB or Django or HTML5. I've only done some very newbie/minor Android development (a calculator), an Arduino side project, and my regular school projects (C, C++).

How should I approach this? Any startup engineers here by coincedence that might want to give insights as to what you would look for from a work-inexperienced potential intern?"

It's just that I'm really lonely: I don't seem to have any common interests with anyone I meet and I'm not really extroverted enough to just start making friends or putting myself out there left and right.

I mean (warning: wall of text), the Irish students I meet go home on weekends, and although I know other Americans on my study abroad program, I'm not good friends with them - not that they're bad people, it's just we haven't much in common (I hate going out), so I feel like they tolerate me rather than actually like me, and the last time I went out to dinner with them, I really couldn't stand them. The ones I do like I can't seem to get together with because they're all so busy with whatever it is they do.

And I tried joining clubs and societies, but I got hung up because they went to pubs all the time and I didn't have the money.

    [backstory]
I met this girl while she was doing an internship in my city. I was interested and asked her out knowing she would be leaving eventually. We clicked pretty well and started dating, things moved pretty fast. We decided to keep it going after she left, I'm due to go see her in May. We have been dating for two months. I can see this becoming quite serious except for a few issues.

First issue is she clams up when she's upset, sad, disappointed. She won't say anything at all when she's undecided or doesn't know what to say or doesn't know how to say it. I'm the opposite, I'm very straightforward. I grew up debating, discussing and arguing things with my family all the time. It's been hard for me since its hard to get a dialogue going when there's an issue, but so far its been okay. She says she appreciates it and says it helps her feel there's someone who can ""keep her grounded"" (her own words).

    [/backstory]

My main problem right now is that she has a housemate who has feelings for her. He met her when she started her current job and trained her. He left afterwards for another job but a lot of her current coworkers are mutual friends, even her current manager. He has known her for a while and has apparently helped her a lot. Even more than required, such as paying for her car repair himself after an accident because he knew she didn't have a lot of money. He offered to move into her house when he heard she was looking for a tenant for the same reason. I don't don't know if she knew at the time that he had feelings for her, or if his feelings developed later. They had casual sex a few times before she and I started dating. She says she zero feelings for him and says she only agreed to his advances because she didn't want him to move out. She really can't afford the entire rent of the house she's in and can't afford to lose her job. She's ashamed of what she did and it took a lot for her to tell me. She feels she ""acted like a slut and used him for money"" (her own words). When she told me I told her I didn't think any less of her, I still wanted her and appreciated she told me, but that she had to end it. 

She agreed and she says told him when she got back that their casual relationship was over and they were never getting together. My problem is that even though she told him, she still allows her coworkers to think they are an item. She says she is afraid that her coworkers will gossip and her current manager (who is apparently an asshole) will use the information to get her fired. She also feels that saying officially that she isn't with the guy will embarrass him since people assumed they were together, and feels its too cruel to him since she feels he's helped her so much. 

Last night the two had dinner with said mutual ""friends"" who happen to also be her coworkers. I asked her, begged her to make it clear that she wasn't with him. I told her I was not okay with my girlfriend letting someone else pretend she's his. She didn't. When I got upset she got upset, fell apart, started crying said she couldn't do it, was already ashamed of how he treated him. She didn't talk at all after that despite me being on the phone asking her to talk to me. Total silence cept for some crying. After about half an hour waiting and no response at all from her I hung up.

Now I'm torn about this. I really feel she cares about me but she's also much more emotional than I and feels she'd be ""cruel"" to her housemate by saying publicly she's with someone else, even if the two were never officially together. I don't feel this is something okay to do, despite how nice he's been to her (he had motive, and reward). But on the other hand I know she's tried really hard for me already and I really don't want her to lose her job (I consider the risk to be real). 

Do you guys have any thoughts? What should I do, say to her? Is this something I should just let go? I'm just afraid if I do, it'll lead to bigger problems later on...

**tl;dr** girlfriend allows coworkers to assume she's with her housemate who used to be a coworker as well. afraid saying otherwise will get her fired, and is too embarrassing to said housemate.

I'm gonna be starting internships and important interviews soon and I just wanna dress more grown up in general. My closet is full of Hollister from high school. I just turned 20 and it's time my wardrobe matches my age! 

My personal style I would describe as southern, preppy. I loveeee pink. I love Lilly Pulitzer and the sorority girl look even tho I'm not in a sorority haha. Sundresses are awesome as well as heels. I can't live without my fake pearl earrings. Spring is my fav season because of all the pastel colors an cute prints like polka dots :) I love bows and khakis and just the whole southern belle look. I have more cardigans than anyone I know.

My body type would be small framed, but rather chesty. I'm a runner so I'm thin, but my boobies can make certain shirts unfortunately inappropriate. I like clothes that are kind of modest, but not old people esque. I'm self conscious of my thighs and my butt.

What are some flattering, key wardrobe pieces I should invest in?? Online links would be awesomee. What are some good stores for a 20sonething to shop at? With a limited budget, what should be my must have buys? Right now all I have for summer and spring are denim shorts and Hollister tanks -_-

I'm currently a third year MechE student considering staying a fifth year for a CS degree. I am interested in robotics and control systems, and while I have learned a lot of programming on my own, I think the CS degree will help me have a more formal background. Also, I am hoping to start working on a research project in the fall that I will be able to work on for at least a year before applying to grad school. I've saved up so I wouldn't have to work, meaning I could put more hours into research/projects/clubs.
 
While I have worked on research projects previously, they have all been in the very early stages so I haven't had a chance to publish/present at a conference. I took this semester for an internship (Big name plus my mentor expects me to publish a paper by the end), so I am no longer working on those two projects. Would staying an extra year for a second major + more research experience be a significant benefit in grad school applications? One big benefit of staying the extra year would be refining my research interests because there are currently a few areas I am interested in and I do not think I will know for sure by the time I apply for schools if I am finishing next year.
 
For some more background, I am currently at a Big State U ranked around 50th for engineering in US depending where you look for the two programs I am interested. I expect to maintain a 3.9+ GPA either way, and from the practice GREs I think I will be able to get high 90 percentile on quant, low 90 on verbal. My only real concern is that the lack of a long term research project will prevent me from getting in top ranked schools like CMU.
 
While I can't imagine it would hurt my application, paying for another year of school (no scholarship past four years) and starting to work a year later has a big financial impact so I just want to make sure the decision makes sense.
 
Thanks for any suggestions!"

I started working in retail in 2006, and the job paid my way through college as a Graphic Design major, but things haven't panned out very well since graduating in 2010, and I've found myself investing in a career that just wasn't working out. After about a year of stale internships, non-paying clientele, and interviews that went nowhere, I gave it up altogether, and in 2011, I began pursuing my masters in Computer Science, and now I'm about 1.5 years away from finishing the program.

The entire time, I've kept my job as a cashier because it was a really good yield for a part-time gig: $10.20/hr, plus prescription, vacation time, sick pay, time-and-a-half on Sundays, and somewhat decent health coverage. The place is also right in my neighborhood, so I have $0 commuting cost. I can't imagine getting such a great yield anywhere else.

But things have changed in recent times; the health plan has been downgraded to MagnaCare, and from what I've been reading online, it's absolute garbage and is frowned upon in healthcare circles. We also recently got a newly-appointed supervisor who is the ultimate douche of a human being (the kind that wears sunglasses indoors and is never seen without them on).

I've tolerated the pangs of retail for a long time now (dumb or mentally ill customers, incompetent co-workers), and I know that there are lots of people out there who wish they had my job, but now that my healthcare is a joke, and that there's an ego-stroking douchebag for a higher-up, I feel that I've reached my threshold and am ready to call it quits.

My problem, however, is that I have no suitable backups for employment. Most places don't seem to want a still-in-school programmer with zero experience, and it seems like a bad idea to give up both a health insurance plan and an income. Since I'm still living at home with my parents, my greatest money sink would be tuition. This job, combined with the savings I've got, will be just enough to get me through school with $0 debt on my back.

What would you do? Would you just try to endure for another year?"

At first I assumed it was anarchist, so I went along with it, but upon actually researching it and talking about it with the friend, I learned that it's owned by Bob Avakian, leader of the Revolutionary Communist Party, and everyone who works there is a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist, whatever the hell that's supposed to mean. Looking up Avakian, I've heard some kind of weird shit. Now if this place was in my town I would have no problem hanging out there and learning, because it wouldn't be a hassle, but I'm not ready to go across the country to get down with the Mao. So, what do you guys know about this Avakian guy and his organization? Is the cult of personality thing actually true? How sketchy is the RCP?"

I want to get into the web development industry and I just landed my actual customers which is great because I'm now learning to deal with clients.

I read an post about how important interning while in college can be. I'm going to bust my ass to get the best GPA and study as hard as I can.

My question is where do you go to find internships? I know its way late to look for one this coming summer, but I want to be prepared as best I can. So here are the questions I have off the top of my head, and feel free to chime in any advice you have.

* Where do I look for internships? Do I google web development companies in kansas city area or do most people actually relocate for internships?
* Will they have it public that they're looking for interns or do I just email them with a resume asking if they're offering internships? I'm working on a portfolio site, is this something I should send a link to? What about my GitHub account (in process of uploading my code, I've only been using Git locally so far).
* I know their are paid and unpaid internships, but from what I hear if it's free don't even give it a second glance. Is this the actual mentality of most? 
* If I should only be looking for paid internship, what's the general ballpark for starting wage?

I live in the Kansas City area and will be attending UMKC if it matters.

EDIT: Also, if you have any resources on creating a ""professional"" resume or literally anything helpful I'm always looking for me to read."
19zgvk,7,2013-03-09,"Will reach debt-free in May (over $26k in ten months, 23 years old, Canada)",LengthyEpic,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/19zgvk/will_reach_debtfree_in_may_over_26k_in_ten_months/,"Just wanted to share my progress in my own personal finance journey with you guys, and maybe answer any questions about my lifestyle and such since I know I've always been very good at saving money. Maybe no one cares, I guess I'll see. Any comments or advice are of course appreciated and will be considered.

I graduated from school (Mechanical Engineering) last April, and had three months off before I was due to start my job. When I started work in August my line of credit (interest rate at 4% right now) was just over $26k. It would have been much more but I had a 16-month internship at an aerospace company before my final year, during which I paid my LOC down from $24k to about $3k (so close to getting debt-free momentarily, but didn't quite make it!).

For some additional info, my salary right now is $50k. After receiving my tax refund this morning and putting it into my LOC, I am down to $3700 outstanding. Based on my budget and savings rate, I should have my LOC completely paid off sometime in May. Here is the screenshot of the account activity, if anyone was curious to see the progression (http://i.imgur.com/wif1GXo.jpg).

I'm hugely excited about becoming debt-free for the first time in four and a half years! I have already taken steps towards figuring out what I am going to do with my money once it becomes something that I can get working for me. Earning interest instead of paying interest is going to feel so glorious! As soon as my LOC is paid off, I will be opening a marginal account and a TSFA with Questrade (good review [here](http://canadianprofiteer.com/questrade-review/)), which is a discount online brokerage in Canada. They have zero account fees and they just switched to not charging a commission on buying ETFs, so I can diversify easily and purchase small quantities often without paying tons of commission fees. Buying ETFs through my bank right now would cost $28.95 per transaction, as a comparison.

Just excited to finally breath the free air! Just within reach!"

One side doesn't play.,Zhao16,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/19za9q/desperate_headphonesearphones_curse_one_side/,"So over the past month my earphones broke (my left ear-bud stopped producing sounds). Frustratingly I bought a new pair of earphones, which broke (also stopped playing sound in the left ear) within 2 weeks. I was told to buy more expensive earphones. So I bought the $25 kind instead of the $15 and this time in under a week they broke too. So I was told I should just stronger headphones, like actual skullycandy headphones. The Skull Candy broke in 3 days.

Now I am really desperate how to actually keep a working pair of headphones. I have spent $80 on headphones this month alone and as a student that is a lot.

Also as a side note (as I get asked) I don't throw, toss or step on them at any time. I have been extra careful and treat them no worse than a normal person but they break.

**TL;DR: 4 headphones have broken whenever I use them. I am burning money on them and am desperate to resolve the issue.**

*Edit: It's been suggest by a friend that my phone (which has been dropped a lot) as a broken jack and intern is ruining the headphones. Is there any validity here?*

19z8n8,1,2013-03-09,Missed Calls,MVoltaire,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/19z8n8/missed_calls/,"I heard this one from a friend of a friend (Facebook, naturally) so I was dubious until he showed me the email he'd received. You can make up your own minds.

My friend – let’s call him Bill – works for a newspaper in his town, doing reviews. He was given an assignment one year to go into the supposedly haunted houses in the area, some in his home town and at least two in B_________, ME. This guy doesn't scare easily, by the way. He once wrote off to Gacy, and got a long letter back as a reply (also seen as a photo via Facebook). 

The last house on the list was the G_______ house, and it had been condemned by B _____’s town council that week, so he sort-of had permission from the newspaper to go in there and do some research – local flavour, say how creepy it was and then take a photo or two. He took two of the exterior, and went in through the front doors. It helps if you know the layout –  a two-storey wooden house with a large picture window out front. He walked all around the ground floor, and didn't feel anything at the time. No chills, no spooky sounds, nothing. He even tried out calling some names (associated with the property’s hauntings) but there was nothing. The inside of the house was all still pretty well as they’d left it back in the 1990’s, but all the furniture was gone. The G______ house hauntings had apparently been going on from 1970- intermittently, so there was sure to be something to write about, even if it was only a historical piece. 

Bill told me that he’d gone from room to room on the bottom floor, doing the same thing, calling out to see if there was any ‘supernatural response’ – I think he was checking for rats, too. The staircase still seemed sound, so he managed to get halfway upstairs before he say what he described to me as a ‘white, flowing thing’. It was not a curtain, or wall-hanging, or any fabric that could have been loose in the wind. There wasn't a curtain or blind left hanging up there, or even peeling wallpaper. There wasn't even a draft which could have blown something into his line of sight.

Bill made it up to the top of the staircase, but he didn’t manage to reach any of the rooms. He couldn't see anything white or flapping (I even asked him if it could have been an animal or maybe a grocery bag or similar). The lights were out, but this was in the middle of the day, just coming up to April. Something stopped him from moving off the landing into the top rooms of the house – every time he made to step further into the corridor, he became nauseous. Sick to the point of vomiting. He stepped over the top stair, and immediately vomited, but didn’t lose his balance. 

He says he doesn’t know what made him want to run down the stairs straight after. He was still shaky, but he didn’t vomit again once he was out of the house. 

Bill isn’t a smartphone addict, so he wasn’t surprised when he saw that he had four missed calls, all leaving messages. What he was surprised about was that they were all timed from the moment – roughly – that he stepped onto the staircase. One at 1:43, another at 1:45, and then two more at 1:47. 

1:43 call was something Bill thought was a wrong number. It sounded like a young guy who was drunk. “Bitch, don’t you fucking threaten me…fucking dosed me with something real good...”

The second call, at 1:45 was “just sound at first – like someone breathing heavily, choking, and then a girl’s voice crying”. Bill has friends who’ve been known to pull pranks on him, and some of these did know he was off to see the G______ house that day, so he wasn’t that creeped by it. It was the two final calls that did it.

The first call at 1:47 was “kinda echoing, like it was made in a large space with a high ceiling”. Some thumping sounds, like someone coming up or down steps, on floorboards. There was some static, but the next part was where he lost it completely. He clearly heard, above the static, his own voice asking ‘if the spirits knew if there was anybody there’. There was a female voice, just after it.
“There is. Keep away, he’s toxic.”

The final call was not the same voice. It was just a growl, more like an old man instead of the young girl’s voice. There were just two words. “Get out.”

Bill did turn in his column that week without saying what had happened with the phone calls in full. There were a flood of letters afterwards, though. It turned out that the paper’s researcher interns had got it wrong. The G________ house was further down, 117 rather than 107 T______ St. Local ghost hunters were making fun of it on the paper’s website. Bill deleted the answerphone messages, as he thought it was more than likely it was his friends pranking him. The sickness he never did explain.

It took another week before someone actually wrote an email to Bill from F_______ , ME. His daughter had lived in 107 T_______ St, in 1989. Sick of living with her junkie husband, she had cut his heroin with rat poison.  Instead of calling an ambulance, she had been paralysed with fear as he died in front of her, cursing, vomiting. Finally, she was able to get up enough courage to crawl from the upper rooms towards the staircase, but she tripped and fell. The fall took her down the stairs, and left her with a neck injury and some mild brain damage. Her father had visited her in hospital, and then in jail until she was sentenced. She was now at Charleston, but it was unlikely that she would ever return to B__________.

19z08t,3,2013-03-09,Is anybody out there? Just want to get my thoughts/story out.,trappedinnhead,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/19z08t/is_anybody_out_there_just_want_to_get_my/,"Hello all,

This post may turn into a bit of a ramble, but seeing as how I'm basically in the middle of a panic attack right now I thought writing down my story and getting some support may help.

I have suffered from anxiety all of my life. When I was a child, the main source was a fear of losing my parents, my mom specifically. Whenever she would go out on a vacation with my dad or just out to get groceries, I would worry until the minute she came back. Sometimes even to the point of a panic attack. If I called her phone and she didn't answer, forget it, full on panic.

As I got older this fear subsided, although I still have it to this day it's not as severe. When I was younger I also had a bad experience with throwing up, and have been emetephobic ever since. I have a severe fear of nausea and throwing up.

None of this was a huge problem until a year ago when I began having random panic attacks for no reason. I was a senior in college and they became so bad that I often would have to leave class to deal with them. My safe spot seems to be my bathtub, whenever my anxiety gets really bad I take a bath and it (usually) seems to calm me down. So I'd end up running out of class covered in sweat, feeling nauseous, shaky, and my heart pumping.

I went to a school counselor who got me a consultation with an actual therapist, who told me I had Generalized Anxiety Disorder. He asked me if I wanted to get on any meds but I said no. I was already one as-needed Xanax from my family physician and I was feeling better from the counseling. After a few months, I had my anxiety under control, and everything was normal.

I graduated with honors this past may, and got an internship that turned into a job. I have a girlfriend who I've been dating for over 3 years who is very understanding and accepting of everything as well. Life has been good.

Then this past Christmas I had another real anxiety attack for the first time in probably 7 months. When I woke up on Christmas morning I realized it would probably be one of my last Christmases in my childhood home, since I'm hoping to get engaged and married within the next 2 years. Even though I love my girlfriend more than anything in the world and want to spend my life with her, the thought of leaving my childhood home, and my parents, sent me into a panic.

I managed to get over this panic though and move on. But my job has been getting more and more stressful lately because we're in a resource crunch with a few of our staff members quitting, then last weekend I woke up to the sound of my sister throwing up like crazy in the bathroom. She had gotten some kind of stomach bug. This triggered my anxiety again (the emetephobia) and the next day when I was out on a date with my girlfriend, I had a full blown panic attack where I could barely move. With her help and some Xanax, I got over it.

Then this past Thursday a panic attack hit me again, this time at work. I felt trapped there and embarrassed about having a panic attack. I just walked out of work and sat in my car, unable to move so badly that my parents had to come pick me up and take me home. I didn't go to work yesterday either fearing it would result in another panic attack.

Now I fear that I'm developing a bit of agoraphobia. Over the past few days since leaving work any attempt to leave my house has resulted in panic. I am so afraid that my life is going to fall apart due to this. I'm afraid I'll lose my job because I can't go in to work and I'm afraid this constant mental illness will drive the girl of my dreams away from me.

I woke up this morning and couldn't even go downstairs to eat breakfast, I'm sitting next to the tub right now just trying not to lose my mind. I'm so afraid this is going to ruin my life.

Thanks for reading if you did. I appreciate any support."

Is it possible? How do you recommend I go about doing this? Cold-emailing people at the Big 4, connecting through LinkedIn?

[Do you remember a certain person or reading that stood out to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rlt8x?context=5)|Ooph, that's a tough question. There are certainly a lot of people that come to mind. I think the main person, that just blew my mind, was a woman who would use the SMS service and would ask -
 |&gt;Does [Steve] love me? Does he want to be with me? Will we be together?
 |She sent her first text at 07:00 when she woke up and would send it every 20 minutes until 23:00 when she went to sleep. At first, because everything has to be positive, a lot of the replies went like this - 
 |&gt;I feel a love of love and energy around you and [Steve], it is only a matter of time before this energy blah blah.
 |And that's all she ever said. She never replied in a conversation, she'd just send that.
 |At $7 per SMS, it was a lot, for months.
 |Then, one day the message changed. She sent the following - 
 |&gt;Why does nobody at [place of work] talk to me? Were they laughing at me before?
 |That a fairly big moment, at the time, because she had become well known in the company, given we had to come up with a unique response every time; we hated getting her text messages and would bounce her around from person to person just to give ourselves a break.
 |It turns out, over a period of months, that she's never even spoken to [Steve], he's just a guy that works in her office and that in her office, she isn't liked. Nobody spoke to her, they'd laugh at her and make fun of her because she owned a lot of cats. It was horrible.
 |After this came to light, there was a heavy change from the lovey-dovey stuff, to a more progressive - 
 |&gt;I feel that there are other things in your life that you should focus on blah blah.
 |I always wonder what happened to her.
[For some reason reading this story really broke my heart. I guess I just can't fathom how lonely she must have felt :( I hope she is okay.

She must have spent thousands over a period of months.
[Oh gosh this made me incredibly sad...  It's bad enough that she's a lonely cat lady, and her office mates are mean to her...  But the fact that she paid so much of her hard earned money and looked towards your ""fake"" psychic company as a means for an answer from her sad life just kills me :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rzaqn?context=5)|I understand, I hated her for it. I wanted to grab her and shake her, but obviously couldn't.

[So your saying those books I...er my friend bought on how to kill someone with your mind are a fraud?  Oh well then can you recommend what ordinary office equipment would be best for cracking a human skull? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rn8oo?context=5)|Use the book. It's the best use you'll get out of it.
[Would you/ Have you considered fighting the good fight in helping the JREF expose other frauds?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rmc6l?context=5)|That's an interesting question. In what way would I be able to help them? Other than confirm what they already know, I don't know if they'd be able to put me to any use or I'd be able to give them anything. It's hardly ground-breaking stuff and I wasn't famous enough for it to be earth shattering.
 |The BBC contacted me after my last AMA and asked me to do an interview as part of an exposé, I was going to, but unfortunately, life got in the way and I ended up forgetting and nothing came of it. 
[*In what way would I be able to help them?*  Public demonstrations, followed by explanations of how you did it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8s7bzv?context=5)|Although I understand, given current and previous circumstances, I wouldn't be able to appear in public and everything I do would need to be at least semi-anonymous, such as this. Rallies, TV shows and the like aren't suitable to my circumstances.
[The best part is that that sort of ironic redemption would make your life read like the backstory of a character in a novel.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8so0x9?context=5)|Want to be the ghostwriter?
[Did anyone ever question you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rlzfk?context=5)|Question the psychics? Yeah, quite a lot. Some people would do it for the sake of taking the piss when they were bored, some people would want 'proof' before they would take you seriously.
[Did you ever tell any of your clients the truth?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rlzfk?context=5)|Don't hate me for this, but the latter was rarely a problem. Truth be told, I was good at it. People who are 'testing' you believe in it, so you're not trying to convince somebody that doesn't believe. Believers who are 'skeptical' are just as vulnerable to being exploited, because that belief is there and as long as you know what you're doing, it's no an obstacle.  I'd estimate that 8/10 people who wanted proof, would be satisfied with the 'test' questions.
 |Some of them knew. Most people, I found, just wanted somebody to talk to and vent. Most of what I said was just straight forward advice, rarely did I reply in a 'spiritual' manner. One women knew me by [real] name and knew my hours of work, she'd ask for me specifically and just sit texting me for hours about non-psychic things.
 |People turn to the spiritual and all religion when they're unsure and feel like they need an answer or some guidance; from my experience, an objective take on their situation was often good enough, it didn't need to be spiritual.
[Did you stay in contact with the lady that knew you by name after you left?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rrsd1?context=5)|Me and a coworker from there that I stayed in touch with Facebook'd her and sent her a message. She replied a nice message, because we had quit several months earlier; but that was that really. I didn't want to start a personal relationship. It was really just to explain what happened and why everybody just went away; the company went bust after we left, but she wasn't to know that.
[Can I have a fake psychic reading?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rrw19?context=5)|[Right here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8roa2q). I wrote it before you even showed up. Don't worry about the other comments, you can skip them.
 |Specific stuff for you -
 |You're caring and you want to look after something that you call your own (maybe a child), but you don't want it because you don't have enough trust in yourself that you'll be able to care for it properly. You have bigger hurdles to overcome before you'll be properly confident in yourself to make such a commitment.
 |In that respect though, you know your own weaknesses and what's 'going wrong' and you're actively working to change that; it takes a big person to know when to need help and support. Your fiancee has been amazingly supportive, even though you've taken a lot of things out on her, she's tolerated it and she's helped you through it. Saying that, she can be just as awkward as you are; you both know it.
 |You should probably work on your diet; but don't worry, because I'm a hypocrit for saying it. You have an almost pretentious preference to the original book, rather than the film version, regardless of how the good the film actually was. You have no idea what you want to do with your life, so you take great interest in learning about other peoples and their journeys, because you're trying to figure out your own route to somewhere.
 |You've just not yet realised, that there is no route. Nobody has a path, shit just happens and people adjust; so perhaps too much of your energy is being spent on worry about where you are in comparison to other people, instead of looking back on the personal development and strides you've made in overcoming your own issues that are superb; you don't appreciate how much you've grown as a person and you need to.
 |**Edit: 08/03/2013**- Sorry guys, I really can't give everybody a psychic reading, because they just take too long. However, if you [you donate some money](http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/support-us.html)  ($5 will do it) to JREF (of which I am not associated), then I'm sure I'll spend some time coming up with something for you.

[What was the craziest experience that you've had as a ""psychic""? Did you follow a particular script?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rm9hf?context=5)|There was no script or pre-written messages, everything was ad-hoc; it has to be. Obviously, there are lots of vague statements that would come up over and over, because people generally ask the same questions.
 |Crazy experience? When a world-renowned psychic came into the office in order to pick up some scripts he had ordered (these are generalised profiles that they will memorise and recall on command during a group reading). 99% of anybody 'famous' knows it's bullshit. The other 1% have mental health problems and they believe they are.

[Can I quote you on that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8s3zsw?context=5)|No.

It sounds ridiculous but I swear it's true. The company was 'invested' by a group of rich folk, who wanted to experiment selling their products using NLP to the vulnerable people using the services; that was around the time I realised I seriously needed to jack it in. One day, my boss started shouting at me and I just walked out.
[Holy shit! What products did you recommend to people??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rvk8i?context=5)|None. None at all. The products were nothing outstanding or noteworthy, mostly books and related merch.
[Do you ever feel guilty about being a fraud?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rrefp?context=5)|I think that's a fair question.
 |Overall? Yes. I'm not proud of having done it, I don't like to share that part of my employment with co-workers or friends, because it demonstrates a side to me that really only existed because of necessity; it doesn't represent who I am as a human being or as a person. People will instantly judge me because of it, without consideration to other parts of my life or my current work, where I'd say I generally make a positive impact in the world.
 |Specifically, I said in an earlier reply; as much as I hated doing it, I wouldn't change the fact that I've done, simply because I did learn so much in the time I spent; not the fraud part, but cold reading, awareness, maturity, etc.  I think I'm also pretty resentful that such a thing exists in our society, but sadness too, because I also know there's not much that can be done about it; there will always be some form of exploitation, illegal or not.
[Thanks for answering. I can understand necessity creating this opportunity for you.  Another question: Do you feel that there are any form of psychic abilities which are valid or real?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rrt29?context=5)|Absolutely not. I just wrote a reply that might express it in more detail [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rryb0?context=3). Either people are consciously aware that they are exploiting other people or they have serious mental issues that need to be addressed with a mental health professional. 
[I feel most ""psychics"" who work for big companies are Cold Readers](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rro6r?context=5)|I worked for a company that had about 15 employees, including accountant, IT, HR and the actual psychics. They accounted for about 80% of the non-TV advertising in the UK and about 10% of America. People would contact different adverts with the same questions, looking for different responses and it would go through to the same variation of six or so people.  There are no mega-corporations in the game, but it is a game.
[However myself and relatives have had enough uncanny experiences that I still do feel there is an aspect to life that is beyond convential explanation all the time](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rro6r?context=5)|This is your belief and it's great that you have something. I think it's just teetering to the right direction; because you're obviously skeptical of ""some"", but have yet to look into it enough to just give you that push over the edge into realising that there really is no such thing. The idea that ""Some are fake, but some are real"" is enthralling. Everything that you have experienced is explainable in such a way that it is dull.
 |Just briefly, let's say that a 1 - 1,000,000 thing happens. One in one million chance. We're thinking ""shit! That's amazing! It's a miracle!"", yet the reality is, that's underestimating the number of things that could happen and have happened at any one time in history. On your fingernail, there are billions of individual cells. One molecule, just one out of billions, just so happened to be in that place at that specific time; it could have been in 100,000,000,000,000 other places every second that has ever happened in the last 100,000,000,000,000 years in at least 100,000,000,000 dimensions of reality.
 |When you think about it - think about what the ultimate chance of that one molecule ending up on your fingernail is - too many zeros to type - but still, it did. That's exactly where it ended up. When you step back and you think about it, having a one-in-a-million chance is chump change. Yes, these numbers are beyond our tiny minds comprehension; and still, ""uncanny experiences"", no matter how unlikely, have already been eclipsed billions and trillions times over simply by the shape of your fingernail. Infinitesimal odds take place all around and inside you, all of the time and guessing a name, age, anything like that; in comparison, is not impressive at all.
[Did that experience help you to date girls ? Do you use your knowledges in this domain nowadays ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8ru4jt?context=5)|Erm, for me personally? No. There's a lot of psychic-poon to be had, people would throw themselves at you in the hope of getting closer to you; which isn't really my thing and I thought was pretty despicable. These days, it's too manipulative to use when flirting/dating. I think there's a fine line and it's a very, very creepy one to cross.

[I don't blame you for giving the job a go, but, having seen all this first hand, do you think it should be illegal to charge money for so called 'psychic' services? I know I do. I equate it to false advertisement and con artistry.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rq885?context=5)|Absolutely. I would make all forms of quackery illegal where money is exchanged; unless there is actual, scientific evidence that it is more effective than a placebo or such thing actually exists. No more holistic medicine. No more Chinese herbs. Parent's who don't get their child vaccinated are investigated by Child Protection for endangerment. I would create channels for people to 'report' cons and using the fines imposed to fund counseling for anti-cult organisations.
 |If somebody believes in it and they go to a spiritualist church, where no donations or money charged, then that's their right as human beings in a free world. However, I would not allow for money to be exchanged, as that is the cause of the manipulation in the first place. People can exercise their beliefs, but would (hopefully) remove the financial attraction of doing so; protecting the vulnerable, which is what any 'psychic' ultimately does.
[Thats kinda stepping on people's rights.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8rult0?context=5)|I'm not saying that I'd be a great dictator.

As long as it stands up against a placebo, that's all good in my book. If people want placebos, they can have as many as they like; it's about the money that gets exploited from other peoples vulnerability that annoys me.

As long as you do it right, you're never wrong. Unless you're at least 95% certain about something, you'd never make an outlandish statement - everything else is fairly generic stuff. There are two types of people who are catching you out -

Like make someone really angry or confrontational?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19v8hv/i_used_to_be_professional_psychic_i_was_a_fraud/c8roh30?context=5)|People who don't believe in it - didn't come across these very often, because very few people would waste $7 on something like that.
 |People who were testing to see if you were 'real' before asking their actual question - because they already believe, they still 'go for' the regular cold reading, vague and general stuff.
 |Occasionally, you'd get people asking for very specific stuff to test you out and if you know that's what they're trying to do, I used to call them out on it - ""Look, I know you don't care about what you're asking, you're trying to establish if I'm 'real'. Why don't you just tell me what's on your mind?""
 |A lot of the time, yeah. Often, people give you the whole story and background to what's going on and I was very straight forward; I was basically just blatantly giving them advice with no mention of spirits or shit. So when somebody would say ""My husband left me and ran away with his assistant, will he realise his mistake and come back to me?"", I couldn't lie to them more and say ""Hey, everything's going to be okay because he loves you"", so I'd say ""No, no he's not and that's a good thing, because he's a dick and he isn't worth your time. Suffer and cry for a while, get it all out, get drunk with your friends and punch walls, but then it's time heal and move on with your life"".

Is one a bit of a tomboy?"") or picked up from somewhere else, that your mother mentioned in response to an earlier question; or even that she was referred by a friend and the friend has inadvertently passed that information on.
 |Making a statement about the distant future, people would forget about that. Also, it's likely that somebody who believes in spirituality would push their children towards that field and make it come true. The psychic said that she'll be in the medical field, so the parent encourages science subjects. Bonus, it's a statistical win, because ""medical"" is a very broad term. She could have been a receptionist in a clinic and it would have been 'accurate'. Also, who doesn't interact with computers? That's not huge.

 |I would say there is a producer or a researcher, who does a pre-interview (i.e., ""who do you want to contact, etc.?""). The research then shares this information with the crew, including the staff / assistant of the Medium, who in turn feeds it back. The producer may even casually leave the pre-interview notes unattended for denability.
 |It is not unheard of for Mediums to bug the lobby or lounge of their performance and have researchers listen out for conversation for beforehand, whilst using plants to walk around and encourage people to open up underneath the microphone.

I just gave him a Google and I don't think I recognise him. Cold Reading, once you get used to it, is so amazingly simple; the risk though is that you end up doing it without realising it, so you no longer need to think ""He looks scruffy, so he's probably not very professional"", you train yourself to do it on instinct.

 |It means that, I develop a good rapport with a wide range of people; from top to bottom of society and backgrounds, because I'm able to understand their perspective but I'm also very aware of peoples 'buttons'; what's uncomfortable for them, what they enjoy, which topics to avoid, which topics to carry on with.
 |A big part of my now-job is about understanding how people will react, picking up on inconsistencies and relationship building between lots of different people from massively different backgrounds. I would happily include Cold Reading in general education if I could, because it's not about manipulating, it's about learning how to empathise and understand another point of view, which is something the world desperately needs more of.

Overall I thought I'd done well - I'd done my work without complaint, asked for more work, and was friendly and chatting to my office mates when they asked me things. My supervisor was barely around and came in to ask me how I was doing only four times during my two months there, so I got a lot of guidance from my office mates.

While I did get positive feedback during my debrief session with my supervisor, a few things came up that I hadn't been aware were problems. She said that it had been fed back to her that I was too quiet and not chatty, when I asked an office mate about it later she said that once we got to know each other I would talk more but even then I was more quiet than most people. I was also told that I needed to be more assertive and confident to speak out when I was asked for my opinion. I said that I didn't feel that I had anything to contribute when I'd been asked about clients discussed in meetings since I hadn't met them, my supervisor insisted that I could have used what I knew about the clients in theory to add something. Then she asked me if I intend to stay in the area, I said I wasn't sure since I didn't have anything else tying me here. She asked if I'd been lonely outside of work, I said that at times I had. I was told that she and my office mates were concerned about how I was feeling and that I don't easily give away how I am and that they weren't mind-readers, that I should have told them so they could have taken me out at weekends. I said that I honestly felt that I was imposing if I asked to be taken out, she said that I wouldn't have been. At this point she had to go to another meeting, so our meeting ended on that note.

So now I'm mixed up. I did my work well, and didn't let my private life interfere with it. Also I did tell my office mates when they asked that it was hard being on my own in a new area, and told them honestly about how I was trying local groups but didn't feel that I was fitting in. My supervisor was rarely in, and didn't ask me how I was doing when she did see me, I didn't know that it was expected that I would seek her out to talk about non work-related things. I'd have liked to have been asked if I'd wanted to do something outside of work - I was new and unsure, and my office mates often talked about how busy they are during evenings and weekends so I didn't feel right asking them. It feels as though a lot of this was my responsibility, when I wasn't aware that it should have been.

I spoke to my dad about this when I got home (he has Asperger's too), he said that it would have been my supervisor's job to check that I was alright in and out of work, that placing the responsibility on me without explicitly telling me was unfair of her. 

Also regarding being quiet, I told my office mates in the first few days that I have Asperger's and that I'm not good at starting conversations. My supervisor knows I have Asperger's since she was the one to assess and diagnose me a few years ago! 

She ended our meeting by talking about someone at a conference who had Asperger's, how it was interesting that she'd said that she felt that she was expected to behave neurotypically all the time. I felt following our review that I had been expected to be neurotypical and that even though my work was done well, I hadn't done well enough for them."

What should I wear to interviews?,[deleted],malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/19ytrz/i_am_moving_to_los_angeles_to_find_a/,"Hi guys. I am moving to L.A. at the end of the month and have no idea what I should be wearing to job interviews.

 The internship coordinator at our school says jeans are better than khakis any day but I think something like a pair of Chinos would be better than showing up in jeans. I hate how button downs make my chest look (I'm skinny but have big nips haha) so I enjoy baggy ones I don't have to tuck in. I see a lot of people from L.A. wearing double button pocketed buttondowns rolled up.

I'm going shopping tomorrow and have things like H&amp;M, GAP, Banana Rpbc, Kholes, and a few other similar chains around. ANY advice before leaving this afternoon would be amazing. 

edit: Lets say I have 300$. I already have some snazzy shoes I am looking for shirts + pants advice. Do i wear a tie? I was thinking about getting a short/skinny one since I do not have any and it seems appropriate for an interview. "
19yr8v,37,2013-03-09,Am I too old for internships?,AtheistKharm,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/19yr8v/am_i_too_old_for_internships/,"I'm a 30 year old adult trying to get my life back on track by going back to school. I'll spare you all the details on why I had my head up my ass for so long. The bottom line is I'm determined to get BS in Computer Science and make a career out of software development/engineering. I need some advice, but first some background:

I have a wife, two kids, mortgage, a full-time job, and go to school full-time. On top of all that, the wife is also going back to school, but while working part-time. We are still in the process of figuring out if this is even feasible. We both want to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, but it's not easy to say the least.

I'm currently going to TCCD (in the DFW area in Texas) and doing their Associates of Arts transfer degree. I have only finished 22 credit hours (7 classes) so far and currently taking 14 hours (4 classes). I currently have a 4.0 GPA and I'm trying really hard to keep it that way, but science classes such as General Biology for Science Majors make it challenging. Due to my situation, I'm not able just transfer to any college I want to. I have been planning on transferring to UNT which is closer to where I live but further from where I work than say UTA, for example. I have been following the UNT 2012-13 computer science transfer guide (found here: http://essc.unt.edu/registrar/articulation/ direct link here: http://essc.unt.edu/registrar/articulation/TransferGuides/2012-13/Engin/CENG%20Computer%20Science%20(BS)%202012-13.pdf). 

Right now I have the luxury to pick and choose what days and times I want classes to be on that meshes really nice with work. However once I transfer, scheduling classes at University–as far as I can tell–will not be as convenient. I have talked to my boss about this and he is willing to manipulate and/or reduce hours to help me out (which is great). 

One question would be, should I consider prestige of UNT vs UTA or should I go with whatever is more practical? They seem about the same to me.

Internships have been on my mind a lot lately because of how important people say they are to finding a job. The thing is, I'm a laptop technician working in a production environment, and I have an embarrassing amount of experience doing just that (about 10 years in this dead end field). In addition, I have been working for my current company over 5 years now (yay more vacation); so I rather not have to quit just to pursue internship experience. However, I'm definitely willing to do it if it's worth it. I should note though, I have done some technical writing for this company and it looks like there is going to be more opportunities to get more experience doing just that. Seems like there are plenty of little programming/scripting projects I can do on the side (that I dreamed up) to help the company out. I don't really know how good that would look on a resume because in the end it is very unlikely my job title or main duty is going to change.

I am aware of how important it is to get involved in an open source project on github or wherever. And this is another main thing I worry about all the time is not having enough time to really do stuff on the side. For example, I would like nothing more than to spend the next week during spring break doing coding. In fact I will be spending a decent about of time working ahead in my C++ class to get that out-of-the-way, but a great deal of my time is going to be spent studying for this madman Biology Lab exam I have the week after spring break.

Any kind of general advice that you guys have is greatly appreciated.

19ylzz,1,2013-03-09,What internships can I actually do as a second year CE student?,Dartht33bagger,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/19ylzz/what_internships_can_i_actually_do_as_a_second/,"Hey /r/ECE, I've got a question for you guys.  I'm a computer engineering major that is nearing the end of my second year of college.  Up until a few days ago, I had planned to sign up for a program called MECOP, which would have placed me in two six-month internships within my next year years.  Being in the program would have extended my degree to five years, but that was fine.  However, after talking to my adviser, this isn't an option for me anymore.  For some reason, the computer engineering students in the program need to take a 300 level class during spring term of their sophomore year to be able to participate in the program.  This is because the class (ECE 351) is only offered during spring term, and both internships are during spring term of junior and senior year.  Taking this class would push my credit count up to 18 for spring term,  and I don't think I could pull it off with good grades.  This, along with other conflicts with scholarships that I have and classes that are only offered this term that I need to move on, make it so that MECOP isn't an option for me anymore.

So my adviser said that I could find internships on my own, and that MECOP wasn't for everyone.  The only problem is, I have no idea what I'm looking for as far as internships go.  I was just looking at internships on the Intel website (I live in Oregon and want to work there someday), and I have no idea what I could even apply for.  Nothing that I've learned in my first two years of classes seems applicable to these internships.  

So what is something that I could actually do this summer as far as an internship goes?  Or do I need to go through my junior level classes first and try again next summer?  I really would like to get into an internship this summer so I can get some experience and also avoid having to work at Fedex Ground again."

I'm planning on getting a four month internship which is 90 km's away from my house. 

I'm also planning on taking a night-time course (once a week) at my University which is 112 km away from work, but 32 km away from home. All of which is highway miles.

If I find an apartment around my work for 4 months, I'm looking at $500 + the cost of living on your own (food, utilities, etc)

If I live at home and commute to work, I'm looking at an intense amount of daily driving 230 km the day i have school, and 170 km when I don't, and the cost of commute + gas. 

I currently have a vehicle, but its more of an enthusiastic vehicle which gets 11 litres/100km, but I'd hate to even rack up those miles on it. I'd rather garage this (or lend it to family to drive locally) and just buy another vehicle for the sake of commuting.

What would you guys recommend as being a cheaper alternative? Any ideas/tips?"

:--|:--
[$30 million doesn't even buy a rocket to get to the moon (even Falcon 9 is $50m\). Obviously entrants will have to have other funding or income to compete. Why was $30 million chosen? Was a larger number considered, but rejected due to funding constraints? Or was it to encourage outside business models?  Thank you very much in advance! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19uy9s/we_are_the_google_lunar_x_prize_a_30_million/c8rixwq?context=5)|One of the main goals of the Google Lunar X PRIZE is to establish a sustainable lunar economy. Putting the prize purse too high can lead to unsustainable designs. The $20 million grand prize we felt was a good number to spark interest in creating a new industry and to promote a sustainable business. When this is all done, I think you will be surprised and how little the overall mission costs are for the Google Lunar X PRIZE compared to traditional lunar missions. 
[ off, I think this is a very cool competition. Are there any updates about protecting the historically significant sites up there while letting people see them again?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19uy9s/we_are_the_google_lunar_x_prize_a_30_million/c8rio1o?context=5)|Ah, good question. The GLXP competition has engaged with NASA and our teams about the Apollo and Lunar Heritage sites on the moon. We are taking the proper steps to ensure that these sites are protected and maintained for scientific analysis. Although some of our prizes focus around documenting these sites, guidelines (such as distance requirements) have been set to ensure their conservation.
[It would be cool if there were Moon rovers that we could follow on Live tv. It seems odd that we have a Mars rover we can tune into but not a Moon rover. Live HD Moon Stream, I'd watch it!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19uy9s/we_are_the_google_lunar_x_prize_a_30_million/c8rwss8?context=5)|That was one of our original visions.
[Just heard about Lunar X Price for the first time. As it is already 2013 and time is running short can we expect a race or exciting news in the coming months?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19uy9s/we_are_the_google_lunar_x_prize_a_30_million/c8riz0u?context=5)|The next few months will be very exciting indeed. At the end of March we will be hosting our yearly international team summit, where all the teams fly in and discuss that status of the GLXP and meet and greet with each other. Big news is generally revealed at these conferences as well as mergers announced. The deadlines to get serious about launches are rapidly approaching and teams will need to buckle down more than ever now so it would be safe to say it will be an interesting year.
[Also what about China, do you think it is possible to beat them with a rover to the moon, or will they launch first?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19uy9s/we_are_the_google_lunar_x_prize_a_30_million/c8riz0u?context=5)|Of the teams competing in the GLXP, the earliest launch date has been slated for 2014 so China is scheduled to beat our teams this year, but they are still a government agency, as opposed to our private teams.
[How many teams are seriously pursuing the prize?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19uy9s/we_are_the_google_lunar_x_prize_a_30_million/c8rj52s?context=5)|Originally there were 33 teams, but after mergers, acquisitions and withdrawals, there are currently 23 active teams.
[Might I ask the purpose behind Google sponsoring this expedition? Is it simply to help spur the advancement of science? Does you guys expect any return from it? Either way I think it's fantastically cool and I can't wait to see how it goes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19uy9s/we_are_the_google_lunar_x_prize_a_30_million/c8rjrr9?context=5)|We think space is great (everyone at GLXP, including our CEO Peter Diamandis and president Robert Weiss are humungous space fans) but it really requires a strong kick to get it rolling. It' s expensive and difficult and unless there is someone with a lot of money and desire, like our heroes at SpaceX, there is not much incentive for smaller groups to attempt this task. The GLXP offers that platform. It's a chance for businesses to arise under a very public contest which can attract investors and offer the potential for an entire industry to spawn at a much more accelerated rate. Maybe one team doesnt have the resources to complete a rover, but they built an amazing lander. They now have many other companies and teams across the globe who are aware of this and, through commerce and partnerships, an new economy and market is born with the mission of commercializing space. Regardless of winning, every team involved has the potential to raise awareness and become a trailblazer in a new industry.

It is not only difficult but also insanely expensive. Although we've been to the moon, it's far from standard fare.

Assuming it somehow it DID happen, someone won't be getting any cookies and and ice cream, that's for sure.
[People love space and rockets, but have really short attention spans.  Is it difficult for you to get (and keep\) eyes on what you are doing and the teams that are involved?  Also, what is the coolest video of something (blowing up?\) one of the teams has done so far?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19uy9s/we_are_the_google_lunar_x_prize_a_30_million/c8rk57y?context=5)|Yeah, keeping people is difficult because no one is launching yet. The real hardcore audience is tech enthusiasts who find all the technical and hardware related updates interesting. Once the teams start launching I think things will get very publicly enticing. It's also tough when you have such amazing things happening around you like a Mars Landing and commercial birthing with the ISS but those same events bring attention to space overall.

[Hello, I'm currently a mechanical engineering senior hoping to end up in the aerospace industry very soon so I've got a close eye on the aerospace world.  Do you think there any challenges today's people are facing that didn't exist back in the 60s? If so, what are they?  Technology doesn't seem to be the primary limiting factor keeping people from space exploration these days so what do you think it is? Political will? Money? Lack of public interest?  What do you think it would take to get the public excited about space again like they were in the 60s? Are you hoping to accomplish this with your prize?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19uy9s/we_are_the_google_lunar_x_prize_a_30_million/c8rlqv6?context=5)|Technology is advanced, thats true, but making that technology affordable if definitely one set back. Another along those same lines would be making a case for the development of that technology. Why would I, as an investor spend a small fortune on developing tech to go to the moon unless I either have an intense desire for science, or, I plan on making a profit off of it? it's not an easy answer either but answers do exist and are being promoted solidly in the aerospace world with small steps at a time. The public interest fits in when there is actually stuff happening. Space works on very LONG timelines and its not everyones cup of tea to watch avionics boards being tested. When teams start launching I believe it will make a splash but until then, the challenge is coming up with compelling stories that people, not already involved with these technical fields, can relate too.

Hard to do both and maintain a job, but we work very hard to put as much news out there as we can.
[See, why couldn't someone like Discovery turn this competition into a reality show of sorts? It would be an interesting competition and could increase public awareness as it goes.

There are a number of reasons why people think we should go. Financially there are cases to be made in mining the moon. If we can standardize this then we can move on to mining asteroids more easily and that would yield major profit. There is also the case of exploration. You don't know what can come of it until you attempt it. New tech emerges simply from the fact that people are building new tech to try their hand and something that has never been done. Streamlining current technology and new forms of communication are only the surface. So many unknown inventions and discoveries are born from these sorts of expeditions and the development rapidly increases the rate at which we discover and vice versa. Industry is another popular model that coincides with money making. Yes, individuals will become wealthy but many people will have to be employed to complete these tasks and I believe the moon is the perfect ""next step"" for this kind of expansion of industry.

 |•	“We believe that this kind of contest, and setting an ambitious goal like going to the Moon, is a really good way to improve the state of humanity in the world—and that‘s why we care about this. It’s also going to be a great competition and a lot of fun.  … Science has a serious marketing problem. I think this is the best antidote I’ve seen for that:  this event and this PRIZE. … I hope that a small, very ambitious team of people will allow us all virtually to go back to the Moon very soon.  I could not be more excited about that.”  Larry Page.
 |•	“We’re proud to sponsor the Google Lunar X PRIZE. … Google is sponsoring this PRIZE because it is really different than any other kind of corporate sponsorship that I’ve seen. It’s really going to accomplish something very, very impressive. …  We hope to have helped make private space flight more viable. Efforts like this will stimulate a passion for space-related research and education in a new generation of potential innovators.” Sergey Brin.
 |•	“One of the things that really exited me about this project is how it can help with education. I mean, space really fascinates college students, and I think this will inspire a lot of interest in space, in the physics that surrounds it, the math, and the history of the space programs.  I think all the interest and attention on this prize is going to be very beneficial to the education of our children. We’re hopeful that our sponsorship of the Lunar X PRIZE will help spark a new generation’s interest in the fields of math, science, and computer science, which should ultimately prove quite beneficial to both the international workforce in general and Google in particular. ” Sergey Brin.
[Hi guys. Why ONLY $30 million?

It's about innovation and developing a new industry. 
[I've been wanting to ask some rocket people this for a long time.

[Where do you see space travel in the next ten to twenty years? Do you think that it will be a common thing for people to commute to space?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19uy9s/we_are_the_google_lunar_x_prize_a_30_million/c8rvjx2?context=5)|No. Commuting would imply that there is  destination to get to. i think that the next 10 to 20 years will yield radical developments, specifically, in lunar colonization. It won't be people at first but rather robots. Imagine, we take a 3d printer up to the moon, beam up designs, and through the use of robots, we start building a base of some sort. I think that in the next 10 to 20 years this is completely feasible but to say we would be commuting would be too much of a commitment. I do think that man will be in space more often to repair and build those bases or devices but it will be in small amounts and on specific missions. I do however believe that with the advent of companies like Virgin Galactic, people will be flying to low earth orbit much more frequently, both for science and recreation.

Not all teams like to divulge information.
[This is somewhat off topic but I would like to ask you what kind of people you think would do this.

Don't do something because you think it is the only way to get in. The Space sector needs so many different skills that whatever you pick you can probably find a way to use it in the Industry. On the Google Lunar X PRIZE team we not only have technical experts, but also experts in media, education, marketing, and other areas. 
[I don't mean to sound coarse, but why put X in your title name? The Google Lunar Prize conveys just as much meaning without the tacky ""it's the future"" tag.

Now, you may also want to look into companies like SpaceX or the Mojave dessert labs like X-COR, Virgin Galactic and Maston Space. That's where some really cool rocket science is going on.
[So once the GLXP is over will there be a second one, will you be offering any support to the winning team so they can continue to send rovers to the Moon?

I think, like the Ansari X PRIZE and Virgin Galactic, the winning (and runner-up) technology will be purchased and commercialized by an independent investor.
[Since the prize was announced have there been any advancements made in super-long range communication technology?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19uy9s/we_are_the_google_lunar_x_prize_a_30_million/c8rs2qa?context=5)|Communication to and from the Moon doesn't need much advancement in super-long range communication.

There are currently no passport stamps for the moon. If you mean how do you get permits to launch, then you do that by contracting a launch provider, like Spacex. This contest does not require you to launch yourself. That would make it impractical and extremely unlikely.
[What is your definition of landing a robot? If I let a rocket explode within the range of the moon's gravity, which is filled with hundreds of tiny $5 (toy\) robots, surely some will make it to the surface.

If someone outside the Google Lunar X PRIZE were to commercial land on the moon, however unlikely that is, then they would not qualify for the prize purse. If a government were to get there first, it wouldn't count because this is a race for the first PRIVATE team to land on the moon.
[What do you think the next (or first, I suppose, depending on how you look at it\) major activity of the private-sector space industry will be? For example, do you think that mining asteroids is in our near future, or do you think that there will be more companies focusing on private space tourism, etc.?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19uy9s/we_are_the_google_lunar_x_prize_a_30_million/c8rnm7v?context=5)|I would say that ""space tourism"" is a slightly closer future than asteroid mining. I say this because companies like Virgin Galactic and X-COR Aerospace are already finalizing their fleets and tickets are being sold on backorder. With that said, I think that asteroid mining is still relatively close, in terms of space timelines, as a viable business model but it is still in its infancy. The ideas are there but the practice isn't. The funding is still something that needs to be worked on a bit but I believe as technology increases, and commercial agencies succeed more and more that the likelihood of these businesses launching (no pun... hell, pun intended) in our lifetime is a very real thing.

University students are sending up cubesats all the time to gather space data. Bringing something back is not only technically much more challenging, in the US it is also much harder regulation wise in terms of the licensing you need to get.  Something like this may be able to happen. Early satellites took pictures of the Earth and returned the physical film back in order to get processed.

Currently, I am going to be graduating this coming spring with a B.S. in Biotechnology. I have done a couple internships all wet lab. I have a lot of lab experience too from school (Cal Poly -&gt; hands on). I really haven't like working in the lab.

Granted, I know I was an intern at these companies so I'm doing all the work that everyone else doesn't want to do, but I have done enough lab work to know it isn't where I want to be.

So what other jobs are there out in Biotech? What do they pay? Can I get them with a B.S. or do I still need to go back for a master or PHD.

The boy and the uncle have a non-personal relationship and the boy is trying to bridge the gap between them. any feedback is welcome!

	As a child, the summer was an escape from the three quarters of my life filled with dull teachers and mind-numbing classrooms.  As a young adult it is still an escape, albeit of a different type.  I plan to spend this summer by dividing my time into four important categories: work, play, sleep, and travel.

	I will be working this summer, without a doubt. The oil industry has made a name for itself in my hometown. As a result, when I go back for the summer, I will intern at Pale Energy, a startup within the oil sector. Pale Energy, an independent oil and gas company, focuses on the acquisition, exploration, and development of gas and oil. While there, I will attempt to strengthen my ties to the energy industry while simultaneously strengthening my work ethic and resume. Furthermore, I hope to develop a comprehensive understanding of where the energy industry is headed in the future by working with the senior management at Pale Energy. The “work” part of my summer will constitute the majority of my free time this summer.

	While I am not working, I will be spending my free time with my friends and family or sleeping. Houston is a city ideally located for summer escapades, and, as a result, I will be spending my time escaping to different parts of Texas. One weekend in June, I might go on a road trip with friends of mine to visit Galveston and spend a day on the beach. Another weekend, the family and I might go see my Uncle George, living in northeast Texas. Houston itself is a great place to spend time with friends and family. 

	Finally, I will travel this summer to Europe. I believe that understanding other cultures is essential to becoming a successful business person. For high school, I attended the Awty International School, which really established my hunger for experiencing other cultures and ways of thinking. My first stop will be Spain. While there, I will visit family there and revisit the Hispanic side of myself. The second stop will be to Amsterdam, the capital city of the Netherlands. Guilhem, a friend of mine attending university there, invited me to spend a week there; an offer too good to refuse. While there, I hope to experience all the infamous city has to offer. 

	This summer is already shaping up to be a fantastic one.

19y4pb,2,2013-03-08,Right now I'm feeling the most stress I have in 7 years. Just need to write everything down...,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/19y4pb/right_now_im_feeling_the_most_stress_i_have_in_7/,"    # dd if=/dev/mem of=/dev/reddit

* I really need to find an internship for the summer, but after 2 months of spamming my resume to different companies I have a total of 1 response and the interview isn't until May so I have plenty of time to worry about it. I've never had a job before and just practicing it with my dad made me nervous.
* I've been really lonely ever since I started college almost 2 years ago. I went through all of freshman year without any friends except for maybe a couple of guys I worked on CS projects with, now I have a few more friends but they don't really have much in common with me. This college is considered the ""nerd Mecca"" for the region but I haven't managed to get to know any of the thousands of geeks like me that I see every day.
I hope this doesn't sound like I'm complaining about what kind of friends I have when I knew nobody a year ago, but in high school it was the same way but worse, and I was looking forward to knowing some guys I could just hang out with playing video games or talking about algorithms or something, not having to pretend that I'm interested in sports or the Lord of the Rings or something.
* I have Tourette Syndrome, and I was wrong when I thought it was no longer an issue. Usually no one even notices it but the strong emotions I've been feeling lately have been making it much, much worse, and I also discovered that I can get ""frozen"" in place and keep yelling or flailing my arms or whatever for 10 minutes or more, no matter where I am at the time. I usually don't show my emotions much so this is obviously not pleasant, and having TS attacks like that always makes me feel terrible for a couple of hours afterwards.
* Related to the 2 above points: I play the social game [Humans vs Zombies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humans_vs._Zombies) every semester, and it's usually a great break from everything, but this week it seems like it actually made my stress worse. When going to missions and such I just kept noticing how much the people my age were dividing into tight-knit exclusive groups, how many people I knew from previous games weren't talking to me and just how horrible I am at socializing in general. I am extremely awkward and shy except when around those that I know well and not many people are in that category.
* I'm bisexual (though I've decided that I'll probably just identify as gay, since I'm more attracted to guys and probably couldn't ever have a relationship with a girl) and told my parents 2 months ago. They were accepting but that wasn't the biggest challenge, because I've been either trying to repress Satan's urges or pretending that I'm straight for all of my life and it feels very strange not having to hide it. I still haven't told anyone else.

And that's all on top of the stress anyone goes through when studying Computer Science, I have to study for 2 tests and write a few C programs this weekend..."

I erroneously assumed and now my resume is submitted without a cover letter.

However,  in the long run, I [M] do want a family and marriage. Also, as we leave grad school, life will definitely throw some loops in career and locations that may not align with our current relationship unless we really make it a priority. 


Given the shifting goals and a few other reservations, I don't know how well things may continue to work.  


Our lease will be going month-to-month soon, and I also will be gone all summer for an internship. I graduate in a year, which may bring in all the location shifting.  Until then, I really don't see the two of us finding a better life than what we've built so far. 


Do I wait for a life event a full year from now? Is that fair to her? Do I try to bring up these concerns looking for a conclusion? We've discussed them indirectly before, but always kinda skirt any firm answers.

airbnb

I was wondering if it's realistic to expect any place to deal with 3-4 students, such that each student has their own room. Not necessarily a bedroom per say (a den is fine), but just to have their own space. Are there a lot of places which come pre-furnished?

Most of us have about $1000/month res allowances that are given to us from our companies and we all have some amount of money that we accumulated from previous internships that can go towards housing.

Any recommendations for housing resources / your own place for rent / area suggestions is greatly appreciated.

I moved to Japan a year ago for a temporary job here, and I decided to switch to eating meat for this year.  It was the right decision *for me* - not everyone needs to eat meat in Japan, but I felt it was right for me, and sure enough it made my life so much easier.

But I never got used to it.  I have noticed it every single time I ate meat.  I enjoyed some of it, burgers turn out to be pretty tasty, but I never *liked* eating meat.  And in three weeks, I'm moving back to the US permanently, where it's much easier to be vegetarian.  And I can't wait!  My favorite restaurant in the world is a vegan place a mile from my house, and I'm going there the day after I land, I think!  I can't wait!

So I consider myself a 20-year vegetarian with a 1-year hiatus.  Yes, I decided to do it myself, and some might say I can't claim the longer term as a result.  But vegetarianism is a huge part of my identity and it was a big shift for me to give it up.  I'm really happy to get back to it.  Yay!"

So I kind of screwed up this whole ""getting an internship"" thing.  I am currently a sophomore electrical engineering student and I have been looking for a summer internship for a while now.  My problem has been that I have wanted to live at home this summer since I am always away at school and don't see my family too often, so this has limited me to companies that are in driving distance of my house.

Well, that didn't work well as I still haven't landed an internship so I have become more liberal in applying for jobs that are further away.  I recently applied to one last company that is close by and I actually really think I would be a great fit for this job.  Based on the job description that they gave, I think I would love the work that I would be doing.  I also think I am uniquely qualified in some ways, but I also have some shortcoming in other ways (ie. I do not have as much knowledge as they would like, but I am motivated to do whatever it takes to learn the material.)

Ok, I'm kind of ranting but back to the title question.  This company is very small; in fact, they are a startup with less than 5 employees.  I applied to them about a week and a half ago with my resume and a cover letter that I wrote according to standard format, but I tried to express how passionate about the position I was.  So basically my question is, is there a way I can further show them that I am the right person for the position?  I have not heard back from them since I applied, but I was thinking I could maybe write to them again to further express my interest?  I don't know if this is a good idea or a bad idea.  They are a startup so they obviously want an intern that will be able to contribute immediately (even more so than big companies that can kind of train their interns) and I want to show them how motivated I am to be able to contribute to the company.

My routine before this was a modified SS program that I made work for me, the A/B day splits, and running 6.5 or 7 miles in an hour on T/Th.

I really have no expertise in lifting (high school or otherwise), and just did this because there wasn't anything on GVT in reddit that I could tell. Please pardon my lack of science.

METHODOLOGY:

The idea behind the routine, a LOT of volume at about 65% your max weight. There are two halves to this, the ""beginner"" half where you do 10 sets of 10 reps, and an ""intermediate"" half where you do 10 sets of 6 reps.

DIET &amp; SUPPLEMENTS:

This is pretty important. You gotta eat. More than probably what you just though. I ate a LOT of food. On days where I wasn't forced to eat fast food (seriously, I'm a full time student with 2 internships and a job. I literally COULD NOT get around it) my diet stuck almost exactly to this: [http://i.imgur.com/QF1tSmC.png](http://i.imgur.com/QF1tSmC.png)

Also, it is HIGHLY important to note that sleep is also important as your diet. I NEVER got less than seven hours of sleep except twice, and it made me absolutely miserable. My advice is to aim for 8 hours.

The supplements I took itemized:

* Package containing Oxan-VR, 3-Test-OXO, and NGH-t

* Orange Triad multivitamin

* Mega Shred fish oil

* Assault pre-workout

* Anabolic 60 whey 

DISCUSSION:

I was warned going into this that it is incredibly brutal. After doing it, I personally wouldn't recommend this to beginning lifters and would even have some reservations about some intermediate lifters attempting this particular program. Don't get me wrong, it is a very good program (I feel), but there are a few things that would concern me:

* Lack of discipline - this routine will pound your will power into the ground. If you aren't as mentally strong as you are physically, there is no way in hell you're going to make it past 100 squat day.

* Lack of proper form - it is VERY important you have good form while doing all of these lifts. I almost injured myself due to misunderstanding ""bent knee deadlifts"" was actually ""Romanian Deadlifts"" and attempted to slowly lower heavier than necessary deadlift weight.

* Failure to adhere to tempo - This is incredibly important - you can power through the workout no problem, but doing it at the prescribed tempo can literally make all the difference, since all the difference is doing this program right.

* Not knowing your limits - there were 3 instances of the 60 day span where I had failed during my lifts, once during an incline bench, nearly crushing my head. Another was during the close grip bench, providing a sore rib cage for a couple days. The last one was the bent over rows I was having difficulty doing correctly the first day.

* Joint pain - as you probably guessed, this particular routine is absolutely vicious on your joints. I wanted to cry on 100 dip days. The worst offender of this was just that day though, but it may be different for every body.

PROGRESSION:

The program went fairly well I think.

RESULTS:

I did all of my core lifts before going into the GVT program. The numbers before and after stayed remarkably the same, and my maxes even fault ""easy"" compared to how hard they use to be.

SQUAT - 315x5x3

OHP - 135x5x3

DEADLIFT - 405x5x1

BENCH - 225x5x3

PC - 185x5x3

I would also like to report there was no loss of strength during this program, and after the DOMS end I intend to see if I can get any gains from it.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION TO BE ADDED LATER:

Since I'm having a hard time getting a moment to add the rest, I figured I'd go ahead and state that I'll add the ""after"" BF% once the machine gets fixed at my university. I am also working on an excel document for each day and the weight for each one. Gotta rush out the door now, will update later.

(Before BF% was 8.5....I'm GUESSING it is probably around 10-12% maybe?)

I started the new year weighing in at about 135, and I decided it was my time to make the gains. In order to do so, I finally quit using dip/snus, which I had been addicted to for four years. I also quit smoking weed due to the fact I have a drug test for an internship in the coming summer (One would think this would hurt gaining weight, but in my case it helped a lot). 

Surprisingly I have not gone to the gym yet, which I know is not the route I want to go. (I'm going to buy a pass tomorrow before class, and will be doing starting strength) The main thing that helped me is buying/preparing my own food from the grocery store rather than eating out/delivery. This helped because I now had food just waiting to be eaten in my kitchen, and it has been learning to cook new things everyday. The biggest thing for me was quitting nicotine though, because that shit ruins an appetite like no other. I have been tracking my calories very loosely, and have been shooting for around 3000 cals a day. 

Anyway, last night *(yes, I know this is kind of cheating by weighing in at night)* I weighed myself and saw that I hit 150. I don't know why, but that number felt awesome and rewarding as fuck. I'm going to try to make it to 160 within the next few months, maybe even 165. I plan on doing a progress pic update when I get 165.

Few quick food tips: 

1) Easy breakfast with around 800+ calories: Muffin with large glass of chocolate milk (2 cups). Prepared in 15 seconds lol

2) Here is a recipe that I've already used quite a bit for chicken enchiladas. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYjUqHGQoRM&amp;list=PLUDVfp84wxJPnYKTSAH_QVVoLGSrOl-Ai (instead of doing the last step of adding the sauce/cheese on top and putting it back in the oven, let them cool, and throw em all in the freezer). I throw 2 in the oven at a time (325* for 55 minutes, then pull em out, put the sauce/cheese on, and put em back in for like 3 minutes). I don't know the exact calorie count for them, but I know it is pretty high, if someone could somehow count the calories for these it would be appreciated. "

How strict are these universities in applying the honors rule?

Secondly, which universities would be a good choice for an international student (ChemE, materials or Inorganic), so to speak the best value for cost? I am fluent in English and even though my French is somewhat rusty it should be sufficient."

I am 19/m and she is 18/f.. her (now ex) boyfriend is 18/m. Just thought i would get the ages out of the way early. We will call her M and him Z.

[begin background] So M and I have known each other longer than Z has known her and had been going out with her. We met through one of my exes, when M helped me through rough patches with my ex's dad. He treated her like crap, took away her phone all the time, blah blah blah, LDR, blah blah blah. All you need to know is that M acted as a go between and from there we became really good friends. This was the summer of 2009, and we were long distance friends fro a long time.

Fast-forward, and i have broken up with first ex, just broken up with second, and had decided to try again with ex #1. In the process, i mentioned in passing that **it seemed like I only ever really fell in love with girls with birthdays at the end of the month** to M (remember this, its important). At the time, she was in a somewhat new relationship, maybe 4 or 5 months. End of 2009. Little did i know, **she had had a crush on me at that time, even though she was in a relationship**.

Fast forward again to the next summer, and i had broken up with ex #1 for good. Slowly but surely, I fell for M and I let slip that I liked her. She was still with her boyfriend and very much in love with him. But I didn't care and i just decided to wait on the outside, because I looked at this girl and I knew she was perfect, or at least I thought so. By the end of the summer, she had let slip about her crush she used to have but then immediately shut me down telling me that she had lost interest after me telling her about the girls Ive liked's birthdays (hers is at the beginning of may). Needless to say I was devastated, but not disheartened, so i continued to stand on the outside, waiting for my chance.

This continued for a few years. We became the best of friends. I spent a lot of my time fielding problems between her and her boyfriend. They fought quite a bit and he wouldn't want to hang out or talk to her much, but she loved him none the less and they lasted for quite awhile. 

In 2012 we both entered college, at the same university (coincidence), and so did her boyfriend. Things went well for a month or so, but then things went down-hill, fast. The fights became more frequent, he would take weeks at a time and not talk to or see her, and she was sad a lot of the time because of this. 

During this time, I decided to play a larger role in her life. I was the helping best friend that would go eat dinner with her and help with homework and pretty much anything she needed. 

Around christmas break, things got into a rough patch. I had made comments, though seemingly harmless, caused her to go into a tailspin and not talk to me for awhile. She hung with Z maybe once or twice in a two week span, but only occasionally sending me a text to tell me she was still alive. During christmas break, we had a huge fight which ended with me coming to the conclusion that **i was in love with the idea of loving her**. I had been depressed because she would not talk to me and I felt lonely, and she told me multiple times that she planned on marrying Z. **So i took this as a chance to try and find someone else**, so I wasn't left all alone after she did marry him. Much to my dismay, every attempt failed miserably, and I don't think i have been rejected more in my life. WIth each rejection, I started gravitating to M much faster. 

[background over]

Everything came to a head last weekend when her boyfriend decided to break up with her as soon as she told him she had received an internship across the country. Needless to say, she was devastated. It came seemingly out of the blue, he told her he did not want to date her ever again, and I was left picking up the pieces, which I did not mind at all.

Now, I had gone back on my previous statement, about only loving the idea of loving her, and was trying to show her that I really did love her, not just the idea of her. I came clean and outright told her that I still loved her, to which she responded that ""no you don't. you said so during winter break that you were in love with the idea of me. and you also tried getting with other girls, so you must not be serious.""

After explaining where I was at emotionally, and why i said the things I said, she said she was flattered but that she thought I shouldn't love her at all. I didn't want to take this as an answer, and decided to continue and wait a bit longer. Maybe she would love me back, right? right? Well we have hung out ever night this last week, because she couldn't stand the thought of eating alone nor being alone, and i have sorta played around and ""made moves"" while we watch stuff on hulu while we eat (arm around the shoulder, around her lower back, etc.). All of it though has been in jest.

so now I really have no idea what to do. Do i continue waiting and risk watching her fall in love with some other guy? Do i make a real move and just hope for the best? or do i just try to be supportive and let it go for the sake of our friendship?


Edit: the internship is only for next (fall) semester.

**TL;DR: I have loved a girl for a while now, only to be blocked by the fact that she had a boyfriend. He recently broke up with her and so she is now back on the market. What should I do?"

1a05c4,4,2013-03-09,Can you haggle with a company for an internship offer?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1a05c4/can_you_haggle_with_a_company_for_an_internship/,"I have an interview coming up at a really cool company that I would love to work for. For whatever reason, they already told me what they are planning to offer interns this summer before giving me an offer, and to put it simply it's way too low, PLUS I would have to commute 40 minutes one direction or get closer living arrangements. I think I have some leverage as I already have another offer from a company which is about $10/hour higher + a $1500 relocation bonus + 10 minute commute. I also have a pretty good chunk of experience even though I'm still a student: 3 s/w engineering internships (albeit at the same company), 3 research positions with different labs, decent # of side projects and freelance work, etc.

I'm really struggling with this because the lower offer would actually be more valuable work (plus I know they pay their full timers very well), but I really would need more money due to transportation and relocation costs. Is it inappropriate to haggle for an internship position based on this? Has anyone successfully done this for an internship? If so, should I directly mention what my other offer is or just hint that I have a higher offer without giving them an amount?"

That was a year and a half ago, and in that time, we were happy as can be together. I've tried to think of one thing I didn't like about her, and I always come up blank. She was perfect for me, and she thought I was perfect for her. We at least texted every day, had skype dates, etc. I was looking to do an internship out there so we could be together at least for a while until we graduate. 

Six months ago, she tells me an ex boyfriend of hers decided to come back into her life. Her whole family adores him, his whole family adores her, and he even asked her family permission to marry her (and I was like wtf). At this time, she told me she was just going to go through the motions with him, not do anything besides an occasional kiss, and break up with him as soon as she got accepted to a new school (finishing up community college this spring and transferring). 

Everything was fine and dandy until two weeks ago. She tells me that, despite hating it at first, he's been growing on her, and she's decided to give him a fair chance. ""He's loved me a quarter of my life, and he's never stopped loving me even though I've dated other guys."" However, she also says that if the situation was different, that if we lived closer and he didn't deserve this, she still loves me and would rather be with me. She said if it doesn’t work with him this time (but she’s pretty sure it will, and I think she will stick with it even if she doesn’t want to to please her family) she would want to be with me, but wouldn’t expect me to take her back because of all of this. 

And I don't know what to do. I still love her, and I can't help but think about her all the time. But it hurts so much. It hurts to be without her, so we've been talking a little since, and that hurts just as much. I'm sad and angry and confused, but I still want her to be happy. I don’t know what to do with myself. I can’t just move on from the girl who meant the world to me for so long, who I shared so much in common with, and who I shared so many memories with. Can we stay “just friends?” Should we? How long should it take to be over her? Would I be stupid to take her back if things don’t work out?

I don't get that.

Why aren't these competitions happening when students would have more time - like during the summer.  Even if I get an internship this summer, I know I'd have WAY more free time than I do during the regular semester.

What is bothering me is that several different recruiting companies(yeah, several job ads I've responded to have been recruiters in disguise) indicated that their 'client' wanted someone right now. They didn't want to wait for me to graduate and thus, stated I wouldn't work out for the job.

I suppose I'll just keep at it, but maybe I am missing something. What did you guys do to secure a job before graduation?

I am a french computer science student, and on the 1st day of April, I will arrive at Auckland for a four-month internship (at the UoA). Here is my problem: I still do not know where to live during this time.

And it's a shame, because I am exactly the flatmate you always wanted. I am clean, well-educated, I browse Reddit, I pay rent on time, I am not noisy but I am perfectly able to sleep in a noisy environment, I sympathize with basically anyone aaaand I am a great cook. Ever fantasized about the country which basically invented fine cooking? That's the perfect opportunity to try it at home, each week, for almost nothing (just enough discount for that the rent is not much more than 170$/week). Trust me: you will not regret it. We got five-dish banquets with three differents wines over here. 

That fancy presentation being done, a few boring-but-important details: I can not stand cigarette smoke (lung issues), I have nothing against animals (and if you have kittens, you will make my day), it would be nice if I could borrow some bedsheets from you (I am traveling to NZ by plane, so I must bring as few as possible), it would be awesome if I can borrow kitchenware (for the same reasons), I need an Internet access, and I think that's all.

Last thing: if you can't welcome me for four months but have a little space for me during the first (or the first two) weeks of April, that would still be a great help and I could still cook you some dinners.

I hope to hear from some of you! Do not hesitate to ask me further questions.

PS: Oh, also, if you have *two* free beds, a friend of mine (french computer science student too) might be interested, so please let me know!

I have a long fucking history of depression, and it all seemed to come to a resolve this past summer. I was never really suicidal, but I spent ~~most~~ all of high school stuck in despondency. 

I go to a fairly challenging liberal arts college (freshman). I have passion for many things and I can't escape the feeling that I'm stuck &amp; trapped. Like life is a cycle. After this semester - in which I have no girlfriend, a monotonous social life, and a ceaseless workload -I'm going to return home for the summer, probably for some bullshit internship, most likely the same job I had last summer. I liked that job, I got to write articles for a major website, I enjoyed that, but I am so much more than some one that sits behind a desk writing. In general, I hate home. I have no friends in my home state, essentially. I need to create my own home.

I play music. Not as much as I used to, but I still do. I used to be in a band, when I was 16, we even had some local fame. By the end of high school, the project had erupted, fell apart. Nothing came of it. My biggest fear is that I peaked at 16.

Here I am, in college, and nothing is developing. I have a really nice friend group, and thats more than I can say about my social life in high school, I'm managing to stay afloat in the rigorous academic environment, but I can't pull a band together and its killing me.

I'm trying to figure out what I want to do this summer. I want to get out. Yes, I'm aware i need a job for most of the summer so I can gain financial dependance, but I want to go out of my comfort zone and help a foreign community. Even for just two weeks.

I just don't know what to do. Yes, a summer plan that invigorates me would be nice but I can't stand it. I feel like I'm stuck, I feel like I Just can't push more. Maybe I should start working out again. Maybe I should smoke less weed.

I don't know. I feel lost and like a failed investment. My parents throw so much money towards me and it kills me because I feel like I'm not even worth it.

tl;dr Been suffering from depression since I was a kid, it was getting better in college, but now its coming back because I feel like I'm doing nothing. I don't know how to get out of this."

1a3ujl,2,2013-03-11,I [20M] have not been in love with my girlfriend [20F] for 2 years in a 3 year relationship but can't bring myself to end the relationship because I value her wellbeing. Please. Please help me.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1a3ujl/i_20m_have_not_been_in_love_with_my_girlfriend/,"Oh boy, where to begin. I'll keep it as short as possible if I can but 3 years is long time, from a relative standpoint in my life. Also, my prose is fucking terrible and I tend to ramble sometimes, please try to sift past my retardation. 

We started dating in senior year of high school after a long friendship since 6th grade. I was quite promiscuous in high school and seldom dated girls rather than just sleeping with them. But all the common stereotypes joined to bring us together. She had just lost a grandfather and was emotionally unstable and within this madness of emotion and confusion, we somehow slipped into a kiss and what usually follows a 6 year friendship of repressed feelings.

So, sexy hot sex ensued. Then suddenly we were dating 7 days after I took her lifelong best friend to prom. People were angry, happy and sad for us while we were blinded by our lust and compassion and promised to never leave each other. Things were good, I was accepted into a good school and she as well. 

The end of the summer comes and we agree to stay together and that nothing could bring us apart. School starts, problems arise. She stays entirely loyal but my old tendencies quietly linger. At one point, I stopped myself from putting on a condom while lying naked with a another girl. 

I don't tell and life goes on, I still love her after 9-10 months but after finding out that she has severe anxiety, insomnia, stress disorder, and a slew of other things, my feelings are wavering in midst of her breaking down emotionally to me all the time. She acts perfect one day and is an absolute nightmare to me the next. My friends are pissed because I can never see them anymore, my social life has become my girlfriend now. Nothing. No one else but her.

After about a year of long-distance, attending an engineering college, and having 2 internships, I decide I have no more time for a relationship or anything else but my career for that matter. I meet her at her school and tell her exactly what is on my mind with a somber tone. ""It isn't practical. We never see each other. I have no time. Our lives are not going in the same direction and this can only lead to resentment for both of us."" You know what she says? 

""If you really loved me, you'd make it work and not bitch out."" 

What the **actual fuck** am I suppose to say to something like that? Seriously, nothing I said countered her entirely invalid and unquantifiable rebuttal to our relationship. She said I never really loved her, that I used her for sex, cheated on her, etc... while crying hysterically and in a sad tone. She fucking guilted me man. She guilted me into not breaking it off with her. 

Fast forward to present day. Just imagine everything I've said so far about my relationship with this girl: ***rinse and repeat***. Nothings really changed. Sex has gotten so boring that I can't even get it up sometimes. I am 20 and healthy. I should not be experiencing that yet. I don't cheat on her but am presented in many opportunities that I can't pursue due to my loyalty and we meet once every 2 weeks with short phone calls every night. The past 2 years have been her using me for emotional and physical support while I get nothing in return. And everytime I try to end the relationship, she throws some Disney ass shit in my face like the first time. She doesn't get the hint at all. She has also put on a ton of weight. Like a lot of fucking weight because she is no longer playing any sports after high school. And as shallow this may sound, I can't even force myself to be attracted to her anymore. I imagine Angelina Jolie when we have sex. This stopped being a relationship long ago.

I come to you now, not for pity or attention, but for guidance. I am at a loss here. My grades have fallen, my friends are gone from my life, I am surrounded by women I cannot pursue, and my life belongs to someone else now. 

***How do I break up with her?*** Such a simple question but so difficult to actualize.

Her birthday is in two weeks, her parents love me, and I want to keep the break-up as painless as possible for her. I plan on waiting until after her birthday to do this by the way. 

TLDR; Dating girl for 3 years, 2 of which have been me living in sadness and resentment towards her. I don't love her anymore and can't find a good way to break the relationship while maintaining some form of civility between us. Please help me out. 

In any case, I am sorry to you guys for bringing my pathetic, first-world problems and asking you for help. I just don't know what to do and that scares the living crap out of me. "

Which has been 7 long months. At first I was waiting for a shipment to come in to one of my LGS. They told me they would have about 8 coming in towards the beginning of October and to call back around then. So, wanting to support my local business, I waited until October and called. They told me it looked like it would be a little bit more of a wait and to keep calling back. So, I did. Towards the end of October with still no sign of a Shield coming in, I headed to my local Academy Sports to see what they had. They told me they had a waiting list for guns and that about 5 other people were ahead of me for a Shield 9mm. I quickly put down my name because that was about 25 less than another LGS that had waiting lists. I kept checking on my preferred LGS and around mid November I called and was told that they had received a shipment in of about 6 Shields, but all the 9mm's had sold and there was one .40 left. That day I had been in class until 1pm. So, I missed my CCW for college...I guess that's not a horrible reason. 

After that, I went by my Academy again to see where I was at on the waiting list. Spot 12. But wait, I was at spot 5...how did that happen? Apparently, the other guy had missed quite a few. I left even more defeated, feeling like I'd never get my Shield. I had been checking online stores before this and forums trying to get the jump, but because of either school or work I kept missing my opportunities. Fast forward to late January. I called my Academy to check up on my spot on the waiting list only to be told that, ""oh, sorry, we discontinued the list at the start of the new year because of high demand and blah blah, but you should have received a call letting you know..."". But I hadn't. So, I had been wasting my opportunities by not calling every shipment day. I was told, probably through pity, that two M&amp;P's were scheduled to be delivered that Saturday or Monday, but he didn't know if they were 9mm or not. But, guess what? I had to be at my internship both mornings, starting at 7:30am and the stores do not open until 8am. SOL again. Similar things happened to me about three more times, either through my internship interfering or some other obligations. I would call up as soon as I was free and would get told, ""yeah, we got one in this morning...but we already sold it"". 

So, this past weekend I went to a gun show in hopes of scoring a decently priced Shield. Just as I got up to one table and asked if they had a Shield 9mm, another guy piped up and said he had just sold it to this guy in front of him. I had missed it by mere SECONDS. That was real maddening. There was another guy selling one, buy he had it for $600 and I wasn't about to pay that when I could get it at my Academy for $150 less. And this brings us to this morning, 8:00am rolled around and I called my Academy. They said they had gotten in one Shield 9mm but they wouldn't set it aside for me. So I rushed around the house to finish getting ready and then rushed out the house, in my car, and towards my Academy. About half way there (only a 15 min drive) I am confronted with a yellow light. The guy in front of me looked like he was going for it, so I was going to go for it too. Then, as my luck would have it, he slammed on his brakes. Yup, I rear-ended him. Nothing horrible, minor paint damage and no one was hurt. This happened at 8:15 am. I got out to talk to the guy and he seemed to want to handle this on our own, no need for the police. But, a sheriff officer rolled up and about 40 minutes later I had a ""following too closely"" citation and an at-fault accident under my name. Called my Academy, just to check before I continued over there, and they had already sold it. Yup, I'm pretty sure it is not in my cards to have a M&amp;P Shield. I feel like giving up, especially now that I have a $500 deductible to pay. That's $350 more than I would have had to pay for the extra cost of the $600 Shield...and it's my money I had set aside for the Shield.

tl;dr - I kept just missing getting a Shield 9mm and got into an accident rushing to get a Shield. So, obviously, a Shield is not in my cards and I feel like giving up on my quest. "

I'm not an expert on bodybuilding, and this program, with the help of a trainer at the gym to check my form occasionally, has really given me some easy tools to work on my body efficiently and in a controlled manner. I'm looking forward to the next cycle, will really up my eating to try and accelerate my gains!

1a3rag,11,2013-03-11,I'm just so stressed and I don't know where to put it all,stresseandfrustrate,SRSWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/1a3rag/im_just_so_stressed_and_i_dont_know_where_to_put/,"So right now I'm living with my boyfriend, who is bound to graduate this spring. He's stressing about finding a job in his chosen field and has anxiety attacks which he talks to me to deal with. But I'm still having trouble finding an internship for the summer and all of the good ones are getting taken before I can even apply, because I'm busy and cover letters are a new thing for me. If I'm having anxiety about this I feel like my boyfriend's problems always takes precedence over mine and all we do is talk about his plans without taking mine into account at all.

Same with my friends. I'll try to hang out with friends in order to get my mind off this stuff but then they'll start talking about their problems with our mutual friends or how they aren't sure of their relationship with this guy that they're having sex with or [TW?] how they're having PTSD flashbacks from childhood trauma. Which is like okay, generally I'm a very supportive friend but as soon as they start talking I feel like I'm being a bitch to ask them to stop or just talk about something else.

And now I'm home for break and my grandma's in the hospital for the 17372th time because she refuses to stay healthy and I'm expected to go visit her. In addition, because I chose to go on a trip with my boyfriend over break instead of staying home, my emotionally manipulative mom is being her typical emotionally manipulative self and guilting me into staying even though the trip is already paid for. Even when I call home (when I'm not on break) it turns into her venting at me about how hard her job is or how her business partner is a [slur] or how annoying her family is. Sometimes I get to talk about the positive things in my life but whenever I complain she just sighs and tells me she has to get back to work.

On top of all of this is a really full plate for next year, the fact that I'm trying to work out long distance with my boyfriend, and my complete lack of marketability which is only compounded by my procrastination on job applications and such. I am so stressed and I feel like I have no outlet, and I just try to zone out and end up watching TV or playing video games for hours at a time. Then it's suddenly midnight and I've accomplished nothing and I feel like more of a failure than ever. But I can't talk about it to anyone because they all have such big shit going on in their lives that I can't possibly stress them out with my problems. And I feel like I have to do everything at once and I'm just. So. Overwhelmed.

*sigh* I'm just sick of being everyone's emotional crutch. I get strained too sometimes. And yes I know I would benefit from a therapist, making that first phone call is proving surprisingly difficult for reasons which are even more complicated but are very ingrained into my thoughts about seeking help for things.

So, how do I tell people to back the fuck off? I don't want to be a mere fair weather friend but sometimes I simply cannot handle everyone else's problems and my own."
1a3r90,2,2013-03-11,1l summerinternship,[deleted],LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/1a3r90/1l_summerinternship/,"Hey guys,

So I have two internship offers for my upcoming 1l summer. both are with public interest orgs. One is in portland, the other is in arlington, va. I'm going to school in socal and all my ties are in socal.  

From what I gathered of the two internships, the portland one will most likely provide me with better experience based on someone I talked to who interned with them last summer. Additionally, the arlington internship apparently is a work offsite weedays, meet once in their office on weekends sort of deal..

My first choice would probably be to remain in socal for work, but I can envision myself living longterm in portland as well. From what I hear, the DC market is quite hard to crack into so if I do end up choosing the arlington internship, it won't be in order for me to attempt to open any doors in DC. 

However, the one thing that the arlington internship has that portland doesn't have is it's probably (correct me if i'm wrong here guys) more of a national region, so that when I'm applying for my 2nd summer internship in socal, it'll be easier for me to explain during interviews why I interned in arlington. Portland might be a bit harder to justify in this situation. 

Any of you guys care to weigh in on my situation?

TL;DR - from socal, intern in portland or arlington? want to end up back in socal, wouldn't mind portland, no interest/expectation of getting into dc."

1a3h0m,1,2013-03-11,What school to transfer to? Canadian Student with internship experience this summer.,LiNZero,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1a3h0m/what_school_to_transfer_to_canadian_student_with/,"I am a Canadian student that attends a satellite campus of University of Toronto. I am quite unhappy with attending school at my current campus because of multiple reasons such as poor student life at the school(no eatery is open past 9 on campus -_-) a faculty that is rarely present in school(they only come to teach and then they run back to the main campus). I plan on transferring campuses after my year long internship.

Currently I am considering the following schools:

* University of Western Ontario
* University of Toronto
* University of Waterloo
* University of British Columbia

One of the biggest reasons I want to transfer is so I can experience living away from home during my university years(party moderately!) because I've been commuter. I know that Western is one of the bigger party schools in Ontario but I am unsure of their Computer Science faculty. Wondering if anyone has any say with regard to Western?

I know that work experience will be important so many will recommend Waterloo. However, I am a 2nd year student so I am unlikely to get into Waterloo's co-op program. I will be working for over a year at a major international company as a software developer starting in May. I am sure that this experience will give me the experience to be successful in the job search upon graduation. I will also be looking for another internship of course between 3rd and 4th year.

I guess my main concern is that, suppose I choose to go to University of Western Ontario, will I have still be as successful as a CS graduate from Waterloo, Toronto, or UBC? Will I still have a good shot going into graduate school? Waterloo and Toronto are the best of the best in CS in Canada, I know recommendations from these faculties will be regarded better in comparison to Western. Will Western sink my battleship?

**TLDR: Transfer to University of Western Ontario, Waterloo, Toronto, UBC? Which one? I will have over a year of internship experience before transfer.**

Thanks for reading and any comments/recommendations/advice!"

I have no internships under my belt but do have plenty of work experience although most of it is customer service and manual labor.

My main question is exactly how do I start? Should I study on my own or enroll in an online class? How many internships should I have under my belt? Would you say I'm behind? I do feel the need to quicken my pace in this field but again I don't want to rush in this. I want to take my time and make sure I understand the material well.

Basically, I was in charge of the yearly refresh project. We deployed about 50 desktops and ran into only a few issues. About a week after the last deployment, I get a call from one of the faculty members,    


*""Hello, this is p0rt at the helpdesk, what can I do for you today?""*  
**""Hey, I don't know what you guys did, but my computer doesn't recognize who I am anymore.""**    
*""Is there a particular program or website that isn't loading?""*  
**""Look, just come over here and teach this thing that it's me sitting at it.""**

I walk across campus to this user's office and they are extremely frustrated with me. I can't even get a word in.    
**You guys need to figure your stuff out and get us working machines**  
I finally get her to replicate the problem and she goes to *schoolname*.gmail.com and it prompts a credential screen. Then it finally hits me, *I should have known from the beginning what was going on.*

*""Do you know your password?""*  

**""No, and I've never had to either. My old computer always knew it was me sitting here and just logged in for me. This one doesn't know it's me. Fix it.""**  

I try to explain that is not how things work. But she was DEAD SET that it was. The facebook login page coupled with her ebay login page only reinforced her strange thinking. 

**""See, these sites don't work either. It just doesn't know it's me. That's the problem.""**

I finally reason with her to try and remember her password and she types something in for her email and it throws the wrong password exception. Then she throws out this little gem after she initially insisted she didn't remember her password.  

**""I know that is my password, that's not the problem. It thinks i'm someone else and isn't letting me in. Why in the world would someone put this kind of security on a school email.""**    

I told her that I will go and talk to our IT staff and get back to her later in the day. I ended up resetting her email password and had my supervisor deal with her. Anti-climactic ending, I know.
  
TL;DR: User thought cached credentials were actually computers that were sentient and could distinguish who sat in front of them.

Everyone I've talked to about it thinks I should go for it, my parents, business-owner friends, roommates.

What would I be getting myself into? I would intern for about a year then buy it, the owner would stay on part-time awhile and be available if I need help. He would let me pay him directly over 5 years for the place. He said that's how he got the place from the guy before him.

I'm fucking freaking out a little right now. He said I'm the only customer he ever let work on his bike back in the shop, I thought he just liked breaking my balls and calling me a Polock, apparently he was seeing if I could do the work or not.

Just found out about this place tonight and I'm thinking it's exactly what I needed.
 Just got over a big break up and I'm really trying to get past it and meet some new people.

I'm mostly just looking for someone to hang out with on Fridays/weekends. For all the time that I've lived in the city I really haven't explored it much. And maybe just some casual fun on the side. I'm really rather open to anything.

I'm not into drinking and am allergic to smoke/cigarettes so if you do smoke I'll have to stand upwind of you. :P

Currently in Manhattan for school, 3rd year Psychology Major. Hoping to snag a summer internship with Sesame Workshop. [I'm planning on going into counseling/social work for families and children so I really need that experience in child related fields!]

Not much of an athlete but I love a good game of soccer, hockey, badminton, football, tennis, what ever. You name it, I can probably keep from falling over while playing it!

I used to be an avid reader and am hoping to get back into it when money allows.
 I also really love movies, especially animated films. Really wish I could go downtown to Loews or something more often.

It'd be awesome if there were someone on the main island itself, not really a fan of going down into Brookyln or up into the Bronx. Near the Upper West Side would be the best.

TL;DR, Psych Student in the Upper West Side looking for friends with benefits of either gender to just hang out and do things with, interested in sports, art, media, anything really.

1a2uou,7,2013-03-11,No motivation to do anything anymore.,throwaway123454321ab,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1a2uou/no_motivation_to_do_anything_anymore/,"Hi, I'm 20 years old. I have an older brother and both parents who live in the same house. 

I've never thought I would be depressed, but after this horrendous start to this year, I'm thinking that I might be.

Let me first start off by saying that my older brother and I are completely opposites.

We are blood brothers, but he is MUCH better looking, taller, more muscular, where as I am overweight and pretty ugly. He is also MUCH more smarter than I am and clearly my parents love him more than me.

He's had everything go his way in our house, doesn't wash his dishes?, oh don't worry 123454321ab will do it because he needs to 'study' when all he does is play games in his room. 

Oh, you asked for the car first?, no, he needs it to go to his friends house which is like 10 mins walk from our house.  

Oh, you want an iPod after getting B's and C's all year? (This was EXTREMELY hard for me as I'm horrible at school) No, we want the to spend our money on giving your brother the newer model of iPod, and no you can't have his old one.

Everything that I own, is from my OWN money, that I worked hard for at my job at a factory.

Everything that I own, has been bought with my own money, the computer that I built, my phone, everything.

The only thing my parents provide me with is a roof over my head and food, I pay my own share of internet and phone bills and even give my parents an extra $150 for anything they need help with.

Guess what they use that $150 for? That's right presents for my brother.

Tonight, I told my parents that I dropped out of my course in order to find a full time job after having no motivation to finish off my course. My brother criticizes me and says, ""Go wash the dishes, all you do is stay home and play games, with your no education and no proper job. I hope you die.""  

The only joy in my life right now are my group of friends. At the moment they are my only saving grace from me possibly ending my life. Even though we don't see each other everyday, we all talk in a massive group over skype, and this cheers me up everytime I have a down moment. Although I haven't told them I feel this way, they will always be there for me.

I seriously have no motivation of anything right now. I currently go to work 2 days per week, and this sustains me, but I feel like I have no path for my future.

My brother on the otherhand, just got an internship at a law firm and I can see him as an auditor.

I remember when I was young, my parents told me that they moved to Australia so that my brother and I could have a better life, a better education, so that we wouldn't have to work in factories and hard working jobs our whole lives like my parents. I feel like that I have disappointed them so much that they don't even express love for me anymore.

I am close to the suicide line, if my life doesn't pick up by next year, I most likely won't be around."

A week and a half ago, I completed a paid marketing internship. I am still a full-time student; however, that internship was my source of income. I am currently interviewing with a local agency, I have completed two interviews and now I am just waiting to go on to the next step of the process (if selected). 
My question is, what can I do to make money in the mean time? The company wants to fill the position by April 1st, but I want to have some income while I am waiting on the outcome. 
I am a full-time student but I take all of my classes in one day, which means I have a lot of free time right now. 
I am still submitting resumes, but I am looking for more of an immediate return versus the typical job hunting, waiting two weeks then getting a paycheck. 

Unfortunately, a life of crime is not an option. I'm not tough enough."

Advice please?

I am on my second semester of college. I hate it. It's not particularly ""hard"" - but I am just sick of school and terribly unmotivated. I don't want to have anything to do with it and I just want to leave. I feel like by going to school now, not only am I emptying my wallet on something I can get for free, but I feel like I am wasting my time and closing doors.

I recently got an internship at a company run by someone I guess I could consider an idol of mine, in a sense. It's literally like a dream come true. On top if it being a job that I love, the pay is pretty damned good.

I started my own company senior year - and I am extremely confident in the idea, but school draws away from my ability to work on it.

I also acquired 4% of a group of Rutger's Business school seniors' company - and I LOVE the idea, but I am having trouble working on the code for the app because school is taking away from my time. 

It's really hard, you know. It sounds stupid for me to say, (first world problem) - but I feel like every second I sit here thinking about it I am throwing away part of my future. I need to make a decision, and quickly. 
I know that the ultimatum is me dropping out of school. I just can't bring myself to do it. It might have something to do with peoples' (family, etc) expectations.

It is tearing me apart inside. I have been depressed all through highschool because I have always been called a failure because of my grades. I am starting to see glimpses of success that have nothing to do with school, and I am not ready to let school take it away from me/throw it away for school. 
Please, if you can't give advice, at least acknowledge. Thanks. "

I just feel like I can write this here if anywhere at all. The actual needing of advice is at the bottom. Also, now that I read it back - sorry for the shitty poorly structured writing.
-------------------------------------------------------

I am tired of feeling like I am always doing the wrong thing. I am always in the wrong place at the wrong time wanting the wrong stuff. It is always my fault, and I can't exactly argue against that. I have never intended on doing any wrong, but I always find myself not doing what other people want, and feeling terribly guilty about it. It could be that I have a naturally guilty conscious, or it could be that my entire life I've been shot down for doing everything that isn't what people have expected of me. I spend hours and days working on things I love (Software. There are probably a lot of other software guys here, too), learning endlessly, only to find out that none of it really matters to anyone but me. I caught on relatively quickly when people started insinuating that my poor grades and lack of dedication to academics are exactly what's wrong with me. I can't really blame them, either. It's how things are nowadays. The worst part about it hasn't been the work itself. School has always been easy for me, and I've always known how to fix it. I just never did. I hate(d) everything about school and just don't want to ""fix"" that.



I never really took anyone's advice. I kept not doing things, and doing other things. I came to accept titles. Lazy, potentially retarded, disconnected from the world, a failure.

I'm in college now. A local community college. It's not terrible, really. A lot of people from other, actually pretty nice colleges have been dropping out and going here instead. I still don't feel it, though. I can see how other people would be excited, but I just feel like it's not for me. I still go to class every day and try to endure it.

I absolutely feel like it's not for me at all. 

On the bright side



Senior year I started a company, which in my mind is going ok. Not much results, but I see what it could be.

In the early Winter a Rutgers U senior and a friend gave me 4% of their company to write a backend for them. That's getting somewhere... slowly.

I recently got an internship in a company that happens to be run by one of my ""childhood"" (more of late-teenhood) idols, which I personally consider fucking amazing. On top of doing what I love for someone I look up to, the pay is pretty damned awesome.

 For some reason I am still horribly out of place. Not at the company or anything. I just feel like all of the other things in my life are drawing away from the good. I can barely 
 
 
Every bone in my body wants to drop out, and be what I can be. I *know* I can continue to get footing in the industry and I have faith in myself to run an extremely succesful company; But something is holding me back. I have no idea what to do, and desparately need advice. I am finding it more and more difficult every day to get my school work done, because I am stuck between the massive pull of potential success, and peoples' expectations. I know I will inevitably let people down when it comes to school, but I just can't come to embrace it. Someone help?"

Just found out about this place tonight and I'm thinking it's exactly what I needed.     
Just got over a big break up and I'm really trying to get past it and meet some new people.

I'm mostly just looking for someone to hang out with on Fridays/weekends. For all the time that I've lived in the city I really haven't explored it much. And maybe just some casual fun on the side. I'm really rather open to anything.

I'm not into drinking and am allergic to smoke/cigarettes so if you do smoke I'll have to stand upwind of you. :P

Not much of an athlete but I love a good game of soccer, hockey, badminton, football, tennis, what ever. You name it, I can probably keep from falling over while playing it!

I used to be an avid reader and am hoping to get back into it when money allows.    
I also really love movies, especially animated films. Really wish I could go downtown to Loews or something more often.

1a2k1i,1,2013-03-11,Just posted this as a response in another thread. Thought it belonged here [3],[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1a2k1i/just_posted_this_as_a_response_in_another_thread/,"Copy that. You sound pretty cool in regards to your attitude on weed. It's totally your choice if you ever want to smoke or not.

That being said, I feel like telling a small story, if that's okay -- just in case you ever do try it on your own in the proper setting with intelligent/responsible smokers [(and we do exist, in pretty huge numbers)](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-02-28/silicon-valley-is-high-on-innovation-dot-and-pot).

I was a criminal justice and sociology double-major with a plan to work my way up through federal law enforcement -- never touched pot throughout high school or college for this exact reason. Ended up not going into the profession after receiving a lengthy education and doing my internship with County, because, well, the U.S. Justice System, particularly the war on drugs and our incarceration methods are completely fucked up. Mind you, never touched a single drug this entire time. 

Fast-forward to 26 -- while travelling abroad in Thailand and buzzing, a friend offers me a joint. Beautiful country, having a great time with new friends, best trip of my life -- figure I'm never going into the law enforcement arena, decide to toke up. End up walking around Chiang Mai with a buddy of mine in the warm summer air, smelling the tropical breeze and feeling as pleasant and light as a feather. It was fantastic.

I ended up doing another year abroad (in Korea, a country where it's not particularly wise to try to attain/smoke weed and is usually punished by deportation or imprisonment for foreigners) before moving back to the states, and have been smoking every since.

I am now 29, and I have gone through various stages of personal reasons for smoking, and at this point am smoking about once every day, or every other day. Truth be told, if I focus on tasks while I'm high, (especially creative works like writing, or repetitive data-copying like lab reports), I actually find the tasks *easier to perform* and often think much differently while I am high.

But that's just explaining functional smoking, which I am working on. I have three jobs, a girlfriend (she doesn't smoke), am going to school for prerequisites for a master's part-time, and am the vice-president of the science organization at the community college I work at. I'm also working on becoming a full-time teacher and working on science fiction writing in the meantime.

The point of all this isn't to brag or tell you that weed gives you superpowers. The point of all this is to tell you that, despite your rather unfortunate experiences of your own and with people you know with marijuana, it's just not right for some people, but very likely the problem is *those people* and not marijuana. I can guarantee you some of the most prominent people in your local community are daily smokers, and probably a lot more than you think.

The reason you, and many people, (including my former self) don't realize this is because of the stigma of marijuana, which was almost entirely constructed on false pretenses. They can't say that they do it, because that fact alone would ruin their otherwise great reputation in their community. On a much smaller scale (as it is a choice, if nothing else), it is very much like homosexuality throughout history -- people had to hide it because it would absolutely ruin them, and in some cases actually would *get them murdered*. Obviously there are major differences here, but in some aspects is it basically the same thing -- a personal choice that not only doesn't harm anybody but actually *tends to increase creativity, imagination, and overall enjoyment of life.* 

Yes, it's a drug, and yes, there are some things that you shouldn't do on it, like operate machinery or perform (some) jobs, among other common sense things. But honestly man, as a former [HEAVY DRINKER](http://i.imgur.com/VFmquOD.jpg) in college, I can tell you that marijuana far exceeds alcohol in almost every realm. I am more social. I get no hangover. I feel better. I can be ""intoxicated"" in 5 minutes rather than taking an hour or two to ""get drunk"". Sex is better. I write better. I start to think of ideas I would have never even considered without smoking.

And that's really just the start, man. [You feel much more relaxed.](http://i.imgur.com/LPihV.jpg) You're still in control of what you do, and you're still able to make moral decisions. [Life becomes more interesting](http://imgur.com/Ywx07) -- that doesnt' mean that you should be high 24/7. It means it's *just another way to experience life*. And we, very likely, only get one.

Anyways, I hope this at least imparted some wisdom to you. I'm not trying to get you to smoke, that is wholly your choice. I'm just trying to tell you that, for me, honestly? It has changed my entire life for the positive.

If you have read this far, thank you for being so open-minded. I highly urge you check out [this article by Sam Harris](http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/drugs-and-the-meaning-of-life), a neuroscientist and philosopher, called **""Drugs and the Meaning of Life""**. It's one of the best articles on experimental drug usage and the positive effects of them I have read. 

Cheers, bro. "

I was visiting London and my friend invited me to come over &amp; catch up - he happens to be living with his Godfather (Bill Bailey) whilst he's doing an internship in London.

The house was mind-blowing, it's like a zoo. Glass container in the middle of the kitchen with 4-6 little monkeys in it, 4 'pack' dogs running everywhere (unsure which breed), a chameleon that casually lives in their shower, giant pigeons &amp; other rare birds in a large cage in their back garden, 4 parrots located around the house. Can't even remember half the things I seen. 

Was offered a vodka, tonic &amp; lychee the second I walked in the door. Him &amp; his wife are amazing people, they showed me &amp; my girlfriend all around the house and they asked more about us than we got the chance to ask them. I never even got the chance to tell Bill that QI was the only reason I turn on my TV!

Gave me a whole new appreciation for Bill!

I haven't seen her or heard her voice since. I'm having a really hard time giving up on the hope that we will be together again in the future. After 3 weeks I broke NC and I sent her this letter that I put my all into. I don't really regret sending it to her even though the response she sent hurt. I wanted her to see it. The only part of that letter she responded to was the part about me being afraid that we can't be simply be friends anymore. She texted me, ""while you're right it might be hard for us to be friends, I'd like to try when I come back at the end of march to visit family and friends. I think it'll help us move on.(Shes away on a semester internship) "" 

That hurt really bad. I didn't respond, and haven't said anything to her since, because I'm not sure I have the strength just to be friends with this girl. We shared something that will never go away. I'll never forget that every time I see her. I know she won't either. So as the end of March gets closer, I get incredibly more worried and nervous. I've thought about just telling her that I don't think its a good idea to meet up if she tries to get in contact with me like she said she would when she comes back to visit.

So I don't know if I'm just ranting, or looking for responses to what's on my mind but I felt like posting this. If you're interested in anymore background you can check my submissions. Thanks for being here."

1a27hy,5,2013-03-10,Worn Thin,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1a27hy/worn_thin/,"I conceptualize my moods in some odd ways. It is never a break from reality, but rather a perception of myself and my interaction with a much larger, usually hostile or somehow poisonous world. At one point, I felt alive, even if it was a beaten and seriously wounded life. I once felt filled to the limit with despair, almost powerful enough to feel a deep pressure and heaviness. Overwhelming sadness.

Now, over the course of the past few months, it's as if everything had been emptied out, and I've been worn to a sliver or starved to a waif. I don't have the energy or desire to deal with anybody except myself, and want desperately to have as much isolation as I can get-within the limits of my own need for a small group of friends. It's an unrealistic goal to be totally alone, but given my extreme reluctance to expend energy which has not already been meted out to work or occasional excursions and my growing cynicism toward the world at large, it has become a reflex action.

Work is a large factor in this development. I have to deal with people on a regular basis and can be notified of assignments constantly and at all hours. I barely associate my particular field with any of the lofty idealism I once had (this does not seem to be a coincidence; I'm one of the so-called ""millenials"" and as far as I can tell, we're disposable cogs for internships and low-wage labor). For me, an assignment is no more than it's dollar amount and everybody else is a means to an end. I have no exploitative tendencies, but empathy is no longer a factor, either. It disappeared somewhere in the fog.

Meds might also have something to do with it. I just got off Concerta and I'm preparing to go on Wellbutrin. Stimulants definitely aren't my thing; Adderall was a nightmare and though the Concerta wasn't as heavy-hitting, it fucked up my baseline far too often to justify its continued use.

Building myself up from here is a pretty daunting task. I've been stripped of a hell of a lot, and I can't just slap all of it back on and expect my old self to be rebuilt. I don't see death, not yet. I don't see a future ahead of me either and a part of me has no capability to create one. It would require efforts which I simply cannot muster."
1a25i8,2,2013-03-10,"I am a recent graduate, and have gotten several part time and two full time jobs by applying online. Here is my experience.",IGetJobs,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1a25i8/i_am_a_recent_graduate_and_have_gotten_several/,"**1. Best Buy**

The trick with them (and a lot of positions) is passing the personality test. Realize that the personality test is way out of touch with reality and there is no need to second guess yourself. Answer the ""obvious"" correct one and try to not answer many questions ""in the middle."" For example:

Question: Do you like being in a crowd?

(a) Yes

(b) Sometimes

(c) No

The answer (unfortunately) is yes. You want to show yourself as being extroverted, etc. etc. It doesn't matter if the position is client facing or not, you need to be able to ""work in a team"" and somehow these personality tests reveal that /s. 

In addition, the ""sometimes"" answers are bad. At Best Buy at least (and probably other places as well), your whole application actually gets locked out if you do not score high enough. Your experience could be killer and you could have been a manager at Circuit City for 5 years, but if you don't pass that personality test, you're out. 

[http://www.ehow.com/how_4446746_pass-preemployment-personality-test.html](Here is an article on passing these tests.)

**2. Internship 1, 2, &amp; 3**

I applied (and got) three internships through my school job board. **I am not a technical major**, however the two paid ones were technical based (database management and technical writing). Two of them were paid, one of them was not but I got awesome experience (better than the two paid ones) and class credit. I thoroughly believe that school job boards are the way to go for internships as the employer has already got your school in mind when looking at applications.

In addition, one of the internships offered me a full time position upon graduation but I already had one lined up, read below.

**3. First Full Time Position**

I actually started out this position as part time while in college. I also doubled up, and took one of the other internships above while working at this place. It was my last semester and I only had classes two days a week, so it was easy to work 15 hrs/week at each place.

Anyways, this position was a posting on Craigslist regarding a product I LOVED (technical based) and it paid better than any other part time positions I'd had thus far. I applied, boosting my resume with a ""portfolio"" of projects I had done with the product throughout the years. I got the job during the summer, and went full time after graduating in December until...

**4. Second Full Time Position**

I just sent in the signed offer letter for my first ""career"" position. My previous role was at a company I loved with people I really liked working with, but in a field that I am not passionate about. The company was growing, but slowly. They have been very supportive about my progress and are still supportive in the wake of me leaving.

The company I just signed on with will be giving me training in advanced programs and in a field that I am very excited about being in.

This company had me do an online test. It was *hard*. Lots of pattern recognition, math problems (I have a funny form of number dyslexia so this was scary as mess for me since it was timed, as much as I otherwise like math), and a personality test at the end. I passed it, got two phone interviews and an in person interview... then had to take the test again. *shudder* My new manager told me that about 8% of the people pass the test. Whether this is due to laziness or not, I do not know.

What was interesting about this position however is that I really wasn't qualified for it. It is for making eLearning courses and I have had minimal experience in many of the programs they use, but they asked me for examples of any graphic work I did have and I sent it all in. In addition, I downloaded a trial version of Captivate and make a quick eLearning course in it to give to them as well. I've put a lot of effort into getting this position, and I'm happy that it panned out. 

That being said, all of the other positions I applied for that I was actually somewhat qualified for never contacted me. *shrug*

**So there it is**...

Some background on me:

* White, female
* ~3.3 GPA
* Humanities degree at a state college
* Technically oriented (but again, a degree that doesn't show it)
* Founded a club (unrelated to my major or career), president of ambassador program freshman year at a community college
* Studied abroad (related to my major, unrelated to career)
* Active LinkedIn profile (not sure if this ever helped)
* Held a total of 9 paid part-time jobs/internships while in college and one 1 unpaid internship, often two at a time
* Total jobs gotten by networking: 3 (part time), total jobs gotten online: 6 (+ unpaid internship)
* I deal with anxiety and depression issues, and some atypical migraines. I'm outgoing in the sense that I have no trouble with public speaking or approaching people, but I'm mostly antisocial and don't go out very much.

I apologize for the wall of text, and I am in NO way suggesting to drop the networking route. This has worked for me so far, and I am a huge advocate for job networking. If I can be more specific about anything or if you have any questions, please let me know."

I am a married 26 year old male with no kids at the moment.

I have been going to school for quite some time to finish my bachelors degree (in which I will be done this Fall 2013) and right now I am at the point of going to take my MCATs so that I can apply for medical school this coming June 2013. There is a high probability that I will be able to get into medical school here in the states and I'm not ""too"" worried about being rejected. 

Here is where the ""issue"" comes in, I have been offered to work with my brother and to help run his electrical company. We do both commercial and residential buildings with occasional renovation work for quick cash and as of right now we have a total bid amount of $16 million with more contracts in the works. 

My brother is well aware of my work ethics and he wants someone who is like-minded like him so that he can amplify the business and make more money. The idea is that the more money that can be brought in, the more money we both can make rather than him handling everything himself. Basically he's the CEO, CFO, and COO and he needs help to distribute the load and reduce the bottleneck effect as he's having a hard time being in two places at once. And this is where I come in.

He is also aware that I am trying to go to medical school and he's trying to essentially ""buy me out"" of medical school and work with him to run the company and make a lot of money.

I am torn on what I want to do, I've invested a lot of time and energy to pursue a career in medicine and I truly do enjoy it because everything in biology makes sense. I also enjoy what I am learning out in the construction field and one misconception that I would like to correct is that it's not just a bunch of guys swinging hammers. To be able to run a job site, you have to know how to handle the people who work for you and to be able to get what you want out of them so that it's a win-win situation. And in order to do that, you have to be able to think on your feet and understand the limitations of people on what they can and cannot do. There are a lot of mind games that you have to play to achieve your ending goal and I enjoy being able to do that.

I also have 4 years experience in working in a genetic research facility for a muscle wasting disease and the level of work that I was doing (without having an degree of any kind) was that of a Ph.D. It was basically an internship that lead to an employment opportunity later on. I was working on a Ph.D. level without being paid as one and that was fine for me because the experience that I've gotten could not have been gotten anywhere else, especially for an undergraduate student. On a side note, I am also a published author in various medical journals and one of those publications, I am a ""second author"" (this is a very big deal in the medical field). And because of this this experience that I've gotten, I am not worried about being able to get into medical school.

Basically to answer a question that may potentially come up, I enjoy both medical field and the construction field. They both offer me mental stimulation and perspective on people and how to troubleshoot when things don't work out the way you plan (construction field and laboratory work).

I will be able to make money both ways, but I don't know which one I should take, there are both pros and cons to each and I need help from people who are not biased towards me and to offer me insight or personal experience. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this, I will do the best I can to answer questions that you may ask or to expand on details where appropriate."

tyler group barcelona relations

In a cramped office in downtown Madrid, five young architects who found themselves jobless in Spain's wrenching economic crisis sit almost elbow to elbow — glued to computer screens as they create 3-D videos of construction proposals for far-flung sites in Britain, Panama, Malaysia and Zambia.
The founders of the Factoria 5 digital design company last month took home €2,000 ($2,700) each for the projects they are delivering. That's good money for professionals in a field so blighted by Spain's building bust that many of Factoria 5's fellow architecture grads are either unemployed, have given up on architecture or moved abroad. One, who considers himself lucky, became a train conductor.
Juan Francisco Lopez, one of the founders of the firm, took another path in the crisis, one that goes deeply against the grain of Spain's traditional career path: With no work coming to them, Lopez and his partners decided to go after the work, taking control of their destiny with a risky startup.
""Architecture will never come back to Spain as a business again like it was,"" said Lopez. ""But our business has been growing little by little as Spain's economy has been falling.""
By spawning astonishing 50 percent youth unemployment, Spain's crushing crisis appears to be starting to force ingenuity, innovation and creativity among young professionals who are taking risks and bucking the pattern of seeking security under the umbrella of an established business. That means embracing a more American-style entrepreneurial spirit — breathing a new spirit into the workforce of a country where ""making it"" typically meant a good, stable job with a blue chip company or in the family business.
Two members of Factoria 5 are friends of Class of 2012 participant Rafael Gonzalez del Castillo, who admires them for taking a big risk by sticking with Spain in tough times, instead of leaving to hawk their skills in booming economies elsewhere, amid a corrosive brain drain that threatens Spain's longterm future.
""We are young,"" said Gonzalez del Castillo, who expects to become a full-fledged architect soon with approval for his graduation project. ""We are the best at creating new things because we are open-minded and that is what the world needs now: creation, change.""
Spain has long been viewed as a laggard in startup entrepreneurship compared to other European countries. Startup proponents say there are encouraging signs that may be changing, though they acknowledge there are no hard numbers yet to provide strong evidence of a trend. In one positive sign, there was a big jump last year in Spanish startups seeking early stage capital funding, according to New York-based investment platform Gust LLC, which matches investors with entrepreneurs. And the number of self-employed Spaniards also rose, after successive years of declines.
""It's the mentality of the people,"" said Alex Barrera, a co-founder and former chief executive of the Tetuan Valley startup school in Madrid that gives 6-week crash courses to would-be young entrepreneurs. ""I go to universities and this is an option students are now considering, whereas before they weren't even thinking about it. They were just thinking of working for a big company or for government. Now people realize you can build a company around a mobile app.""
No one disputes that the Spanish economy is in the midst of a Darwinian phase of survival of the fittest — and those willing and able to carve out something new in the crisis may be the ones best placed to come out on top once good times return.
""There are a lot of young people and even those up to 40 or so years old who are doing new business experiments,"" said Jose Ramon Pin, a business management professor at the IESE Business School in Madrid. ""And there's a natural selection of companies under way. Those that survive the crisis or start during it have the advantage: The market will be theirs when the economy bounces back.""
When the architects of Factoria 5 started their company as Spain's economy lurched into a deep double-dip recession, some of their parents told them they were crazy. The would-be entrepreneurs, however, had all just finished their architecture degrees plus digital media masters degrees and sensed they could fill a niche by becoming high-tech content suppliers to Spanish architects who no longer had work at home but were increasingly designing projects for foreign clients. The only other option was seeking work abroad.
After 18 months of 70-hour work weeks, few weekends off and skimping on costs by walking or taking public transport to visit clients, the hard work has paid off: Factoria 5 has completed 65 projects and makes money — if not always a profit.
During down months, they take home almost nothing but have always managed to pay their monthly costs of about â,7/82,000 for rent and other office expenses, plus national health care and social security. Right now they're working on videos to showcase an office building in El Salvador, corporate headquarters in Puerto Rico, furniture in Madrid and advertising space for fragrances in Barcelona; about 90 percent of their work is for projects abroad.
The architects consider the result a victory given the terrible state of Spain's economy. But the success is bittersweet: They don't think they'll ever build the real buildings they dreamed about during their studies: Museums, apartment buildings, and a government offices like those that country built with no end in sight until the construction boom crashed in 2008.
Gonzalez del Castillo, who plans to seek architecture work abroad once he gets his degree, respects his friends' resolve: ""Sometimes it seems that the hardest part ... is to go abroad, but maybe it is harder to stay here and try to face it, changing the way you work.""
Across the country, other young entrepreneurs working on separate ventures are increasingly banding together in groups of 10 or so to jointly rent office space, splitting the bill and sometimes the cost of a secretary to serve all of their different businesses.
""Many of these people don't hold out much hope of getting a traditional job with a Spanish company for the next 15 years or so but they are creative, so they decide to create their own businesses,"" said Ricardo Ibarra Roca, the 28-year-old president of The Spanish Youth Council, which represents 76 Spanish associations representing young adults.
Far from Madrid's center, in an industrial park that's home to countless auto repair shops, more than two dozen mostly 20-something application developers, sales representatives, community managers and content editors work in an open loft office space for social travel startup Minube (Mycloud in Spanish), which provides travel experiences from users around the world in multiple languages on its Internet site and smartphone applications. The company had revenue of â,7/81 million last year, and is forecasting an increase of 40 percent this year.
""If we weren't in crisis, it's possible this company wouldn't exist,"" said founder Raul Jimenez, 35. ""The great opportunity is innovation, and the crisis is helping because it pushes people out of their comfort zone.""
Spanish companies that are successful traditionally move to better digs and prime locations when successful, but Jimenez decided to move just a few blocks within the industrial park when Minube's space got too small.
The company also breaks traditional business norms by having shifts that end at 5:30 p.m. or 6:30 p.m. instead of later or when the boss leaves the office, no two-hour Spanish lunches and no separate offices for higher-ups. The formal attire common in Spanish companies is unknown here. In a country where directors of company often closet themselves in expansive offices, the Minube interns sit next to Jimenez.
Minube's growth has coincided precisely with Spain's economic decline. It got its start with a â,7/8400,000 loan in 2007 before the crisis hit, but hasn't been able to obtain any credit for expansion since then, so all income has been plowed back into operations and the company ruthlessly keeps costs down. Surviving in an era of austerity is an accomplishment, Jimenez says, and he senses a mindset change among Spaniards toward work after years of bad economic times with no end in sight.
During Spain's boom times, Jimenez recalled, it wasn't uncommon or frowned upon in Spain for workers to quit jobs, and go on unemployment with monthly government payments until they were ready to take on another easy-to-find job. While that's also happened in other countries, Jimenez said the attitude change in Spain has been profound.
""Five years ago, people would go to the beach for six months and then find another job. Now everyone wants to work,"" he said. ""When the comfort zone breaks apart, it changes people. I've never before seen the spirit of change that there is now. I have friends who are leaving big companies so they can experiment.""

Planning on moving to SD and just looking for some overall insight, or if you want, just tell me why you love living there.",[deleted],sandiego,https://www.reddit.com/r/sandiego/comments/1a1xia/i_know_its_been_asked_multiple_times_but_im/,"Hi everyone! 24 years old, Connecticut.

I'm planning on moving out to San Diego **awhile** from now...like in a year. But I'm big on making plans and trying to get things situated beforehand if possible, so I wanted to see if you all had any advice about where I should look for work (or specific companies I might apply to) when the time to move gets a little closer.

I'm fairly certain that most companies won't hire someone who lives across the country, so I have a feeling I'm going to have to move without a job lined up, so if someone (anyone? please?) wants to change my mind about that, I'd love to hear what you have to say.

As far as my background is concerned...
Graduated in 2010 with a B.A. in Communications
Graduated in 2011 with my M.S. in Professional Communications
Completed two internships in public relations during undergrad. Worked as an assistant college coach for two years (while completing my Masters and the year after). Worked in IT for a year as a Business Analyst (they hired me because of my background in writing, but really I wasn't right for this position).
Started working in marketing at a nonprofit in July, where I currently still work. I do social media, photography and videography of events, website administration. I also do a ton of writing...press releases, copy for the website, e-newsletters, and promotional materials.

I love what I do, and ideally I'd like to do similar work somewhere out there. I'd also *love* to work in communications/marketing/public relations in higher ed, but I've learned that even though I worked as a college coach for two years, most colleges/universities don't consider that enough higher ed experience to want to hire me to work at their school.

Again, I realize this is very early to be doing this, but I figure it's never too early to put out feelers and get some insight into what the process would be of lining up a job *before* I move, or soon after moving.

Any insight into moving as well would be appreciated...perhaps from anyone who has moved across country or significant distance.

And, anyone who just wants to tell me about how much you love San Diego, what brought you there, what part of the city you live in...I'd love to hear it all.

Thank you so much!"

I was accepted, but I'm weary about the program for a few reasons:

1. It seems like the only editing/publishing professors in the program are all visiting professors. This seems kind of strange to me.

2. While I enjoy writing (and got my undergraduate degree in creative writing), I'm wanting my master's degree to focus on editing and publishing. Over half of the classes seem to focus on workshops and writing rather than anything specific to the publishing industry.

3. DePaul doesn't have its own press, so I'm not sure how easy it is to get an internship through one of the presses in the area. 

Anyone have any experience with the department? My other major school I'm looking at (and still waiting to hear back from) is Portland State University. While Chicago would arguably be better for a career, Portland's program seems like it fits with me a lot more.

Here are the links for the respective programs, in case anyone is interested:

I am a sophomore undergrad majoring in biology and pursuing a career in research. I'm having a weird today. On the one hand, I just secured an apartment for me and my boyfriend (yay!) but I also just got notified that I was rejected from another summer research internship that I applied to. This is the second one that has denied me, citing a high volume of applicants for a limited number of spots as the reason. I am still waiting to hear back from one more, but it is the least attractive option because this one wouldn't provide housing so I would have to come up with a plan to get there and still make money. I am taking on my own student loans so as much as I would love to just be concerned with doing something I like, making money over the summer has to be a priority for me.

I had noticed on the sites for these tow programs that I was rejected from they specifically note that the programs are designed for minority groups that are underrepresented in biomedical research to have access to graduate education. From what I'm gathering between that and the high volume of minority individuals who participate in these programs (as seen by their year to year group photos) is that while they say ""people of all groups are encouraged to apply"", what they mean is that sure, you can apply, but we won't actually care about your application if you're white.

I am a good student, I'm in the honors program at my school, and I've worked my ass off so far in college. I don't think it's very fair that I am not considered as qualified for these programs just because I'm not a racial minority. Anyone else having similar frustrations?

Bill Clinton admits he was wrong.

When Ex-President Bill Clinton admits he was wrong about everything he did while he was in the oval office, you realize he is a man with no substance or commitment to who he is as a man. He was terribly wrong for what he did to a young intern in the oval office. Bill Clinton is no hero, he sexually abused a young girl in the white house, he is no hero. Any politician, who thinks Bill Clinton is a mentor or role model, is admitting that they have no loyalty, commitment or respect for the millions of Americans who have lost their lives in the past to protect our constitution. Fifty percent 50% of American families have moral boundaries and moral values, and ""rights"" to uphold the constitution upon the soil of America. Modern day lobbyist have creeped into our traditional politic's, and politicians like, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and Andrew Cuomo, have disregarded our constitutional rights and laws that made us the most powerful country in the world. We the people, are worth more than the bullshit these politicians are shoving down our throats. We are not democrats, we are not homosexuals, we are not muslims, we are not baby killers, we are not illegal immigrants, we are Americans. Stop fighting to change our constitutional rights because those laws are what makes us a strong America, gay America is not a strong America, gay America is a manipulated America, and it will ultimately destroy our freedom and the respect of other countries around the world. The Constitution should remain in tack as is, where is, maintained, and nothing or no one should have the right to manipulate those American laws, not ever. Bill Clinton is a perfect example of why there should be no ""thought or opinion"" that is supported by a man like him, who is controlled by the influence of manipulation.

i responded with this:

LinkedIn Melissa Ulto has sent you a message. Date: 3/11/2013 Subject: RE: Bill Clinton admits he was wrong. as a bisexual woman and friend of many gay people, i find your message HIGHLY offensive. stop sending hate through linkedin. i will notify every gay organization and civil rights organization about your publication is that is your attitude toward your FELLOW AMERICANS.

she responded with the below which is just sick:

Melissa Ulto, don't you ever threaten me, I don't care about your gay and civil rights organizations, who the hell do you think that you are, huh? When you missy bi-sexual needed help many years ago I helped you, and told your story. How dare you think you got the balls to screw with me, if you want to be in the spotlight, I'll put you in the spotlight, bring it on! I will expose you, I'll do a followup story about you, the poor battered woman. You devious piece of garbage, you sound like a real bully pig. Don't you ever threaten me again, you got that? Remove yourself from my LinkedIn! You better stop bullying people young lady... you tell your gay and civil rights organizations to give me a call because my publication or my readers, are not going to take your threats lying down. To think I helped you, you piece of garbage. BTW, I don't care if you eat pussy or suck dicks, so don't try to shove your sexual preference down my throat because I don't!

i responded with this:

Thank you for giving me copious ammunition, you hateful person. Battered? Lol, we corresponded about me being ripped off by an investor you fuckwit. Your special kind of hate will be forwarded to everyone I can think of, because people like you don't seem to get we all have civil and human rights. Not so long ago women and POC couldn't vote. Remember when Italians were called WOPS (without papers)? What you are saying about immigrants is all kinds of hateful when you clearly don't get we were all immigrants to this country in our familial history. You need to bone up on human rights - if you believe in your own, how can you say you're more human than others? You sound like a Nazi, lady.

then Barbara sent this:

What the fuck are you talking about? You're a fucking bully who shoves your sexual preferences down straight people's throats, you are a straight people hater, this is your problem, you are always on the defense when someone does not agree with you! Too fucking bad, this time. I don't hate people, I help a lot of people and I have thousands of readers and contacts, who are gay, lesbians, straight, bi-sexual, immigrants, black, white, hispanics, Indians, and asians. I'm with Millions of Americans, who do not agree with gay marriage or who think illegal immigrants should not get a free ride through our borders. It's called the freedom of speech, and not only gay people like you have an opinion, straight people have an opinion too! You are so far off from the truth about me and this article, and you will not achieve anything from being devious, I promise you that.
The only difference between gay people and straight people is sexual preference, gays have the same rights as straight people in the bedroom. The U.S. Constitution refers to marriage being between a man and a woman, it has nothing to do with equality for gays and lesbians sexual preference. I support equal rights for gays, but, marriage is off limits because marriage is between a man and a woman. Gays and lesbians can not reproduce the population without straight sex, you need Adam and Eve to have a child. Marriage is between a man and a woman, and that is what I believe, this is the Word of God!
The message in the article I wrote is a metaphor, that just a selective few are being cared for in America, and all those people you mentioned are being squeezed into a corner and ignored. We are all immigrants here, we all have family members that are gay and we love them, we all have neighbors, that are muslims, jews, italians, africans, latinos, asians etc. but, we cannot allow our own rights to be diminished for anything or anyone. The United States Constitution, these are the principles that this land was built on, these laws are what makes America free, and if we start touching those laws we will become like the rest of the world. Do you want to live in a country like Egypt? No, you do not! That is why it is extremely important we uphold the Constitution of the United States of America.
It's best you move on... Melissa Ulto... This conversation is finished.

i got further messages from her threatening, blaming and accusing me off all kinds of things, and more hate speech.

We plan to have kids in about 2 years, at which point she will either work part time or not at all to raise the kids, so we aren't as worried about her career prospects.

As for experience, I have been working for a law firm for the last year as a paralegal/legal assistant, specifically handling personal injury cases. I have recently found out about actuarial sciences and want to try to pursue a career in this field.

 I understand it’s most likely a matter of how hard I work and it’s not going to happen quickly, but I am limited in funds and I really want to find a career where I can do something I actually like doing. 
Any advice or brutally honest opinions are welcomed. Thanks in advance. 
Also, I’m located in Arizona. I’m not sure if location makes a difference in this job market.

I have applied to a few job openings at Amazon and some other places as a Software Engineer (or Developer) as I'm hoping to get back in the game (technically) but I feel so out of place when it comes to all the questions that these companies are asking these days. I have the practical experience but I've been out of touch with basic algorithms, I feel so scared (I really do). I have no idea on how to create a maze algorithm (just an example)...I know I've been out of touch with the basic fundamentals, so I'm applying for entry level positions and not intermediate (I'm willing to start from scratch). 

I'm planning to go through all my old OOP books, review basic data structures/sorts etc...but its still so damn scary. Has anyone else been in my shoes? Any tips? Is this normal? I've been using only C# in the past few years, what language do you guys recommend that's considered acceptable during interviews...C++, Java?
I don't mind starting from scratch, I just need a way to get inside a real ""tech"" company, not sure where I stand."

1a5p50,1,2013-03-12,My dilemma: go to medical school or run a company...[x-post from r/offmychest],throwaway_dilemma,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1a5p50/my_dilemma_go_to_medical_school_or_run_a/,"I have a dilemma that I am facing and I am confused on what I want to do; should I go to medical school or should I run a company that has potential to make a lot of money. 

I am a married 26 year old male with no kids at the moment.

I have been going to school for quite some time to finish my bachelors degree (in which I will be done this Fall 2013) and right now I am at the point of going to take my MCATs so that I can apply for medical school this coming June 2013. There is a high probability that I will be able to get into medical school here in the states and I'm not ""too"" worried about being rejected. 

Here is where the ""issue"" comes in, I have been offered to work with my brother and to help run his electrical company. We do both commercial and residential buildings with occasional renovation work for quick cash and as of right now we have a total bid amount of $16 million with more contracts in the works. 

My brother is well aware of my work ethics and he wants someone who is like-minded like him so that he can amplify the business and make more money. The idea is that the more money that can be brought in, the more money we both can make rather than him handling everything himself. Basically he's the CEO, CFO, and COO and he needs help to distribute the load and reduce the bottleneck effect as he's having a hard time being in two places at once. And this is where I come in.

He is also aware that I am trying to go to medical school and he's trying to essentially ""buy me out"" of medical school and work with him to run the company and make a lot of money.

I am torn on what I want to do, I've invested a lot of time and energy to pursue a career in medicine and I truly do enjoy it because everything in biology makes sense. I also enjoy what I am learning out in the construction field and one misconception that I would like to correct is that it's not just a bunch of guys swinging hammers. To be able to run a job site, you have to know how to handle the people who work for you and to be able to get what you want out of them so that it's a win-win situation. And in order to do that, you have to be able to think on your feet and understand the limitations of people on what they can and cannot do. There are a lot of mind games that you have to play to achieve your ending goal and I enjoy being able to do that.

I also have 4 years experience in working in a genetic research facility for a muscle wasting disease and the level of work that I was doing (without having an degree of any kind) was that of a Ph.D. It was basically an internship that lead to an employment opportunity later on. I was working on a Ph.D. level without being paid as one and that was fine for me because the experience that I've gotten could not have been gotten anywhere else, especially for an undergraduate student. On a side note, I am also a published author in various medical journals and one of those publications, I am a ""second author"" (this is a very big deal in the medical field). And because of this this experience that I've gotten, I am not worried about being able to get into medical school.

Basically to answer a question that may potentially come up, I enjoy both medical field and the construction field. They both offer me mental stimulation and perspective on people and how to troubleshoot when things don't work out the way you plan (construction field and laboratory work).

I will be able to make money both ways, but I don't know which one I should take, there are both pros and cons to each and I need help from people who are not biased towards me and to offer me insight or personal experience. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this, I will do the best I can to answer questions that you may ask or to expand on details where appropriate.

I've spoken with famous people occasionally. I typically don't bother asking for a name unless the conversation takes a turn for sensitive info. Anyway, I pretty much don't get star-struck. Apparently we once hosted the site for Mythbusters way back when they were just getting famous. Before their site was moved onto Discovery Channel. So one of my coworkers got yelled at by Adam Savage for not providing support because he wasn't the account-holder nor was he authorized to be given account info.

There are famous people who built and manage their own sites who do call support sometimes. 

This story has nothing to do with that.

On one awful Saturday I was truly star-struck. I got a little shot of adrenaline and got all kinds of excited. But this had nothing to do with celebrities or pseudo-celebrities or any of the pro athletes who have websites with us.

No. This was the day I came face-to-face with our longest running server. Today's uptime shows:

    11:37AM  up 3148 days,  1:34, 8 users, load averages: 0.53, 0.87, 1.10

This device was running continuously since July of 2004. I had to head to the datacenter to reboot something (just a short walk from my desk) and found the rack I was looking for, opened the right cabinet and there it was. There were only about four cases left in this cabinet (we're working to rearrange the DC in question) and there I see the server I'm looking for at the top. Right below that... A label that made me slow down and take my time. I was suddenly all bomb-defusal mode not wanting to make the old beast upset while I rebooted its neighbor.

Call me nerdy but I dare say I swooned for this server's immense uptime. This server last rebooted around the time I was toking it up in college on my way to my internship. This server was live for just under 9 years now.

Side note: this server's part of a pool whose average uptime is 1600 days at the moment.

I'm 26 years-old with an MBA in Accounting (3.7 GPA) living in the US (northeast).  I'm currently studying for the first part of my CPA exam, which is BEC on April 25th.  I have 4 years experience as a staff accountant for a small distribution company.  I also have 3 years of part-time experience preparing individual tax returns using Lacerte at a very small CPA practice (husband, wife, and me).

My goal is to get a full time audit position with a larger firm.  I feel as if I've missed the boat with the Big 4 since I never landed any internships with them.  I've been talking back and forth with Deloitte and PwC for almost 2 years now about landing an audit associate position but long story short, things haven't worked out.  I met with Deloitte in person about a summer internship right before I started my MBA program.  Everything went well but they said that they were already full.  Since then it's just been email contact with recruiters.  My contact with PwC has been mostly through email and a handful of phone interviews but they continue to tell me that there are no positions available in my area.

Looking past the Big 4, I focused my attention on the larger mid-sized firms, such as Grant Thornton, Marcum, BDO, and McGladrey, but still no success.  I know this is a very busy time of year for these firms but I'm really hoping to lock something up once the tax season passes.

I know I should definitely be putting myself out there more but I honestly don't know how.  I finished my MBA this past December and I really didn't think getting into a firm would be this difficult.  I feel like I'm spinning my wheels at my current position and in life, generally speaking.  These are the years I need to be putting in some serious time and acquiring experience but I'm not.  I know the competition in my area is extremely high, maybe the highest in the country, but I have the GPA.  I'm starting to think that the small private college where I got my MBA from was a bad choice, since it can be easily overshadowed by the numerous expensive ivy league schools in the area.

Thoughts of relocating to the southeast US have been becoming more serious as of late.  I know I will need public experience for my career to really take off.  My ultimate goal is to land a high position in an industry job after I put my time in the public sector.

Would it be in my best interest to just get into any firm right now for experience, then jump over to a larger firm like the Big 4, GT, Marcum, BDO, or McGladrey when I have the necessary requirements to come in as a senior associate?

I could really use some input from you guys.  I'm really hitting the books hard for the CPA exam since I know passing some sections will definitely spark some interest among firms.

Thanks in advance guys, /r/accounting has been great to me so far."

I want a slideshow on the front page of the site. I coded the slide show in functions.php, using div names as the identifiers for the images to included. I made a custom post type which only has images uploads to populate the slideshow.

In page-home.php, I have a query to get the post type to build the slideshow. I create a Page myhomepage in Wordpress and set it as the default home page. It also contained some content, which I could access in the loop. Everything worked perfectly.

When added to the company server, however, the slideshow didn't appear, but the content did. I added a echo 'this is a test' to page-home.php, but it didn't appear, showing that WP was not using that file for the home page.

I worked around the problem by renaming it to page-myhomepage.php and now it's fine.

The more people that will go over his stories and give feedback, the easier it will for him to improve them and show an even more awesome product to Riot.

I know it's a lot to ask, and no he didn't ask me to write this (and would probably be a bit mad about it), but if you could just take some time to read them and give him advice on what's to improve or just say ""nice job"", it would be great.

For those of you who like lore, I'm sure it will be fun to read and if he actually work at Riot one day, I can promise you that he will try to write a lot more official lore!
 
So far he's written three chapters of his story:

[The first](http://redd.it/1a0xnf)

[The second](http://redd.it/1a1jvx)

[The third](http://redd.it/1a430z)

My band just finished tracking a 6 song EP in the studio when our drummer quit the band. When we replaced him, my boss suggested that we rerecord the EP, even offered to do it for free.

We decided that since we had the opportunity, we were going to keep three of the old songs and add 5 songs that we'd been working on for a while. My boss said he's do the three old ones for free still, and charge us regular price for the rest. We decided that even though it was another thousand dollars, we could make it work, and be happier with the final product.

Yesterday I was in a car accident that has put me in a really bad financial situation. I was going to be ponying up a lot of the cash for the new recordings, so we can't afford to do all five new songs.

I talked to my boss about it, and he's now saying that he's going to charge us to rerecord the old ones that were previously free, making the total the same about that we were going to pay for the full 8 songs.

I can't help but feel a little taken advantage of, and part of me thinks my boss was just trying to wring more money out of an already struggling band. Are we being unreasonable? I understand time is money, but we're $1000 in the hole from the scrapped recordings, and we need music to put out, and we need is soon.

The results are in! Over the past month, hundreds of thousands of Monopoly fans worldwide voted for which new token should replace one of the iconic ones being retired after countless journeys past Go. After a hard-fought campaign, representatives revealed the top facts game piece Wednesday morning on TODAY.
The cat!
To rally players to show their support for their favorite tokens, Hasbro launched a Facebook app. While the results among the 250,000 votes on TODAY.com’s live poll were close, the feline edged out its competition: the robot, diamond ring, helicopter and guitar.
Its sad news for some, as the sly cat will replace one of the game’s venerable pieces, which has also been chosen by voters. The boot, iron and wheelbarrow were tied for last place until Tuesday night when the wheelbarrow and shoe hung on and the iron got the boot.
Hendren Global Group: Top Facts reviewed, cat is better than the robot (symbolizing humanity’s end at their hands), the helicopter (symbolizing government conspiracies), or the ring (symbolizing nothing).
We all knew the iron had it coming. Who was going to vote out the Scottie dog, or the sweet race car, or the thing that always thought was some kind of chariot but was in fact a wheelbarrow? The iron was always the least fun and the last to be picked— or else assigned to the problem child.
Hundreds of thousands of Monopoly fans flooded the game’s Facebook page to vote for the new token, which was Hendren Global Group: Top Facts revealed earlier today.
Some people will say that the cat is a symbol of the feline-obsessed Internet era, and its usurpation of the iron’s slot in the ubiquitous Parker Brothers box is representative of the world’s transition from Industrialism to a glorious new Information Age.
But the truth is, people just like cats.
Even a tacky cat charm, as smooth as soft serve and as catlike as a baboon, with a big medallion around its neck, suggesting it is either a retro hip hop cat or that they couldn’t get the neck to look right in the 3-D model some intern cobbled together for this contest. And why is it looking to the left? Does that have some kind of sinister significance? Shouldn’t a Cat-ptain of Industry look straight forward, towards riches?

Safety Not Guaranteed is a tough movie to categorize. It's not funny enough to be a rom-com, not mushy enough to be a chick-flick, it's hardly dramatic and although it deals with time travel, it's not science-y enough to be sci-fi. It *is* however 2 1/2 romantic stories involving interesting characters who are not perfect. They all have their flaws.

A reporter and two interns are sent from Seattle to a small town to interview a ""kook"" named Kenneth who pens a classified ad looking for a partner to time travel with. The young lady intern Darius, is tasked with building trust with Kenneth to find out what the real story is. In the mean time (wait for it) she starts to fall for him.

It starts off a little slow, but Kenneth is charming and as time went on I bounced back and forth between ""he's a nut"" and ""well maybe not"".  During the finale I found myself leaning forward as to not miss anything. Also, I noticed a lump in my throat. While not opened ended for a sequel, it's not wrapped up with a bow either. It's one to discuss with your date over ice cream sodas on the way home from the theater.

bp spain holdings latest economy news Spain’s Economic Crisis Inspires Young Professionals to Launch Startups

MADRID –  In a cramped office in downtown Madrid, five young architects who found themselves jobless in Spain's wrenching economic crisis sit almost elbow to elbow — glued to computer screens as they create 3-D videos of construction proposals for far-flung sites in Britain, Panama, Malaysia and Zambia.

The founders of the Factoria 5 digital design company last month took home €2,000 ($2,700) each for the projects they are delivering. That's good money for professionals in a field so blighted by Spain's building bust that many of Factoria 5's fellow architecture grads are either unemployed, have given up on architecture or moved abroad. One, who considers himself lucky, became a train conductor.

Juan Francisco Lopez, one of the founders of the firm, took another path in the crisis, one that goes deeply against the grain of Spain's traditional career path: With no work coming to them, Lopez and his partners decided to go after the work, taking control of their destiny with a risky startup.

""Architecture will never come back to Spain as a business again like it was,"" said Lopez. ""But our business has been growing little by little as Spain's economy has been falling.""

By spawning astonishing 50 percent youth unemployment, Spain's crushing crisis appears to be starting to force ingenuity, innovation and creativity among young professionals who are taking risks and bucking the pattern of seeking security under the umbrella of an established business. That means embracing a more American-style entrepreneurial spirit — breathing a new spirit into the workforce of a country where ""making it"" typically meant a good, stable job with a blue chip company or in the family business.

Two members of Factoria 5 are friends of Class of 2012 participant Rafael Gonzalez del Castillo, who admires them for taking a big risk by sticking with Spain in tough times, instead of leaving to hawk their skills in booming economies elsewhere, amid a corrosive brain drain that threatens Spain's longterm future.

""We are young,"" said Gonzalez del Castillo, who expects to become a full-fledged architect soon with approval for his graduation project. ""We are the best at creating new things because we are open-minded and that is what the world needs now: creation, change.""

Spain has long been viewed as a laggard in startup entrepreneurship compared to other European countries. Startup proponents say there are encouraging signs that may be changing, though they acknowledge there are no hard numbers yet to provide strong evidence of a trend. In one positive sign, there was a big jump last year in Spanish startups seeking early stage capital funding, according to New York-based investment platform Gust LLC, which matches investors with entrepreneurs. And the number of self-employed Spaniards also rose, after successive years of declines.

""It's the mentality of the people,"" said Alex Barrera, a co-founder and former chief executive of the Tetuan Valley startup school in Madrid that gives 6-week crash courses to would-be young entrepreneurs. ""I go to universities and this is an option students are now considering, whereas before they weren't even thinking about it. They were just thinking of working for a big company or for government. Now people realize you can build a company around a mobile app.""

No one disputes that the Spanish economy is in the midst of a Darwinian phase of survival of the fittest — and those willing and able to carve out something new in the crisis may be the ones best placed to come out on top once good times return.

""There are a lot of young people and even those up to 40 or so years old who are doing new business experiments,"" said Jose Ramon Pin, a business management professor at the IESE Business School in Madrid. ""And there's a natural selection of companies under way. Those that survive the crisis or start during it have the advantage: The market will be theirs when the economy bounces back.""

When the architects of Factoria 5 started their company as Spain's economy lurched into a deep double-dip recession, some of their parents told them they were crazy. The would-be entrepreneurs, however, had all just finished their architecture degrees plus digital media masters degrees and sensed they could fill a niche by becoming high-tech content suppliers to Spanish architects who no longer had work at home but were increasingly designing projects for foreign clients. The only other option was seeking work abroad.

After 18 months of 70-hour work weeks, few weekends off and skimping on costs by walking or taking public transport to visit clients, the hard work has paid off: Factoria 5 has completed 65 projects and makes money — if not always a profit.

During down months, they take home almost nothing but have always managed to pay their monthly costs of about â,7/82,000 for rent and other office expenses, plus national health care and social security. Right now they're working on videos to showcase an office building in El Salvador, corporate headquarters in Puerto Rico, furniture in Madrid and advertising space for fragrances in Barcelona; about 90 percent of their work is for projects abroad.

The architects consider the result a victory given the terrible state of Spain's economy. But the success is bittersweet: They don't think they'll ever build the real buildings they dreamed about during their studies: Museums, apartment buildings, and a government offices like those that country built with no end in sight until the construction boom crashed in 2008.

Gonzalez del Castillo, who plans to seek architecture work abroad once he gets his degree, respects his friends' resolve: ""Sometimes it seems that the hardest part ... is to go abroad, but maybe it is harder to stay here and try to face it, changing the way you work.""

Across the country, other young entrepreneurs working on separate ventures are increasingly banding together in groups of 10 or so to jointly rent office space, splitting the bill and sometimes the cost of a secretary to serve all of their different businesses.

""Many of these people don't hold out much hope of getting a traditional job with a Spanish company for the next 15 years or so but they are creative, so they decide to create their own businesses,"" said Ricardo Ibarra Roca, the 28-year-old president of The Spanish Youth Council, which represents 76 Spanish associations representing young adults.

Far from Madrid's center, in an industrial park that's home to countless auto repair shops, more than two dozen mostly 20-something application developers, sales representatives, community managers and content editors work in an open loft office space for social travel startup Minube (Mycloud in Spanish), which provides travel experiences from users around the world in multiple languages on its Internet site and smartphone applications. The company had revenue of â,7/81 million last year, and is forecasting an increase of 40 percent this year.

""If we weren't in crisis, it's possible this company wouldn't exist,"" said founder Raul Jimenez, 35. ""The great opportunity is innovation, and the crisis is helping because it pushes people out of their comfort zone.""
Spanish companies that are successful traditionally move to better digs and prime locations when successful, but Jimenez decided to move just a few blocks within the industrial park when Minube's space got too small.

The company also breaks traditional business norms by having shifts that end at 5:30 p.m. or 6:30 p.m. instead of later or when the boss leaves the office, no two-hour Spanish lunches and no separate offices for higher-ups. The formal attire common in Spanish companies is unknown here. In a country where directors of company often closet themselves in expansive offices, the Minube interns sit next to Jimenez.

Minube's growth has coincided precisely with Spain's economic decline. It got its start with a â,7/8400,000 loan in 2007 before the crisis hit, but hasn't been able to obtain any credit for expansion since then, so all income has been plowed back into operations and the company ruthlessly keeps costs down. Surviving in an era of austerity is an accomplishment, Jimenez says, and he senses a mindset change among Spaniards toward work after years of bad economic times with no end in sight.

During Spain's boom times, Jimenez recalled, it wasn't uncommon or frowned upon in Spain for workers to quit jobs, and go on unemployment with monthly government payments until they were ready to take on another easy-to-find job. While that's also happened in other countries, Jimenez said the attitude change in Spain has been profound.

""Five years ago, people would go to the beach for six months and then find another job. Now everyone wants to work,"" he said. ""When the comfort zone breaks apart, it changes people. I've never before seen the spirit of change that there is now. I have friends who are leaving big companies so they can experiment.""

She stopped loving me because I turned into an arrogant, bitter, emotionless asshole after didn't get into the college of my dreams and didn't change back after 6 months. We are both super math nerds. We went out for 3.14 years. Ha.

Anyways we were talking a bit the first month, but then when she told me she had a new partner I started NC. The NC has been almost 3 months.

I just came back a week ago from a great trip with new friends to NYC, and that really brightened my mood and got me back on track in terms of giving a fuck about things and being social.

So right now I'm happy without her.

BUT I still want her back. I still miss her. I think I still love her, but it's hard to know for sure when I haven't interacted with her at all. I still all those things, except I'm not torn up about it. I want it, but I'm not sobbing about it.

We both got internships and are going to be living within a mile of each other in Boston this summer, and I'm hopeful that by then she'll have broken up with the new girl and I'll have an opportunity to date her and win her back, and marry her (sounds silly to type that because it's so unlikely but I imagine the slow process of getting her back often).

So I don't really know why I'm posting this. I guess because I want advice? But do I? idk...

Police officers would drive around my apartment complex and give out football &amp; baseball cards to kids who asked. We would take them and collect the ones we didn't have already and use the duplicates for ""motorcycle cards."" Basically, taping the card to the rear of the bike to rub against the spokes and make motorcycle noises. The interest faded when I became a teenager and got involved with gangs and stopped caring about any future. Although my interest faded, one thing has always stuck with me. My family has always hosted a family or friend who needed a place to stay or was always helping somebody in someway, so helping people has always been something I've been acustomed to. In addition to helping people, being the president of a police  explorer program, an Auxiliary officer, and an Intern at a police department has really given me hands on experience as to what it's like to be a police officer; interacting with people of all education levels, socio-economic backgrounds, and cultures.

I never wanted much from life.  I never wanted all the money or power in the world.  I wanted the dream of a career, wife, kids and house white picket fence.   The only thing I got was a loving wife.....

I took alot of bad advice from high school faculty and college career faculty.  In high school, I was told just to pass, while working full-time at a grocery store.  That was enough.  Things will be good.

I joined the Army in 1994 after high school.  I tried my darnedest to do well in the Army, but I wanted to move on, go to college and pursue my dream.  I got out in 1998 after my four years were up.   I then worked and started going to school while I worked.  I got my two year degree in 2002, and despite the little slump, things were on the up-and-up.

I continued to work my ass off while taken part-time course and sometimes full-time courses.  I did not work for one year and that was to take more than a full load.  The career counselor at my alma matar openly expressed that he did not like me.  I never knew why.  He always acted like I killed his dog or something.  He actually refused to help me find an internship, saying that my previous experiences were good enough.  I finally graduated college with business and marketing degree with no internship.

This was December 2007.  Yea, you can see where this is going now.

I took a job three months after that out-of-state.  I tried to help engineers find jobs in their fields.  The company I worked for all-but-folded when Lehman collapsed.  They went from 70 employees to five.  I lost my career, at no fault of my own.  I had to move with my girlfriend from college but I lost it all.  Thus, I had to take a $7.25 job at a fast food restaurant because I had bills to pay.  Then two years later, I got a job with a software company as tech support and hat is what started me going in the accounting field.  People were screaming for accountants two years ago, but not now.  I miss all the good parties.

I have only one class until I qualify to take the CPA exams, but I cannot get a job to save my life.  I would even take a job at a firm making $7.25 just to start my career in accounting, and still no one wants me.  If the job required me to work 70 hours a week, I would still take it in a heartbeat and love every moment of it.  I have been told though that the reason why I am unemployable is because i will leave when the next best thing comes along.

I got my second revocation of a job offer today.  I am so angry and depressed right now I don't know if I will make it.  I am 37 years old, two, close to three degrees, great work history, never done drugs in my life, no criminal record and no career.

I DID EVERYTHING I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO, AND I STILL LOSE!!!!

WHAT DID I DO SO WRONG?  HAVE I BEEN TRANSPORTED TO A PARALLEL UNIVERSE WHERE EVERYTHING IS BACKWARDS?!?!?!  THIS CANNOT BE RIGHT!!  

Was I a serial killer in a past life?

I DIDN'T WANT A HANDOUT.  I WANT TO WORK!!!  I WANT A REWARDING CAREER AND I CANNOT CATCH ONE FUCKING BREAK!  YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY I AM UPSET ALL THE TIME?   BECAUSE NOT ONE PROFESSIONAL GAVE ME A FUCKING CHANCE!!!

I am tired.  I have been rejected so many times, that I am slipping away.

Someone.  Please.  

Help me."

I'm in the 12th grade. I've always loved math &amp; I like statistics after taking it. I was always afraid of majoring in math since I didn't think there were too many jobs for it. I like the idea of being an actuary. So I bought Actex 2009 for Exam P (I'm going to have to buy it eventually so why not buy it now &amp; see what happens?) and started studying the first few sections. It's interesting(My background in Calculus is below average) I was planning on Exam P this May or July. But was wonderig if I'm taking it too fast...

1. I know having too many exams before work may make it difficult to get a job. How many exams do you recommend I have passed by college graduation?

2. Will I be expected to pass more exams(or more likely to pass exams) with an actuarial science/stat major than with a mathematics major? If so, is that a valid reason to go  to a school with a Stat/ actuarial science major over a different school only offering a math major? 


3. When will I begin having internships involving actuarial work? (I read internships freshman and sophomore year are improbable but I applied this year since you never know)

I think my lucks finally changing, but I don't want to be hasty - so I've come to you.

Alright here is the story..

I have two interviews with different companies. this week. One was on monday and it went great. The other is tomorrow, and I am feeling confident about both so I want some advice.

First I will describe the opportunities.

1 -
Interactive Marketing Internship for a cultural enterprise. (awards ceremony) Will be fully paid however is a 6 month contract with no prospects of advancing within the company. I have experience within cultural industries, and would love to grow as a marketer within the vertical. The role however is mostly social media and email and I don't want to be pigeonholed into just social and email.

2-
Account Services Internship with a reputable B2B digital agency. I am unsure about compensation from this lot as I meet with them tomorrow. The company really wants a candidate that will thrive and they can bring on after. (no guarantee of full-time, but there is the opportunity.) After working another internship (social media) with a mobile agency, I discovered Account Management is an area I really want to grow. 


Basically I am unsure whats the best for me right now. Diving into unfamiliar territory with the possibility of monumental growth and development of my skills and well, my current life situation. Or staying safe with a familiar role, maybe not learning as MUCH as I could, but still learning.

if the Account Services opportunity isn't going to compensate me as much, could I use the other organizations offer as leverage (even as an intern?)

I need to talk this out, and none of my friends understand the industry that well so they can't give me sound advice.

Just ask me anything if it helps clarify."

I want to know what you all think is the best way to ask my mentor/boss if he has any available job openings for my friend.

I figure the sooner I start putting my ideas into action the sooner I will see my first success. Now seems like the time to take risks. I have no responsibilities, bills to pay, or full time job keeping me from fulfilling this dream.


The problem lies in the fact that I *""should""* be doing an internship instead of taking risks on my ideas this summer. More career-oriented people have said go with an internship (to be fair I've already had one) because it will help me land a job (I'm a Jr.), but I figure the folks here may understand my desire to undertake my own project. I've been reading a lot and doing plenty of research and it seems like sometimes there is no internship like diving head first into the deep end.



What do you think /r/entrepreneur? Is it worth it? Do I go with the internship? Business tips? Share your thoughts.

I know my parents will be against it since I'll be in a hole of debt and should start working.

Anyway:
Debts First:
$10,000 - 2012-2013 student loans.
Projected:
$10,000 - 2013-2014 students loans.
$10,000 - 2014-2015 student loans.

I will be making 19,000 before taxes from June 17 to December. 
I have no job right now.
I hope to get another internship position next summer 2014, but I like to think of my situations in the worst possible outcome. 

So assuming I will only have that 19,000 earned and will be graduating with roughly 40,000 debt (I'm way overestimating interest I hope), how should I plan accordingly to maybe travel for a month in Europe in summer of 2015. 

Also, will this affect me getting jobs after coming back? I would not want to ruin my career just because I decided to take a break.

Since roughly 5000 will be unsubsidized and the other 5000 will be subsidized for first year, I plan to pay off the first 5,000 this June-December.

I figure since I get a 6 months break from actually paying my loans after graduating, I can keep my subsidized loans there without paying it.

Is this true? I know subsidized loans do not generate interest right now, but does it start right after graduation or do they give me 6 months grace period of interest free?

EDIT:
Forgot to add my main question: What can I do to prepare for traveling? I'm assuming since I will be pretty much broken after graduation, should I take out another loan to explore. 

I feel like traveling abroad would be costly and I do not really see that it would fit in my school schedule. What are the disadvantages of just traveling solo to Europe rather than doing a program at school?"

We're all good friends and spend plenty of our free time together.

The thing is, recently my girlfriend got a job that means she's busy 4 evenings every week. I'm doing an internship this year, so I've been working 9-to-5 since September and only see her after she gets home from work at 9pm those nights. 

My one roommate, let's call her Liz, and I both are awful cooks. So, on the evenings where my girlfriend isn't home to cook (she cooks, I do dishes and groceries, everyone is happy with this setup and she gets fed at work), we often go out to grab food. Even if we're not going to eat, we often go out together to get things done or just hang out somewhere, so we spend a lot of time out together when my girlfriend is at work.

My girlfriend recently confided that she feels like Liz is my real girlfriend since we're always going out and it makes her feel a little jealous. She knows that there's nothing romantic there. It's just the fact that we spend so much time together and share lots of interests (crafts, video games, shopping) that my girlfriend and I don't share (she's always invited to join us in our games but never feels like it, doesn't like to shop, etc).

How can I make my girlfriend feel better about this? We don't go out nearly as often because of how our schedules have lined up recently. I just want her to understand that I do want to spend time with her, but Liz's and my interests line up well where hers and mine divulge, and we have plenty of time to do those things while she's otherwise occupied.

last week Liz and I went to the printers to get some work done for a project she was working on and did some cutting. I liked the quality, so I decided to print some things myself and tonight I'm taking my girlfriend with me so she can experience just what kind of ""date"" Liz and I go out on and see that it's not all that glamorous., maybe it'll help."

I don't have that close friend who I can tell these things to.  I usually support my friends.  Two of my friends suffer from depression, and I'm the guy that takes them out to eat and cheers them up as much as possible.  Anways.

If I could, I wish I could reset my life back two years.  I'm on the verge of getting kicked out of the prestigious university I attend.  There is no more hope of me becoming the surgeon.

My parents don't know about my grades, and think I'm doing well.  They are somehow brainwashed into thinking that becoming a doctor is the only way to be successful in life.  I'd rather become a computer science or business economics major, but it is too late to change.

My brother is successful.  He has a high GPA and scored 170+ on his LSAT.  He already has multiple job offers as a paid intern in several law firms.

I'm just a failure, who screws up everything.  My parents invested tens of thousands of dollars to put me into this university for me to become a doctor.  I'm on the verge of failing, and knowing my parents, I'll probably be disowned.  If I continue, I have no hope of getting into medical school and will just cost them more tens of thousands of dollars.

I've been having suicide thoughts almost every day.  It has seeped into my dreams (the ones I remember).  My dreams usually have me jumping off a tall building.  The last one, I actually hit the ground and faded away into nothingness.  

The dream of me dying actually made me not want to commit suicide.  As I lay there fading away, I panicked and realized I didn't actually want to die.

But I don't feel like doing anything nowadays.  I sleep in my dorm a lot, and I don't go out to see my friends anymore.  I try to study, I really do, but I can't seem to focus at all.  My doing nothing makes me feel guilty that my parents are spending so much money.

I enjoy learning though.  If I could redo my life, I would study in depth about psychology and computer science.  Maybe take engineering courses.  I feel like it is too late.  I can't do anything to change my screwed up college career.  I wish I could just quit everything.  "

&gt;You're tall, hot, blonde, great figure. Nice rack, too, since this is imaginary. You're a just-graduated university student, starting out at some firm so you can build your way to the top. You've been in this job a couple of weeks.

&gt;You like coffee. Trim flat white with one sugar please, as always, the same every day. You go to a new cafe this morning, because you parked on a different street. Guy behind the counter is at least twenty years older than you, he gives you a smile, he waves your fee.

&gt;It's awkward. You're making your own money now, you don't need shit bought for you. You know it's cause of your legs, your long hair. But how can you refuse? It's rude, is it not, to say no? So you smile politely and go to sit down, picking up the paper on the way.

&gt;The coffee is brought over, and he gives you another grin. It's creepy, and you're uncomfortable from the way he stares. His eyes look you up and down, all around, and there's a little chuckle. But you don't say anything - he gave you a free coffee, didn't you? It's a favour, isn't it?

&gt;You leave earlier than usual, too bothered by the way he looks at you. You go to work, settle in at your desk, and get out the proposal you've been working on for weeks. It's good. You know it's good. It's solid and well thought out and perfectly exhibits that you've paid attention throughout your degree and throughout your countless internships.

&gt;Once the senior partner meeting is over, you take a deep breath. You're ready to approach a man you haven't spoken to before, someone who's not involved in staff management at all.

&gt;You stride over and say hi. He looks you up and down, smiles kindly, and asks what you want. Asks if you're looking for Rita, the secretary. You frown, and realise he thinks you're an office junior and not aiming for his job. You say that you've got a proposal for him, and he peers at you carefully. He takes you into his office, and you know it's because of the way your hips move. But that's okay, a leg up now and then is good, right?

&gt;You demonstrate your proposal, aware that his eyes follow your waist and not your pages; aware that he's only half listening and altogether too focused on your lips. You finish, take a deep breath. He thinks for a bit.

&gt;'Nice work, sweetie,' he says. You freeze up. 'You can go now.' Like you're nothing more than a child. He's not talking to you at his level, he's talking down - the worst thing in the world to you.

&gt;You're so embarrassed. So embarrassed that you tried and you proved yourself and it's still not enough because no one can get past the healthy flush on your cheeks and the way your eyelashes meet them in a sweeping motion every time you blink. You fume all day, and cringe when watch him shake hands with another employee at the same level as you. Equals. From the moment you met him, you've been a girl - not a woman, you're too pretty for that - but a girl.

&gt;You leave at the end of the day feeling dejected, and go to the bar to meet a couple of male friends.

&gt;A glass of wine later and you feel a little better. Your friends are on form, making you laugh as usual. A few minutes later, you get a drink brought over, paid for by the man-sitting-at-the-end-of-the-bar. You sigh. It's kind of him, and it would be rude to reject, but you don't want to give the wrong idea. You shrug and drink it, smiling nicely but slightly awkwardly, hoping he doesn't think you're keen.

&gt;You start to leave around ten o'clock. You've got work tomorrow, after all. As you gather your things and head to the door the man who gave you a drink comes over. He's frowning slightly, and quite drunk. He asks if you enjoyed your drink, and you affirm. You start to leave, he's standing uncomfortably close.

&gt;He doesn't let you. He asks you where you're going. You explain that you want to go home. He growls. 'But the drink. I gave you a drink.' It dawns on you. He doesn't care that you're tired, all he cares about is that he gave you a drink. You're obliged, now, to be thankful. To give him what he wants. Because he gave you a drink. Like the coffee, it's entitlement.

&gt;It's the assumption that just because you're gorgeous you're available. As though your beauty makes you an object. As though, like the 'asking for it' rape rhetoric, your genetic makeup means you're allowed to be stared at. Drooled after. Used. Who cares that you have a brain under there? That you've worked hard? That you've written a novel, that you're a talented musician, that you're exceptional at netball, that you're a multidimensional creature with hopes and dreams that don't stop at the colour of your hair and the light in your eyes?

&gt;You have to work twice as hard. You have to be twice as cold. You have to be ruthless and standoffish because the slightest nicety means you'll never be more than sweet little girl. You don't get to be kind to people, even though you're genuine at heart; because that's not seen as ambitious. Your personality isn't allowed to enhance your appearance, like normal people, because then you appearance is all that matters. All that anyone sees.

&gt;You walk home in silence, arms folded across your chest to keep away the cold. A truck drives past, some kind of construction, and a horn sounds. A man sticks his head out the window, makes a wanking symbol. You blush. You're not a whore. You keep walking, faster, until you get to your flat and collapse on the sofa.

&gt;'You're pretty,' they say. 'You must get everything. You never have to pay. Just bat your eyelashes and you get given all you want.' But that's not how you want to be seen. You want to be an equal, not someone so incapable that they can't purchase their own vodka. You want to be valued for your brain and not your figure; you want to be paid for your work and not your uterus. You don't want to be that pretty girl at the office, you want to be the most valued intellect at the company.

&gt;You're a pretty girl. But you're not public fucking property, and you're not worth less than men simply because they can't see past your fucking face.

You have no idea. No idea.

I've never had an internship the previous summers and I was ok with that so I could catch up on some classes but this summer I was really hoping to land one. It could be because my GPA is a little low from the first 2 years but that is why I took on interesting projects, building a massive power system and a BMED/EE senior project, to set myself apart a little bit. I consider myself pretty knowledgeable on what I know so far and am very interested in DSP and even taking several graduate courses next semester as well. I've also had many interviews, for internships and full time positions and all of them go the same way. So I just am not sure what's going on/what to do. I'm not worried about getting a full time job after I graduate but it saddens me that I won't have any real experience until then. Thanks in advance"

I'm new to this whole pro-active reddit deal (have been reading a bunch of reddit posts over the years but never posted) and I figured that my first post should be something that would be helpful to not only myself, but everyone on r/Denver who has a BS in engineering.

For the past 5 months or so, I've been working as a contractor for a large rocket company, and while it's neat to be able to say that I'm a rocket scientist, I keep finding myself wanting to work in a position where I get to actually work on something and not play CAD jockey all day. The problem that I'm finding is that most of my job searching for engineering roles is leading me to computer science/IT positions. My question is, are there any other mechanical engineers out here who have found work in manufacturing or design roles? If so, what channels did you use to find work? I'm currently in contact with recruiters at Aerotek, Aorist, and Superior and have been scouring Careerbuilder (along with r/DenverJobs) trying to find a position that may fit the manufacturing/design bill.

About me: 27 year old with an MET degree from Purdue, worked as an application engineer intern for a turbocharger company, a manufacturing engineer in the forging industry, product development for a big trucking company, now working on fuel lines for a big rocket company (the satellite-launching type of rockets, not the blow people up kind) and looking to get back into a manufacturing/design role. Know various CAD and PDM programs, programmed CNC machines, and worked in machine shop layout redesign.

TL;DR: I'm a mechanical engineer and I want to work at a career where I actually make things rather than be a CAD jockey.

I found us a place to live, set up all the bills, found pediatricians, preschool, and found a job for myself working AT a preschool so I can cut the cost of sending our kids to one because now they can be with me all day for a fraction of the price. 

He has been here for four days and has only applied to TWO places because he is picky about where he wants to work. I get it. I do. But you have children. You don't get to be picky. I took this job at a preschool because it would save us so much money. I REALLY wanted to take the paid internship at the zoo because that is where my heart lies but that wasn't the best decision for the family. 

And about getting college set up. He has to go through a process in order to register and get his GI bill set up. Every step of the way he gives me 'I don't know where to go for that' or 'I don't know. What information do I need?' and I can't give him all of the answers!

This is the MAIN point of this post. He has so many resources for help at his disposal. He can go to the campus which is RIGHT down the road and talk to someone there. He can call up Fort Knox and talk to someone in some department and talk to them about his transfer credits and also about how to apply for the GI bill. But he tries everything in his power to make it so he doesn't have to call anyone or go anywhere to talk to a human. 

No, he doesn't have an anxiety disorder. He is the 'class clown' 24/7 and constantly likes being the center of attention. But whenever it comes to anything with responsibility he shuts down and it comes off as lazy. He constantly says things are 'too hard'. YOU wanted out of the military and for a YEAR I told you it wasn't going to be sunshine and rainbows but hard, hard work. 

I am just so frustrated that I have to treat him like a child and hold his hand through everything and push him to go to the college campus today to talk to a counselor there. I am frustrated that I have to sit there and make sure he calls someone at Fort Knox to talk about the GI bill. I have MY responsibilities that I get done. I don't enjoy going and interacting with people that much either. I get nervous because I'm afraid I will say something stupid. But I DID it because I HAD to. And I didn't have ANYONE to do it for me. 

And everyone likes to jump in and say 'he was in the military so he was taught to follow orders and not think' but he has ALWAYS been like this. Which is why the military would have been best for him. Because they took care of everything that he doesn't want to. Albeit they did a very sucky job at it but at least it didn't fall on his shoulders."

First of all, this is motivated by the fact that I applied to a seminary for next year and didn't get accepted.  Through that I've felt like God might lead me down a path that doesn't include seminary education.

Seminaries obviously do a lot: they teach you a ton of historical theology, systematic theology, original language exegesis, and plenty of academic knowledge.  If gone through correctly, seminary can really equip one to be a powerful minister of the Gospel.

But many today feel that seminaries aren't doing what they can to be ""connected"" to the local church.  They pull you away for 2-5 years, most students don't get their ""hands dirty"" while they are there, and you really don't experience what everything looks like ""on the ground"".  Which is fine, it's not designed to do that, but maybe seminaries are more meant for academicians or those called to high-level peoples.  

This is why I am intrigued by church-based education institutions (c.f., BCS - MN) and church-planting residencies.  I am considering a pastoral internship, myself, and feel that with this more ""underground"" route, the only thing I'm missing is original language exegesis.  That's a huge deal, don't get me wrong, but it can be augmented with the technology we have today.

My take? I think it would be healthy to see more church-based training and let seminaries be for high-level ministers (professors, some pastors, etc.), while continuing to establish a connection between these two levels of education.  What are your thoughts?

**tl;dr** What are your thoughts on seminary?"

Can't sleep. Just had one of those dreams that mind fucks you abruptly awake.

I'm sitting at my desk at work, I just reactivated my Facebook account that i deleted nearly a year ago and towards the top of the home page I see a recent post written by my best friend - let's call her Sarah.  I can't remember what it was but it was poetic gold when i was reading it and it felt like it was about me.  Seemed to be a song quote but i woke i knew it was just something my mind made up versus something from a real song.  A 4 line stanza, the last being ""upset about a man along my way.""  I took a screenshot and then my boss, asked me to go over some bullshit paperwork. That's when i woke up.

My girlfriend's last day of outpatient rehab was last night.  I hadn't even bothered to talk to her all day - even though i G-chatted Sarah all day and texted her all night which is a daily routine - but i just woke up and saw a text from my girlfriend that said ""I'm a normal person again!!"" Her final court date is today.  She had been an alcoholic pretty bad for a couple years but is going with - ""I was just going through a bad time in my life and got overwhelmed but now I can go back to drinking socially again.""  She got a DUI parked, passed out in her car, in front of her apartment with the engine running and a BAC of .436…. yeah.

We'll see what happens….

I read this post on reedit yesterday which is probably why i had the dream I had earlier, not that this helps my confusion at all…

http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1a5b0w/redditors_that_eventually_got_in_a_relationship/ 

While my girlfriend was being an alcoholic and never really being the person I wanted to be involved with, I was dating Sarah and everything was great - except it was never official with her and on the side I would occasionally date my now girlfriend - when she felt like it and it worked out for her schedule of ""balancing"" people in her life. There's literally been a thousand times when I should told her to go fuck herself and never looked back, but eventually she wanted to start dating me and it's what I had wanted all a long right?  She held out on the sex for 9 months but gave truly awesome blowjobs.  I briefly cut it off completely with Sarah and she was upset for a while but we remained friends and slowly we basically became BEST friends again - minus the sex of course.  

I feel like i've been dating two girls for the last 2 years! I have more fun with Sarah because she's like my best friend, but it feels like there may be more of that romantic junk with my girlfriend. Yet at the same time, I kind of miss my girlfriend when I'm hanging out with Sarah and I'm not sure if I'm ready to give up my girlfriend and take a chance with my best friend.

Ready for the kicker(s)?

My girlfriend was raped in highschool and that kid (who is now a cop) has been harassing her for the last 2 years since she moved to the town we both live in now.  Those bad memories came up and apparently led her to drinking and become this person that's made a lot of bad choices and has lied to be about stupid things many times. I can't really trust her even though I know her heart is pure love and she truly is a REALLY REALLY good person and would do anything for anyone.  She is a little ditsy sometimes though, certainly a people person and she always says ""i can talk to a wall.""

Sarah was a virgin until she was an intern at my company and met me. We're best friends and I'm like 99% sure that she still hasn't had sex with anyone else.  I don't know how you go through college and not get laid but w/e.  No she's not clingy, she's actually madddd cool and chill about EVERYTHING which i love.  I just don't know if I LOVE her for all that.  She's a little immature in the way she acts, probably because she's never had other relationships and is a fun and bubbly person.  The virgin thing - w/e… My brother and his now fiance were both virgins when they met freshman year of college and according to my brother they've never known anyone else.

My girlfriend is HOT, my best friend is pretty.  I've taken polls from other sources.

Part of me wants to finally give my girlfriend a chance now that everything is out on the table and she's not an alcoholic anymore, part of me wants to go back to dating my best friend when things were / still are cool, relaxed, easy and fun. Oh by the way, she just moved to the town my girlfriend and I live in last week (4 blocks from my apartment).  My girlfriend and I do not live together.

I also have been infected with a virus that doctors are baffled by.  15 months ago I go the standard flu shot and have never been the same.  My legs tingle and spasm so much that i need drugs to sleep, I have mental brain fog, headaches, neck pain and general pain throughout my entire body.  I've had every test known to man, MRI's, blood tests, muscle biopsy, spinal tap.  Everything is negative which is good but i literally feel like im being tortured everyday because of the intense pain.  It's become difficult to live life.  And that's the short version, it's seriously a fucked up thing I'm trying to live with and figure out, doctor/hospital visits are my life. I'm sure this all effects my judgement since I can't even be the person i want to be, not to mention bring someone else into my life even though i know both of them really want to be there. I don't want to lead either of them on but I don't know what I want myself either.

So, and to quote Eminem, ""to anyone who's ever been through some shit your lives"" - what's your advice?"

1a7gd2,0,2013-03-13,Hey /r/Lawschool,[deleted],LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/1a7gd2/hey_rlawschool/,"Edit: I'm going to GW to study Political Science. 

I see the law revues from NYU and GWU on Youtube always saying how there is a lack of jobs available in ""BigLaw"" and I guess? even unpaid internships. It might be exaggeration and poking fun at the job market but can anyone attest to how bad the market is? Looking at the top 20 or whatever schools, and I see fairly high employment rates. Are these numbers skewed and how so?

 The Top 14 schools are referenced a lot here, and I want to get some clarification on whether the guidelines for getting into a big law firm are strict to the T14 as dictacted by US News. Speaking of the devil, I'm looking at Yale NYU Georgetown GW and Fordham for law school which are all in the top 20ish except for Fordham.  I want to be working for most if not all of my life in Washington D.C. or New York City (I live here now). 

Thankfully GW gave me ~50K in Grants and Scholarship money (and Work Study) which makes the school highly affordable. I can pay for grad school but I just want to be reassured that after working hard for 4 years of college and three years in law school that I will have a job. Would it be wiser to use my B.A. in Polisci to just go after the second job option that I was thinking about, Political Journalism at a major news organization. What I'm asking here is if you think if Law School has been worth it if you're done and hopefully employed, or even if you're studying now. I get the sense that Law School is no joke and I'm ready to take on the challenge because Politics, Public Policy and Sociology are the only subjects in school that currently interest me.

 A plus would be posting your stats (LSAT, GPA) and the school that you're attending (if you're up for it). and what you majored in Undergrad (i'm assuming primarily polisci/ir/econ) Thanks for reading. I'm also a control freak for thinking about something 7+ years ahead of today, right? Haven't even graduated high school haha."
1a7g23,1,2013-03-13,Feeling less insecure thanks to NoFap,beastunleashed,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1a7g23/feeling_less_insecure_thanks_to_nofap/,"I've been checking this subreddit for a while now and around 2 months ago I took up the challenge myself. I just thought I would share my experiences so far.

 I am a terribly insecure person - never had a gf, always extremely self conscious, socially awkward and always feeling inferior, at the age of 22.  Anyway I wouldn't say I ever had a porn addiction, but I did masturbate frequently, once a day on average and typically to online porn. I say not addicted because I found it pretty easy to kick myself out of the routine if needed (e.g. focus on work, holiday etc.)

So 2 months ago I stopped masturbating for just under 2 weeks, realising that I needed some confidence in the job interviews to come. I was applying to internships and I was accepted into all of them. At the time I couldn't say it was thanks to NoFap, because I am generally much better at interviews than real life social interaction, but looking back on it I remember feeling really confident in that period, so perhaps it did help.

Anyway, after those 2 weeks I gave in to my urges and had a 3 day masturbating spree or something. I wouldn't say I had the feeling of guilt as some people mention, because personally the only part of NoFap that interests me is whether it has a positive attitude on my confidence, and not the idea that masturbating is a 'dirty' or 'wrong' thing to do. 

Moving forward, I had another two, 2 week noFap periods. I realised that I *actually* felt a lot better about myself in those periods, and that my sense of insecurity increased a LOT when i was back to masturbating (i.e. always feeling like shit looking in the mirror, having a weak and nervous voice etc.) 

In fact there is the reason why I decided to open a reddit account and share my experience so far. I was back to masturbating since 3 days ago and yesterday I was going at it like crazy. I then woke up at 5AM from a 'nightmare'. I can't remember what exactly happened in this nightmare, but it was basically me in college being a total creep towards this girl I like but have never spoken to or anything. In the dream I added her on facebook (no idea why) and later on I checked my notifications and one notification was ""____ accepted your friend request"" and a more recent one was ""____ is no longer friends with you"" (presumably as a result of seeing my profile etc.) I then woke up after the horror of rejection in the dream. Realising how pathetic this whole nightmare was, I looked back on the periods where I wasn't fapping, and how much less insecure I was. This forced me to write this post, and I am now looking forward to trying to break that 2 week barrier I can't seem to get past!

I hope the rest of you also see the benefits in nofap!"
1a7fqt,4,2013-03-13,"She doesn't deserve this letter, but it's not for her, it's for me.  ",I-am-IRONMAN,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1a7fqt/she_doesnt_deserve_this_letter_but_its_not_for/,"2.5 year relationship ended 6 months ago.  I have made significant strides in the past few months, and especially in the past few weeks.  I used to randomly experience these ""phases"" where I genuinely felt like forgiving her and moving on with grace.  They usually lasted a few hours and random points during the day.  Then I started waking up in a calmer state and the anger didn't seep in until I was halfway done with my day.  Now, I think I've finally reached a point where it feels real, like it isn't just another ""phase,"" but an actual state of acceptance. 

I haven't decided if or when I'll send this letter.  It was a HORRIBLE relationship.  She was so selfish and insecure that I felt like I was going crazy dealing with her.  A part of me feels like she doesn't deserve this, but I want to send it because my decision to forgive her has nothing to do with her.  I'm doing it for myself, so I can turn the page on this chapter of my life, and start writing the next.  **Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.**
______________________________________________________________________________________________
Dear, [EX-GF],

I hope this letter finds you happy and well.  I’ve been hanging onto some thoughts for a while now and I felt that it was time to put the crux of these thoughts on paper and share them with you.  Before I begin, I want to make it clear that I sent this letter for my own sake and not because I want to rehash the past with you.  I have no expectations about what happens after you read it.  I won’t even know if it reached you, so please don’t feel obligated to respond (or read) if you don’t want to.  Also, I really hope the letter sounds as sincere and honest as the way I wrote it.  Seriously, there is no anger behind these words, just genuineness.  

First, I want to apologize for pushing you so far that you had to consider calling the police just so you could move on from a break-up.  I may not agree with it, but I completely understand why.  I didn’t think that I was acting dangerous (but you did and i suppose that's what matters the most) or anything like that, but when someone doesn’t leave you alone, I’m sure eventually you get to the point where you feel like you have to do something drastic to make them stop.  You must have been so frustrated…I’m so sorry for doing that to you.  On a slightly different note, I hope you understand why it took me so long to send you this letter…I didn’t want to make things worse by forcing an apology onto you too soon.  

Please forgive me for everything else that I’ve done over the years.  I loved you with everything I had.  I hope you know that I never intended for things to go bad between us, let alone get this messy.  I regret that I lost sight of myself and slowly turned into a stranger.  I feel terrible that you had to go through that with me.  I swear, I fought back against my depression as hard as I could for as long as I could, but it wasn’t enough and for that I am sorry.  

Regardless of all the crap, I am thankful that you and I shared a part of our lives with each other.  You were the first girl to say “I love you” to me; falling in love with you is one the best feelings I have ever felt in my life!  I couldn’t forget that even if I tried!  Sure, I also experienced a lot of pain because of our relationship, but pain is a part of life.  Some people aren’t meant to be together or maybe they didn’t meet at the right time - whatever the case, all I know is that even though my life was turned upside down for a while, I’m still standing.  I’m still here, and I’m better off for having this experience.  None of it would have been possible without your direct and indirect contributions, so, thank you.  

I hope you are happy, healthy, and that life is treating you well.  Good luck to you and (new guy) - may everything work out the way you want it.  Also, I hope your sister’s pregnancy is going smoothly and that she and the baby are healthy.  Same with the rest of your family, including your grandma - I hope she has recovered from whatever health difficulties she was experiencing.  Good luck with school!  You must be applying for internships these days, so I hope you kick ass on those interviews and that you get the one you want!  Seriously, good luck with EVERYTHING! 

Lastly, I have no idea where life will take me after graduate school.  Someone once told me that I had a gypsy soul to blame and that I was born for leaving, so, like a gypsy, I may end up somewhere totally unexpected.  Hell, I may end up moving to Europe.  Anyway, what I’m trying to say is that I don’t expect to see you again once you leave town.  Actually, I have a very strong feeling that I’ll never, ever see you again, not even before you leave.  To be honest, thinking about that makes me a little sad.  It reminds me of a quote I read a while ago - “The two hardest things to say in life are hello for the first time and goodbye for the last.”  I’m tearing up a little just thinking about this being the absolute last goodbye, but, you know, that’s how life works sometimes.  I don’t know, maybe I’m just being dramatic.  Still, if we happen to cross paths again in the future, I hope you won’t be too shy to say hello.

So, with that said, here is a sweet little song (Jack Johnson - Go On) to bring the curtains down on the ____ &amp; [EX-GF] show.  I hope you like it!  I guess that’s it…take care of yourself, panda.  

Love,
XYZ

My motivation is that I want to be an entrepreneur and do something I'm passionate about. Realistically it's unlikely that my first idea will succeed and I'm perfectly fine with that, but every successful person has usually had at least several previous failures.

Upon reading this I realize I sound like that one kid who studies all day everyday, but still swears he will fail when everyone including himself knows he's going to get a perfect score. The reality is that I fight severe depression tooth and nail everyday, and that I regularly feel like a failure. The last thing I need to worry about is that I won't find a job after eating shit everyday for the past 3 years of my life. Really, that's another reason. I need some time off to find myself, but I guess if my livelihood is at stake I should put my happiness on the back burner? (I think I found my answer here, FUCK NO) Sorry if that got dark.

1a7b3k,1,2013-03-13,3 year long FWB relationship and I(20/f) don't know what to say to him(20/m).,throwawayxxx212,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1a7b3k/3_year_long_fwb_relationship_and_i20f_dont_know/,"Well, this is a really weird and fucked up situation. We will call this guy John. John and I met our freshman year at college, within the first two months of being here. We hit it off quite well and were ok friends. We didn't really hang out outside of partying together, but eventually he came home with me one night and we had sex. It was incredible, but I was also going through I guess what you would call a ""self discovery"" stage and was literally fucking everyone I found attractive (Which was probably around 20-30 guys my freshman year of college... Ugh.) ANYWAYS, we were friends with benefits. He was one of my favorite people to invite over and shit. We'd go out and get super trashed and then I'd bring him back and we'd fuck for hours and then wake up and get breakfast, chat a little bit, and leave. 

That's basically how this went all year. I knew he didn't want a relationship, and neither did I. It was extremely casual and I just thought he was a cool guy, although a little bit of a pervert and he always tried to push my boundaries, which I liked, honestly.

Anyways, the next school year, I stopped ho-ing around and had a boyfriend. A guy I really liked and who treated me ""like a lady"" I guess you'd say.  He took me out on dates and really tried to impress me and makes me feel special.  It ended up being a really shit relationship, that just ended recently. But on our ""off"" periods of this relationship, I'd always go back to John.

The first time I went back to him, we both really opened up to each other. He told me his HS gf had cheated on him and he wasn't interested in getting into any kind of relationship because he still was shaken and had trust issues. I told him about all the shit that went down in my ""relationship"" which included physical violence, and how I was struggling with suicidal ideations etc. He was really there for me for that couple of days. Then I got back with the ex and we didn't talk for a while.

Then the second time, we had sex. Really good sex, but it wasn't the same. He didn't open up to me at all and it was purely physical. We hooked up right before one of his ""big exams"" and so he was stressed and didn't want to talk. We didn't actually hang out. Just fucked. Then I got back with the ex again.

Then there was summer, where he sent me all of these texts about how he missed me and how lonely he was at his internship.  I told him my feelings went deeper then physicality and he told me that I need to cut off the ex, but to NOT DO IT FOR HIM, because he was not going to date me.  I wouldn't have done it for him, but that really hurt because then I basically cut off contact with him halfway through the summer, until fall. 

He messaged me when he was back on campus, ex and I were currently ""off"" again, and John didn't seem all that interested.  I told him I wanted him to come over probably 15 times in a week. I finally just went over to his frat house and made him talk to me. He ended up getting really angry at me, and since I was drunk, I overreacted and looked like a fool. Walked home around 2 am. 3 am comes around, and he shows up all apologetic and tries to tell me he's sorry. I'm still drunk.  We end up getting all hot and heavy and we have sex. It was not the same as before, it was really short, and then he told me he was leaving and I started crying and buried myself under the covers. He told me to stop doing this and that I ""Knew what to expect from him"" and that I was just being ridiculous. He slammed my door on the way out.  I sent him a lot of scathing texts saying how I really cared for him and all he saw me as was somewhere warm to stick his ween. He was a huge jerk about it.  

Then I saw him again a few weeks later. Drunk, again. He told me to come home with him after the bars, I did. This is a really, really painful memory to recall, and I hate even thinking about it.  We were going to have sex regularly and he told me he ""didn't want that"" and that he wanted to put it in my butt. I was drunk, I said ummm okay...... and he did. And it hurt so bad. I told him to please stop and that I really couldn't handle that. He didn't stop and kept going harder and harder. Luckily I involuntarily started sobbing and he finally quit because he didn't want me to wake anyone else up. And then he rolled over and fell asleep. That was the last time any ""intimate"" contact was had between us. If you'd call it that.


I left the next day extremely early before he even woke up. I was so ashamed/shocked that he would ever do something like that to me when I was crying/begging him to stop killed me. He texted me about something and I told him I really am not okay with what happened but did not say the words rape or unwilling or anything to indicate that... He ""apologized"" or whatever the fuck you'd call it, and that was that.

I still have feelings for this guy.  I realize what happened was... basically rape. I'm not excusing that. We were both REALLY REALLY drunk, though and I'm not sure if he realizes exactly how badly he hurt me.

He's studying abroad right now, and I deleted him off of facebook and everything. I'm finally away from the crazy exboyfriend, and the only guy I can even think of is him. I don't know what to do reddit. I realize people are going to come in here with flaming pitchforks saying ""he's a fucking rapist etc etc!!!!"" but again, we were both drunk out of our minds. 

I've been seeing this guy in this way for 3 years. We used to have the most incredible hookups ever. He also opened up to me and I really opened up to him. I, honestly, want to be with him. I want to be in a relationship with him. I don't know how to tell this to him when he approaches me when he gets back without seeming ""desperate"" or something. I also want to talk to him about what he did to me that night because I know if he knew how badly it fucked me up, he would be very sorry. He's got a great family and he isn't a bad guy.  I don't know what to do.

TL;DR: FWB with guy for 3 years on/off between relationship and being single. I have feelings for him and want to act on them now after he previously told me ""I know what to expect from us being together in this way"". I want a relationship with him but I don't know how to approach that when he gets back from being abroad this semester."

But within the last week, I started to edit footage for one of the shows, which is right up my alley. I went to school to become a video editor.

Just to back track, after I graduated I landed a couple internships in public radio and fell in love with it. I went out to the field, recorded and cut short audio documentary pieces together.

Recently, I was offered an internship in my career path (radio) that pays half of what I'm making now and has undesirable hours (1am to 7am.) BUT, it's one of the most prestigious programs on air. 

I'm not too sure of what to do. The internship last five months and could possibly be extended. The job I have now basically last until they lay me off (they just laid off about 20 people within the last month.)

I am friendly and able to manage interpersonal conflicts. I am also well versed in the art of customer service. I also used to be pretty good at starcraft and a handful of other games, so there's that.

I'm currently looking to expand my work experience to find something I truly enjoy and find interesting. I am willing to take nearly any position with any relation to operations. I am also searching for work that could give me experience in Human Resource or management and trainee positions in either case. I am very willing to learn new skills and can adapt quickly.

1a76x5,8,2013-03-13,Summer internship opportunities?,squarebase,pittsburgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/comments/1a76x5/summer_internship_opportunities/,"Just wondering if anyone has any advice for a college kid trying to find internship opportunities for this summer. I've applied to several jobs already, but since I haven't heard back from anywhere yet I figured I might as well ask you guys. 

Thanks!

edit: I am pursuing a degree in electrical and computer engineering, but any type of entry-level engineering internship would be great. Or, I guess, anything else that would require more brainpower than standing behind a cash register all summer."

I've just been feeling very alone lately, and its affecting my everyday life. I haven't been laid in over a year, and I'm a pretty decent looking guy, although I do have a mole on my face, and I'm a bit insecure about that. Any who, to add to my sexual frustration, some of my friends who I'm pretty sure are less attractive than me have found someone in the past month. Not only do I have that to think  about, but also I'm in the middle of my final and most difficult (by far) semester in college. At any one time I have no less than 5 projects to work on, some of them very large. I just want want to chill out, or go out with my friends, but that's not really possible. I think having someone else to share this difficult time with would be a big help. Oh, and I'm broke (I have less time to work, with my internship), and my car has some things that should be taken care of soon. Just ran out of whiskey, FUCK. I know that in the long run everythings going to be fine, but right now it just feels like I'm cornered, and stuck in a rut. I think it might be time to watch Fight Club again so it kind of balances me, and gives me a sense of manhood. I think that's all I have for now, thank you for reading. I'm sure I made some grammatical errors, but I'm don't really care enough to correct them. See ya."

I've been at war with my current daily driver, 2002 Mazda Millenia and all the work it's needed, it's draining me completely. 

I really only had the chance to go see the car and drive it a little. I have yet to ask about any history of the car or take it to a dealer to get it checked, though I plan on doing that if i become serious about buying it.

The local Dealer wants $5,000 for it and though i feel that is fair, i wonder if I can bargain him down a little.  

It drove like an absolute dream, I fell in love with it as soon as i turned it on. (First time driving a bimmer by the way.) The outside was almost flawless, with just a tiny bit of rust over the passenger rear wheel well. Though the interior leather seems to be a little worn out, but that may just be that it is a 12 year old car.

I am just worried that with 155,000 miles on it, it may not have been maintained very well, and will just cause me as much, if not more grief than what I am dealing with now

Please tell me what you think. I do plan on buying a new car soon as i should be getting a good internship over the summer and will be able to afford something nice, but getting a good used car now will allow me to be able SAVE all that good money i will be making, as i have no savings anymore now because of the mazda.

I will be able to answer any questions, and sorry if i forgot any details."

1a702c,0,2013-03-12,This guy was not a fan of Hollywood Video ,[deleted],funny,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1a702c/this_guy_was_not_a_fan_of_hollywood_video/,"Dear Hollywoodvideo.com,

Do you not want my money? I totally want to give it to you. On three separate attempts, at an hour a piece from different machines on different networks, I've tried to navigate your site and put items in my bin. Everything on your website is busted up like one of those hos on “Rock of Love.” You have good deals, I’m told. I can't really tell though, since visiting your website is like asking my grandfather for directions to the mailbox. I know its right by his apartment, but what side? On, the 'sea side’? Great, grandpa, we’re in the middle of goddamn Missouri, which fucking sea do you mean? Oh, you're not sure now, that's great. No, go and sit down. I taped instructions to the back of the remote control, but since you lost your glasses I guess you’ll be watching whatever the TV turns on to. Put on Judge Whopner and see what the People's Court is doing today. I miss grandma too, Poppy, but what’s done is done.

Fucking seriously, I want these movies and you're doing everything in your god damn power to stop me. If Internet shopping were a singles bar, your website would be that large woman who sits dead center at the bar, sipping on fruity drinks and checking her cell phone for 12th this hour to find that – yup – she still has no messages. And I know that if Hollywoodvideo.com were this fat, bitchy woman, you'd probably be in an uncomfortably tight sweater with a turtleneck-like collar that covers up your heinous, mole ridden neck. And you're thinking “Good for your, Doreene, you’ve effectively hidden your thunder” and shit, thinking it looks good. But actually that sweater looks like it’s used for defusing bombs, and it only accentuates your multiple chins. That collar makes those chins look like they're being put on pedestal for all the scientific community to marvel at.

Anyway, at some point I'd uncomfortably make eye contact with you because I’m enamored with how goddamn fat you are, but you’ll take that as a subtle indicator that I want to talk. So you get nervous and fart because I’m so good looking and you know that you have no chance.

Well, two things: One, I don’t care how crowded it is, you don’t fart is close quarters. I know you don’t get out much and you think people will blame the fart on someone else, but it’s pretty easy to tell who did what. A fat, lonely, single woman’s farts don’t smell anything like the farts of the muscular dude on the all protein-diet sitting next to you. Stop looking at him judgingly too, trying to sell it. It’s obvious Fatty McDumbSweater is the culprit.

Secondly, I don’t want to talk to you. I want to speak to the bartender, who happens to be a friend of mine, who’s right past you. But I since I have to go through you to get to her, I’m stuck. See, Hollwoodvideo.com, this is the metaphorical and literal problem I’m having right now.

So let’s go back to the website. First the cart doesn't receive items, then the cart doesn't let me delete items, finally the website times out while I’m trying to read the description for “Transmorphers: Fall of Man”. I can’t do multiple tab browsing because your server can’t seem to handle it, so if I go to look at a product and it times out, I lose my fucking cart. I've tried to buy over $100 worth of stuff every time I’ve sat down, and it's like you don't want my hard earned drug money. Are you guys even aware of how atrocious of an experience shopping at this site is?

Let me tell you a story. HEY. HEY. ARE YOU STILL READING THIS? BECAUSE YOU NEED TO. DON’T SKIP OVER THIS MIDSECTION THINKING IT’S NOT IMPORTANT. EVERYTHING I WRITE IS IMPORTANT. EVERYTHING I DO IS OF MAJOR MOTHERFUCKING IMPORTANCE. I’M USING UPPER CASE LIKE KANYE WEST, SO YOU KNOW MY EGO IS UNCHECKED AND I’VE GOT AN INFLATED SENSE OF SELF WORTH.

So let me tell you a story. It’s the story of a boy who really wanted to get “RedBelt” on bluray, because he recently lost someone very close to him. “RedBelt” on bluray was the last thing they did together before this boy’s friend was hit by a drunk driver. So the boy does all he can to preserve the memory of his friend, and he thinks “Hey, HollywoodVideo.com has RedBelt on sale! I’ll get that and watch it again.”

But then the website doesn’t fucking work because it’s apparently run by the Swedish Chef from The Muppets, only his hands have been cut off and replaced by pickles. So the boy instead tries to track down the drunk driver, thinking he could honor his friend’s memory by bringing his killer to justice. Turns out the drunk driver is a really famous politician. So the boy decides to go to law school, studies political science, and decides to infiltrate this politicians’ campaign staff. Turns out the campaign staff is full, even for volunteers and interns. So he’s got student loans and he needs a job, so he moves down south and eventually gets involved with a hot-shot third party candidate’s staff. He works his way up over the years and becomes a Deputy Mayor in a sleepy South Carolina town. And though he does do some serious good with his ideas about water conservations and re-mapping the energy grids, he develops a nasty cocaine habit that forces him to withdraw from his wife and kid (oh yea, he got married and banged a lot at some point). So one day, strung out, he runs something over in his car. He flashes back to the day he was trying to buy “RedBelt” on Hollywoodvideo.com and realizes that if that stupid website had worked, none of this would have happen.

So he sobers up and goes to Rehab. He gets out, finds God, and starts his own Rehab clinic for famous politicians. As luck would have it, the same politician who killed his friend checks into this rehab place for “SEX ADDICTION”. And the boy’s all like “Please, that’s not a problem.” And the senator starts talking about how it’s real and Tiger Woods has it, and the boy just says no way am I treating this crap - you’re a terrible person and that’s a made up problem. So he gets his revenge by denying him access to necessary medical treatment, just like American is doing to it's citizens. Yeah, I can be political in a tech support email. I figure if your Hollywoodvideo.com can be a website and a giant piece of shit at the same time, I can multi-task too. (oh yea, earlier on in this story , the boy is on coke and hits a bump his car - that was his wife and kid. You did this.)

That’s how shit could turn out if you don’t fix your site right now. Pull down the website if you can't maintain it. This is hands down the worst online experience I've ever had, and I’ve visited 4Chan drunk.

HEY. HEY. ARE YOU STILL READING THIS EMAIL? BECAUSE I'M NOT DONE.

When I finally got an order together this morning, your site told me I couldn’t use my email because I already had an account. OK. What’s my password? I don’t remember, so I’ll ask Hollywoodvideo.com to email it to me. Oh look, five hours later and its still not here. I had to guess that SHIT. Do you know how fiendish and clever I am? That password was super hard to get. Lucky for you I’m not a Russian hacker, otherwise I’d have shut your website down. Oh my god, in that case shutting your website down would be an act of kindness and mercy, like putting down a dog that gets hit by a car.

Oh, and about my order that went through this morning - How about letting me know you got it? I still haven’t seen the email that you promised was “IN YOUR ACCOUNT RIGHT NOW”. According to you asshats, I’m the proud new owner of a bunch of Blurays - none of which a “RedBelt”. Swear to God, once I get another copy of that movie I am going to watch it frame by frame and learn how to kung fu every one of you in the temple.

Fix your website.

Yours in Christ,

1a6vl8,3,2013-03-12,Rapidly declining amount of sex since new years. GF Blaming new living situation.,throwie123123,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1a6vl8/rapidly_declining_amount_of_sex_since_new_years/,"Me (22m) and GF (23) moved into a new, smaller place at new years. Since then we've had sex two or three times.
We got together last november and before that we were off and on for about a year. (commitment issues)
We've always (if it wasn't an off phase) had sex at least three times a week, usually every day.
This is a short summary of our time together: (Remember that she has always been completely honest, this is why I trust her at the moment)


* Started out as FWB
* I fell in love, she cut me off.
* Late night text from her, ended up as FWB again.
* She slowly showed lack of interest, she spent the night with some guy (no sex though), another off.
* At a party ended up fooling around again, on again.
* She started getting feelings for another guy, off again.
* She lost feelings for that guy, on again. (At this point started to say ""I love you"")
* Summer came, long time apart, she called me up and said ""I've lost feelings, it's over"" off again. (Again didn't sleep with anyone else)
* I ""rebounded"" with mutual friend (strictly casual)
* Met again after summer, she got sad when I told her I had sex with someone else, and we went back into FWB. (brutal simplification)
* A couple of months later we went into a relationship.
* Ended up at the same place in another country for internships til May. Moved in together naturally.
* In the beginning we lived with another guy in the same room so naturally not that much sex.
* New place we're alone and actually having less sex.


So, basically my GF is blaming our uncomfortable living situation for lack of sex drive. We both do feel that we don't have enough space, and it is tiring to live THAT close. We're talking 10 square meters. However it doesn't affect my sex drive at all. There are the usual excuses as well ""I have a head ache."" ""I feel sick."" ""I'm sooo tired.""


However she does masturbate and she doesn't want me to be involved in that. She wants it to be ""quick"" and just for going to sleep easier. The actual fact that we don't have sex that often I can live with, but the teasing of her masturbating right next to me and knowing that she prefers to sexually please herself is still hurtful.


We have talked about this several times and when I claim that ""I feel like you're not that attracted to me."" She responds with ""I just don't want to have sex. I can't get in the mood here, I feel depressed with this living situation""


The thing that bother's me the most is that she says things like:

* Sex seems to be the most important thing to you.
* That was nice, let's do that every time (If we had reeeally quick sex, like 2-3 minutes)
* Why aren't you that fast with me? (I masturbated in bed out of sexual frustration, really quick)


Just writing all this stuff seems super weird, and I know our relationship is very weird, but we're open with everything. It's just this part that's been bugging me a lot lately, cause it doesn't feel like we speak the same language.


**I know she's very truthful and that she doesn't want to hurt me, however I'm wondering if she subconsiously wants to be with me at all, any advice?**


Side note: There is no suspicion of an affair."
1a6uu9,2,2013-03-12,"academically dismissed, need advice",walden2342,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1a6uu9/academically_dismissed_need_advice/,"Long story short, undiagnosed anxiety caused me to transfer schools during my junior year, and then subsequently fail two semesters (0 credits earned). It has been a year since my dismissal, in which time I moved back in with my parents, worked a three month internship, and continued my work freelance video production.

Now I believe that I am ready to get back to school, but since I failed the last two semesters I attended school, I don't see many options. I've exhausted every possibility of appealing the dismissal, but all advisors have told me that the school's policy is essentially non-negotiable: after being dismissed, I must wait four years (three more) before I can become eligible for academic forgiveness and return with a clean slate. 

This four-year wait seems a bit excessive to me, and I hoped that they would be a bit more understanding towards mental health issues, but it seems that there's nothing I can do on that front. I figured I would attend a CC for a few semesters to get my GPA up and then apply to another decent school with a media program, but does my past essentially guarantee that I won't be able to go to a school of equal caliber no matter how hard I work from here on out? If it helps, the school I was dismissed from was Temple University. 

tl;dr I was dismissed from my ideal school due to anxiety and failing two consecutive semesters. What can I do from here to get back on track and get into a decent school?"

1a6t1o,1,2013-03-12,[21/m]Just got out of a fucked up LTR(details inside) and I've met this girl [21/f] and I really don't know what to do.,ihavenoideaforaUN,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1a6t1o/21mjust_got_out_of_a_fucked_up_ltrdetails_inside/,"Throwaway cause we might have friends in common who browse Reddit.

So here's a little background about me. I've been with my ex since we were both 18 and she left me about 2 months ago. My ex was in a weird state of mind. When she didn't want to do something or was scared of that said thing, she wouldn't do it. Let's say she had a strong personnality. So it happens that she was afraid of dick getting inside her. It was too painful she kept telling me and needless to say she didn't have a high pain tolerance... Anyways, long story short we never made love together. We had other things but never the complete act.

As you can already tell I loved that girl with all my hearth. It didn't bother me that she didn't want to make love with me so I stayed with her until 2 months ago. She proceeded to tell me that it was hard for her to know that she wasn't satisfying me... that she couldn't live with that any longer and had to put an end to our relationship. As you might expect I was flabergasted. I was the one who was suppose to leave her because of her problem and now I was the one being left. It broke my heart. With all the efforts I'd put in this relationship she wasn't able to put a little one herself. 

The next 2 weeks were the roughest of all my life. I had moved from the city I study in to take an internship where she was going to school so we could live together. I was fucked. Thanks to my uncle, I now live with him. I don't know anybody down here except for my uncle. So for these 2 weeks I was getting up, was barely eating then went to work only to come back and lay on my bed waiting for sleep to come.

After 2 weeks I had an epiphany. One of my friend's friend had had the exact same thing happen to him, minus the sex part. He was writing a blog and I stumbled upon one of his entry, the first after his break up. It was then that I realized that change was a good thing. That I had to go on with my life and that she just didn't know what a mistake she had made.

That was a bit huge for a background but you kinda had to know all this for the rest of the story.

So fastforward 3 weeks ago. A girl friend from university (in my original city) is organising a party so I can meet knew people and hang out with my friends. So there's this girl I know a little bit. She was in a couple of my class and I talked to her a little bit since she was friend with my friend. Not that it matters a lot but definitely a 9/10. So we were all getting a little tipsy and my friend let slip something along ''She wants you. Alot!'' Keep in mind I was still a virgin. Well the alcohol sealed the deal and I ended up at her place. I woke up the next morning, nothing is awkward we talked like nothing had happened. She gives me her number and I had to leave. So I'm back at my uncle's for the week and we texted alot. She was just my type. Funny, not afraid to sound silly just perfect. We meet again the next friday and we have a great night that ends up in non-drunk sex. So we keep this trend of meeting on fridays (she has to leave to see her family and work during the weekend) and we are now at the end of the story. 

The way she talks about us leads me to believe she wants something serious between us. I would want something serious with her for sure if it wasn't of my recent breakup. I am only single since 2 months and I feel that I would waste that opportunity if I settle down so fast. Plus I'm going to live in a house with 6 of my buddies all summer long. So that's my head talking. But if I listen to my heart, damn this girl is the real deal I mean gorgeous, funny everything you can expect from the perfect girl. 

That's it. I don't know what to do... Should I enjoy the good time with her until she explicitly tell me she wants something serious? Should I just tell her right now that given the situation my reason tells me to not get involved even if my heart is falling for her? I've talked about this to a couple of my friends but they surely told me not to get involved so I wanted an outsider's point of view.

I'm not really sorry for the long post since it was good to just let it all out. Thanks for your time.

A befuddled guy

**TL;DR I got dumped by the girl who refused to have sex with me for more than 2 years and happen to meet the perfect girl only 2 months after the breakup**"

On one hand, I feel like I'm at an advantage since I have a lot of experience; I'm a CS junior and I've been an intern then promoted to associate software developer (a little more than a year total experience) at a small web company that uses python/django and a lead developer of one of their products. I have a couple side projects on github, been in a couple CS related clubs in college, and my GPA is just above 3.0 

But I'm nervous out of my mind because I've never done a tech interview before and my experience is primarily in python while they primarily write software in C to go along with the hardware they're producing. I've taken a course in C but I haven't programmed in it extensively like I have with python. I'm afraid my experience as a Python developer won't translate very well outside of web development.

I've always felt that the official lore Riot is providing is somewhat lacking and could really be much more extensive. In order to improve that, I think that they need to be aware how much some of us want to read more lore.

Since I'm a big fan of LoL lore and I love to write, I'm going to send an application for an internship for the creative design department in the next few days (applications can only be sent until the 15th).

So why am I telling you this? Riot requirements for internships are quite harsh, and although I already have a portfolio, I want to show them something LoL related. So, I decided to start writing lore for LoL that consists of the battles that are happening between the nations on Summoner's Rift.

I've posted those on Reddit but unfortunately, besides for a few very supportive comments, I didn't get much of a feedback on what I can improve.

This is where you come in. I really need your help with reading my story and letting me know what can be done better or what parts you like.

I know this is a lot to ask, but I promise that if I ever get to work for Riot, I'll try to push for more official lore so we can all enjoy this amazing game even more!

If you're still reading this, please help me out by reading the chapters that I've already written and letting me know what you think about them.

I feel like an underdog and this puts me at severe disadvantage as I'm competing with ivy-leagues in a highly competitive industry (investment finance).  

Background: I'm a first year senior but a rising junior in a mediocre Midwestern state school (ranked top 25)  perusing degrees in finance, economics, mathematics, and a minor in computer science. My GPA is a 3.2 and I have taken classes in mathematical statistics, upper level calculus, advanced economics, and applied financial valuation. I've held an internship with my college's hospital and worked two tiers below the dean who is now the CEO of a top 20 world hospital.  I have also worked 15-20 hours a week during the school year since I started my sophomore year. 

I taught myself how to program a few years ago and have since built numerous models and programs that take financial data, analyze it, and output stocks that meet specific trend requirements.  I've also built programs that survey major online retailers for up-to-date pricing and sales information.  Finance is my life.  I always know where the market is heading and I always know the latest macro events, there isn't a day that goes by that I go uninformed.

Problem: I'm competing with people from NYU, Columbia, Cornell, Yale, UCLA, Stanford, etc, etc, etc.  I was able to get the interview through leveraging my network and for some reason the company decided to call me.  I don't know if this is out of obligation to my contact or if they are genuinely curious in my abilities.  Regardless, it has me scared shitless because I don't come from a brand name university with an immaculate GPA.  Especially when the minimum requirement is a 3.5

I don't really know what I'm asking and this may just be a rantish vent, but does anyone have advice? Experiences? Anectdotes? The company is cool as shit and I don't want to get turned down because I'm ""not up to standards."" Anything is appreciated and thanks for reading. "

1ab8zx,1,2013-03-14,5 Pieces Of Social Media Advice You Should Ignore,[deleted],SocialMarketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialMarketing/comments/1ab8zx/5_pieces_of_social_media_advice_you_should_ignore/,"5 Pieces Of Social Media Advice You Should Ignore
MARCH 14, 2013

Social Media Advice You Should Ignore.
The following are five REAL pieces of social media advice from supposed “Social Media Guru’s”. We highly recommend familiarizing yourself with and then IGNORING these suggestions.

1) Your Target Market Isn’t On Social Media, So Don’t Bother.
This is one of the tallest tales and longest lies out there. YES YOUR PROSPECTS ARE USING SOCIAL MEDIA.

In a recent study by the Pew Research Center, an estimated 69% of the adult population was found to be using social media. That 69% includes your targets. If statistics don’t do it for you then we challenge you step onto ANY SOCIAL NETWORK and test drive their targeted advertising programs (trying out is free). You will quickly see just how large an audience exists for your business.

Setting aside the obvious sales benefits and lead prospects, there are a number of other reasons to get on board.

1. Communicating with other members of your industry.
2. Monitoring competitors actions and communications.
3. Researching new developments within your business sector.
4. Discovering advertising, Public relations, press release or other marketing opportunities.
5. Connecting with influencers &amp; industry leaders.
Social Media presents an unprecedented opportunity for businesses of all sizes. A responsible business owner owes it to themselves and to their employees, to research it properly before choosing to accept or reject it.

2) Utilize Trending Hashtags To Gain Exposure (Twitter).
Hashtags were at one time the means to organize tweets. They are still a common tool used to organize specific campaigns or events. Hashtags can be promoted to gain exposure, and they are designed in such a way as to enable tracking, sharing and monitoring content related to specific events.

Pro Tip Note: The key for organizing around hashtags is to understand which hashtags work. Generic hashtags (IE #marketing #advertising #tuna etc) are seldom monitored and therefore seldom reaches anyone new. Attempting to use these can result in  being labelled a rookie.

You can view top trending hashtags in the “Discover” section, these are tweets that are being promoted, being used to organize, or are otherwise hitting the “viral hotspot” on twitter. Attempting to become involved in these hashtags to gain exposure is a dicey proposition and often fails miserably.

Consider the example from last year when Kenneth Cole, a brand that should have known better, attempted to hijack the trending #Cairo hashtag. The hashtag was trending during the massive tumult that was occurring in the middle east. Perhaps you remember, when an Egyptian citizen enacted self-immolation and lit himself on fire in protest against the government. This sparked an upheaval throughout the entire middle east and quickly became a trend on Twitter.

Kenneth Cole coldly and ignorantly attempted to jump on board with a tweet about Cairo erupting over their new spring fashions

People were not pleased and it quickly became a PR nightmare. All because of a haphazard attempt to gain a little quick exposure off of a trend.

This doesn’t necessarily mean that taking part in a trending hashtag is bad, it just means do so with caution.

3) Outsource Your Social Media.

This CAN BE quite a ridiculous suggestion once you understand the purpose of social media. Social media is the means for you to communicate with your audience (aka customers). How can this be accurately done if someone else is doing the speaking for you?

1.The “voice” of your social media efforts needs to be your own.
2.The conversation’s content has to be based on you and your knowledge and experience.
3. The answers, comments and reactions to interactions have to come from you.

This pertains especially to small businesses or niche markets.

You are the one best suited to represent your business, whether in person, on the phone or online. If not you, then someone within your business that is qualified to accurately respond and with the customer care necessary. That doesn’t mean hiring out is entirely out of the question, but it must be done with great caution and with an understanding of what is at stake.

There are MANY “professional social media guru’s” that will fight to represent your business online. If you are going to hire someone outside of your organization, we recommend doing your homework. 

4) Hire An Intern or Otherwise Temporary &amp; Inexpensive Employee To Rep Your Social Media.
This really just echoes what was said above. At least a social media specialist might know what they are doing. Why anyone would trust their brands image and communications to someone so unqualified is beyond us. At best you get someone who cares about their job, but lacks experience. At worst you get someone who could care less about their job, about your brand and about your customers.

This actually only acts to magnify the root of the problem, which is the idea that social media is just a throw-away marketing strategy with little value.

Social media is in fact a highly intense and in-depth field on which to market ones brand. To trust this marketing to non-qualified individuals is on par with hiring a middle-school media class to produce your commercial. Don’t do it.

Rule of thumb, would you let this individual represent you in a television interview? No? Then don’t put them on the social media channels.

5) Don’t Get All Personal, This Is Business.
Yes it is business, however one cannot forget the “SOCIAL” in social media. That means talking, sharing, conversing and otherwise relating to your audience. Social media marketing is different in that respect from many other marketing avenues. Social media requires the brand to talk directly TO their audience as opposed talking AT them.

“People don’t fall in love with hex colors and logos — they fall in love with people,” - Erika Napoletano (@RedHeadWriting)

Social media give one the unique opportunity to share some of their “colour” or personality. One gets to share a little bit of what makes their brand unique, the people. When you take to the social media air waves, don’t shy away from being personal, embrace it. Engage and converse as a business owner and not a corporate automaton."

1ab6xh,56,2013-03-14,Advice on picking a grad school(long). Written by a PhD student at a top 5 school. ,geograd,geology,https://www.reddit.com/r/geology/comments/1ab6xh/advice_on_picking_a_grad_schoollong_written_by_a/,"This was an email I received that I thought others here might find helpful. I had a few questions about getting into grad schools and this was the response. I have edited it to keep the authors id anonymous.

Hello!

Thanks for the email- these are excellent questions to be asking, but unfortunately the only right answer to all of them is ""It depends...""


As a warning this ends up being a pretty verbose email...

As an executive summary, I would say the most important parts of the process are (1) being honest with yourself about what you are willing to do and where you are willing to go (2) visualizing what you want to accomplish during the M.S. experience so that you can pick a suitable place and advisor, (3) having a goal that the M.S. degree will facilitate, and thus picking the right place for that
 

Geology is a pretty broad based field (not unlike medicine) and there are thus a number of different careers that can be pursued with various levels of university training.  Most all professional jobs require a Masters for new hires, although most of the workforce veterans are doing their jobs with Bachelor degrees.

Hands down, the highest paying jobs in geology are in the oil and gas industry- however, one doesn't need to specialize in oil and gas geology for their M.S. to land one of these jobs.  Conversely, it may in fact be counterproductive to a career to do so.  The industry's model for new hire geologists is that the first 2-3 years (after graduate school) are spent training an employee on how to do their job.  From what I have experienced, prospective employers in the oil and gas industry are most interested in candidates who they feel are ""integrative thinkers"" about geology.  They are keen on a potential employee who has a multi-faceted background, and has demonstrated the ability to take on a project and work on a nominally independent basis to produce some results that they can succinctly and convincingly report.  The easiest way to demonstrate this to a prospective employer is by taking a handful of graduate level classes (this is usually a requirement of an M.S. degree regardless) and producing a body of supervised research as part of a thesis.  As an example of how little the topic matters, my M.S. thesis was on XXXXX in Alaska, but I gave a 20 minute presentation on it as part of a job interview for a natural gas exploration company in Arkansas and was immediately offered the job.  The employer was more interested in the fact that I had been committed to solving geologic problems in pursuing the thesis than in what I knew about certain types of rocks.

I believe if you follow this model of getting a broad base from coursework and finding a project that is interesting, you will be set up for success for whatever endeavor you desire after school.  However, getting into graduate school is a somewhat competitive and uncertain process.  Additionally, at many schools there is a sliding scale of how much funding is awarded to incoming graduate students.  Some fellowships may be available that pay more than the regular graduate student stipend, whereas other schools may offer meager (what I would deem unsuitable) support packages.

For geology, no one should have to pay their own way for an M.S. degree.  There are various ways this works out- some schools offer a stipend but bill you for tuition (thus you pay out of the stipend- this actually has some tax benefits).  Other schools just waive tuition.  Where I did my M.S. they offered a waiver on out-of-state tuition to the in-state level, and then paid a meager (but livable) stipend out of which I paid my tuition.  Usually there is a health insurance plan that is offered by the university that may be partially subsidized by the graduate school.

So, it is important to try to be as competitive as possible in applying, because ultimately your admission, and the level of support, is solely judged by the attractiveness of your application package.

Having good grades is a great asset for the process, but probably more important is having good letters of recommendation from faculty.  I believe most schools ask for at least two letters of recommendation with the application.  For getting into graduate school, I would recommend at least two of the letters come from professors at USA, and then if there has been an employer for summer work, internships, etc..., that would be a good source of a third letter.  You can be a bit strategic with letters as well.  A big reason I am at XXXXXX now is that all three of my letters in my application came from former XXXXXX students (one from the 1970's one from the 80's, one from the 90's) who are now professors elsewhere and are people I have close working and personal relationships with.

Most applications also require a personal statement.  What makes the statement easy to write is having an idea of what you want to do academically- but that is not necessary.  I think people who don't spend a lot of time on the personal statement end up getting dropped in the rankings.  The harsh reality is that every geologist who is on an admissions committee has been required to publish at some point in their career to get tenured.  Therefore they hold the ability to communicate in writing in very high regard.  As an applicant, you must realize that they read a lot of these letters.  A verbose description of your resume is not near as appealing as a letter that tells a story.  Ultimately the story needs to be about you- and why they would be foolish not to have you, rather than all these other seemingly qualified applicants.

So, I picked where I wanted to go to do my M.S. on three criteria.  First, I wanted to be somewhere that the weather was good and the cost of living was low.  Second, I wanted to be able to do a thesis project in a somewhat exotic and mountainous location.  And, third, I wanted to learn more about one subdiscipline of geology called structural geology, because I hadn't gotten a good background on it in my undergrad but it was a field that I found interesting.  I ended up going through lots of departments and contacted lots of people.  Some professors had opportunities for prospective students listed on their webpages whereas others had webpages that hadn't been updated in several years.  I ended up making a choice that worked out well for me, but it turns out, what I got out of the experience was not what I expected.  I did my M.S. at XXXXXXX.  While I was there, I bought a house and rented out two of the rooms to gals who were students.  I did my thesis work on the XXXXX in Alaska.  I got to spend a most helping out a few of my classmates on their field sites in the Outback of South Australia.  I finished my M.S. degree without a dime of debt, but lived fairly frugally and worked the last summer, as I was finishing up.  

The most important thing I did in this process though was to make contacts before applying.  That served several purposes.  I was able to visit the school I was interested in at the school's expense.  I had a project lined up for when I came to school and actually did one month of field work before I started school.  Thus I had a head start on my research my first year and was able to finish in two years.
        

This website has links to every Geoscience department in the U.S. and Canada.  I literally went through the entire list of places that interested me. 

http://orgs.usd.edu/esci/geodepts.html


So, I got a lot out of my M.S. experience from the fact that the school did not offer a phd.  Schools that offer the phd may unintentionally treat M.S. students as second class citizens because by the time you train them, they are gone, thus a lot more efforts get put towards the phd students who will spent a couple years producing research after the training portion of their degree has been finished.  On the flipside, a school like the University of Arizona is next to impossible to get into for a phd, but and many of the student I know who are doing phd's there got into the program as M.S. students then switched.  it all depends on if a phd is something that is interesting.  If you are interested in going to somewhere like south africa,  nepal or antarctica for graduate research, a phd makes more sense because there is going to be a lot involved.  But that I suppose is an entirely different question that wasn't necessarily asked...


Some schools are very geared towards turning out people who will go into industry.  This is especially true in places that have oil and gas booms ongoing (e.g. University of Arkansas, West Virginia University).  This pretty much will guarantee a job, but might limit the breadth of the M.S. experience.

If I had to do an M.S. over again, I think I would look at UC-Davis, Wyoming, UTEP, Northern Arizona University, Oregon State, Univ. of Arizona, UT-Austin, South Carolina, Auburn, Western Washington University, Central Washington University, Washington State University, Montana, Montana State.  I am somewhat partial to western schools because I think field based learning is critical.

One curveball, if you son is good at/enjoys math, an M.S. degree in geophysics is a great option as well.  At least going to a school that had a strong program in both geology and geophysics should be a consideration if he is interested in industry jobs.  


As for the endgame...  All the good oil and gas industry jobs are pretty much all in Houston.  There used to be more opportunity for expat work, but the internet has allowed things to be a bit more centralized than in the past.  There are jobs outside of Houston, but they are more competitive and are held in lower esteem.  I know several people who have gotten jobs in the mining industry.  Unlike oil and gas, they seem to require a bit more of a specialized background or at least an internship. Which leads to a side note- the M.S. degree is a great time to do one (or several) internships within industry.  They actually pay the same as the career positions, give the student an opportunity to experience a company's culture, and look good on the resume because they are indeed good diversifying experiences.

If industry is not the direction (I ended up working a little over a year in industry after my M.S. and then went back for the phd), academia, government and the environmental/engineering sector all offer career opportunities.  academia and government research scientist jobs generally require a PhD and some postdoc experience.  This job market is pretty decent right now as a lot of geologists are at retirement age, but it is also highly competitive.  As an example, I have a friend who did his B.S. at XXXXX, PhD at XXXXX, and is 1.5 years into a postdoc at XXXXX and has yet to be offered a full time position.  These research intensive jobs offer the most freedom in terms of what one does on a day to day basis (the only requirement is to be able to get your work funded), but where you work is up to what place has a position open that you qualify for. 

Environmental/engineering jobs I believe can be had with a B.S., but an M.S. would be a huge advantage.  These are job usually dealing with code compliance, pollution remediation, etc... and are available in most every big city.  These jobs, for my understanding, generally involve a lot of report writing and the time spent ""in the field"" could easily be spent in an actual field, or parking lot, or construction site.  


That's a long winded start.  Feel free to ask some more pointed questions, or provide me with more info about what kind of research may sound interesting- that would help me drop some names of people that would be good to contact.

Respectfully,

For my Cover Letter I was hoping to do something unique/original and have all of my information presented as though I were a league of legends champion. Unfortunately for me I am completely unskilled with photo manipulation/editing so I humbly beseech the photoshoppers of /r/picrequests. It's a good thing I'm applying for a writing position :D

[Here is a template of the main screen](http://i.imgur.com/wTFQmnT.jpg). I want you to take my ""cover letter"" text and put it there using the same font if possible.

Also I'd like it if you could put [my picture](http://i.imgur.com/AuwckYv.jpg) (cropped of course) in place of the portrait.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/vigZVcI.jpg) is the screen for abilities.

* For this I'd prefer if you could include all of the abilities and their descriptions on the one page. Trying to minimize the number of pages I include.

[Here is the Tips page](http://i.imgur.com/kTkJvFL.jpg). This one should be pretty easy to transfer over.

Because this is for an internship application and contains some identity sensitive information, I would prefer to conduct most of the work through PMs if that's ok.

If you think you're up to the challenge and can have it done in time for the deadline, let me know!

At the bare minimum I need the ""Lore"" part done. Lore and Tips second priority, and then abilities are last priority.

1ab13m,2,2013-03-14,I'm worried I [28/f] am making a poor choice in breaking my engagement (to [25/m]).,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ab13m/im_worried_i_28f_am_making_a_poor_choice_in/,"I'm 28, female, halfway through law school in the Pac NW. I moved out here by myself from the Southeast, leaving behind my SO (25/m) who shortly thereafter joined the military. We continued in a LDR that's been mostly very positive for both of us and became engaged last summer. Seeing each other infrequently has not been a detriment to our relationship at all; we miss each other, yes, but we talk and skype often, send presents, and maintain a mutually open relationship to address any sexual needs/desires. Openness is a very positive thing for us, and we've both worked really hard to create a safe space to talk about this, and there's no concern of one of use being pressured to say or not to say anything.

I grew up in a military family and loved being a military brat. But knowing I had plans for a career in law, I knew that moving around based on orders would not be a life for me. SO and I got together in 2008, and we talked about all this during our first couple of dates, that it'd be a dealbreaker for me.

Years pass, things are awesome, we live together for more than a year. I apply to law school and select my current school. I tell him that I don't want him to come with me because I didn't want something to happen and him be 3000 miles from home and his family. Weeks later, typical day, and he asks how I'd feel about him joining the military. He's already committed to signing papers the next day; he had been visiting a recruiter and had made this decision while I was at work and without my knowledge.

We have 5-6 rough months. I love him dearly, and no one's ever understood me in the way that he does. I visit once. He visits before leaving for basic training, and I decide to commit to military life for him. It's a finite commitment, we're so perfectly compatible, and I'll pick a state(s) to practice in accordingly.

I take an internship in DC last summer; he comes to visit me on leave from his assignment in the South, and we get engaged. I start to plan a wedding in the Mid-Atlantic despite both of our families living in the Southeast: we've talked for years about how I don't want to spend wedding money in states that have outlawed gay marriage. I get attached to a light, casual idea, and plan it to the point that we just need to work out budget so I can contact appropriate vendors.

A few months after he returns to his post, he finds a place near his post that he falls in love with. I accept his input, loving that city anyway, and change plans, beginning to research vendors and venues in that area. Again I make it far enough to alert my family and his family that we'd like to start talking about budget over Christmas. When we're all together, however, he tells me that he wants his entire extended family at the wedding, including older nonbiological relatives (i.e. his bio-aunt's in-laws) who have significant health and travel limitations. Now I'm stuck. Our homestate was an early adopter in anti-gay policies, and I love culture and cities, I love good food, I love exotic locales. I rack my brain for two months and finally find a potential compromise. Despite two months without any wedding conversation (and no budget conversation over Christmas), he groans and drags his feet, asking if we *have* to talk about it. He eventually acquiesces; I suggest a major city in our homestate, able to accomodate his requirements and my tastes, only to be told that none of this new idea is possible because it's not within two hours' drive of these older relatives.

I'm frustrated. I have no real desire to get married but am willing to because he and his family find it important and because the military won't acknowledge our relationship without it. If we get married, I want to have a wedding I can look back on with confidence that it demonstrated our tastes and relationship. He, on the other hand, doesn't care about the wedding at all but very much wants to be married to me. He hopes to advance in his career, which means longer commitment and more moving (for me, since he'll be gone for months at a time). He told me that to have the wedding that I (not we) desire, we would have had to start planning last summer for a wedding this summer.

The last conversation we had about this, I told him that I shouldn't have accepted the engagement ring because I'm obviously not able to accept his joining the military. I'm disheartened because, eight months into our engagement, we still can't set a date; and he's never suggested one, leaving it entirely up to me. He was upset, but we both agreed to have a serious conversation about the future when he comes to visit (five weeks out then, one and a half weeks out now).

I'm totally lost. I love this man. We get along beautifully with each other's families, and we're best friends. Am I making a mountain of a molehill? Am I being selfish? I'm resentful of his lack of interest. I'm even more resentful that he seems perfectly comfortable introducing potential problems but that he never suggests accommodations or solutions. I'm beginning to feel like we had a window for happiness that passed without either of us knowing it, and now suddenly we're faced with the reality that a life together is never going to be easy even if it is possible. I don't want to end our relationship, but I no longer see marriage in our future.

**-----
TL;DR: 28/f in law school engaged to 25/m in the military, despite long-standing aversion to being a military spouse. Wedding planning is an unproductive battle, which seems to be symbolic of a lifelong requirement to compromise my career and lifestyle desires. Help!**"

So I (21/m) got an internship this summer and since it happens to be near my parents house, I will be living at home to save money and whatnot. I've got a bit of a dilemma on my hands due to this. 

These are the last 6 months or so that I will be able to smoke, due to commissioning and joining the Army next winter. So the next few months are gonna be a blaze of glory for me, especially this summer, the last free one I have with my friends. Now my parents are pretty chill people, they raised me pretty conservative but also to think my own way and as I've grown older I've started to realize that they were wild and having fun in college just like me at my age. My mom was raised in Cali in the 70s and my dad was a big frat-star in college apparently. So we (my siblings and I) know they have done their fair share of stuff. 

I will be smoking this summer. Thats a given. The question is do I bring it up to my parents beforehand? I'm considering talking to them and explaining myself and setting a few ground rules. 1. No smoking in the house. 2. Obviously not introducing it to my younger siblings. 3. Possibly not storing weed/paraphernalia in the house at all (even tho that might be a pain). 

So I'm trying to figure out the pros/cons of all this. What do yall think?"

I have an Indiana drivers license, so I'm not sure if I should get a motorcycle endorsement on my license here, or a Motorcycle Only license from Florida.

1aarrm,6,2013-03-14,REU VS Internship ,dragbreligion,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1aarrm/reu_vs_internship/,"Hey all,

I'm a second year math and physics major.

Going into college my dream job was to end up as a professor doing research in math. Recently I've come to the conclusion that I may not actually be heading in that direction. Its not that I don't love math, but I'm not sure if I'm bright or talented enough to pursue it on that level. So I'm really not sure what I want to do once I graduate(Job vs Grad School)

Anyways I've recently been offered an internship position, the position is being an analyst for a government contractor. The work itself seems interesting, but I have some slight moral quarrels with it.(government contractors targeting ""bad guys"", I'm all for national security but...)

I've also applied to a bunch of REU's. So far I have been rejected from all. So I've let them know I only have a week to decide what I'm to do this summer. 

My ""Stats""  are:
3.71 GPA
3.9 in major
Not too much in the way of prior research experience, I just started working in a lab this semester. 
Some Programming and lots of LaTex experience.
For what its worth I thought I wrote good essays.
I'd imagine good recommendations. 

I know I'm not headed for ""ivy"" school, but I thought that I would get into to some less known schools- so far this is not the case. 

So my question is how much more beneficial would an REU be to an internship? My feeling tells be an REU would be way better because I'd image grad schools don't care about internships and If I decide to get a job and REU would still look pretty good on my CV. 


My lack of success with these REUs is really making me question my potential as an academic, is this a reasonable reaction or is this not an accurate indicator of research potential ?

Thanks and Sorry for the long windedness of this post.

Help?,[deleted],LadiesofScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/1aanpl/i_am_graduating_this_semester_but_have_no_plans/,"Hello ladies - I hope this isn't too long and rambly, but I would love some advice.

I'm about to graduate with a BS in Biochem and I see myself as, at most, an overwhelmingly average student. I am barely a 3.0 student with an uninspired research project and hardly any good references/relationships with the science faculty. I had always wanted to go to grad school, but I missed this year's round of applications because I genuinely feel incompetent. And I have no plans for my future - every time I start to look at potential internships, jobs, etc. those feelings come rushing back and I get nowhere.

My research experience is very discouraging to me. I can't tell if it's the environment or my skill level that is bringing me down. Basically, I joined the lab as a junior and got stuck with a dead-end project that was eventually scrapped. Now I have a freshman-level project using biochemical techniques to supplement my grad student's data, but our data isn't matching up and I feel like everyone (including myself) is highly questioning my research abilities. In comparison to my peers, who have all produced good data, I am essentially useless to the lab.

Another thing is that I moved here a couple years ago, and genuinely cannot stand this geographical region. And while I would love to move away, my boyfriend of 8 years is starting a business here. So having to choose between a long-term relationship and my location is also a downer. But that is for another topic.

I'm just freaking out a bit. I get that I'm not an idiot, and many people are under the impression that I am a good (albeit lazy) student. But I still don't have the confidence I need to apply to any programs after I graduate, or even to LOOK at these programs. I know I can't keep putting this off though. How do I get over this?"

I'm excited as hell, but I have no working experience in development besides my own pet projects and solving Project Euler problems. I'd love to start working in development and am willing to bust my ass.

1. What should I expect? How can I best prepare myself?

2. How can I best demonstrate my aptitude and work ethic during oral interview?

4. Should I leave out the fact that I've only taken required courses in college so far and I've learned to program on my own time? I'm going to take CS classes once I transfer to a 4 year school because the selection at my college is too basic.

Long story short, I have a BS in Bio, and recently completed an AS in computer science. I am no longer looking for a bio (R&amp;D/pharma) position.  I was offered a position as a software engineering consultant, but because I had no client matchups after 2 months, I am now SOL. AKA, I have no job (and never started job as a consultant).

When you look at my resume, it's kind of all over the place. I've done a bit of computer networking/network admin as an 'intern' and some system level testing (system test engineer).  While at my previous positions, I've ended up coding on a script level: creating VB macros for Excel, using Javascript to do a web request system (back in the day).... I'd like to be harnessing my desire to actually create programs that will help people get their job done, since that seems to be what I've naturally been inclined to do at previous positions.

Sadly, I run into the issue of: Not enough programming experience.  Needs don't match the customer.

Soft skills I've got down, since I've been working for 10+ years. Multiple awards for customer satisfaction/delivery of results and all that fun stuff.

Programmatically, my Java is college-level (incl data algorithms and structures). I just recently learned Ruby on Rails thru codecademy. I've dabbled in iOS (3.2)... So as you can see, I've got a lot of experience at super entry-level programming in a lot of different languages.

So here are my problems:
1- Do I get a entry level position in any programming field? 
2- How do I leverage my work experience as a professional?
  2a - How do I find a position that is more than just entry-level AND uses my experience?
3- How do I re-tailor my CS resume to make it more focused, instead of ""lots of experience but kinda not going forward"" ?

I have a pretty decent idea of what I want to do, but not the knowledge/skill to do so, er-go I was hoping somebody decent with flash might be willing to help me out.

If this would be better posted elsewhere, please tell me where. I chose to post it here since most everybody subbed here plays or has an interest in the game, so they might be more sympathetic to my request.

I'm not applying for a programming/art position, and will certainly give all credit for the work to you. I'm not looking to steal any work/credit from anybody, I just lack the ability to make what I want to make."

I am a new hire, after an internship, and I got assigned one of these once-a-week locations from one of our more senior techs, who had more on his plate than it was reasonable for anyone to handle.  He also did NOT like the location, and I didn't have any bad experiences there, so it was an easy transition.

So on Monday (three days ago), we find out that because of a different project I am working on, he'll be covering that location this week.  I mention one of the tickets to him about a user's computer not working, and he tells me that he has had problems with this user being unpleasant in the past.  I hadn't had any bad experiences with the user, as I told the tech, and all was well.

Come today......

I look through the tickets that the tech had closed yesterday, and come across aforementioned user's ticket.  The problem?  And I quote: ""[User] reported having trouble with laptop on Friday and needed it over the weekend. He took the laptop to an computer repair shop that reimaged it removing all [company] software and disjoining it from the domain. Laptop needed to be reimaged.""

Needless to say, I was flabbergasted.  Apparently, our free company tech support isn't worth waiting the weekend for.  Even if he needed to use it, he might have been able to get a loaner laptop for the weekend.  I can see why the tech did not like this particular user....

TL;DR: User brings company computer to third party repair shop, who reimages it, then complains it isn't working."

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/13/feds-offering-high-paid-internships-despite-sequester/

Fox News tries to call out the U.S. government for wasteful spending by stating that a posting for an internship at Dryden Flight Research Center is overpaid! The job is for a position at one of our governments most advanced laboratories and is listed offers between $31,000 to $83,000. The article goes on to state that it is open to almost anyone and that the government shouldn't have to pay for an intern!

An good engineering internship for an undergraduate in the private sector is normally equal to the entry level salary, about $50,000-$60,000. This is not a 'good' internship, this is an 'excellent' internship and one of the most selective in the country. 

An example of someone being considered for this position would be a PhD student from MIT with a killer GPA. People this smart are not cheap! And I for one don't want retards working in our government's most advanced laboratories. 

The Federal workforce needs to be reduced and the pay needs to be reviewed by position, but putting out ignorant articles like this makes Fox News and its Republican base look retarded. It also pisses off every Republican that works their ass off as a government employee."

I am asking for some advice from you experienced developers out there. A little about me, I am still a Senior in a University (almost done! :) ). I learned Java, feel like I know the language pretty well, and covered a lot of topics in my studies (Hash tables, linked lists, kv pairs, etc). While I may not know everything, I feel like I can at least understand code pretty well. My biggest weakness right now is when looking at other peoples code, I often have to take a while and figure out what people were doing and why they did it.

I learned Python on my own, while at my internship. From the first days of learning it, I instantly fell in love. (You should have seen my face when I multiplied ""Hello World"" by 8....:D) So long story short, I have been teaching myself A LOT of the concepts so I expect there to be a few gaps in my knowledge, but recently I have become the semi-script/app writer at my internship. I started experimenting in Django, and so far its pretty solid (User auth, MVC concepts).

So lately, I find myself wondering what my next steps could be? I really want to start working on open source Python projects but I don't feel I could be of much use (rather my inexperience is hindering me at the moment). Any advice for an aspiring developer? Possibly how to expand from just a ""simple script writer."" (Not that I don't enjoy doing it, love turning heads when I turn a process that used to take 3 hours to a 2 minute py script haha)

P.S. If you would have told me a year ago, that I would be developing/writing code for a living...I would have pooped my pants in laughter. Glad I am taking this route though, just looking for some advice! :D

Thanks in advance reddit!"

It's also in the middle of fucking nowhere, population 40,000 (I'm used to big cities). The paid internship is in a major U.S. metropolis and would ultimately be more rewarding, but would only be guaranteed until about September. 

**What would you do?**

**Edit:** I should also mention that this salaried gig is a job that I interviewed for back in January, was strung along, and then told the position itself might be cut due to budget cuts. Three hours later I received a rejection email saying that the office had chosen another candidate. Then out of the blue the Hiring Manager emails me and says they want to interview me again. I am so goddamn confused and wondering what to make of their actions. Any experience/wisdom would be GREATLY appreciated.

I have been accepted to Emerson ([MA in Publishing &amp; Writing](http://www.emerson.edu/academics/departments/writing-literature-publishing/graduate-degrees/publishing-writing)) and DePaul ([MA in Writing &amp; Publishing](http://las.depaul.edu/english/Programs/Graduate/Programs/MAWritingandPublishing/index.asp)). I'm currently more likely to choose between DePaul and PSU (if I get in), because when I visited Boston, I didn't like it very much. Driving there was an absolute nightmare, and when I was trying to find a place to eat for lunch, 3 of the 4 places I tried to go to were closed for whatever reason. While the program at Emerson definitely seems better in terms of publishing/editing choices than DePaul, I don't want to be miserable for 2+ years. 

Is anyone part of the program? My main concern is that the department seems to have little money to provide scholarships or assistantships. I know the book publishing track doesn't allow for students to apply for an assistantship until the second year, which means I'd need to find another job to support myself. DePaul does offer assistantships which gives you tuition remission, but only about a $7,000 stipend. 

Besides the possibility of not having a scholarship/assistantship and that moving there would be a hassle (a 32 hour drive or something), PSU seems like the best fit for me. The classes sound interesting and practical (unlike DePaul's multiple writing workshops), there's a press that I'd be likely to get an internship at, Portland seems super cool (though I've never visited). 

Anyway, I live in the Midwest and moving to Portland is a big deal, so any advice in terms of the program, the department, or the city is great. For reference, I'm looking to break into the editorial side of the publishing industry, but I know that it's likely that I might have to work in, say, marketing, before moving into my desired position."

Halfway through high school, I moved away because of my Dad's job. I kept in touch with her, and feelings waned a bit, and I even thought they disappeared. 

Nope. During Spring Break, I went and visited her, and I feel I felt back in high school. Nothing has changed as far as how I feel about her. Leading up to the visit, the feelings were the same. This didn't just jump out of nowhere. It's just been lingering. 

I've been timid in the past, but I'm looking to change that. I'm going to be moving to the city where she lives this summer because I got an internship, there. Something is going to happen with this situation before the end of May. 

So, after searching around a bit, I've found several methods that have worked for people escaping the friend zone. Basically, from what I've heard, it comes down to divisive action that basically comes down to: ""I want us to try to be together or I can't continue to be friends."" I basically want to go with this method.

I want one of two options: I want to either be with her, or not be friends any longer. I don't know if I can take any more of the other option. I don't want to, at least. 

All that is well and good, though, but the reason I'm posting this is because there's another obstacle in the way that I haven't seen others deal with: **She's in a long-term relationship with another guy**. They've been together for more than a year, maybe close to two. She's starting to talk about marriage with him, and I can't take it. Luckily for me, it seems he may have commitment issues and does not want to propose, though they have talked about it. 

Basically, I'm hoping for some advice, pointers, or just general motivation. This is not easy for me, but I'm not going through this shit all summer. 

I'm getting on with my fucking life, with her or without her. 

**TL;DR** Loved her since 8th grade. She's talking about marriage with another guy, and I can't take it any more. "

I also have my name on a couple of papers that were presented at Acoustics conferences from a summer research gig I had a few years ago-- I show up on Google Scholar, so there's that.

Up until the end of last year, I thought I wanted to go into academia, but over the last year I've realized I have pretty much no interest in doing that-- so I've tried a few different things, and I'm thinking very seriously about going into SLP, since I do *like* Linguistics but also want to do something more impactful than spending the rest of my life sitting at a desk and thinking *really hard* about sluicing. 

So to that end, I'm taking time off next year while I work on applying to graduate school. I'm already planning on taking the bio/physical science kind of prereqs that are required, as well as a few ASL classes, at a state school near me. However, I also don't really have a lot of experience on my resume working with people-- I've been involved in a few clubs in leadership position doing literary and service kind of stuff. 

The thing is, I don't really know what to do to GET experience-- I realize that getting a job/paid internship doing something related to SLP is unrealistic, but I don't know what kind of volunteer opportunities to start looking for or where to look. I'll be living at home, and the SLP at my old school is kind of a family friend, but I am unsure if it would be appropriate to email her to ask if she would be willing to let me volunteer some time as an assistant? Or if it would be appropriate to cold email hospitals/speech clinics/programs near me to ask what volunteer opportunities I could pursue? 

Can anyone give me some advice, both on whether or not I'd have a hell of a time getting into a program to start with, as well as on what I can do to get some volunteer experience? Thanks so much ~new friends~, and sorry for the wall of text.

I went to a high school where kids all went to top tier schools, me being the first one in my family to go to college here in the U.S., I didn't know what to expect and was not even close to being prepared.

I started at the college and I hated every minute of it from day one. It is located in an inner city, I had to commute because my parents didn't want me to dorm, and I was actually OK with it because it wasn't a very pleasant place to live anyway. So, I failed hard. I always did well in math, science not so much, but in college, I did well in nothing at all as I did not care to be there one bit.

I didn't get kicked out after my first two semesters, but I begged and pleaded with my parents to let me go to community college and go into the finance field which I always wanted to do. This was not even close to being ok with my mother, as I would make her look bad in the community, since every one elses children were all becoming doctors or engineers. Those were my only two fields of choice, and this was the only school I was allowed to go to. I couldn't afford to go to school on my own, my parents had to co-sign my loans, but if I wanted to go to community college I would have to pay myself which at the time I did not ""know"" how to. Why? I was raised very sheltered, although I was ""poor"" compared to probably 80% of the kids in my school, I developed the same mindset, working only to blow all the money on things I wanted, not thinking about the future and saving.

So I continued school, I changed majors from computers to medicine, and continued to fail, but the easier classes kept my GPA just high enough for me to stay in school. At the start of my third year there, I changed majors again, this time to engineering. I continued to fail, I felt horrible, my friends were about to graduate, while I pretty much had the equivalent credits of being a freshman at the end of my fourth year.

I talk to my parents again, they finally see that I'm struggling, but it's too late. My grades are too low to be able to transfer to any other college, I would have to drop out, or go to community college and pretty much start all over, or I could stay where I was.

I stayed. Why? I don't know. I continued to struggle, I continued to fail and repeat classes, everyone else just blowing by me, me being stuck in time in the same place with no end in sight.

As much as I hated the place, I made many friends and met many people. One of my friends helped me get an engineering internship at place where that summer they had over 7,000 applicants out of which they hired only 90. I was actually happy for once, they were paying us, what seemed to me was a ridiculous amount of money. I was excited, but at the same time, I was scared shitless. They never asked for my grades and I was afraid they would find out, I was afraid the people who get me the internship would find out and I would make my friend look bad. At the end of the summer, I got a great review, but I had to go back to school and face failure again.

I continued, I started doing better in school, the internship somewhat helped me put into perspective of what I could be doing if I did graduate. But then I always realized that even if I did graduate, due to my grades I would never be able to land a job anywhere. I had applied to many other internships, but why would they want anyone with such shitty grades? If it wasn't for my friend, I wouldn't be where I am.

Summer came again, and the company let me do another internship with them, paying me even a little more this time. My work ethic was complete opposite of my school work ethic. In the real world, I always did well, rarely made mistakes, and tried my best to keep everyone happy. I had a different boss this time since I worked at a different location, he was awesome, and he gave me an awesome review and I thought I would get hired when I graduated but I didn't, not because of him, but because the company had a hiring freeze.

So I finally graduated, almost 8 years later after I started. I felt like shit. It took me so long. I saw people from high school who had already been working for 4 years, becoming independent, doing what they wanted. Me? I was close to being almost 6 figures in debt, I couldn't get a job anywhere, sure they'd interview me, but as soon as they asked me for my GPA and I told them, I could see their disinterest right away.

Again though, with the help of a friend, I was able to get a full-time job only 3 months after graduating. Kids who were in my classes who had close to 4.0 GPAs couldn't even find work. I stay in contact with them, and even a year later they couldn't find work, many decided to go back to grad school.

I landed this job, because they didn't ask me about my grades, I interviewed well, and they loved my attitude towards learning. My parents were happy, I was happy, but again, I worried that they would find out my grades, luckily it never came up.

So, I always read about people having so many problems due to not having money. I've come to realize, money has nothing to do with, and everything to do with it. I'm making somewhere close to 6 figures now, but due to my student debt, I still am staying at home.

I am very happy with where I work and what I do. But at the same time, I have a deep resentment towards my parents for not letting me do what I wanted to do. I know for a fact I could have excelled greatly in the finance field, but they still feel that forcing me to go this route was the best decision ever.

So now that I've graduated, and making lots of money, has my depression/sadness gone away? Not one bit. If you see me outside of my house, you'll never see me without a smile on my face, always smiling and laughing, never get mad at people. I have more friends than I know what to do with. At home, it's the opposite, you'll rarely see me smiling and I always feel angry.

My parents don't seem to be happy, now that I'm working, they want me to have an arranged marriage, and start a family. My happiness is linked with my parents for some strange fucked up reason. I feel as if though I can't make them happy, then I'm just a piece of shit and I myself feel sad. If I do what makes me happy, they will be sad, which in turn would make me sad because I never want to see my parents hurt in any type of way. If I want them to be happy, I feel like I would have to be sad the rest of my life.

It is a vicious cycle to which I see no end to. I am stuck in what seems to be an endless torture in my mind. Even though I have so many friends, I still feel completely alone. I can buy myself almost anything I want, but usually that gratification of having something new lasts only for a few hours. In college I always thought that once I graduated and started working, all my worries would go away and life would be perfect. The reality is, I feel almost the exact same way. I come home from work and just prepare for the next morning because I don't feel like doing anything else other than sitting around. I have no motivation, as I feel that no matter what I do, I will always be stuck feeling this way.

Can money help solve some of one's problems? Without a doubt in my mind, I know it can. Will money lead you to happiness? When you don't have it, you may think so, but from what I'm experiencing, it is just a big misconception, kind of like playing with fire as a kid, it doesn't look dangerous until you stick your hand in and feel the pain.

1a9bp6,10,2013-03-13,Does prestige matter for a master's degree in counseling psychology? (x-post r/gradadmissions),burdenedbanshee,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/1a9bp6/does_prestige_matter_for_a_masters_degree_in/,"I applied to several schools for master's in marriage and family therapy programs, and to one school for a master's in counseling psychology with a concentration in marriage and family therapy. Problem is, I just had all my interviews, and the marriage and family therapy programs, despite being ""good"" or ""well-known"" programs, made terrible impressions on me. At one, the professors were late to the interview and left us sitting in the room confused for a bit. At another, they scoffed at me when I asked if they provided any support for job-seeking. They also scoffed when I asked about financial aid.

I went to the counseling psychology program interview, and I LOVED it. It's small. The faculty seemed genuinely interested in the success of their students and willing to tailor the program to the student's needs. The location is great, and where I want to settle down eventually. A few days later, I got a call saying I was accepted. I was ecstatic! But I'm having some trouble giving that final ""yes""... mostly because the school isn't a ""big name"",  but also partially because I didn't expect to like it as much as I did.

r/psychotherapy, could I have some help?

**tl;dr**: How much does prestige matter in a master's in counseling psychology program, considering I don't *ever* plan on going on to a PhD? (I can't find rankings of counseling psychology masters ANYWHERE, and trust me I've looked.) Will I be able to find a job? Will people care where I got my training, or will they care about my internships and experience more?

Secondly, if prestige doesn't matter, what DOES matter? What final factors should I consider before *committing* to a program (e.g. can I pay for it, does it teach me what I need to know, will I be able to get a job I want when leaving)?"

Now at the end of my tenure, where I've failed socially, I'm in a position to start over again. I applied for an internship where I would have to move across the country if I was offered work from the company at the end. I guess the thing is, is that I don't think I can do it again.

As a result, we are allowed to take electives outside the department if they're statistics-related.  My plan is to take a graduate level data mining course in my university's business school in the fall because it's a topic I have an interest in, along with Bayesian statistics (although my university has nothing with regard to that).  I have very little programming experience other than some rather basic stuff in Python and Java, and I know a bit of R.

However at the same time, I will be a junior next year and nonparametric statistics is the elective that is offered at the undergraduate level, and after that it won't be offerred for another two years when I'll have graduated.  It seems like it includes some important inference techniques.  I have two other required Stat classes to take next fall (Intermediate Probability and Time Series) and with my math minor, would have to delay my math classes a semesters to fit four Stat classes in.  I'm going to talk to my advisor about this when my break is over, but in the meantime, for internship and graduate school purposes, should I forego nonparametric statistics in favor of data mining?

We've been together for about a year and a half.  Love each other very much and have a great time when we are together. Often times when one of us has to head home it usually takes an hour or longer to head out since we'd rather not be apart from one another. 

He is on his final semesters (just the rest of this semester/fall semester left) of college and on his way to complete his bachelors in mechanical engineering.  He is extremely stressed about not doing well in school, trying to finish up with the best grades he can, finding an internship for the summer and finding a great job for when he graduates.  While my stress levels are a little lower, I'm still trying to figure out what road I want to travel down when it comes to what school I want to transfer to so I can complete my bachelors. 

Since he is so stressed with things about school he decided that we needed to make a business decision about school and us.  Meaning we needed to slow things down so he could have enough time to get his studying done to get through the rest of his time in school (I might add we live an hour away from each other).  With the amount of homework and tests he has, the business side of me is in 100% agreement, seeing as I would rather not be a cause of him not doing well in school if I can help it.  Not saying he'd do that but I don't want to take any chance of that happening.  However the emotional side of me is completely torn apart about slowing things down and taking some time apart to make all this happen.  He has told me that this has been really hard for him to do, but it is something that he feels he needs to do to give himself the best opportunity to find a great job after graduation so that he can provide for us.  We have a current agreement that to our family, friends, and any others that ask we are very much still in a relationship however on the inside we slowing down and taking a little time apart.  I can see it on his face that this isn’t entirely what he wants to do but at the same time its something he feels he really needs to.

Since Christmas time, she randomly started peeing on my bed. Like, **every day**. We took her to the vet but the stupid intern lost her bloodwork. We haven't taken her back yet because its really cold out and we dont want to stress her out. 

We started keeping her in my moms room instead because I was getting fed up. She has only peed on my moms bed like once or twice. but now she'll come out and run in to my room.

IfI don’t change right now, I’m going to be dead in a month.

In this post, I would like to offer the complete and total truth.

I'm very serious about this 2 week water fast. I know everybody tells me it's not going to work, but it's something I believe in beyond a shadow of a doubt. Monday IS the day. I’m going to do it, or I’m going to die, but I will NOT fail.

I would like to start a blog/vlog covering my journey from here, and im wondering if you think it would have a chance of gaining a serious following.

I’m extremely physically and mentally ill. I’m dying, and I need to change NOW because this is absolute last chance and I can NOT accept the life I’ve living. I’m supposed to be one the worlds greatest, I’m supposed to be make a big change, I’m supposed to be a revolutionary.

Growing up, I was always supposed to be “the golden child.” The best looking, the genius, the star of the family that everybody KNEW was going to “make it.” My mom told me people used to stop her on the street with me to comment on my looks and how I should go into acting or modeling. This is when I was 3.

I’ve been a musician and classic rock junkie since childhood- hardrock is in my blood, it’s my very soul, I live and breath it. It’s how I’ve always identified myself.

I was the talented one, I was the special one, I was always the one to watch. I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to be a great scientist, or a mega star in the entertainment industry, but I knew I’d be one of them, and so did everybody around me, even some people who really hated me. I’ve been a musician and classic rock junkie since childhood- hardrock is in my blood, it’s my very soul, I live and breath it. It’s how I’ve always identified myself. I KNEW it was gonna happen someday!

Life was great, I can’t lie. I was popular in high school, got all the best girls, lost my virginity at 12, had a great home life, etc. I thought “if I can just keep this up, life will be perfect!”

I’ll never forget the day I had my first death-anxiety induced panic attack at 16. Cold sweats, shaking, crying, heart pounding… I was listening to “the end” by the doors, and I suddenly had a very clear and complete contemplation and what eternal death was like, and I’ve never felt anything like it before or since. Pure, absolute terror.

The next day I became a transhumanist. I started researching radical life extension technologies- gene therapy, nano, etc- and I decided I was going to dedicate my life to finding the solution for aging and mortality. My plan was to go to MIT, study A.I and nano, and develop technology around the brain-in-a-vat theory to create potential centuries of full virtual reality. I’d also perhaps get to work for the likes of Marvin Minsky or Aubrey de Grey (both of whom I’ve met, btw.)

I started going to conferences, the singularity summit, MIT labs, etc. I’d meet professors and apply for internships. I’d write articles on doctorate level work and have it published.

Around this time, I also got into the mens rights movement (MRA.)

I also started going to taco bell everyday.

So M.I.T tells me my grades aren’t quite up to par (thanks to slacking off in the early years), but if I took a year off , took some classes,did some work and really impressed them, they’d be happy to have me. Great!

I’ll never forget july 19th 2010, the day I picked up guns n roses book Watch you bleed in boston airport on the way back from one such meeting. Immediately I knew “THIS is what I have to do! THIS is who I am”! I’d never felt a stronger feeling in my entire life.

By this time 90% of my calories comes from fast food/junk food

I went to Vietnam to teach English as my sister was doing,thinking it would be great for my MIT resume. Of course I was listening to appetite everyday. The teaching was a complete disaster, but I had so much fun. Sexy European girls, free and plentiful weed, brawls with hordes of drunken Australian backpackers.We had a rotating band we called “the wrecking crew”, and wreck shit we did. I was 18 and invincible.

Then I was offered heroin, and accepted. I’ll never forget November 5th 2010 either. It was that night I formulated my plan- I would start the next greatest hardrock band, rise up to superfame, become a cultural icon around the globe, and use that to foster the transhumanist revolution and become the ultimate hero of humanity.

I hitch hiked from south florida to L.A. Describing that would triple this post, so I’ll justsay ask if you want any details. It’s the craziest part of the story.

I turned 19.

Ah, the joys of opiates. I had all sorts of crazy ideas that were, admittingly, pretty fucking cool to think about. My original plan was the scale the wall of Geffen records, burst in some unsuspecting AR and tell them all about my brilliant plan. It would work..it HAS to work! Of course they’d see how brilliant it was!

Then I thought first, I wanted to become infamous, then rise up. I wanted to stand against the materialistic, judgement. I hate how the average people are shut down, how people are told they aren’t good enough or cool enough. Maybe I’d create this “troll character”, a fat ugly loser type, to become a tabloid. Under the watchful eye of heroin, I started this ridiculous idea where I invented this character called “the #1 infamous anti-celebrity and celebrity stalker” and proceeded to write a series of letters to select actresses and TMZ about my plan and exploits. I’d sneak into movie premiers at the Chinese theater (I actually got into the Oscars a few weeks ago.)

Of course, I was here for guns n roses, and the first thing I did was go on the “GNR hajj” where I visited all of the classic places: canters, el compadres, the hell house, etc. I lived down the street from the liquor store on sunset/ la brea in slash’s book.

By this time, 100% of my calories are coming from fast food/junk food. I’m topping 15,000 calories a dy and 2 gallons of soda a day.

Remembering my privileged childhood, I always regretted not having lived a more “street” life. I thought, “If im going to be GNR, I gotta LIVE gnr”.

I came up with a motto- WWSD- “what would slash do?” the answer the obvious- I need to drink and do drugs!

And thus the “suicide diet” got kicked up a few notches. I started drinking, shooting up, “living life”.

I had a fake ID- shit I looked old enough- and always made sure I had enough vodka. A half gallon turned to a full gallon. Then 1 gallon a day would turn into 2. My eyes would turn yellow. My skin would turn yellow, (except for when it would turn blue). I'd throw up blood. I'd cough up blood. I'd go to the bathroom and see nothing but blood. My legs would swell and start bleeding from the pores. I’d start having vivid hallucinations. Shoot. Spike.rail.

I’d shoot 2 consecutive speedballs, go to the mirror and see my skin turn blue, only to go and shoot another one, pass out, and wake up 2 days later…and do it again. spike I started having serious symptoms, and really started feeling sick.

I turned 20. rail

I knew it was time to stop, but now I was beginning to realize what so many before me hadn’t- I wasn’t able to.

I was sick shoot. I was beginning to look different. I need to quit. Ok, I quit. Rail Ok, next week. Monday is the day Shoot

So I turned 20.5….time to quit next monday Shoot.rail

I finally reached 2 gallons a day, everyday. My skin/eyes are always yellow. I’ve gained 30 pounds. I supported a habit through illegal means*

*note- I never hurt anybody in anyway, and was never involved in anything harder than weed.

And now im 2 months, 3 weeks and 3 days away from 21, and it’s time to change. I KNOW that im meant for more than this…it isn’t supposed to be this way…

And it wont be. This Monday is IT, no matter what. I will finish this two week water fast, restore my youth and rise up in the hard rock revolution. im going to change for everybody who believed in me becausethis life is NOT how things are supposed to be.

so, do you think if i made a youtube account tonightt posting my story, i could get a following for this? how should i say it? what should i do?

I work at a recording studio during the summer, and love my job (aka unpaid internship). Now like with any job, i have to deal with my fair share of idiots (if i had a quarter for every time i got called to someones home studio to turn on phantom power for them). but none of them compare to the TCFF incident.


So its a bright and shining saturday morning, and we had just gotten through recording a single for a local band. The phone rings and i pick it up. 


me: Hello, (name censored) Studios speaking, how may i help you?

stupid: Hey...you guys fix recordings right?

me: Yes sir we do, its $100 if you bring the mix in, $250 if we come out there and do it

s: Oh, that'll work fine, its pretty serious, come on out


So im expecting the worst. This guy sounded worried. So we drive out there and meet him at his studio.


m: Okay, so what seems to be the problem

s: Ok so we are making a commercial for the Traverse City Film Festival, and the sound is really distant and muffled, we've tried everything!


So now i'm worried. These guys have the credentials to make commercials for the TCFF?!?!?! We're screwed.


m: So...mind if we go in and take a look at things?

s: Sure, sure, go right ahead


we walk in and start playing with the mix. Nothing is working, the sound just stays muffled and distant. I turn around, ready to give up, and see something out of the corner of my eye. i slowly walk over to the recording booth, turn the mic around, and call out ""I think we are done here""

Hope you guys help out better!

So I've been applying to grad schools and have been accepted to University of Utah in SLC. Colorado State is also considering me! I'm excited to do graduate school in environmental engineering but am starting to have concerns about financing this endeavor.

Due to being a non-resident, my tuition will be very high the first year. In addition my girlfriend (serious relationship) wants to go with, and she may have a lot of trouble finding a job early on. Therefore I will have to help financially support her as well.

Though I want a graduate degree, I would be equally happy finding a job in UT or CO as its always been my dream to live out there. I've been applying like crazy for nearly two years now but nobody is interested. On the other hand, I know it's far easier to get jobs as a local of the city I want to live in.

The fortunate news is I have $12000 in savings to spend for grad school or to support myself until I find a job. I've a chemical engineering degree with 2 years experience with ChE and EnvE jobs and internships.

Should I spend my money on graduate school or move to CO or UT and spend it supporting my unemployment until I find a job? My gf will require my monetary help for the first 3 or 4 months but I want to keep her with me in either scenario.

-What do you know about foster care? 
-Have you seen any marketing about becoming a foster parent? How did you react to it?

This is my (M/28) first post ever on reddit. Have been lurking for a month or so. I'll use a throwable account, because telling about involuntary loss of job is awkward.

So I am this legal clerk working in a local government. It's by far not the most satisfying job I've ever had. Actually I took the job, because I was looking for a career change and I figured, that if I take a job beneath me, then I will have time to pursue my degree in computer science. 

Well, I had no idea, how much beneath my current job would be. I was used to working hard to present strong legal argumentation and then fight for our position to prevail. However, at my current employer, we try to figure out, how to avoid getting in legal disputes. We don't believe in our own ability, so we try not to allow situations arise, where our ability would be measured.

We make pretty bad mistakes too. Ethical on professional. As a government organization we screw over the citizen if we believe, that s/he won't know how to enforce his/her rights. We usually won't be able to hold another party liable before us, because our people generally don't understand our legal position. 

So after many meetings I am asked to give my opinion on the issue. I look at the paperworks and say: ""Duh, it's expired, so we can't claim anything."" But there are many other simple questions which they discuss week in and week out.

At first, I was quite busy, because our organization cannot *cough* afford to pay for our training. So figure out at work place. However, Once I figured the important stuff out, I suddenly didn't have much work at all. I was so bored at work. I could do some CS stuff, but the environment doesn't allow me to concentrate and also makes me feel quilty. 

About a month ago I read about free training on taxes. Wrote to my boss, that I'd like to go. 3 days over a month. Allowed. Then I began to take classes at school to become a student tutor. For 10 weeks, I needed to leave 1 hour before end of work. Allowed. This week I had a fever. Wrote to my boss and said, that I will stay home for a couple of days to get my health back. As per our internal regulation, we are allowed to take 3 personal days with no explanation. No response to that. 

Then today I went to him with an application to get a paid studyleave. According to legislation, we get 20 days per year. Last year I used it all. This year I have used 12 days and applied for 5 more. Intend to pursue CS internship in the summer, so I don't mind using all of my days before this summer. My boss says, that we'll talk about it later. Wierd.

Anyway, a bit later I overheard him talking to his boss about letting my go by lay-off. 

I'll be in a class object-oriented programming for a few hours now. After that if there are any comments or questions, I will answer them. Or perhaps I'll have a drink and do the answering later.

Should this be in the AMA-forum? I'm a bit too shy to it over there.

I'm stuck in a dead end job, I was up for an interview with a career related job (my first one) that would have been amazing but for various reasons I got seriously screwed over by an agency so its rapidly looking like I haven't got it (but this process has been going on since September and I still don't have an answer).

I've been struggling to apply for one job a month and the truth is the reason I've done so few is because I hate putting myself out there, I cant cope with the rejection, so I just hide away in fantasy worlds instead of making the steps I need to, to change my life for the better.

I've been trying to get jobs in one area of my career and I've rapidly been realising I'm no longer interested in it which is a massive problem because I move to london to pursue that career (I've been here a year and got nothing just a couple of work experiences).

I'm broke and having to take money from my parents to survive.
I'm over weight.

I finally grew some stones and asked a girl out only to find out she had a boyfriend and I'm still kicking myself over that because I knew for a long time she was single I just waited to long.

My sister has been dianosed with depression, shes on medication and shes been having a rough time but she admitted to me that one of the reasons she's depressed is because of me.
I mean my sister is literally worried sick over me and I dont know how to react to that, I mean its great that she cares (she never really shows it) but I'm kind of angry at her as well but then I feel like a dick for being angry at her.

I never wanted to move to london its just there were no career options at home and after graduating university I ended up work in a super market for two years but had nothing to show for it then came here to try my luck.

Oh and to top it all off I want to move to canada but theres a distinct possibility that I wont be able to because I'm more than likely on a black list and I'm seen as a flight risk (as in potential illegal immigrant).

That stories complicated but the short version is I was going to intern with a company in canada. At the time we didnt know I needed a visa to be over there (it was an unpaid internship), I got one sorted eventually but the company used its government connections to try and sneak me in the back door and I guess I got caught.

I had no idea this was happening and I didn't find out anything was wrong until my next visit to Canada two years latter where I was pulled over at immigration. Luckily the guy let me in the country but he gave me very strict warnings.

I've heard its impossible to get off that black list so even if I follow all the processes correctly I could still be rejected.

Which means my main dream is over before its even started."

I'm in College full-time and have an unpaid internship so I really wanted to do this to earn some side money/get better at photography. 

These are some of the kits under $300 I've been looking at, please give me some feedback! 

ps: Since I would be shooting them standing doing tricks I would more than likely need at least a 10x20 backdrop cloth so they can step on it. 

Kit 1: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002S9KTAW/ref=ox_sc_act_title_3?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A2FI19G9IAJPA5

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036NNGFY/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER

Kit 2: http://www.cowboystudio.com/product_p/b-fslash-sfl08boomkitcboom%20_newcb_bwg.htm?1=1&amp;CartID=1 (it's $280, will be adding a 10x20 white background for $20 more) 

kit 3: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0081SUXTG/ref=ox_sc_sfl_title_2?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A3JD14OD11FZKR (can buy the 10x20 backdrop cloth separately for $45)

Now these are just kits I've been looking at, if you have any recommendations please let me know. Thank you!"

Colorado State is also considering me! I'm excited to do graduate school in environmental engineering but am starting to have concerns about financing this endeavor.

Due to being a non-resident, my tuition will be very high the first year. In addition my girlfriend wants to go with, and she may have a lot of trouble finding a job early on. Therefore I will have to help financially support her as well.

Though I want a graduate degree, I would be equally happy finding a job in UT or CO as its always been my dream to live out there. I've been applying like crazy for nearly two years now but nobody is interested. On the other hand, I know it's far easier to get jobs as a local of the city I want to live in.

The fortunate news is I have $12000 in savings to spend for grad school or to support myself until I find a job. I've a chemical engineering degree with 2 years experience with ChE and EnvE jobs and internships.

Should I spend my money on graduate school or on supporting my unemployment until I find a job in CO or UT? My gf will require my monetary help for the first 3 or 4 months but I want to keep her with me in either scenario."

I will be working as an intern for a organisation that promotes peace in the region and works towards interfaith and non violence in the Palestinian community. I am a 21 year old British National, currently i am trying to organize my visa and the practical means of traveling. Kindly the non profit organisation has said they will provide me with free accommodation, however i am wondering what a breakdown of the costs will be for food/water basic supplies. 
Most importantly i am unsure of how to deal with the entry issues. Different people are telling me different things, with some people saying i should not state that i will be volunteering or working with Palestinians otherwise state security could give me grief, others say a tourist visa would be fine, and then there are other people who say i should apply for a working visa through the Israeli embassy. 

This may come across as a amateur question, but i don't want to take any action before i am informed properly of the consequences of my actions. 
Anyone who has got any advice, in general, i would deeply appreciate.

I just wanted, I guess, to vent. This is kind of a scary moment for me. While I know Riot isn't the be-all-end-all for my writing career, video game writing is what I want to do with my life. IT's what my passion is in. I can't imagine waking up and doing anything else every day (other than writing books but that's a given). Riot is a great company, exactly the kind of company I would want to work for.

Am I likely to get the internship? Probably not. There's probably hundreds of other applicants who are better qualified. But I had to try, right?

We are in college together and spend a lot of time together. We have an open, honest relationship that has had its history of fights but nothing too bad at all. We are best friends, before we started dating we were really good friends and things turned romantic. She and I have had some really intimate moments and I had begun to think more or less long term about this relationship lasting after college... maybe more. We had talked about all this stuff pretty extensively and detailed. She eveN had a plan to live with me this summer and work an internship 30 minutes from my house. 

Then all of the sudden things changed. She starts skyping 'friends' (male in gender but she insists they are just friends and this is typical, she just the type of girl that gets along with guys better that girls) these friends are from Europe. She has known them for years, one she has actually hooked up with before, friends now she insists. Anyways, she tells me one night that I'm holding her back (I am far poorer than this girl) and she wants to travel the world, she wants to break things off and go to Europe this summer with these friends. I am enraged, confused, and helpless. She insists that she still has feelings for me, ""loves me,"" yada yada. On top of this she only wants to go on a break, just end things for the summer. In her words, ""Completely cut herself off from home."" She claims she miserable here and needs to find herself. I knew she struggled with depression but man, this was serious. Now she wanted to break things off!

I'm completely shattered to say the least but I have to play it off. I can't prevent this girl I care so much about from seeking happiness. I want her to go if that what she wants, and honestly I can't say my life will be lonely or boring without her but this girl was/is such a catch. I love her. She loves me. There is no denying that in my mind at this moment. I am heart broken and absolutely dread thinking about her not in my life. 

Currently we are together and have simply agreed to go our separate ways this summer, her to Europe and home for me. We are going to give things an honest go when we get back to school for our senior year but I don’t want to give myself false hope. Advice is needed. I am being eaten up with anxiety about this summer. I want to be okay with this decision I’ve made. I know it’s the right one; letting her go. Help.

A caveat for the faint of heart: I used a graphic and a non-TNR font, so I consciously ignored those conventions. I'm hoping to get work in the publishing industry. I don't think a little panache would hurt. In fact, in the past I've had some very, very (over) stylized resumes that have earned me dream jobs, so I hope you guys don't mind my (polite) disregard of that rule. 

Everything else is fair game though; what I'd really like to know is if there is anything absolutely inexcusable or egregious. Any insight into phrasing, design, etc. would also be greatly appreciated. 


Also, I have several other jobs/internships that I chose not to include because they're not particularly germane to my field. Of course, the skills translate over, but the positions themselves were pretty menial. Among them: teacher's assistant at an elementary school for a few months, RA at a dormitory for ballerinas one summer, and intern at a law office. Should I include these, or was I right to leave them off?

A bit more background: like I mentioned, I'm a soon to be new grad moving to a city with few opportunities for my chosen industry. I already have a perfect job here, but I'm relocating with my boyfriend (whose work is more location specific) and would have to move on from it. The two positions I'm applying for are almost identical to the one I currently hold. 


Thanks in advance for any suggestions!

I feel like an underdog and this puts me at severe disadvantage as I'm competing with ivy-leagues in a highly competitive industry (investment finance).

Background: I'm a first year senior but a rising junior in a mediocre Midwestern state school (ranked top 25) perusing degrees in finance, economics, mathematics, and a minor in computer science. My GPA is a 3.2 and I have taken classes in mathematical statistics, upper level calculus, advanced economics, and applied financial valuation. I've held an internship with my college's hospital and worked two tiers below the dean who is now the CEO of a top 20 world hospital. I have also worked 15-20 hours a week during the school year since I started my sophomore year.

I taught myself how to program a few years ago and have since built numerous models and programs that take financial data, analyze it, and output stocks that meet specific trend requirements. I've also built programs that survey major online retailers for up-to-date pricing and sales information. Finance is my life. I always know where the market is heading and I always know the latest macro events, there isn't a day that goes by that I go uninformed.

Problem: I'm competing with people from NYU, Columbia, Cornell, Yale, UCLA, Stanford, etc, etc, etc. I was able to get the interview through leveraging my network and for some reason the company decided to call me. I don't know if this is out of obligation to my contact or if they are genuinely curious in my abilities. Regardless, it has me scared shitless because I don't come from a brand name university with an immaculate GPA. Especially when the minimum requirement is a 3.5

I don't really know what I'm asking and this may just be a rantish vent, but does anyone have advice? Experiences? Anectdotes? The company is cool as shit and I don't want to get turned down because I'm ""not up to standards."" Anything is appreciated and thanks for reading."

",ThrownAwayy119,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1abs1z/my_m20_exgirl_f20_wants_to_get_back_together_i/,"Hey Reddit, 

I want to thank you in advance for reading this, and giving any input you may have.  I don’t know where else to turn – the shame would kill me if I told my friends. 

I love her immensely; when we click it’s a thing of beauty.  Most of the people around us dream of the type of relationship we have.  We communicate well, I trust her with everything, after almost two years I still find her gorgeous and attractive as hell – and the sex, don’t even get me started, its wonderful. 

At the beginning of this year, I moved away to complete an internship for 4 months about one hour away. I was home practically every weekend, and we would do our thing – obviously dyeing to see each other, it was never enough. It was painful, especially for her. “ It hurts to think about you, so I try to distance myself, I try not to miss you”.  I was fine with keeping up this little long distance thing, especially with modern technology; it’s my opinion we have it easy.  Nevertheless, this didn’t work for her and she broke up with me, but we kept hanging out and seeing each other and being intimate, going on dates and all the rest of it.    I still felt attached, close and content for the most part.    She was happy making friends, going out and wheeling guys.   

Nevertheless she wanted distance from me, she wanted single life. Chances are , this was happening whether I moved away or not.  When we met she had just gotten out of her first, only long term relationship – and was planning on being single for a while. On the other hand I had been single for a long time, knew what I was looking for etc.  She always told me how she regrets not having that time to herself, to be single and live that life.  Problem is, we were fireworks right away – we didn’t want to let each other slip and we made it official a couple months into a relationship that was pretty exclusive from the get go.  

So recently, we spent the weekends together – doing really cute shit, beautiful dates, holding hands.  She would tell me she loves me, and how hard it is being apart – share our thoughts and feelings.   I always asked about her nights out, and she would tell me, even about how she kissed a guy at the bar, (doesn’t bother me at all, heh) rejected another – how awful the singles market is.  I was getting used to being just her sorta-friend.  Its weird listening to a girl you see yourself spending the rest of a long time with, potentially slipping away. 

I am pretty jealous, in a caring way, but I never creep, go through phones, or stop her. Ever.  I do however have an old school mentality about sex and love, exclusivity is important.  When she got excited as hell recently to talk to me, I practically knew what she was going to say – she wants to be with me, boyfriend-girlfriend.  She said how we have something special, and that it took the time apart for her to realize that, and we talked, I rejoiced and the world was good. Until she dropped the “I hooked up with someone”, and as she explained it more in depth she probably saw the perfect picture of my heart breaking.  She apologized, said how bad it was – nothing like ours, it was a premeditated sober decision because she was single,  “why not”, alcohol just helped the process – the logic is so I know she would never ever cheat on me if we are dating. Apparently she literally stopped it, no one got off and she went home.     He is a friend of a friend, she isn’t ready to tell me yet – but I know I will find out I already told her it is critical to me, one thing at a time though.   

Help Reddit,  .   I don’t know how to get over it, its pretty fresh,  I just cant get the image of another man between her legs out of my head – I cant even comprehend how she would let our relationship go ( I told her this, response was “ I was willing to let us go when we broke up” ).  I thought of her under someone else, someone else insider her, and as close to her on that level which I hold sacred. SRS is going to fucking love me, but here it goes – I just feel like she was mine and I was hers, and now even though she was “single”, that boy will always have a little piece of her so to speak. She isn’t infinitely mine, and won’t be, unless…. I don’t know, I get over it I guess.  I think I even see her as less attractive in my mind.  Fuck, I am so dramatic.   

How do I let it go? How do I build my relationship with her again?  How can I get rid of the shame? How the fuck do swingers work, seriously?  I feel hurt.  

She is also very eager to be normal, it doesn’t bother her at all – she is chipper and happy to Skype, talk on the phone – see each other, and I m just sitting there asking for details, being obviously sad. I just, I don’t know if I see her the same.  I do, she is all there, but just not that perfect girl I thought was mine. 


**Things I am not worried about (just to clear it up, avoid wasting your time): **

I trust her completely, she told me everything, she wouldn’t keep something at this point, and if she is – I am sure its for good reason. 

I am not worried about this happening again.  

Not worried that the other guy was bigger, or physically better looking.  Might sting a little to find him being a stud, but meh.  Motivation for the gym. 

**Something to consider; oh the irony:**

About a year into our relationship, a girl kissed me.  She was loaded, I was drunk – no excuse but she basically jumped me. I told her, I love my girl, thanks but no thanks, we are not going anywhere.  No one saw, so I kept it in my heart – I didn’t want to hurt my women.  Girls know girls know girls – and I get a super angry call about 2 weeks later.  She finds out what happened, I learn my lesson about communication – and we continue on our way.   She considers this worse than what she did because we were “dating”, and official together.  On the other hand, currently we are single – therefore no big deal.    In my opinion the title means nothing to me, they are just words – actions and feelings are the language of love. 

**TLDR:**  Amazing relationship, break up for about 2.5 months – frequently seeing each other, being intimate and doing couple stuff. Has shitty one night stand to try single life, decides its not for her two weeks later. Asks me out, I want / plan on accepting – but I don’t know how to get over something that hurts basically like infidelity.

1abqgh,31,2013-03-14,Singapore designated by UK Border Agency as Non-English Speaking Country. What do you think?,NEWater,singapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/1abqgh/singapore_designated_by_uk_border_agency_as/,"I was applying for a program that includes classes at LSE and an internship stint in British Parliament, and I was told that should my application be accepted, I must take the TOEFL test (SATs for those with English as second language) right away because Singapore is considered by the UK to be a non-English speaking nation.

This is despite the fact that I have a Cambridge-endorsed O Level certificate, and that I have completed my US university's writing requirement - without which I cannot graduate. 

I'm not surprised, though. The quality of English education in Singapore has deteriorated rapidly ever since I received my O Level cert, and the usage of proper English among Singaporeans is commonly seen as an elitist and ""atas"" trait."
1abphs,1,2013-03-14,Venting about Nursing clinical,throwawaynursing,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1abphs/venting_about_nursing_clinical/,"Alright, I just made a throwaway to vent.  I don't know why.  I'm just too hurt to keep it to myself.  It's so hard to convey in typing how much it hurts.

I have just been threatened (by my instructor) today to be failed in my clinical placement.  This would mean that I would be held back a year and basically lose everything (especially my new friends) that I have worked for since September.

Backstory: I am currently a full-time student in the second semester of a nursing program at a university.  It's my first year, but technically it's my fifth since I already have a degree in another major.  I've managed to make a few friends during the first semester, which have really helped a lot to motivate and support me to keep going, especially since I feel like utter shit for wasting my time and money on my first degree.  In my program, I have a clinical placement built into the curriculum (that's when you're sent to a hospital or long term care facility to work with staff and learn your skills; it's basically an internship for nurses).  However, during the first year, students don't actually get a real placement until second semester (which is where I am right now).  
So first semester is just sitting in a classroom for 8 hours and talking about practice standards, interview skills for patients, basically boring shit.  This is where it started.  The clinical instructor that I got (chosen at random; I had no control over who I was with) was a complete stickler.  Every single assignment I have ever handed in to her was wrong (we had multiple weekly assignments; it's not just 1 or 2).  They always, WITHOUT FAIL, needed corrections, needed revisions, needed attention.  Needless to say, it was very taxing and stressful, and eventually it all started to erode on my opinion of this instructor that I had never met before.  I hated her.  It felt like I was fighting some sort of really sneaky war, where the enemy strategy was to mentally break me down, and there was absolutely nothing I could do about it.  
I eventually got through the semester, worn out and bitter (although I will admit, I have made some really great friends from this war of a course that I fought).  Keep in mind that this was just one course.  I still had 4 others to attend to.  I hated this instructor that made 4 months of my life a living hell.  But I was done with her.  Free.  

Or so I thought.

Jump to second semester, where I am now.  It turns out that I was one of the ""lucky"" few to get the same instructor for my first clinical placement (we only found out which instructors we were assigned to, at the very last minute).  I thought it would be better; I had somewhat gotten used to how she marks things.  Maybe it would be better?  Maybe I could turn things around with her?  
No.  I now see that this was just wishful thinking.  She still ripped apart my assignments, just like last time.  And to add to it, I have to actually take care of people within my placement, with her moving around throughout the building to check up on what each of us are doing (there are 5 other students who are also in the same placement as I am).  When we perform skills in clinical, we are supposed to find our instructor so we can show them we can do it right.  I can say with confidence that I have performed every skill that I have been taught, and my instructor has not been around more than half the time to observe me doing them.  This is why she is failing me.  Because I couldn't fucking locate her within the building, just so I could show her I can do things (no amount of assignments or documentation can prove that I am capable of the skills that I have learned).  I had a meeting with her and a clinical coordinator today.  They **strongly** advised that I should voluntarily withdraw from the clinical course because they **strongly** felt that they would not pass me (And I quote, ""I'm about 90% sure you will not be given a pass."").  Again, I repeat that this would hold me back a year.  I would lose all of my friends, be back to square one, and waste more time and money.

I don't know what to do.  It makes me feel like shit.  So what? The degree that I have already earned means nothing?  That I'm more incompetent than a fresh-out-of-highschool student?  That I'm not deserving enough to even be considered a chance at second year?  I've been backed into a corner, and I feel like I'm drowning.  

If you've read this far, I truly thank you.  I have no idea how to deal with this, and I'm scared."

Allow me to begin by thanking all of you
Your subsection is the main reason I browse reddit, and your photos and posts continually remind me that a better world exists, though it currently lies far outside of my reach.

A little background info:

I have lived in Virginia since birth.

Until age 21 I believed the bullshit, spin and propaganda D.A.R.E, Law Enforcement and indeed much of the backward population of this state spout concerning Cannabis.

I have suffered from suicidal depression and anxiety for the entirety of my teenage and adult life.

Junior year of college was particularly dark.  

I felt as though life was hopeless, nothing I did mattered, and that every genuine desire I had was thwarted by the State, Family, School or my own scrambled psyche.

I was desperate enough to try anything. Even if it meant defying my family and country.

I made the necessary connections and acquired some ""herbal remedies"".

Cannabis broke my depression over it's knee and laughed heartily while doing so.
My anxiety melted away into a glorious spiritual reawakening.

Physically, with increased appetite and improved mood and outlook, over the course of two years I transformed from a literal ""90-pound weakling""

to a healthy, robust 120 pound flyweight (still tiny, but no longer a gaunt, dreary skeleton)

I am currently 23, recently graduated with a bachelors degree in the humanities (Though no internships or extracurriculars, so my slip of paper's utility is questionable at best)

I am stuck working a soul-sucking minimum wage job whilst I am continually rejected by every ""decent"" employer I apply to.

My dream and goal is to escape this nightmarish gung-ho redneck military police-state to the shining sands of California or any state where Cannabis is more readily available, where I can receive adequate treatment for my condition, and enjoy my life once again.

My job affords me only enough money and hours to keep my car filled up and my stomach (relatively) full.  

I was forced to leave the city I lived in during college and return home to the backwater hamlet I grew up in.

My parents are unsympathetic to my problems, calling me a ""drug addict"" and a ""lazy stoner"".  

They question why I need chemicals/addiction as a crutch and fail to see any irony at all when I cite coffee, alcohol, cigarrettes, gambling and all manner of other substances and practices they freely ingest and engage in.

I expect no help from them and have given up my appeals to reason.

I left my collegiate social circle behind, so I have been almost completely alone since graduation (Dec) making do with whatever herb I managed to scrape together enough funds for (Cannabis is prohibitively expensive in ""Neanderthal"" states like mine due to the high risk involved)

My depression and anxiety have returned in force. Imagine how nice it was to hear their voices again.

I have hardly any appetite, and am losing weight at a steady pace (currently around 112-108 and dropping).  
I have lost much of my motivation to work out, and as a result, my strength is fading and my muscles are slowly wasting away.

I refuse to ingest ""State-Approved"" Psychoactives like Prozac, Zoloft, Wellbutrin and all other manner of Pharmaceutical snake oils.
I will die by my own hand before Pfizer profits from my misery.

Ents, I need your suggestions for the FASTEST POSSIBLE WAY out of this state and into a better one.

I don't require much.  Just a roof over my head, some clothes on my back, some food to eat and a brimming bowlpack.

I have searched several corporate, insurance claims, and call-center jobs ""out west"", but so far, every employer has rejected me.

My degree is in English Literature (turns out all the jokes about an English degree being useless have a great deal of truth to them)

I am willing to scrimp and save for an apartment security-deposit and enough gas for the trip (and it is likely that my parents would be willing to assist me financially if my move is cloaked in the guise of employment)

Any suggestions would be a godsend to me.

&lt;3 J.

P.S. I've been on a ""forced tolerance break"" long enough to piss clean for any pre-employment drug-test, though I'm not so sure about hair"

I want someone to care about me. I always feel alone. I always feel left out. I look after everyone, yet no one does the same for me. A simple ""how are you?"" is all I ask and I never get it.

I want to end it all so badly. I can buy a cheap gun and be done. I made my friend a promise that I would get help, but I regret making that promise. I've regretted it from the moment the words left my lips. I feel so alone and I want to die. I cut myself to keep myself calm. I carry scissors with me to keep myself calm. I want to die so badly. I feel like I have to make everyone around me proud and I can't. I can't handle the pressure. I feel like I can't make mistakes. I screw up once and everything is done. I have to be perfect or else everyone will see me as a disappointment. I already feel like everyone hates me and making a mistake will only make things worse. I want to relax, but I don't know how. I'm so paranoid about everything. I know someone is going to say ""things get better"" but I've been hearing that through out my whole life. I don't believe that things will get better."

1afkeu,0,2013-03-16,An Idea for a new Ashe passive,robo_orlo,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1afkeu/an_idea_for_a_new_ashe_passive/,"So, Recently Riot Asked on it's Internship application “What is the worst Designed skill in the game?”.  The answer I came up with is Ashe's passive. There are a few glaring flaws with her passive: 

1) Her passive is inconsistent. There is no worse feeling that waiting for a while to save up your crit chance, and then not getting a crit with that auto attack.

2) It's an invisible source of power. There is no way to know for sure what your crit chance is without highlighting the icon over your health bar.  Moreover, enemy champions can't tell either.  They just have to assume 

       A) you have been last hitting, so your passive Is currently worthless or 
       B) you just got back to lane, so you have a good chance to crit
3) It has no presence in team fights.  One crit on a squishy is awesome, but a crit on a tank isn’t worth too much

How should we fix this?  I think we should completely change her passive.  The ability to crit early on is hampering her damage, and it makes it hard to balance.  I would suggest something like this:  

every twenty seconds(scales down, to 10 at 16) ashe's next auto attack deals 150% damage, and silence for 1 second.  The cool down on the passive is reduced by 1 second on every frost arrow.  

I think this would fix most of the problems with ashe's current passive.  It's consistent damage, and reliable.  While it is certainly a reduction in her burst damage early on, it gives her  a short cc that would make her kit more powerful, but in a different way from other AD's.  Plus, it could have a cool particle effect that glows blue on her, making it clear when her passive is active.  In any case, It would be cool to know what you guys think about this. "

I'm about a third of the way through a Ph.D. program in marine science.  Without giving too much away, my research is in isotope geochemistry.  I like the work well enough, but the prospects of spending years in low-paying, high-stress positions isn't terribly appealing.  

I took my first (and thus far, only) real geology lecture class just last semester here at my grad school.  I really, really liked it, and in hindsight, if I could re-do my undergrad, I would have majored in geology.  My other classes have just been seminars on specific topics in geochemistry, which have been very useful, but don't provide the same type of structured learning that, say, a regular sed/strat course would provide.

I've been reading about petroleum geochemistry for the past few months, and it seems like an awesome--if small--field.  Unfortunately, I don't really have anyone to talk to to learn more about what it takes to become a petroleum geologist/geochemist, since my grad school is very academia-oriented (it's one of the top-ranked earth science grad programs), and is not located in a mining/oil-producing area.  Reddit, I am asking for your help.

My question is this:  **Is there any possibility that I can teach myself enough of the material covered in a traditional B.S./M.S. geology program to be functional as a petroleum geochemist?  Would companies like Shell or Anadarko even consider hiring someone like me, with no true geology degrees?  And if so, how can I go about getting my foot in the door (e.g., getting an internship)?**  Shell, Slb, and Exxon recruit at our career fairs, but they mostly are looking for other majors (e.g., business, engineering), rather than geoscience, probably because they get such a low yield from our department.

Any advice or insights would be awesome. Thank you!

I have had zero luck finding a job in the above entry level bracket. I just got an offer for sub-40k employment that I would typically expect a green student to get with no experience. 

I have friends that are turning to barista/clerk positions that graduated right with me. They applied to these same positions I did, but the recruiters seems to be leaning towards people that have work experience now far in excess of the position they are moving into. I have seen this with some other of us older returning students finding work.

We all expected college to boom our options and take us to the mid 50's at least. This is not the case. If you can graduate and get employed making mid 30's to low 40's with a chance to move up then you are smitten. 


BTW, I believe this is due in part to unpaid interns taking jobs away that traditionally would pay WELL. Corporations and government KNOW that they can do it and they take advantage.

I had an offer with local government here that would have been paid to the tune of 45k the year prior, but instead of offering me money they wanted a 6 month intern. 

Between shit like that and recruiters us job seekers need to stick together. 

It is brutal out there. "

Here's the intro: (roll the drums)

Since I was a kid, I loved creating scenes with my toys and acting out different roles to complement the scene. One time it would be a war scene where my toys were pitched against each other, other it would be a pirate raid, or a space shuttle launch or something.

What I mean to say is that I enjoyed acting from a very young age and am still a very happy go lucky person; being the source of laughter wherever I go. I am 21 and still try to make a fool out of myself by doing weird funny things and enjoying it and lightening the mood around me.

But inside, I feel down. Very very down. I am pursuing a degree in banking/accounting which I do not enjoy (even though I get it). My parents have put shit ton of money in my education and I need to finish what I started. I have done internships every summer so I can get a job in this international country I am studying in. (Fuck me right?)

I want to become an actor, but I never feel motivated enough to search for anything online any more. I still get these bursts of creativity and I am scared that if I put this voice inside me down, it will go away forever. And I can't lose that part of me because it is me, and it is who I want to be.

Coming from South Asia with these cultural strains on me is taking its toll on me. I never feel motivated to even pick my guitar any more. I don't know why I'm writing this, I hope someone out there went through the same thing as me, in the end did what they wanted to do and loved every bit of it. I don't want to ruin my life now that it has actually started. What do I do?

So there it is. I hope I used the right tag."

Ask me anything.,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1aesn1/moved_to_a_new_country_leaving_everything_behind/,"Dropping everything for love. That is what I did. I used to have everything a young woman would dream of, awesome job, a car, a house, supportive family and amazing friends. Distance relationships don't work for me, so after 6 months of suffering, being far away from the guy I love, I decided not to break my heart anymore and move to Sweden. If only I knew what I was getting into! No, I don't say that I regret it, not at all. But it has been toughest 2 years of my life (even-though I studied at the university for so many years and worked 8 hours a day at the same time). First I was satisfied with my decision, then I started feeling isolated, no friends, no family, don't know the language, can't communicate. The only person I met was my boyfriend. Long and dark winters did not help me assimilate, bringing me depression after depression. Finding job seemed impossible in my professional area, because everyone seemed to need someone who speaks Swedish. So, I went to language courses (which are thankfully free), brought my language level to strong intermediate in almost 2 years. After so much effort to learn a new language, their excuse is that I do not have work experience in Sweden, that is why I need to go on internship, without no pay, to begin somewhere. Which is also very hard to find, since I'd like to work for a company where I could learn something new too, for this not to be complete waste of time, when I could be spamming companies with my CV.
With two bachelor diplomas, one Masters diploma, fluent knowledge of 4 languages + intermediate Swedish and about 6 years of work experience, here I am, unemployed and struggling to assimilate, to be accepted and to find a job. It is hard to find a job, even if your standards are lowered as much as possible and you have so much you reached in your life (for example, my life spent at universities).
Pressure is really big sometimes and these two last years were full of disappointments. But I do believe that I will find that job where I will be able to show what I know and that I can be a valuable member of a team.
I guess I am hopeless romantic, in love and in my dreams for the better future. 
You can ask me anything about my experiences of moving to a new country, without anything but some savings and loving support of those who wish me luck."

The meeting was to get career advice and resume feedback.  In the interview I mentioned that I would like to apply for an internship at the company.  I was asked what type of development I was interested in and I said iOS development is what I have found most enjoyable.  He said he would send me a code test to take, so I could show them some of my work.  

I received the code test and its far more advanced than anything I've ever done and I've been out of practice with Objective-C for a year now.  The test is basically to develop a full fledge app.  I've found a tutorial that is very relavent to the app and I'm wonder if it is okay to use the tutorial as a resource.

Also, if I do use it should I tell them that I used it as a resource?

I'd say I feel a little better (having ideas again, less apathetic, only slightly more talkative), but life in general still seems pretty shitty.
1. Pretty much gave up on my social life under the pretense of focusing on school and work. I say pretense because I'm still failing everything. I spend all day and all night in front of a computer screen, filling out applications for internships or study abroad programs or chiseling away at a mountainous workload, but when the exams come, I bomb. And then all the application processes seem worthless because in the end, I'll end up not being able to pay the deposit and they'll give my spot to someone else. Why does all this work yield no positive results?
2. My checks are literally four times the size they were in January, but it feels hollow because I'm too scared to spend the money on anything (What if I need it for something else? I don't really NEED that, I just want it. Can I really justify spending that much money on a whim? What if my hours change and I go back to what I used to make? I'll feel like I wasted the surplus that I had!) And so I work nights and weekends and miss parties and have all my friends ask ""Why don't I see you anymore?"" and then eventually stop talking to me altogether.
Why do I do all this?
3. I can't get a girl to so much as look me in the eye, let alone hold a conversation with me. I feel like I bore the living shit out everyone who knows me, and my presence is just kinda tolerated in the circles I stay with because they know me from before I was all shitty like this. I can't stand when Firday comes because I know it's the beginning of a long weekend of having nothing to say to anyone until I can finally get up and say ""Sorry, I gotta go to work. You guys have fun."" Why am I so terrible??

Sorry to dump all this on the board, I realize this is gonna be TL;DR for a lot of you, but NoFap was kinda like my nexus for life improvement when I started it, so I figured maybe somebody could clue me in on any elements of NoFap I might be neglecting. Anybody else experience a three-weeks-in SuperFunk??"

I'm a senior in college with literally 2 months until I graduate.  I have an internship doing what I love and I've held it for 4 years.  I have a loving family and every member would gladly do anything for me, especially my father.  Yet, on the inside, I cannot find happiness.  While there are stretches when I am happy, when I'm with friends or family, the feeling is fleeting and afterward I find myself sad and alone. 

During my first 2 years of college I was on depression medication.  That helped, but didn't fully solve the problem.  After my doctor said I could wean myself off of the meds, I did.  It went well for a year, but this year I find myself in a deep, dark, sad hole.  Alone.  I know that my friends would do anything for me, they are there for me, but I do not want to burden them with my sadness for I feel it would take away from their happiness. 

I write this message as I sit at a friend's house during my spring break, a time in which I should be completely at peace.  I cannot, however, find that peace.  When I go out with friends I am happy, but as soon as it ends I feel dark and alone. Even though in less than 10 hours I will be awake and with them again.

I can't find the point in trying to be happy, as the happiness inevitably comes to an end and launches me deeper into darkness.  The girl I love barely knows what I feel (which I think is for the better considering I have only 2 months left in the town with her) and I continue to hide what I feel for, what I think, is the benefit for everyone.  

I just don't know what to do anymore."

I've been dealing with anxiety and depression all through school, so I never got the full college experience; I never went to any parties or events, I never made any friends, I never volunteered for any internships or projects (I'm a film major) because it made me way too scared and anxious (I even used to throw up every day before my screenwriting workshop class.) The fact that I just /couldn't/ do a lot of my work also caused me a lot of grief. The only reason I held on was because I promised my mom -who didn't finish high school- that I would graduate for her. But now I feel that once I do that, there really won't be anything left for me. I know I won't ever get a film job because I'm not ambitious or outgoing enough to pursue it, and I don't want to spend the rest of my life working somewhere I'll hate. Hell, even if I did get my dream job, I don't want to spend the rest of my life just hating myself. I don't see myself ever being happy. I think about killing myself a lot, even if I don't think I would do it.

I was planning on just dropping the class and taking it over the summer but I read that both teachers are horrible. I feel like I would waste more time taking the risk of not getting a high grade
with teachers who can't teach. 

I'm thinking of just trying my hardest and hopefully getting a C in the class. I will then take Intermediate 2 over the summer just in case I end up doing bad on it and then having the chance to take it
Fall 2013. 

Any input is appreciated. "
1ae4h6,7,2013-03-15,Role of finances in admissions decisions,[deleted],gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/1ae4h6/role_of_finances_in_admissions_decisions/,"As much as I'd like to believe things like personal finances don't play at role at private institutions, does anyone know whether or not admissions committees will base decisions off of your financial ability to pay for the program without funding?

The case:
Both me and my friend/employee applied to Columbia Journalism. She was accepted and I was wait-listed. Not trying to sound like sour grapes, but here's the thing:

1) My GPA is 3.8, hers is 3.0
2) I'm her boss. We've both worked at the same institution for a while, but her background was in arts reporting, mine was in news reporting (which is what Columbia's program is)
3) Other experience. Her experience in the industry only extends to the institution we both work at. I have other work experience, including one top internship in the country. 
4) Essays. I saw her essay she submitted after it went in and there were three spelling mistakes in the application.
5) Recommendations. Objectively speaking, mine were from top media professionals in the nations, she had a university lecturer (not a prof) and one of her unemployed friends. Additionally, all three were late.

So, now I sound like I'm trying to come up with a list of subjective reasons why my stats were better—but we both also got into another grad school together that looks at merit, and no financial need information was filled out. I got 100% funding, she received 30% funding. I also received 100% funding (the only one in a program of 80) at another institution where I didn't have to fill out any financial info. 

With Columbia, you have to state all your finances, including how much your parents will contribute. I come from a lower middle class background, whereas she comes from a lower upper class background—her parents were willing to pay for her to go there and she would have had to fill that out.

So, in conclusion, I'm a bit miffed? Do these institutions highly factor in your finances when making admission decisions? "

I switched to math with a CS minor last year from a social science major, so I've been working my butt off trying to catch up.

Right now I have already taken Computer Science I (intro Java course), one discrete math for CS course, and I'm currently in Computer Science II (Java with intro to data structures). My planned CS courses for the next two semesters include: Computer Science III (software engineering), Introduction to the Theory of Computation, Artificial Intelligence, Analysis of Algorithms and more if my schedule allows it.

My main question is what can I do this summer to add to my knowledge and employability as a programmer? I am planning on working through CLRS and learning Haskell because I want to learn a functional programming language. I really would like to work on a concrete project in Java that can be added to my resume, but I'm not sure what a good option would be. I'm not particularly interested in one thing or another. For example, I have friends who already have good ideas for apps or games they would like to build; I don't have any good ideas for anything concrete like that. **Does anyone have any suggestions on a project that would be relevant to my strong math background?** I have done lots of little card games and small assignments like that, but I really want to find a bigger project I can work on that will be challenging. If my math interests are relevant, I really like combinatorics, linear algebra and real analysis.

As for my careers goals, I would like to work at the NSA or at least get an internship there, but I don't know how plausible that is since it seems like they only want the best of the best. I have heard that having a strong math background is good for programming careers in the financial industry but I haven't really looked into that at all.

**Background:** I'm a senior majoring in chemical engineering and decided to pursue medical school at the beginning of junior year (did a biomed co-op that exposed me to the medical field and sparked my interest) and I'm planning on applying this upcoming cycle.

Anyways by the time I confirmed that I really wanted to pursue medicine and got some research, shadowing and clinical volunteering under my belt, it was summer of 2012 (between junior and senior year) and the MCAT was the last hurdle left.

I signed up to take it Sept 2012 and started studying mid June. I took a diagnostic (AAMC #3) when I started and scored a 21. Unfortunately, coming from an engineering background, I had to teach myself a lot of the biology content and ochem since I forgot most of it. Content review took longer than I expected and I was not ready for the Sept. test at all so I postponed it to January 23, 2013. 

I promised myself to try and study regularly during fall semester but that was difficult to do with a full course load in engineering. In a flash, the semester was over and I had done minimal practice. I took another full length at the beginning of December and scored a 23. I decided to sign up with Kaplan's winter break 4-5 week course. I felt like I needed to follow a rigorous schedule to get me back on track. Following Kaplan's schedule, a week before my scheduled MCAT, I took another full length and scored a 26. 

Once again, I decided to postpone the MCAT to April 4th. I cut my course load for the semester in half so I could really focus on the MCAT - I was determined to get a 30+ in April. This whole semester, I've been studying for the MCAT everyday and utilizing a variety of study material: Kaplan's online material (Qbank, section tests, etc..), EK 1001 and 101 verbal, BR passages, TPR Hyperlearning questions, Khan academy,  and mcat-review.

I've tried everything, yet I'm still scoring below a 30. My latest full length was today and I scored a 27. My MCAT test date is in 2 weeks and I'm starting to freak out. I really don't know what to do anymore. This test has beaten me to the ground and shattered all my confidence.  After each full length, I completely lose all my motivation and want to throw in the towel. 

I've got a stellar application otherwise. Really good LORs, unique experiences and EC's, OK GPA (3.5 cGPA and 3.7sGPA), research, shadowing, clinical and non-clinical volunteering, co-ops and internships, etc... The only thing standing in my way is the MCAT. 

Sorry for the wall of text, I haven't talked to anyone about this and it's been building up inside me for a while. "

Definition
: You need to define this particular profession. This can include a general
description and then the classification of various specialties and what they entail (for
instance, the law profession can be divided in to criminal law, corporate law, family law,
etc.). You can discuss the public perception of this profession and/or the value of this
profession to the larger community. At the end of this section, you will need to identify
the specific area on which you will be focussing and why.
!

Preparation
: This section will involve finding out what you can do, starting now as
a high school student, to prepare for entering the work world. This should include high
school coursework that could benefit you, potential job or service experiences, and
aptitude traits. You will need to find out what kind of college or training program you
would need to take, including descriptions of specific courses, internships, and licenses/
certificates needed. You can discuss which schools around the US are known for their
special programs and you must compare and contrast two or more well-regarded
programs. In researching this section, you will need to contact someone in the
appropriate department at the university level to answer your questions and point you to
the appropriate materials and applications you would need to pursue this course of
study.
!

Entry-level
: For this section, you need to find out what you need to do to get
started in this profession. How do you get hired? What will make the difference between
two people who are interviewing for the same position? What are they looking for? As
an entry-level professional, what can you expect to be your responsibilities, limitations,
and compensation? What would a day-in-the-life of an entry level position involve? How
long do you have to “pay your dues” at this level before you can begin to advance? A
good resource for this section may be someone in human resources with the kind of
company/organization you are interested in.
!

Advancement
: The last section of the paper should describe the various stages
through which you pass as you advance in your profession. How do you get to be the
CEO of a corporation, or the lead partner in a law firm? What are the most prestigious
positions you can hold in the profession you have chosen? What are the average and
potential maximum earning levels? How many who enter the profession will actually
achieve those levels? What kind of person achieves that level? What sacrifices have to
be made? What kind of ongoing training/education do you have to get? What kinds of
professional organizations can you be involved in? What are some of the options/
consequences of changing jobs within the profession? How or why could you lose your
job? What ethics are involved in succeeding in this profession? For this section, you
need to interview at least one (preferably more than one to get a broader perspective)
mature professional about their experiences.

If someone can find multiple websites that have this information, it would really help me out."

I graduated back in Fall of 2009. I've only had a few phone interviews over the past 3 years, and haven't had anything lately. This is the latest iteration of my resume.

Some thoughts and concerns:

* My GPA was 2.485. I've never put it on any of my resumes. However, I did go to a tough school. I'm afraid that the number will jump out more than the school's name though. I have a feeling that a 4.0 from a local tiny school will beat out a 2.49 from a world-ranked university. Am I wrong? Should I give it a shot and throw the GPA on there?
* I did manage to get some solid experience from the few transportation classes I was able to take, and did well in them. I hope that I'm drawing enough attention to my results and experiences with those classes. Certainly not comparable to an actual job or internship, but better than nothing and it's the best I've got.
* There used to be room to fit the two most recent positions I've held, but now I can only fit one while keeping the resume to a single page. However, I've found it easier to draw from experiences in that later job than my most recent one, when it comes to answering interview questions. What else should I cut to make room for that later job? Or should I just cut that later job and mention it in an interview if it comes up?
* The biggest issue for me is that I don't look good on paper. I'm a nice guy, I work well with others, I work hard, and I get the job done. No one's regretted hiring me, it's just a matter of getting them to take that chance. Are there ways I can get that message across in my resume without making it sound fluffy and non-concrete?

Virginia Commonwealth univ- where I had always pictured myself, Richmond is nice, I'm considering their new homeland security and emergency preparedness program
George Mason univ- campus has always bugged me, but proximity to DC makes me hopeful for good internships

College of Charleston- I'm concerned that it may be small for me,but it is the most beautiful college I applied and I am in love with the town. 
LSU- to be honest i'm not sure why I applied there. I was always amazed at the amount of the passion that the students have for their school.
Georgia State- applied because I Like Atlanta. I would rather attend a grad program there than my first four years.

Lately my university has become fuck full of them, and I am going to spread the word as much as I can. 

Yesterday I was asked by a classmate to come and check out a networking even where I could talk with business professionals hopefully get some internships. Woke up at 7AM, got dressed, attend meeting. Drove over 20 miles and I got...just a HUGE disappointment. 5 minutes into the ""networking event"" and I realized it for what it was; multi-level marketing. 7 hrs fucking wasted.

I understand multi-level marketing is completely legal from pyramid schemes, since there IS a transaction of goods and money between the ""associates"" or ""advisors"" etc. bullshit. The problem is the people who buy these products or services are left with jack and less than 1% actually succeed. And no, this is not from the people who quit early or anything; the problem is because it is extremely difficult to actually sell the product or service. 

I have been dragged by ""friends""(now they are ex-friends) to go to these damn meetings and I'm sick and tired of them. Smart people are getting conned into this failing business model and it needs to stop. These types of things SABOTAGE RELATIONSHIPS.

Every single time I attend these events, I immediately get suspicious with any recruiting mentioning. They always maintain a master group psychology; making everyone feel comfortable and complementing how you dress, speak, and how unsuccessful you've been in life so far. After trying to convince people that they are not making as much money as they should and that ""THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY OF A LIFETIME"", ""OWN YOUR OWN BUSINESS"", or ""IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE"" they always ALWAYS talk about how fast your income will increase. They then show luxury products and lifestyles of the people who are supposedly in the business. After that they usually get a 23-28 year old pitch a sob story about how they were poor and never had anything in life, and that by joining the team they became wealthy, successful, and independent. This then afterwards is concluded with people aggressively asked to sign contracts and pay up front fees in order to obtain a license or package to become these ""associates"" or ""advisors."" They do not even ask for resumes or work experience; only for your money. They are promised by recruiting others and them recruiting others as well the system cannot fail. IT NEVER FAILS THAT EVERY PRESENTATION IS LIKE THIS AT THESE TYPE OF MEETINGS.

If ANYONE attempts to speak out, it is almost certain that the person will immediately be vilified. If they speak out against this ""successful"" person who has made millions of dollars, that person would be shunned and criticized by people, getting shit like ""Who the fuck are you to speak out?"" People are too afraid to speak out against these people, because such pressure by nice people causes them to succumb and stay silent. This sadly ends with a majority of people signing up to these bullshit marketing models blinded by their greed. It absolutely breaks my heart to see good people believe in such nonsense and false promises, and I wish to see this stop.

**NOW THE QUESTION IS HOW DO I SPEAK OUT AGAINST THE SPEAKER AT THESE RIDICULOUS MEETINGS, WHEN THE GROUP PSYCHOLOGY AND CLOUDED JUDGEMENT OF PEOPLE PREVENT ME FROM DOING SO WITHOUT BEING VILIFIED?**

1ahj5l,0,2013-03-17,"Since I matched and have nothing else to do, anyone else hate our current generation of trainees?  Let's talk about it.",[deleted],medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1ahj5l/since_i_matched_and_have_nothing_else_to_do/,"So now that Match Day and St. Patty's are over, I finally let myself go back on SDN to start fantasizing about how wonderfully miserable I'm going to be in residency (WTF is wrong with me) and stumbled upon this interesting thread titled [""Quitting Surgery""](http://forums.studentdoctor.net/showthread.php?t=888841) with this gem of a post that I think applies to all of medicine, and life in general (emphasis mine):

&gt;No one enjoys every aspect of residency. Surgical training is hard, and sometimes unpleasant. Getting yelled at occasionally is par for the course. If your surgical training is not extremely humbling then chances are you are not being trained well.

&gt;I completed very rigorous training for my residency, and my fellowship. Sometimes I was unhappy, but that was unimportant to me at the time because I looked at the big picture. I was happy to have the opportunity to train where I did because I was trained by outstanding surgeons in high-volume environments. I accepted that the path to becoming very well-trained was rocky at times.

&gt;I have been in practice for a short time, and am happier than I have ever been. I am busy, but not stressed. I am well-paid, and have more free time than most lawyers, engineers, investment bankers, etc. I am excited about my profession, and am respected for my abilities by my peers and my patients alike. I know how to work up my patients, plan their operations, take care of complications, make decisions easily and quickly, and in short be a good surgeon. This ability was acquired through years of extremely hard work, sacrifice, and at times emotional turmoil. But, it was worth every second, and now I am reaping the rewards of my hard work and the efforts of my surgical teachers. I am still learning every day, and I love it.

&gt;**I think in the era of 80 hours, no overnight call for interns, and the overall generation Y sense of having everything on your own terms, many folks are unwilling to train on others' terms. They want to constantly be told that they are a great resident, that in faculty meetings no one says anything bad about you, that you are great at this or that, or whatever. I can think of two or three times in residency and fellowship when I was told positive things, and countless times when I was told of my shortcomings. I liked it that way since I always was looking for ways to improve. I never worried about whether my attendings thought I was ""strong"" or not. The mentality of my training programs was, ""if you f\*\*\* up we will let you know, otherwise just keep busting your behind"". No cookies or gold stars.**

&gt;You have to step outside of your current frame of mind, and decide what you want out of your life. Have you ever asked yourself what you want to become, how hard you are willing to work to achieve it, and answered yourself honestly? Until you do that, you will be a wanderer, always asking others for validation or advice. It's your life, and everyone else are just bit players. It is really very simple. Decide what you want to do, and then do it. But, also be prepared for a rocky path no matter what you want to do. Nothing worthwhile is easy.

I know all of you have peers/classmates who are, for lack of a better description, fucking lazy.  They're in medicine because of their families' expectations, because they're going inherit a practice, or just because they're Asian/brown.  Their rank list was based on ""best club scene"" and how easy it is to request time off.  After meeting their new PD minutes after opening their envelope, they ask their new boss when they can start planning their vacation days.  They matched EM or anesthesia if they had decent Step scores; PM&amp;R and psych if they didn't.  Not only did they do EM, they only applied to 3-year programs because 4 was too much.  They're doing medicine to get into allergy or sports.  The derm guy marries the pain girl.

We've always had ROAD specialties and there's nothing inherently wrong with wanting an easier life and more money (duh) and the old-school guys *really* had it made, but I just can't stand to work with these people.  Look at those anesthesia prelims try to run a surgical service.  I have literally never been closer to killing someone than when I had to work with them.  Or your fellow student who just never shows up or is daydreaming in the cafeteria because they don't need any honors to match psych.

What happened to work ethic?  Pride in yourself and your work?  Wanting to be the best doctor you can be?  Maybe I'm just a naive idiot student who's about to have his shit kicked in, and I am by no means a perfect gunner or anything close to that, but I really believe in the whole ""medicine is a calling not a job"" line.  I could just be stroking my own dick because I want to be an asshole egotistical surgeon but I was raised to work hard and not fucking complain.  Now that I actually found my calling, I can simultaneously see how lucky I was to have awesome parents and how awful it is when people don't share your level of expectation.  Maybe I'm just bitter and hate myself and want everyone else to be as miserable as I am.

**TL;DR: I'm awesome, ""kids these days"" are useless lazy fucks, the old days were best... I'm hungover and bored, let's argue.**"

Fellow Ent and [Caustic Soda](http://www.causticsodapodcast.com/) host Joe here. This coming weekend we'll be recording our ""Marijuana"" episode, and I'm hoping that some of you can assist with our research.

Each week we cover a different topic, focusing on the weird/gross/disturbing aspects of it. As we Ents know almost all things like that with regard to trees are because of prohibition, and that's where you come in.

Give me the worst trees and trees-prohibition stories you know about. The horrible effects on families, the innocent people killed, the lives ruined because of marijuana prohibition. The worst and most disturbing you know of. We're all scouring the Internet and elsewhere ourselves, and we also have some wonderful (unpaid, as are we so far) research interns helping us out but if there's one place that knows about the effects of the drug war it's here.

We'll also talk about the medicinal benefits, and how hard it has been for people to get access because of the current laws.

Our show is typically presented as Background, Science, and History in the first half, and then News and Pop Culture aspects in the second half.

Please cite your stories -- links to reputable news articles or published papers are best. We don't want to repeat hearsay! If you have a particularly impressive personal story you can certainly cite yourself, but we really can't use ""I heard from someone that...""

We'll provide research credit to anyone who wishes it -- ""This story is from ________. In November, 1983..."" Please let me know what attribution you'd prefer -- username, real name, first name, ""an Ent on /r/trees"" -- whatever you like.

Pop culture research has been pretty easy so far. There are plenty of stoner flicks out there, and a lot recently on prohibition. I've already (re)watched Super High Me, and followed that up with the *absolutely terrible* [Evil Bong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_Bong/). I've got a lot more to watch/rewatch like The Union, and ""Grass"", as well as some more fun stoner comedies. And then I'm going to hurt myself and watch the *two* Evil Bong sequels. Ugh, how did that get one sequel, much less two?

We record this coming Saturday, and then take time to edit. The plan is to have it go online on April 14th so it will have been available for nearly a full week when 4/20 happens.

Check out our [previous episodes](http://www.causticsodapodcast.com/). They're all available online, in iTunes and several other aggreators completely free. We're now in our fourth year, have a great group of fans (Soda Jerks!) and getting more and more every week. This episode is one I'm very personally excited about! Help me make it even better!"

This week is my (and the rest of the ""intern class"" of 7) evaluation and I'm both nervous and excited.  We haven't had much feedback so I'm really looking forward to the opportunity.  

Anyways, the firm typically hires 2 or the interns full time afterwards.  During the evaluation, how can I best convey my desires to work full time.  I've loved the stressful environment, constant workload, pressure, juggling multiple projects at once, etc, however I'm concerned that being the only intern part time (everyone else has graduated college already although only 1 is going for her MST and no one has really started the process of CPA testing) may leave a negative impression and show that I'm not dedicated.  I plan on bringing this up in the meeting and ensuring them that working 36 hours a week ""part-time"" over 3.5 days is all I can muster with school.  

Anyways, other than this, does anyone have any suggestions on important things to possibly discuss or bring up that would increase my chances of attaining a full time position?"
1ahd57,1,2013-03-17,Question about class action eligibility,drhmd124,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1ahd57/question_about_class_action_eligibility/,"Ok, this is a really long and complicated situation, so I'll try and pare down the details as best I can. Long and short of it, my girlfriend is getting a graduate-level degree and was told at the beginning it would take five years. Now, the university is claiming that she needs to take a sixth year. She goes to a for-profit university, so to her and her cohort, this seems like a bold-faced money grab. 

Just to give everyone an understanding of the situation, for a degree in clinical psychology, you do five years of schooling in which the fifth year is an internship. Internship is extremely competitive, and requires around 400 total hours of supervised therapy, which are attained through supervised practicums (internships, essentially).

Here's the breakdown of events:

*  Cohort applies for Masters in Psychology. Told that during 2nd semester 2nd year, they can apply for PsyD and be finished in five years, total (the same as those who applied for PsyD from the outset)
* Cohort begins classes and begins taking two masters-level practicums (pracs not observed by a Ph.D/PsyD). 
* Unbeknownst to the cohort, the practicums they're taking are not PsyD-level pracs, and as such are inadmissible for internship consideration. This was not explained to the cohort from the outset. 
* Midway through the cohort's third year, they are told that in order to be competitive for internship, they must take a fifth year practicum (meaning that now instead of four years of classes, they have five, THEN an internship). Furthermore, they are told that they will be evaluated by the school as to whether or not they are allowed to apply for internship (because apparently the school is concerned about a negative affect on their internship placement statistics)

TL;DR School says cohort will be done in five years. Announce midway through the five years that it will actually take six. Cohort forced to take another year's worth of loans, lose wages, etc. Unequivocal claim throughout cohort that they were told program would take five years. Strong possibility of documentation to corroborate claims as well (this is the initial enquiry into things, so little has been done on our end so far).

Thanks for the help!"

1ah052,0,2013-03-17,"Day 23 of my first try, thoughts and observations:",[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1ah052/day_23_of_my_first_try_thoughts_and_observations/,"I’m a 22 yo male and I’ve been doing NoFap/NoPMO for 23 days now. It’s my first try, and I’m doing it because I believe I have a porn-induced ED. I’m seeing a girl at the time, and I would like to be able to have sex with her. The last two years I have been struggling with depressions and my self-esteem has gotten worse. This has led to a more excessive porn-use(although I have been fapping to porn frequently since I was 15 - that was when we got high-speed-internet at home). When I found out about YBOP and this subreddit, it was like a revelation for me!! It all started to make sense, and I decided I had to give it a try because I really believe this project will help me with getting able to give girls a good time again.

The first days I was extremely motivated, and I spent a lot of time thinking about how much porn had fucked up my brain. For instance it became clear to me how I often associate normal things/objects with things I had seen in a porn scene and in the next moment my brain would go crazy and make me crave porn. Another thing that got some clarity was how bad I actually was reducing girls to being nothing less than sexual objects. Around day 4-5 the craving got really bad. Especially after hanging out with my girl cuddling and kissing but not being able to get my dick to work properly – getting home made me crave heavily. This was also a thing that made me see how fucked up my brain is at the time: I thought if she would be here right now I would fuck her brains out, but I realized how unrealistic these thoughts were. I had just been over at her flat for hours and been able to get hard enough for penetration!! Wtf???!!! I also had moments when I just had to get away from my desk so I wouldn’t relapse. I also avoided cravings just by getting out of the house – walking. Because I have a heart disease at the time, I haven’t been able to go running, or to hit the gym pumping that iron like the Governor back in the days. Can’t wait to get back there - at some days my energy levels have been sky-high. I’ve also noticed that some good tunes have helped me when the craving has been bad, and I have tried some creative things like writing or drawing. It has helped me with expressing my emotions, and getting more clarity.

Over the past 23 days I have also been having sporadic wet dreams, like most people here.

Around day 7 I think I hit the flatline. I felt like I had no libido at all, and cravings were down to a minimum compared to the last days. The next two weeks there was absolutely no sign at all that my penis was even close to being alive. It sometimes felt like I had lost it, and it got smaller – like when it’s cold outside. I tried to keep the touching down to a minimum. From day 10 on I was out of town for an internship. I hooked up with a girl and went to her place, but I couldn’t think of anything else than sleeping – even though I was lying in her bed with her. I have to say that she was not the prettiest, but I don’t think I would have given a fuck if my sex-drive was normal.

Day 20-23 I had erections when I woke up in the morning. Two of them were 80% and one was a 100%-Hallelujah-erection! Omfg it felt like someone was contacting me from outer space! My sex-drive has not been any stronger though. I don’t know yet, if this project is gonna help me with getting rid of my ED, but I really believe so!! I am noticing that there is stuff going on (the wet dreams, the zero sex-drive), and I would say that my emotional state has changed in a positive direction as well. I’m still having some ups and downs, but in general I feel a bit better at the time. I can’t say that I believe NoFap/NoPMO is the only reason for these changes, but it feels like it has some kind of a key role. All these things motivate me even more to keep going, and I hope all of you will do as well! When we are done with this shit the girls won’t know what just hit them!! Stay strong fellow fapstronauts!!!

This fall I fell into a pretty deep depression for a variety of reasons.  An unfortunate coincidence was that I happened to move home at the same time and had to be sober.  This semester, I moved out on my own again, and between just living life and some self-medication with trees, I was happy and had pulled myself almost completely out of the hole I was in.

Last week, however, I learned that what I am doing this semester will not get me where I thought it would in terms of my career path, and that I may find myself just as lonely and unemployed at the end of this semester as I was last semester.  As a result, I started to slide back down the rabbit hole.  A quick trip home over spring break only served to further that feeling as I couldn't bring myself to tell my parents the truth about my predicament.  

Usually, I would smoke to reach some inner peace and clear my head.  I don't view it as running away from my problems but just a way of clearing my mind of the stress and worries so that I can approach my problems on an even keel.  This time, however, I am slammed at my internship with projects and I need to get on top of them because if I fuck this up, I'm really screwed.  I know this, and yet I procrastinate (see me posting here instead of doing work).  All of that pressure is piling on top of my depression and pushing me further down, but I feel like I can't smoke because I have so many responsibilities I need to attend to, including things that I have yet to complete for tomorrow.

I know I need to finish these projects.  I just feel like I'm completely off my center.  Weed usually helps take me back there, but I don't think weed is a good idea right now since I have critical deadlines coming up this week including uncompleted work that is needed tomorrow.  Really, I just feel lost.

Should I toke up, which will affect my work but hopefully help bring me back on a road to inner peace, or should I remain sober for this period, so that I can focus on my work?"

The advice my family offers, while appreciated isn't the best due to vested interests and generally them being a family, supportive of what I do regardless, so I'm turning to a group of strangers who can give honest advice without fear of reprisal.

I have two options laid out in front of me:

1 - Return to University to complete my Journalism Diploma in the hope I can find a career as a Journalist. This will be a 6 month course that will cost me, including living costs, rent etc. about £5,000 ($7,500). At the end of it I won't have a job, but will be qualified to be a proper Journalist. I have already completed a 3 month internship at a big local news outlet so have a respectable portfolio for someone my age (21). I've also been writing regularly for a website, with articles getting 30,000-40,000 views each week. All in all I have quite a bit of relevant experience which I believe would give me some advantage over others applying for journalism work. That being said, Journalism is extremely competitive, and print-media is circling the drain on a local level, making jobs very hard to get. Starting salaries for Journalists here are around £15,000 ($22,600). I haven't dreamed of journalism all my life, it only came to me in the last 8 months when I was offered the aforementioned internship, but it is rather fun, challenging and seeing your name in print is extremely rewarding.

2 - Take a job doing bookings and logistics for a big European shipping company. This isn't the most exciting work but I can start the job in 1 month with a starting salary of £20,000 ($30,100) a year. The company is based all over Europe and offers many training schemes and business opportunities for travel if you show aptitude. Taking this job would mean I could afford to move out of home and rent my own place, and most important means I will be earning within a few months, as opposed to potentially being a few more years of unemployment as a Journalist. The job doesn't sound particularly exciting, but the hours and good and it has a huge practicality bonus of me being earning almost straight away. It's a foot on the corporate ladder that should offer opportunities in the future for promotion and travel if I work hard enough, I hope.

So the issue is the practicality of employment and higher money vs doing a job I would enjoy more, if I somehow manage to find employment in that sector.

I'm about to start my permanent sub position. I'm not new to the school; I did two 72 hour internships and my 15 week student teaching there. This is going to be my first teaching job! I'm nervous and excited. I'm nervous that the students wont respect me at first. I also feel pressured to do extremely well because I take over before state testing. I don't want my students to perform poorly. 



Any advice would be awesome. How do I set the tone of mutual respect on the first day? How do I prepare for taking over in the middle of the year? Help!"

I'm a recent grad who is looking for an entry-level system, network, or database administration position in the Philadelphia, PA area.

I have two summers of internship at a local Fortune 100 company. I worked with the team responsible for maintaining the internally and externally hosted web applications for the company.

I have experience with:

* Windows Server 2003/08 (software installation/upgrade, documentation, builds, PowerShell scripting, etc.)
* IIS 6/7 (troubleshooting, configuring sites, etc.)
* RHEL (LAMP configuration, installing/configuring CMSs and MySQL databases)

I haven't been able to find anything since graduation and figured I'd give it a shot here.

I'm not looking to re-locate at this time, and I'd prefer something in the northern suburbs of Philadelphia, but I'd be open to hearing about anything at this point.

If you'd like more information, please send me a PM and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

Thanks!"
1ago2v,1,2013-03-17,25 [F4M] NJ - Want to talk (and maybe do something) about my lacking husband,[deleted],r4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1ago2v/25_f4m_nj_want_to_talk_and_maybe_do_something/,"Throwaway account here - I'm a 25 yr old female who has been with my current husband for one year and dated before that for 4.  We both went to the same college and back then I think we were made for each other because we were both awkward and sort of trying to figure out life.  I was more studious and cared about working hard, while he was more lazy and really just spent all day in front of a tv or computer.  And after we graduated, I got an amazing job, took better care of myself, got in shape and became more social; he on the other hand didn't change at all.


I guess I should've noticed the differences between us in the beginning... but in general his submissiveness with life is what makes me think he's lacking.  He has no real goals and has had the same internship for 3 years now - doesn't even get paid.  Watching him with his guy ""friends"", you can tell they keep him around to make fun of him, and it always requires me to stand up for him.  Not to mention that he has all these insecurities about his weight gain since college and how short he is, especially when I wear heels (and I'm only 5'6).  It's gotten so bad that I've stopped defending and have a laugh whenever he's ashamed or uncomfortable.


I've had all kinds of advice, from one of my friends telling me to just get a divorce, to one saying that I should stop complaining, to one (my sassy gay friend) blurting out that I should cuckold him (which to be honest doesn't even sound like a horrible idea to me...).  And they all use the same word to describe him: wimp.  I know there must be guys out there who have their lives together and can talk me through this."

i'm a 21 year old college junior (girl). studying astronomy. on a scholarship funded by NASA. i have a great internship in my field right now and will be applying to grad school soon. i have a number of friends, an active social life, and am reasonably attractive. from the outside it seems like i have my shit together. but i dont. 

i met a boy (a grad student in my dept) last summer and we started casually seeing each other. from there, my whole life fell apart. he treats me like garbage one second and like his girlfriend the next. i'll stay over at his house once a week and we'll cook dinner together and be all lovey-dovey; the next day he'll act like i dont exist and not answer texts for 20 full hours. this has been going on for 8 months.

i cant focus, i feel like shit all the time--my grades plummeted--i had a 3.8 gpa prior to this year, but now i will be lucky to get a 2.0 in ANY of my classes this quarter. because of that, i'm probably going to lose my scholarship. 

i recently found out from a mutual friend who didnt know our situation that this guy has been seeing at least 2 other girls for who knows how long. since we aren't officially boyfriend-girlfriend, i cant even be mad at him. now the depression has multiplied 100 fold. since i found out i cant stop thinking about how my life has turned into a total mess and i essentially threw away my future for this guy who thinks i am completely worthless. and yet i'm hopelessly in love with him.

my close friends are tired of hearing about this guy and the surrounding issues because they all told me to kick him to the curb months ago. they were right but for some reason i *can't.* i have to leave class in the middle sometimes to go cry in the bathroom and i cried so hard last night that i threw up. 

**i dont know wtf is wrong with me** since i have a great family, amazing best friend/roommate, and the only other relationships i have had (2) were both long-term, very healthy and loving, and i'm still friends with both guys, so its not like i have any concrete reason for emotional baggage. but all i can think about lately is how hopeless my future is looking, how much i fucked it up, and how this guy who i'm crazy about has been dating and fucking other girls all this time. i cant stop thinking about how nice it would be to just have everything go away and its scaring me. ive tried counting my blessings and thinking of my family **but i just cant shake it.**

please give me advice or talk to me or something please"

1aggbz,0,2013-03-17,Invest in us.,[deleted],RealEstate,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1aggbz/invest_in_us/,"Hello to you,

My gf and I are saving to buy a home in Peoria, Illinois. I have recently found a condo for sale that is in foreclosure for $27,000. We are looking for an investor to help us buy this house in a peer to peer loann format.

We've been working with a financial adviser here in town for some months now. The snag is that we only qualify for an FHA loan with a cosigner. Totally fine, I have a parent who is willing to cosign with us. This condo, however, is not FHA approved. So, I want to expand our opportunities for buying a home at a great price by searching for an independent, peer to peer, loaner.

The condo is $27,000. And we have saved a %10 downpayment so far. If we can agree on an interest rate, for example, of 3.5% over 20 years (for example) you stand to profit $18900.

Basically, the reason we need the help is I've got the good credit but she's got the income. And she has no credit to cosign with me. Making it through college on full scholarships left her debtless but also creditless. A double-edged sword. I'm self-employed and working on growing a small business. She has a full-time income that is reliable and an education that will pay off even more once she's done with her internship.

We are working on building her credit by using a secured credit card. In the coming years we will be able to get a mortgage for the full price of the condo and pay you off in full. Sure, we can wait it out and get a loan for a house in a year or so. But this is a great opportunity to buy low and watch our investment appreciate. We'd love to seize the day!

Thank you for your time Mr/Mrs Investor. "

I gave it some time (a month or so) and the feelings are still there. I still care about my current girlfriend but I don't feel the same as I used to. 

However, I am afraid to take the leap and move on, but I feel like I will be trapped if I don't. I have mulled the situation over for weeks, but I am afraid of hurting anyone. Please advise. If anyone was wondering, I'm 21/M.

This is a throwaway because the boy is Redditor and hates when I post on this sub so I'll probably delete this post in the morning so there is no chance he sees it. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half. He graduated from college last May with a double major in two different fields of engineering from a top engineering school. He got a good 62k a year job straight away and moved out of state for it and we broke up because we didn't want to do long distance. Two weeks later he quits his job on a whim and comes back here saying he's going to attempt to market some of the products he made as a undergrad. Fine. We get back together and I support him. 

After about 2 months of attempting that and working part time jobs to pay rent to stay here that didn't work out. Now he has decided to start an Internet business with his older brother who has recently been diagnosed with schizophrenia. Needless to say, that's not working out too well for him either. He and his brother Skype all day long but get nothing done and just fight all the time. He has been struggling to pay rent and doesn't want to work at his part time jobs anymore. 

The problem is, every time I try to talk to him about applying to other full time ""real"" jobs again he gets very angry at me. Says that a real job just isn't for him. That he gets sick in the mornings and can't work normal hours. That he is a bad employee and can't stand working for someone. I, on the other hand, am currently in school full time also pursuing two degrees while working two part time jobs to have money to do things. Anytime I want to go out with him I have to pay for both of us because ""he's broke"" and ""can't afford it."" 

I am at a loss of what to do with this situation. I have an amazing internship secured for this summer that will hopefully lead me to a full time job with the company and he's still floundering around with his life. He is also now tired of working part time to pay rent here and is moving back home a state over so that he can ""really focus on the Internet business."" The boy is amazing other than this fact. He treats me like I'm a princess and always goes out of his was to support me and make me happy but he absolutely refuses to budge on this job situation. 

What do I do? How do I handle this?

If you point that out, I already know and actively try to fix it. There isn't much way to say what I'm about to without that give coming across. I'm very sorry if I offend anyone.

Here goes. Freshman, honors student. I don't really think I'm all that great, but my counselors, friends, the validictorians, ivy league accepted seniors, and countless other people think I am. They tell me I'm in the top 10 of my class. Not percent, but top 10. Out of &gt;500. So like 5% or better. I took the ACT through a special program in 7th grade and scored a 19, while infected with the flu and a 102 fever. Today I took and ACT practice test and scored a 28 composite, with 31 in reading. Sure, this is probably a fluke, but the margin of error probably isn't that far off, and I'll take another test tomorrow to prove that. But my question comes to: do I start taking the official ACT now and take it ~8 times before I graduate, probably scoring into the 33-36 range, and constantly take practice tests. If I were to do that I'd be dropping a few major extracurriculars that I really care about. I still wouldn't have a social life, but I'd have an almost garunteed entry and probably significant grant to attend my first choice school. Mind you, my parents won't allow me to take out any significant student loans to pay for college. I either have to raise the money myself, or earn a scholarship (or 50). There's no way I can get $40K per year without scholarships. Would dropping some of my extracurricular things hurt my chances at the whole scholarship thing? Here's a list of everything I participate in:

Marching band, Jazz band, CyberPatriot, skillUSA, scholars bowl, history bowl, geography bee, STEM Academy (an internship shadowing a professional at one of the top government facilities for my field), soon to pick up science bowl, math bowl, tutoring, NTHS, NJHS, and Latin club.

I'd be willing to drop: jazz band, history bowl, geography bee, and tutoring no problem. Everything else listed is once-twice a month except scholars bowl and marching. Both are twice s work after school, and alternate seasons. My internship I have to shadow 140 hours before I graduate (through spring summer and fall) and I want to keep that mostly condensed to a year, for sake of my mentor. 

So, keep all or almost all of my stuff, or get a crazy high ACT score? I'll manage whatever social life and AP credits I can with both."

2. They can be missread

I think of the time when I was 19 and flew home from an internship and was still drunk and couldn't be bothered to put on actual clothes and my dad picked me up from the airport and I was wearing sweatpants , my makeup was smeared and I reeked of booze. He didn't even have to say anything, but he didn't have to. I was so embarrassed. 

I think of the time I planned with a coworker to drink while we were stuck on a late-night closing at Urban Outfitters and I was caught after a manager smelled booze on me - I admitted to it but refused to bring my friend down, because it was close to his last day, but I got fired. 

I think of the time I was drunk at a house party and fell down some stairs, pulling one of my best friends with me, giving her a concussion.

I think of the time I was arrested for being too drunk and was charged with resisting arrest because my reaction was to fight against the police officers. (charges were eventually dropped, but what a nightmare that was). 

I think of the time I fell down a flight of stairs and cracked my head - I didn't get stitches, but probably should have - and refused help from my boyfriend because I was so drunk and angry. I still have an indent in my scalp from that. 

I also recently decided - after a particularly awful drunk night - that I had hit rock bottom, and I'm not going to drink anymore. Most of my friends can get shit-faced and pull it off relatively well. But not me, and the hardest part has been that I can't handle my alcohol like everyone else I know. 

I am so grateful I found this subreddit. Seriously, thank you so much for all your support and giving your own experiences and just being strong, amazing people. I have tried to quit drinking before and failed, but I am determined this time. "

This semester I'm taking a java programming and web design course, just the beginning steps towards a degree in computer science that I will finish in approx. two years. In a previous life I worked as a molecular biologist and as an EHR training specialist for a hospital network, but I realized that cs definitely has more job opportunities than bio-research and potentially better salary after I get some work experience.

I should probably add that I'm female and I didn't want the title of my post to come across as sexist...but I'm really curious to meet other women programmers/developers/analysts and learn what it's really like from their perspective. My java class of 30 has a total of 5 women and I'm not sure they are all majors. It's been difficult to find specific examples online and I'd like to know what I'm getting into.

I'm certainly grateful for any male advice as well, so please comment.

I know from my experience in biology that companies prefer entry level employees who have gone beyond the classroom and engaged in research or internships. Is this also the case for computer science? 

I understand that I will need to create a portfolio of programming projects that I can show to potential employers. How do I determine what languages to use and what types of projects will be of most value?

Okay, that's all for now, I'm new to Reddit and this is the fourth time I've tried to post these questions...only to get stuck on the front page reading links and articles for hours until I forgot why I was here in the first place :) Thanks!

1ajp83,76,2013-03-18,"IMA (nearly) 4th year medical student who is having difficulty with specialty selection and having second thoughts about a career in medicine in general. I am seeking advice, thoughts, or experiences from the good people of /r/medicine.",[deleted],medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1ajp83/ima_nearly_4th_year_medical_student_who_is_having/,"So, a little more background:
I am in a US MD program, and thus far, have had a fairly unremarkable track record.  I was middle of the pack for my USMLE step I, had zero honors during my first 2 years (yeah...i know), little substantial research experience/volunteering, and a handful of honors/high passes during my 3rd year.  I have no financial support from my family and have been funding my own education. Despite being one of the lucky few to get a nice scholarship, I will be leaving here with around $100k in debt.

Throughout my training, no specialties have really stood out to me above the rest, though each fell somewhere on the spectrum of intolerable to tolerable.  After much thought, I felt like anesthesia, IM, and emergency seemed like the best options for me (though my exposure to anesthesiology was for only 1 week), but I am going into my 4th year rotation-selection with very little conviction about my would-be career.  Part of me is not convinced that I want the life that a career as a practicing physician seems to offer.   

I am worried because the reasons that I decided to go into this field have been overshadowed by more negative experiences.  The aspects that I enjoy (getting to know patients, medical detective work, saving/changing lives) are a fraction of what has occupied me over the last year of my clinical training.  My ability to focus on the positives is dwindling and I am becoming overwhelmed by the hours/lack of sleep, the pressures around documentation/CYA, the highlighted systemic shortcomings, and the social exhaustion I feel from working from the bottom of the totem pole in a rigid hierarchical system.  

I watch the residents cope with their indentured servitude and see them struggle to pay for child-care that can accommodate their extreme hours. One intern guiltily remarked that he hadn't seen his kids in the last month because he is always gone before they awake and home after they are asleep.  I've watched marriages crumble, residents bitterly complain about how the maternity leave for one of their co-residents was forcing them to pick up the slack, and heard a new female attending (in her early 30s) anxiously describe how she feels obliged to continue to delay having children because the effects that it may have on her new practice. I recognize that this is in the setting of me being a male third-year, having no children (or even a willing incubator, for that matter), and practicing ""diet-doctoring,"" with significantly fewer patients/paperwork/responsibility. To top it off, I am rarely even reaching 80 hour/week duty hours.  

So... I am likening myself to a guy who is complaining of blisters during the first mile of an ultra-marathon.  Is there a light at the end of the tunnel?  Or is my training designed to increase my comfort in knowing that I am not in a tunnel, rather on a never-ending subterranean highway, and I should be grateful that I may go from 80 hr/wk to 60?  

So, are there any anesthesiologists, IM docs, ED docs willing to talk about their careers, and the factors they weighed most heavily in deciding on specialty to select?  Are there any medical people who have had cold feet during their training?  Anybody out there who took the debt from getting an MD degree but didn't pursue a residency or clinical practice?

TL;DR: Naive MS3 whines about medicine, is undecided about his career, and wants to hear from meddit about cold-feet and career selection. 

Edit: typos

Edit #2:  I wanted to thank everyone for their support and advice.  I cannot describe how meaningful it has been for me to read these comments.  It reminds me that one of the greatest things about this field is how it selects for so many smart and genuinely nice people.  Again, thank you all so much, and I am grateful to be part of an online sub-community that is filled with such kind and insightful members.  "

Aside from the valid and reasonable laws of moderation taking place, what if there is something bigger afoot? What if everything shipped to your door that passed through customs or whatever was actually tainted. You don't think the government can properly adulterate and reseal a bag that gets to your house and you just thought you got an extra .2 for picking a reputable dealer? What if that dealer is just The Man? Anything is possible, we act like we don't know what the Big Ones are capable of, but is it not feasible that they can control the rc market and target rogue citizens who are actually marking themselves by purchasing ""grey market"" substances? How is it that technology steadily updates itself at a consistent rate (look at computers, don't tell me that technology of today was discovered recently, government just collaborates with corporation to make the most $$$$ by steadily releasing better ""newer"" technology)?
Anyways, what if all of these ""legal"" analogous substances were actually designed with malicious intent of actually causing neurological changes in the brain, and granting access to them out to the open internet (as in that google can look up you, don't act like they [data collecting agents] don't use the information they collect from everything you do), with ""little to no research"" on them. What if the knowledge of the brain has been researched, but kept hidden to be used by profiteering entities of our time?
All I'm saying is if the government figured a way to induce neurological mapping and/or mind control, the best way to test it would be on unknowing test subjects who willingly ingest, and PAY FOR, only god knows what to get a buzz.
Maybe it's the beginning of world government or alien takeover or second coming. Maybe we're just an experimental planet that's a science project for an aspiring intern at a prestigious school of a planet of superintelligent beings, which must be played out in it's entirety. Maybe it's why taking psychedelics gives you that feeling of one-ness in everything, because ""the matrix"" of our conscious world is not unveiled, but rather exposes the consciousness for what it is, just one conscious. Perhaps the feeling of oneness we feel from mystical experiences could be the outlet to our universal, outside consciousness. Kinda like finding an easter egg in a videogame, obviously they exist otherwise we wouldn't have religious figures in our past societies. Everything can be explained in an alien project like this.

I am looking to buy my first home in the Raleigh-Durham, NC, area, and I am trying to prepare myself as much as I can before I start the process. I've been lurking here (and /r/HomeImprovement) pretty intensely for the last few months, but I still have so many questions, so I wanted to just lay out my whole situation to the fine people of this subreddit.

I want to buy a home that costs roughly $100k-$150k - that is, a pretty small house of 1200-1500 square feet. I have roughly $50k saved up in cash that I could use for the house (with additional money in investments and retirement funds). I believe my credit score is somewhere in the low-to-mid-700s, but my only credit history is a credit card with a $500 limit that I've had since I was 18. No student loans, car debt, or anything of that sort.

The biggest potential problem that I see - and it could be a big one - is that I will starting a new job in April. I'm set to make about $70k a year, which is about double what I've made the past few years. My last few years have been sort of semi-stable-ish; I worked full-time at one company for 2 years, then switched to a different company as an intern (although I actually got paid more), and then I went to do an internship in Europe (same company, but it paid less). The permanent job that I am starting in April will be with the same company where I did my internships.

So, my questions to you all are:

* How badly do you think my job situation will affect my ability to get a mortgage? I know there's only one real way to find out (walking on in there and asking), but I want to have some realistic expectations before I walk in there.

* How much of that $50k should I carve out as a down payment? I'm sure it depends on the condition of the house I'm moving into, so let's assume a house in moderate shape that might need a few small repairs. I don't have a lot of furniture, but I plan to get most of my stuff (excluding a mattress and possibly couches) from consignment stores, Craigslist, and even Goodwill if they happen to have anything good.

* What housing ""features"" should I watch out for? For example, I've heard some bad stories about houses on slab foundations. I'm also pretty wary about all of these houses with fresh paint and new floors; I see it often mentioned here as a selling point, but it really rings my alarm bells because who knows what kind of water damage and other crap is hiding under there. I'd rather look at houses with dirty walls and carpet because I feel (although it might not actually be true) that I have a better idea of what I'm in for. Are there any good inspection checklists out there with things to look for when viewing homes?

* How many places do you usually shop around for mortgage pre-qualification? Are there any good, trustworthy online tools? Can anyone from the area recommend a bank or broker?

* I'm a single female in my mid-20s, and I'm worried people won't take me seriously. Considering this is all new to me, I feel like I'm in a very vulnerable position, which is why I want to be as prepared as possible. I am sure real estate agents and mortgage brokers alike will have dollar signs in their eyes as they imagine the things they could get past me in their contracts (sorry, do I seem paranoid?). What things should I look out for in contracts? Any recommendations for how to get people to take me seriously?

* What's the best way to contact a reputable real estate agent? I've seen ""Contact a buyer's agent"" ads on real estate websites, but what other avenues would you recommend? I don't know anyone who could personally recommend one to me.

* I'm also considering buying a piece of land sometime to build a future home on. Do people get real estate agents for land sales? How does buying land differ from buying a home (other than there not being a house). I know about perk testing in areas without city water/sewer, but what else do you have to look out for? If land hasn't been perk tested, what do you do - just buy and hope? I assume you could look at soil data to get a good idea of whether it would or not, but really I have no idea.

Thanks!

Internship A is in another state, in an undesirable city, with unknown pay, doing projects that are of little interest to me. I will most likely decline the offer from Company A.

Internship B is with a company that is very prestigious, doing projects that would be very fun and desirable. The internship is for an unknown time (""as long as I want""), with a possibility that I will be hired full-time after 3 to 6 months. The company is very ""volatile""--they are known for hiring and letting people go.

Full-time job C is with a lesser known company that has great job stability (they haven't laid off any employees in over 10 years). The projects are related to my past work experience, but not all that interesting to me. Company C will get back to me later this week to let me know if I have been offered a job.

What should I say to Company B in the mean time? Should I ask them what the expected salary/benefits will be? Should I let them know I'm waiting for a full-time position, and that I need a few days before I make a decision? If I get an offer at Company C, should I take it? 

**tl;dr-I have an internship offer from a great (but volatile) company. I'm waiting to hear back about a potential full-time offer with another (more stable) company. How do I proceed?**

Since 2008, I've been in a relationship with a really cute girl. We started dating during high school, and since I was her first serious boyfriend, we started out taking things very slow. After high school was done I started seeing her less and less. It started when I first choose to major in accounting. I was working a full time job, and she choose to major in art, and fashion design. We saw each other about once a week. She worked in the weekends that time, so it when we saw each other, I usually slept over, and left the following morning. This had to be done because we both had homework to do, and since I sometimes have a hard time focusing on my work when other people are around, I did that back home. 

After eight months I decided to quit my studies, because I didn't like it. She was still in her first year of uni, and was focusing full time on her studies, so I couldn't see her more. I started business administration the following year, and I could still see her only about once a week, because her study was simply very time consuming. She once told me that  none of her classmates (all girls, mostly) are in relationships because of the lack of time for that. That was the year when my father got fired, which now poses some financial problems, but that aside. My girlfriend and I had some weeks off together during the summer break. Since I was broke I also had to work a lot during the summer, but we still had some time for ourselves. She and I didn't really know what to do with so much spare time, so we kind of hung out and did some things we wanted to do for a while, go swimming etc. This felt kind of forced and awkward, because when you are in a relationship with another person for more than 3 years, you would expect to know how to kill time together. Shortly thereafter my I started my new study, public healthcare management. I have enjoyed this new study a lot, and it's something that I found I can achieve and be happy about. During the last half year we still only saw  each other once a week, sometimes even less. Me and my girlfriend barely talk about our relationship. I tried to start conversations about things like sex and relationships, but I quit trying a long time ago because of a lack of response. 

In January, my girlfriend applied for an internship in the uk, which is a 7 hour drive and quite expensive for me, given the fact that I'm soon jobless. She is gone for 5 weeks and one day now. During the last five weeks she has been gone I've realized that the communication with my girlfriend is terrible. Aside the usual 'what have you done today ' we don't really talk about important things. She hates to use Skype to talk with me, as she told me on my visit last week. This is not the first time I have doubted our relationship. I can barely remember the times when we had proper long conversations. I also have to say that we barely share any common interests, and we both find each other's hobbies to be weird. She loves fashion, and while trendy sometimes, I'm a nerd who loves the internet and I love reading literature, and well, she doesn't. As stated previously, I have thought about ending our relationship before. We had a small breakup in our first year together, mainly for the same reasons posted here, which I couldn't feel I could explain to her at the time. I now realize that was a mistake. I am troubled about quite a few things at this very moment. I don't have enough money to visit my girlfriend as much as I would like to. The funny thing is, after being together for five years, I can easily be without her for a long amount of time without starting to miss her big time. I think this is a very bad sign of the status of our relationship. When I visited her last week, I felt kind of ok, but not super relieved or anything, but I was happy. I really don't know what to do. I could use some outsiders advice! Thank you so much in advance.

**TL;DR: Me and my girlfriend have never really been emotionally attached to e/o and are figuring this out now 5 years in.**

Right now it's sitting in a data center until my contract is up in August.  I plan to have it shipped back to me so I can start up a homelab.  I plan to virtualize the machine using ESXi.

The specs of the machine are as follows:

* Xeon E3-1230v2
* Supermicro X9SCM-F-O
* 32GB DDR3 1600 ECC
* 500GB Western Digital RE4 (I disabled TLER after realizing it was pointless to use an RE drive by itself, so right now it might as well be a Black drive)
* 128GB Samsung 830 SSD
* Supermicro CSE-512F-350B Chassis (and a heatsink and rails)
* OS: Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard


I've secured an internship for this summer (paid), so I'd like to put some of that money towards lab equipment.

Since I won't have that machine until August, and I want to get started earlier, I'd like to pick up some other hardware to get myself started.

Here's what I've been thinking about:

* I want some sort of NAS solution to hold all of my VMs and any other data I'd like to share across my network (media maybe?).
* Gigabit managed switch (maybe utilize the SFP and do a little fiber networking?  I might be able to get my hands on some free transceivers)
* PFSense box (on something like a firebox x550e or similar)

Do you have any recommendations on what I should pick up to start up my lab?  I'm not entirely sure what I'll be doing at my internship, but I plan to use my lab to further my learning from the internship when I'm at home.  I know I'll be working more with infrastructure rather than programming, but that's about all I know.

As far as budget goes, I don't really have one.  I don't want to spend more than I have to, but I also want some decent hardware (e.g. if I had to choose between a gigabit switch and a 10/100 switch, I'd be willing to spend the extra cash if it's not an absurd amount).

Thanks!"

I already read that the internship system isn't quite popular in Japan - but has anyone a good tip in mind?


I'd rather prefer not speaking Japanese, since I only know some basics. By the time I want to go to Japan I will have studied Japanese for 4 terms, resulting in a basic knowledge, katakana + hiragana and about 300-400 Kanji. Other languages I speak are Polish, English, French, Swedish and German of course.


The internship doesn't have to be paid, or history related. Actually I'm quite happy with everything to be honest. The problem is I can only afford going to Japan by doing an internship, since this gives me the possibility to apply for a scholarship.

A few years ago I had a bone spur on my ankle that was tearing apart my Achilles Tendon. December of 2011 I had surgery on it and the recovery was sloooow. Three months of crutches, then about five months of physical therapy. The kicker is, the surgery did not work. Apparently I am regrowing the bone spur, and the ankle pain is actually worse. Before it would only hurt and make me limp if I sprinted a lot. Now I can't even run at all.

Basically, if you read all that the point is that it has had a huge impact on my ability to exercise. I am a college student that also has a job, an internship, and I do research with one of my professors, so I don't always have time to go to the gym but I have gained about thirty pounds since this whole ankle business started. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to start off? I tend to snack a lot and have a huge problem with carbs, I can't seem to stop eating them. It's hard to get motivated too when I know it's not like I can go for a run. I do the bike at the gym when I can, but it doesn't burn nearly as many calories. "

1airza,54,2013-03-18,ME Trilogy completed...one week later... I'm still searching (*SPOILERS ALL*),sudline,masseffect,https://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/1airza/me_trilogy_completedone_week_later_im_still/,"Let me start this off by saying that I'm an RPG junkie and I just unequivocally love this series of games and am completely taken with the Mass Effect Universe.  While I played the trilogy it gave me a feeling I haven't felt since I was a wide-eyed kid playing Final Fantasy 4, 6, Chrono Trigger, Secret of Mana, and as I got older: Skies of Arcadia and Xenoblade.  That all consuming feeling of wanting to play every minute of every day.  The feeling of total world immersion.  Every night before my wife would go to bed she would ask me, ""How's Mass Effect going?""  And my response would usually be, ""Absolutely incredible.  I LOVE this game.""  However, once it all ended with ME3 I was devastated and left searching for some kind of closure.  One week and many sleepless nights later I still feel awful.

**How I got to this point:** WARNING: LONG AND RAMBLING.

I started playing ME1 two months ago.  Since I have the whole wife, kids, work thing going it took me awhile to complete all three games.  I played ME1 as an Adept and 2 and 3 as an Infiltrator.  I don't think I'll ever get sick of the sound and kickback of a Widow rifle (or squad cryo!).  Incredibly satisfying...  The absolute high point for me was definitely ME2.  I love games with large parties to choose from and lots of characters to get to know.  With all the recruitment and loyalty missions and subsequent dialogue....I was in heaven.  For me the story and dialogue became first and the action was something to do to get to more dialogue.

Now I've never had much use for Bioware romance.  I romanced Ashley in ME1 for...boy I really have no idea why...ugh...let's just say I wish I had chosen to save Kaiden on Virmire.  So as I was playing ME2 I was kinda insulted when the obvious T&amp;A show (Miranda) shows up who conveniently has a king size bed in her office...sigh...(c'mon Bioware...seriously).  I decided then and there I wasn't going to waste my time with romance.  Later after the Haelstrom mission Chambers tells Shepard that Tali likes me...  Wait, what?!  Tali was always the ""innocent little sister"" figure to me.  I liked Tali, I didn't think they developed her much in ME1 (more of just a walking Quarian codex), but I always had to have her all the time in my squad because of her decryption, so I had certainly gotten used to having her around.  But then I thought, ""This is interesting, where does Bioware go with this...a romance with the girl who can't take anything off or she gets sick and could die...a platonic romance??""  Ok, I'll bite, down to engineering I go.  Then as a curveball Tali tries in three separate conversations to tell me basically ""you don't want the akward girl in the suit, you deserve better."" Shepard: ""I don't want anyone else, I want you.""  Homerun!  Bioware got romance right.  My Shepard became a much deeper character with Tali at his side.  He was no longer just a renegade bad-ass space cowboy full of great one-liners and poses.  He was also caring and committed enough to be in a relationship where intimacy was difficult and his girlfriend was considered a second-class citizen through most of the galaxy.  ""Totally worth it.""  And I loved Kasumi's line: ""Tali is so cute...she loves you Shepard, be good to her.""

So blow up the Collector Base, everyone lives, tell the Illusive Man to F-off.  Game over.  ME2 is now in my Top 5 favorite games of all time.  I don't say things like that lightly, I've been gaming pretty much every day of my life since Atari.

Sigh...here it comes...I knew it going in....I read video game blogs every day...ME3 was controversial.  I never read any spoilers.  All I knew was the ending was bad, but it had been corrected in a free DLC.  So good!  Wow...I was not prepared.

I liked ME3, I liked the sense of urgency, the much darker tone.  I hated the ""keep clicking the red ring"" to talk to me dialogue with your crew.  Where was the dialogue wheel?  It no longer felt as real.  Don't get me wrong, there was great dialogue and I liked dropping in on conversations, but I felt a little dis-attached.  I satisfyingly broke up with Ashley (thank god...) told Allers to ""Get the hell off my ship!"" when she flirted with me on our first interview, and I loved every second of Tuchanka.  I was very sad to see Mordin go (my 2nd favorite character), but knew curing the Genophage was the right thing to do.  I was getting a little impatient, my version of Shepard did not feel complete without Tali in the squad, so I rushed ahead to get to Rannoch.  The whole sequence from the Geth dreadnought to slugging Han'Gerrel to Legion asking me ""How many creators have you seen unmasked?  Well....one,"" to killing the Reaper was incredible.  All was right in the world of ME:  I had Tali back, she says ""I love you"", she's going to get her beachfront house, the Quarians and Geth are united, and I get a bad photoshop picture in my cabin (whatever...).  Shepard is on a roll and I am on cloud nine.  Suddenly, I become more focused and the game becomes easier.  Shepard's Black Widow V is obliterating everything in his way, Tali went from akward pilgrimage girl to bad-ass shotgun-wielding sarcastic, funny, unashamed quarian admiral.  Every one of her whispered lines melted my heart and I couldn't wait for the inevitable ""House on Rannoch"" scene.  The Reapers were going to lose.

I'm a completionist.  I had every war asset I could find, all systems were explored to 100%.  I completed the From Ashes, Omega, and Leviathan DLC.  I had made all the right decisions, I never lost a crew member (except Kaiden).  It was time to win.  I got through Priority Earth and was ready for the final push.  I got to talk to all the wonderful and memorable characters one last time and Tali melts my heart with the ""I want more time"" line.  That ""House on Rannoch"" scene is going to be so awesome.

I get to the beam run scene.  Tali gets hurt and Shepard calls for an evac.  What?? An evac here???  How is that possible??  Why not just drop me off at the beam then??  Shepard loads Tali into the Normandy and I'm hit with the ""I have a home.  Come back to me."" line.  I can feel the knife go into my heart and twist.  Shepard responds with ""Go, get out of here!""  What??  The girl just poured her heart out to you and that's what you say??  Where's the ""Don't worry, I'll be fine.""  At least tell her you love her.  What?????  I calm myself down, it's ok, Bioware wouldn't do that...the game has been masterfully written.  Let's get to the beam.  Shepard is hit and my armor is gone and I have a pistol??  I don't carry a pistol...  Harbinger flys off....he just FLYS off...ok???  WTH is going on here?  Here comes some husks and a marauder.  Shoot them dead.  Good.  Hit ""R"" to reload.  There's no ammo in this pistol...ok.  Another head scratcher.  So finally get to the beam and who is inside but Anderson and the Illusive Man??????   How did they get here?  Cue everyone stumbling around in pain sequence.  Kill the Illusive Man, Anderson dies.  I think of the Han Solo line ""Let's blow this thing and go home!""  Then the ghost kid appears...

THREE CHOICES?!?!  NO! THERE IS ONE CHOICE!  I just spent the last 150+ hours convinced that the Reapers need to die and in the last two minutes you are trying to sell me on sacrificing myself to either control the Reapers or synthesize with them??  So basically, do what the Illusive Man or Saren wanted?!?!  HELL F'ING NO!!!  It's damn insulting to even consider that.  I didn't spend the last 150+ hours WINNING just to lose in the cutscene.  Let's blow this place and GTFO.  Call the evac in!

Wait...WTF is Joker doing?  He's leaving the fight...he's leaving the f--cking fight...he would never leave the F--CKING fight...nor would any of his crew!  All of them would gladly die trying to get Shepard out.  Ok ok, Admiral Hackett's speech, yada yada, a bad slideshow of vacation photo's of the crew, keep going...the payoff is coming soon.  Wait...is that Tali holding my f--cking nameplate to put on the memorial wall.  NO.....no......no no no no no no no no no no no no no!!!  ALT+TAB.  Open chrome.  WTF did I do wrong??  Did I make a bad decision??  I thought I would get the perfect ending.  Oh good, here's a youtube video: Perfect ending Tali Romance.  Wait...this is the EXACT SAME ENDING I JUST SAW!!!!  Go back in-game see the crew crashed on some jungle planet?!?!  Joker, Tali and Javik go out.  WTF IS THIS BULL?? Then I get the ""Tell me more about THE SHEPARD"" line.  See the breath scene.  THANKS FOR PLAYING!!!  Purchase more DLC!!!

THANKS FOR PLAYING?!?!?!?!  THANKS FOR PLAYING?!?!?!?!  NO, F--CK YOU!!!  You just ruined my favorite game series of all time and you tell me to buy more DLC?!?!

I woke up my wife at 4AM that night and said.  Honey, I beat ME3.  Oh good, she says.  I say ""No, it was f--cking bullshit!""  The ending was non-sensical and awful!  An unpaid emo intern wrote it who thought it would be cool to make a DARK ending.  It's the only explanation.

So here I am:  still upset.  Still getting 3 hours of sleep a night.  Pouring over ME videos and content trying to get answers of just WTH happened over at Bioware.  I was even more distraught to learn how they handled the initial outrage a year ago.  Will time heal the wounds?  I played the Citadel DLC (they got their wish!!  I did just what they asked me to do!  I bought more DLC!! Hooray!!  Maybe I'm indoctrinated...).  Lots of awesome moments (nearly cried when Tali sang to Shepard), but couldn't enjoy it because I knew ultimately what the end game was.  If anything it just sent me into a deeper spiral.  I found myself staring in the mirror the other night saying, ""Pull yourself together, you have a family to take care of, it's just a damn game.""  But to me it wasn't....it was the ultimate space fantasy escape.

If you managed to read all of this...I thank you.  I know...it was LONG and long-winded, but it probably means that you care just as much I do about the ME Universe and where its future goes.  I really hope this isn't the end.  AND where's my GODDAMN house on Rannoch??"

I've honestly got nothing going for me.

The thing that hurts the most is that I actually try hard at improving my life, but I keep coming up short. I study a lot, genuinely try to learn about CS in my spare time, and exercise 4-6 times a week. From an outsider's perspective it may seem like I've got my shit together, but my actual achievements are hardly spectacular.

I've always imagined myself to be this badass guy who went to a stellar university and got a job at a place like Google or something, but I'm beginning to realize these are childish fantasies. The reality is that I'm just an average dude, going to an OK school with absolutely no intern/job prospects at the moment. Maybe I'll accomplish something great one day, but it's hard seeing the light at the end of the tunnel at this point.

I'm not giving up on pursuing my goals. The motivation is still there. It's just that I keep asking myself ""Is this the best that I can do?"" and the answer is almost always ""Yes"". My self-esteem has slowly been decreasing over time, but that should already be obvious.

My distress is further increased by the vast amount of success stories that float around here. It seems like there's so many people here who simply worked hard and became uber successful. But what about the guys who work hard and don't make the cut? What happens to them? I fear I might end up in the category of failures you never hear about.

1aidtv,3,2013-03-18,Dont know what to do with my life. ,NAZGUL9,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1aidtv/dont_know_what_to_do_with_my_life/,"First off, Ill start with a little background. Im a 26 year old w/m and i live in the midwest. I went to college (did really well surprisingly) and got a BS degree in Law Enforcement. Amazingly after completing my internship and graduating i got a job as an investigator at a county level narcotics task force not more than a month after graduation. 

This is great, I was barely 22 years old and got a job doing what alot of guys spend their entire careers in patrol striving for. So for almost 4 and a half years I work for the task force. At first it was pretty amazing, doing undercover work, catching bad guys, putting evil people in prison. At some point along the way i realized that some of the people we were arresting weren't bad at all, (small time non violent users) and I started trying to justify our ruthless actions to put them away. We would arrest someone for possessing an ounce of weed, and it would make the other guys happy, like they were getting a kick out of catching this person doing wrong. I started to question a lot of things at my job.  

The task force i worked for doesn't lend its self well to making careers. The pay is not very good in comparison, and its grant funded so it can lose funding at any time. So the idea is you get some experience and you parlay that into getting a job in patrol at a department thats well funded and has a union. This is exactly what i did, 4.5 years into my career, and Im strapping on a uniform all while questioning the very role of modern law enforcement. 

Lets just say my time in uniform didn't go very well. They took me and threw me into the fucking shark tank. I can begin to describe how douchey and macho/alpha male everyone at this particular dept is. Im quiet, I prefer to let other people talk until i need to make my point, and then I can get very assertive. This did not fly, I was immediately informed that i was not nearly aggressive enough with ""telling people how it was going to be"" and that I ""didn't want to look like a bitch on the street"". To cut it short, they basically found out that i was laid back, and totally didn't fit the mold for their dept. I will admit that I made a bunch of rookie mistakes throughout the training process, but who doesn't? Also none of the things i did wrong were, illegal, immoral, or unethical. Just dumb shit like driving the slower way to a call. 

Well eventually Im given the option to resign or be fired. They sat me down and said ""you don't fit in here we want you to leave"", so i resigned and left. This was two months ago, and now I have no idea if i should try my hand in another sector. I have very few marketable skills, and a pretty narrow education. 

For the last two months I've been lost, I have no idea what to do. I apply for any job i qualify for, and a few that i don't. Ive probably sent out 60 applications. Ive had two interviews for part time jobs, and I soon got emails stating that neither of those were going to work out. I feel worthless, like I did something horrible, and now society is making me pay for it. My family is disappointed in me, even though this is the only time I've been unemployed since college.  

Im lonely as shit, I went through a hectic few weeks after i got fired, and the resulting negativity caused the girl i was dating to break up with me, I really don't blame her, I treated her like shit the whole time I had that job, I would do the exact same thing in her place. Its impossible to meet people as i live in a small rural area, and if I do meet someone nice, I'm like hey yeah I basically reddit all day and not get calls back for part time jobs...........Ladies contain your orgasams 

So yeah, Im here, trying to vent out all my anger, frustration, negativity. I decided today that the only thing i can really do is try to be positive, and hopefully positive things will come my way. "

I got here, I started meeting people, I like it.  I felt like I underachieved.  Finding out an internship site, I underachieved.  After that, I overachieved, then underachieved.  It's like, I just run out of motivation.  

I found it again after graduation, then I came back here... because I was lucky or blessed enough to.  I found myself overachieving for  the first two terms... then I went to Spain and started... not caring.  Why?  I honestly don't know why.  I couldn't find anything right now to satisfy my needs of boredom, something that would give me happiness.  Graduation is coming soon and I should find a job, yet I don't even have my shit together in that department - I feel like I'm halfassing everything right now.  This isn't me.  This isn't me at all.

Here's a summary of it:
Peter joins Islam and likes it but soon finds out he joined a underground sleeper cell set on blowing up a bridge.
Of course the creators made up a bunch of stuff like Peter buying Cobras and such. Some of the jokes only a Muslim would get, like how Peter thinks ""Allahu Akbar"" is ""Admiral Ackbar"" (that made me laugh.)
But then they started doing things that would portray the stereotypical Muslim, smoking hookah and ordering women to do things. 
I did not find the episode offensive, just a good laugh. But it really wasn't that funny. Maybe the interns wrote it, but the episode had potential to be really funny. 
While the Muslims in the episode were terrorists, they did comment on how not all Muslims are terrorists and how there are Christian terrorists, which I'm glad they got that message out to the public.
Anyway for people who saw it, what are your thoughts? D"

A bit about me:
23 years old, work ~30 hours/ week and am full time CS student ending his junior year. I am at the same University I dropped out of several years prior, and as such my GPA is &lt;3.0. My CS GPA is 4.0 (this is post all the 'core' classes; data struc/algorithms/disc math/comp arch/OS/etc.

In short, I have been busting ass for the past 2 years and am extremely capable when it comes to the 'relatively' basic brain-teasers/algorithm/OO questions that many tech interviews for new grads/interns are comprised of. 

I have applied to all of the big companies (M$/Amazon, etc.) and was not given a single interview. I am fairly certain this is because of my &lt;3.0 cumulative GPA, and I did miss one of the deadlines (I am kicking myself, I know). The technical interviews I have had with smaller companies for internships I have destroyed, and several times I noticed the questions from projecteuler/hackerrank/etc. that I have completed earlier. The problem is all of the internship offers were for &lt;=20$/hour, and these offers are frankly not what I am looking for (It would be both barely sustainable for me and I feel that I would be starting my career on the wrong foot...frankly I feel that these internships are for people below my 'skill'/dedication level). 

I have completed several of the interviewstreet questions (for both Amazon and FB....not sure if this actually works or not however; does anyone know?)

I am simply looking for advice on what to do going forward. I have no major projects to my name; however I have completed a substantial amount of online problems (on the sites I mentioned previously).

I feel like a 65 year old man. My life is literally nothing but school/schoolwork/work (basically menial labor)/doing some CS problems on my own/sleep. It has been this way for far too long and I want to believe that my work will pay off but I am unsure of how to get where I want to be. I am confident if I were to be given an interview with one of the large companies I would stand a good chance of getting in.

My first goal is to simply get an interview from M$/Amazon/etc., my end goal is of course to land a position there.

/cscareerquestions; any advice on what should I do to get there would be GREATLY appreciated, as I feel lost for the first time since my return to school."

•	Highlight distinct traits such as working throughout college career

•	Delve into project experiences

•	Avoid being too specific and disqualifying yourself from many positions - let your projects speak for your skill set

•	Attack from the other side and describe what you like to do and what gets you excited about your field and the experiences you've had - employers may see you fit positions which you weren't aware of

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Can I get that email address to send my bank account info to again, I seem to have deleted your prior 74588 emails?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8ye3iz?context=5)|Those fraudsters play on greed. As they used to say on Hustle, ""You can't scam an honest man"". If the deal looks too good to be true, then it is.
[What is the most common sickness or injury you treat people for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8ye3z2?context=5)|The most common sickness is malaria. Its a much bigger problem than AIDS. Seriously. The commonest injuries are head injuries following road traffic accidents or domestic accidents. Or the occasional fight.
[How old are most of the victims of malaria you see? Do they mostly fall within the average age range of under 5? And when they are diagnosed, what is the usual treatment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8ygd8z?context=5)|Most of the victims are indeed under 5. Usually, when their parents notice the symptoms they keep the child at home, feeding them all kinds of concoctions, and then when they're nearly dead they rush the kids to the hospital. The most annoying part is that the government has provided free malaria treatment for children, yet these parents refuse to take advantage of this opportunity. Severe malaria is usually treated with intravenous quinine, but otherwise we use the Artemisinin Combination Therapy.
[Why do the parents take this action? Stating their decision as you do it seems completely irrational. Why do they do this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8yh61x?context=5)|Its because of two major things: Poverty and Ignorance. Poverty makes them think they can't afford the medical costs, ignorance makes them believe the sickness isn't serious.
[Do Nigerians practice female genital mutilation? All, or mainly the Islamic part?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8yeoof?context=5)|FGM is now illegal in Nigeria. Every part of it. Edit: FGM is not as common as it used to be because of the legal repercussions, and with increased education it's becoming unaccepted culturally. There's no denying that it still exists though.
[What is the one thing you enjoy or are proud of about Nigeria?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8yeeba?context=5)|The one thing I'm proud of is the Nigerian family. No matter how old you are or how far you go, your family's got your back. You can always find your way home. When I was much younger my dad or my friend's dad used to sit us around their feet and tell us folk tales. We also used to sit under the moonlight and just dream. Of course that kind of thing is rare now, what with X-box and PS3 and Facebook and Twitter, but the memories are still with me. That, I'm proud of. Our football team is a plus, btw.
[What is the best part about living in Nigeria?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8ye95s?context=5)|Well, some people may argue that the best part about living is leaving, but not for me. There are so many good things to see in spite of all the undeniable evil. In fact I wrote a poem here www.bit.ly/XmZo43.
[Is it difficult to become a Doctor in Nigeria?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8yflov?context=5)|Becoming a doctor here is no easy task. Most of our textbooks are foreign, and so apart from the pictures in the books we're left to our imaginations, in many cases. Imagine 20 medical students around one patient, trying to learn something. We do work very hard though to meet up with international standards, but it's really not easy. Our professional exams are sometimes very subjective, so you could fail just because a senior examiner is having a bad day, or pass because she knows your mum. it doesn't end in medical school. Getting a place for Residency is another cup of tea. Usually you must be an indigene of the host community, or you must know someone 'at the top'.
[What made you decide to become a Doctor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8yflov?context=5)|I chose medicine because it appealed a lot to me. There hasn't been any doctor in my family before me, but... I don't know how else to put it. Practicing medicine was the only thing that made sense to me. (Next to computer science). I guess this is the 'call' I've heard so much about. Edit: OMG! Thanks for the gold! Edit 2.0 (Clarify) I mentioned we do work hard to meet international standards, and 'usual' is not the same as 'always'.
[How is electricity in your country? I mean, is it expensive, how good is the grid, what sources does it come from? Do you think that developing countries should focus on renewable energy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8yf1fe?context=5)|As Amanpour pointed out recently on CNN, electricity supply is still very bad, but it's improving. In my office we get electricity on the average 6hrs a day. At home, nada, over the past year. Our source of electricity is one hydroelectric dam. I think developing countries should invest in renewable energy, but our primary goal for now should be to maximize what we have. At home we run generators for about 8hrs every day, that's about 15litres of fuel every day! If we had electricity supplied to us by private companies I doubt we'd pay as much, and the companies would still profit a lot. That's one investment opportunity there.
[Tell us about your movie industry. I know it is the third largest in the world, but why don't we see your movies coming to cinemas in Europe or the Americas. We get a bunch of Bollywood ones, but never any Nollywood ones. Is production solely for the domestic market? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8yfu7p?context=5)|Our movie industry is not as developed as we'd like it to be. There's a lot of talent there, but you'd agree with me that movies aren't all about acting. It's difficult to imagine investing a million dollars in a movie here, when our kids are dying from preventable diseases. We are also culprits though, we spend next to nothing to see our movies, but we'd gladly pay 10 dollars to see Django Unchained, and the obvious excuse is quality.
[Those misconceptions being?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8ye2b8?context=5)|One example: Nigerians are fraudsters and scammers. Wrong. Another one: Nigeria is an Islamist state. Wrong again A third: Terrorists have overrun the country. Still wrong.
[Link to www.bbc.co.uk - to summarise, your university was shut down in october 2012 because of the lynching and burning of four people accused of stealing laptops and mobile phones...Is this really acceptable behaviour for a place of higher learning?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8ye8hd?context=5)|First, I graduated from the University of Port Harcourt. The school was shut down temporarily because a vigilante group near the school lynched four students. The unacceptable lynching behaviour was carried out ON the undergrads, and was widely condemned.
[Reports of a bomb explosion at a bus station from a group of terrorists seeking to overthrow the government and create an islamic state.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8ye8hd?context=5)|Secondly, you correctly said, terrorists are SEEKING TO overthrow the government. Would you call Afghanistan a terrorist nation? And we're not even close to that.
[Again, in my email today, I have five email addresses, the IP addresses I can backtrace to Nigeria - you surely have to admit that this doesn't look good from an outside view. Now...Granted, I'm willing to accept that not *all* Nigerians are like this, but you surely have to admit that there is a *massive* problem with crime and corruption in Nigeria, just as there is in other African states such as Ghana?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8ye8hd?context=5)|Yes, I agree that those fraudulent emails might be in your inbox. Indeed the term 419 or 419er originated from Nigeria. But there are so many more honest Nigerians just trying to make a living through honest, legit means. I'm sure the two Nigerians on the Forbes 100 got there legitimately.
[Here's a more pointed question - Are you being proactive to dispel the perception that Nigeria is a corrupt and unwelcoming place for visitors...If so, what are you doing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8ye8hd?context=5)|Finally, I am being proactive. For one I'm doing an AMA.
[I've frankly never heard those misconceptions. People who get the ""Nigerian Prince"" emails know that it's not really from Nigeria, just a scammer.  Good luck to you as you treat the sick and injured though. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8yefnm?context=5)|Thanks! For a moment though I thought you said Goodluck. That's our president's name!
[You are a well educated, probably relatively wealthy young man. What makes you think you can speak on behalf of a country where only about 30% of people finish secondary school and the 45% of the country is below the poverty line?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8ye7gh?context=5)|I grew up in a middle class neighbourhood. We didn't have a TV till I was about 8. No computers till I got to university. I went to a Government Secondary School (High School) and a Government University. I am not a 'relatively wealthy young man', as you have put it. Doctors don't earn as much as we should, at least at the beginning of our career. I've lived all my life here, I'v been in the strikes and protests and hunger and sickness, so I believe I can speak for my country. Recently 'European Engineer' did an AMA on behalf of 'Africa', and he was applauded so much he made it to the front page. I think I deserve some more credit. TL;DR I'm an average Nigerian.
[Do people still revere Fela Kuti in Nigeria?  He was brilliant. (link\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8yefhv?context=5)|Yes. A lot of people do, but mostly the older generation. Some people (me inclusive) don't really dig his style of music. We respect him though, for his boldness in speaking against the military government through his lyrics.
[So you have to deal with a lot of malaria, whats the root cause? and why is malaria not a big issue in more developed countries?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8yedu9?context=5)|Malaria is a tropical disease, the parasite is transmitted by female mosquitoes. These mosquitoes breed in stagnant water, and we have lots of those. Some years ago, on the average one child died of malaria every 30seconds. Now its one child every minute.  In developed countries, apart from the geography/climate, mosquitoes don't find breeding ground because of the industrialization/cleaner environment. Here, you won't find mosquitoes around clean houses that don't have bushes around them.
[If I travel to Nigeria and walk through the streets with my expensive camera, smartphone and wallet like a tourist, how probable is it I get mugged, knifed or kidnapped?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8ye3h4?context=5)|Just like anywhere else in the world, it depends on what street you're walking on. Lots of people walk on lots of streets without incident. I have NEVER been mugged, and I've been to all kinds of places. 
[How many different languages do you encounter on a daily as a doctor in Nigeria?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8ygehr?context=5)|Three languages. English, Ikwerre and Ibo. But that's because of my location. English IS our official language.
[Thanks for doing AMA. Have you encountered any terrorists while working? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8yffr0?context=5)|I live in the south, so I haven't encountered any terrorists. However, there was an incident once at the Teaching Hospital where I trained. Four gunmen came to rob a paypoint within the hospital, and killed one cashier in the process. It was really scary.
[What do Nigerians think of Bill Gates, with all the work he's done trying to fight Malaria?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8yh6a1?context=5)|Personally, I love what he's done against malaria, and I figure the best way to show my appreciation would be to play my part in the fight. Many Nigerians don't know about his charity, and just relate him to Microsoft and his reign as the world's richest man.
[Is there much homophobia in your country?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8ygkgi?context=5)|Oh yes! There's homophobia a-plenty, everywhere. I haven't met anyone who openly accepted homosexuality or lesbianism. Besides, I'm Christian, so maybe it's just the company I keep.
[Is anything being done about Nigeria's exploding population on a grassroots level? The world's birth rate is slowing down rapidly, but Nigeria in particular is not slowing down. Some estimates have the population of Nigeria at one billion by the end of the century, which might be a humanitarian disaster that can't be fixed.  Is anyone being proactive about women's education and birth control or are they just content about the status quo? I understand much of it is cultural or religious but when women are having 6 or seven children as the norm in an incredibly overpopulated state as it is, shouldn't the government at least promote slowing down the birthrate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8yfs97?context=5)|Yes. Family Planning and Female Education are at the core of the efforts to control the population explosion, but we're also trying to improve healthcare. The logic behind having so many children was that, since the infant mortality rate was high and life expectancy was low, they figured they'd have as many kids as possible, so a few would survive to old age.
[What's the music scene like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8yg9yu?context=5)|The music scene is crazy. It exploded recently, lots of wonderful young talents, but also lots of rubbish. The music industry though is up to date, recently one of our young stars performed alongside Chris Brown in Ghana. 
[25 year old doctor? maybe we have misconceptions about medical school? how long is medical school in Nigeria?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8ykn5x?context=5)|It's six years, then you do a 1-year internship, then 1-year of National youth service, then Residency which lasts between 4 and 6 years. After that you become a Consultant/Specialist.
[As a doctor, do you think aid money is going where its needed or into the pockets of government and health officials?  Edit: Thanks for the interesting answer.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8yg7c2?context=5)|Some aid money is reaching it's targets, but a large part of it is diverted into some people's pockets. I remember one of our Consultants telling us how a PCR machine that was headed for our hospital was diverted somewhere else. I'm also aware of an incident where some microscopes were paid for but were never delivered to my school.
[Being a doctor at 25 isn't a good thing. Is it that easy to be a doctor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8yjcvs?context=5)|No it's not. Over a thousand students attempted the exams to get into medical school. Less than two hundred made it in, and of that two hundred, about a hundred made it to the end.
[What's the general opinion on Shell and pollution, or is it viewed as a local problem?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8yglrv?context=5)|Shell has done a lot of damage to our environment, but many people have come to see them as a necessary evil, because crude oil production is at the centre of our economy.
[Thinking about Nigeria makes me want some fried plantains. Mmm... I wan chop.  I used to live in Victoria Island when I was very young, a little less than twenty years ago. How has Nigeria changed since I last saw it?  I vaguely remember local Nigerians greeting each other (and myself\) with a phrase sounding like Ming ga bo. Does that happen to ring a bell? I'd love to know what language it comes from and what it means.  Some Nigerians used to call me Babatunde. Do you happen to know if it means anything?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8ygurc?context=5)|Babatunde is a Yoruba name. I don't know what it means, maybe father of Tunde. Min ga bo sounds like Mingwo. Mingwo is a Delta greeting. It literally means ""I'm on my knees"". It's how older people are greeted in Delta State. Edit: Typo.
[I'm writing a paper about how Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs\) have changed Nigeria.  Can you tell me how technology and inter-connectivity have impacted people around you?  Is it always a good thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8ykxq0?context=5)|It has opened up Nigeria more than before, and it has restored connections we lost when we parted physically. I can speak to my grandma who is almost 200 kilometres away when I want to, and with Skype I could quickly consult my senior colleagues abroad on difficult cases. Just two examples. More importantly, social media has been used to spread important info very fast, and mobilize aid where necessary. So it's mostly good, but there's always a flip side: email scam is now easier to pull off.
[What's up with all the oil spills that go underreported?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8yh6py?context=5)|That's another problem. Crude oil production leaves it's mark on the host communities, and the people are hardly, if ever compensated. this is supposedly what led to the militancy and kidnappings in the south, until the companies came to their senses. The untoward effects of oil exploration are still under reported, maybe Aljazeera will notice someday. 
[There are more people in Nigeria than all of Russia.  The richest black man and black woman are from Nigeria.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1al3uw/iama_25year_old_nigerian_doctor_who_is_fed_up/c8yggk3?context=5)|Thank you. Mrs Folorunsho Alakija is no longer the richest black woman though, but the Richest black man is Aliko Dangote. A Nigerian.

1amib2,4,2013-03-19,Harvard REU or Internship?,[deleted],gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/1amib2/harvard_reu_or_internship/,"So right now, I'm a 3rd year undergrad majoring in biomedical engineering, and I've been offered an REU at Harvard for the summer.

1amh48,3,2013-03-19,How do you get out of a rough spot in your life? I could really use some advice.,arcturin,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1amh48/how_do_you_get_out_of_a_rough_spot_in_your_life_i/,"TL;DR: I have $600 in my bank account, rent is due in two weeks ($725), and my car just died (transmission needs rebuilding, $2600 quote) in a city that depends on cars (Los Angeles). Also, things are very slow at my job, resulting in reduced paychecks due to being paid hourly. I am asking for advice.

I'm 24 and live in Los Angeles. I want nothing more than to work on video games. After college, I moved here to get into video game audio (mainly sound effects and music), but it turns out LA is really not a good place to start in video games, despite everything I was told in college. I worked two unpaid internships, both only tangentially related to video game audio before getting a job at a Starbucks - I needed any job available. I barely made rent for six months before suddenly getting interviewed and subsequently hired by a well-known film composer as his assistant (for example, he writes for a TV show that millions of people have seen - I've seen billboards for it everywhere). He paid me a non-negotiable $2000/month, while I worked 12-14 hours a day, seven days a week. I got no satisfaction out of the work I was doing (getting him lunch/dinner, very simple editing, tech support, etc.), he never wanted to talk to me out of more than necessity, and the stress started getting to me, resulting in me making a few minor mistakes (really, nothing major) that irritated him. So, after two months of being there, I was fired after coming back with lunch one day in mid-December, and was told to pack up immediately and leave.

I finally got another job through a friend in mid-January as an audiobook recording engineer. I still have this job, and I absolutely love it! The people there are fantastic, I'm paid relatively well, and I can work as many or as few shifts a week as I'd like, so long as there are books to be done. Well, two weeks after I got hired, the amount of books to be done suddenly diminished (we were told by our main client to ""go take a vacation""), so ever since then, I've only been able to get, on average, two shifts a week, resulting in me making about $800 a month. We (recording engineers) were told that we'd surely get another large deal soon, but it has been nearly two months since then. I started looking for an additional job a month ago.

Two days ago, on my way to work, the transmission suddenly gave out in my $7000 car. I have $600 in my bank account. I have been living on pasta and canned soup. And I was told it would cost me $2600 to fix my car. Fortunately, I'm still able to use my girlfriend's car to get to work, but that's the only thing I've been able to get out of the situation so far.

I don't know what to do. Ever since I came to this city, it's been a slow slide from being gradually forced to let go of my dream career that I was told was totally realistic all through college, to being taken advantage of when I make it somewhere (there's a line out the door for those internships and assistant jobs, and the people hiring know that), to barely scraping by on rent, and then this. I just sent out an application to Domino's. In the meantime, my roommate came to this city with a car and $2000. He did one internship, then got hired by the same company fulltime with benefits (they're no longer hiring).

My one saving grace is my girlfriend. She is absolutely incredible, and has supported me through a lot of this (we've been together six months). I'm terrified of having to move back in with my parents across the country (they're having a lot of trouble supporting themselves as it is), and leaving her behind.

I need advice. Please. I'm knowledgeable and talented in pro audio positions, I can write music and create sound effects, and I fucking love video games. I don't know what to do."

1amepd,1,2013-03-19,Haven't heard back after initial interview - how should I get an update?,wtsktte,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1amepd/havent_heard_back_after_initial_interview_how/,"About a month ago I interviewed with a company for an internship. The interview was on campus, and I was one of about 10 candidates. The interview went well I thought, especially considering that the work I did in my previous internship was very much related to this one and the interviewer and I were able to talk more as equals about a lot of the questions. 

Anyways, I was told they'd be in contact with candidates for a 2nd  interview within 1.5 to 2 weeks. Given that I had read a lot on glassdoor about this particular company's HR being excessively slow, I chalked that up to probably 3 weeks. My interview was on Feb 21, I sent a thank you that same day over email with no reply. On March 11th I sent a brief email simply asking for an update on the position and to see if they needed any additional info from me. No reply. By now i'm wondering what's up, especially since I thought the interview went well. Should I just drop it at this point? I found their office phone # online and was considering contacting them that way, but it seems a little over the top. Even if I didn't get selected for the position, I'd be interested to get some feedback and hear why/what went wrong in the interview. Any tips? Thanks!"

Jeremy Gibson's Response to GDC:
&gt; I'd make sure to spend some time at least in the expo. Try to meet a recruiter at the companies you're interested in, and be sure to bring resumes with you (and business cards). Even if you're not looking for a job or internship now, it's a good time to meet people and start a relationship with companies. Also, if you have some good portfolio work or game demos, have them on you. A smart phone is a great way to show images or videos of your work.

&gt; The big difference between comicon and GDC is that comicon is about fans while GDC is exclusively for makers who actually develop games. E3 likes to say that they're about developers, but really, it's mostly for the press; GDC is about developers talking with each other about how to make games, so it's pretty different from other conferences you may have been to. :)

Mike Zyda's response to GDC, paraphrased below:
&gt; Between DICE and GDC, DICE is more awesome because they don't have twenty talks in parallel. Almost all the keynotes/talks in DICE are excellent. If you are going to GDC, talk to recruiters that don't typically come to USC during Demo Day. If you are going to spend an hour waiting in line, at least make it someone that don't reach out to us.

(I'll be adding a list of companies that came to USC during Demo Day below.. when I get the list)

(No list yet, from what I can dig up from the old emails.)

* Activision (Neversoft)
* Blizzard
* Disney Interactive
* Electronic Arts
* Fox Network Group
* Insomniac Games
* Lucasfilm
* Microsoft
* Riot Games
* Sony Pictures
* Telltale Games
* thatgamecompany
* Walt Disney Imagineering
* ZQ Games

These are companies that are most likely to come down to USC again for Demo Day and you will be able to spend more time with them. At GDC, if you really really really want to go to one of these companies, then of course you should talk to them you silly. If no real preference, focus on what's not on the list."

And to be honest, if I started posting all my trivial and possibly dumb questions on this sub-reddit, I'd probably get down-voted.

So I guess I am looking for a sort of online internship that pays me in knowledge.  Perhaps you are currently working on a personal or team-oriented project?  It would be awesome to be able to watch and learn how things are done.

I know this might be tedious for a lot of people.  But, sometimes a shot in the dark turns out to be worth it.

I recently just landed a internship without a degree.  However, they want me to do Frontend development in Javascript.  I dont know javascript and I'm struggling passing my knowledge from Java over as quickly as I feel I should be.

Basically, to bring it into a metaphor, depending on how you learn.  Its if you self taught yourself how to play the guitar, just by playing songs.  Without knowing you were playing G Chords, and A chords, and etc.  And when other musicians want to talk to you, you cannot communicate as effectively.  My knowledge from Java isn't passing over as quickly as I hoped because I'm struggling with that sort of minor details when programmers talk to eachother.  

If I had better fundamentals I could learn quicker and my knowledge would pass over better I think.  Things like parameters and arguments for functions, and what belongs there. (i'm not sure what the difference is between a parameter and a argument now that I think about it)

 Does anybody know a good class that will teach you these fundamentals?  Should I just go to coursera?

I am interested in pursuing a graduate education, I am hoping some people here might be able to point me in the right direction.

As the title says, I am interested in grad school for mushroom breeding. I have searched many US schools, and, with some difficulty, I have been exploring opportunities at foreign institutes as well. I have not had overwhelming luck finding a program with my aims. Does anyone here have any experience with applied fungi breeding? How did you get where they are from where you started? My university offers one course in mycology and it is geared towards pathology; students from my institution are not propelled into mycological careers.

The mycological society of America site has several opportunities in fungal genetics, but they appear largely concerned with mycorrhizal fungal associations(which are very interesting, though not my ideal graduate pursuit).

My research experience is largly with weeds, grass, and plant genetics, I  had an internship in fungi pathogen genetics, and have performed adequately throughout my education. Midway through my college years, I grew a mycelial mat of interest in fungi and have, in what spare space I have, attempted small scale cultivation of Pleorotus sp. and shiitake. All suggestions for my situation are greatly appreciated. Thank you kindly."

I was successful as far as restaurant careers go, I got certified as a sommelier and played an active part in running and promoting my restaurant.  I've also been successful in school.  I got a 690 on my GMAT and currently have a 3.96 GPA, which puts me on the Dean's List.

Everyone that had some connection to the world of finance or marketing before they enrolled secured their internships long ago.  Of those of us that remain without internships, the students who took finance, accounting, and marketing classes in their undergrad are getting the calls for interviews.

1am3ri,2,2013-03-19,I [27 M] am having trouble getting over my ex [21 F] who lives below me and shares four college classes.,Synchestra,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1am3ri/i_27_m_am_having_trouble_getting_over_my_ex_21_f/,"Ok, this will be kind of long, but here goes...

I graduated and got my bachelor's degree in psychology this past December and immediately began on the path to get a master's degree in Residential Property Management. Because I'm changing career focuses, I have to take several courses with undergrad students in order to officially take graduate level courses, and so my classes are composed of a younger crowd. Meet Shelley.

Shelley is in all of my classes and starts talking to me one day. We hit it off so to speak during that conversation we realize we live at the same apartment complex. We had a night class that same day and afterwards she asked if I wanted to get some beer and hangout. I was leery because of not wanting to shit where I eat, so to speak, but it was hard to say no. She's a very attractive petite blonde, and didn't seem high maintenance to me. Almost too good to be true.

So of course I said yes and we hung out and talked for hours. This ended with her curled up asleep on my chest in her bed. I suddenly came to at 4 am and once again thought I was getting in over my head is a situation that would be compromising. Still I kissed her a few times and said I needed to go upstairs.

Fast forward a few weeks; we're spending almost all our time together. She works two jobs currently and when she wasn't working we were in class, doing homework, having sex, or hanging out. I knew it was really fast but she was just VERY into me. I've had sexual issues for years, almost my entire adult life. She's the first girl in years that I confided in before we tried and being more comfortable and allowed me to relax. I was really getting into having a real sex life again.

Things progress and although there's an age gap I felt like we can handle it. I'm totally set on being my own person and she does too, at least no jealousy or possessiveness seemed to pervade our relationship. At some point Shelley mentions that women in her family have issues with their vaginas more or less (frequent UTI's, that sort of thing), so I wasn't surprised that she was nervous about going to a gyno appointment that was coming up for her. That whole week, she eventually couldn't start her period. She told me about this one night and I asked her if she might be pregnant, of course. She'd already taken a test and said she ""knew"" that wasn't pregnant or she would feel differently. She then told me about the abortion she had this past summer and how she was worried that she wouldn't be able to have children based on how she'd been feeling. I tried to be reassuring, but she didn't seem that affected.

Amidst all this going on, her grades are slipping a bit in school, while I'm trying to help. She's on academic probation so this is her last shot. Eventually she started acting very different around me, she'd say she'd call or see me that night and would never get to me. Keep in mind this was of her own accord; we didn't make prior plans, she would just call and then...not call back. I knew something was up, especially since she was all over me for over a month and then...nothing. The last two weeks were really hard.... She was so unaffectionate and negative that I knew I couldn't have that in my life, but I didn't wanna ditch her either. I was torn. I really liked her but at the same time, I felt like I couldn't make her feel better about things.

I finally talked to her and she revealed that it wasn't a good time for her to be with someone, which I understood. She explained that there were many things I didn't know about her past (some of which was drug use, which I did know some things of). We agreed to remain amicable of course. Why not, right?

Well the first few days after I felt kind of liberated, as she had made a difficult decision for me. But then all the past couple years of building myself up and feeling confident and self-assured started to creep back into gray territory. She seemed so unaffected by the whole thing, just very different. At one point she did get tested for ADD (which she had bad study habits involving distractors like TV, music, etc), but the psychologist thought she was depressed. I know the way she's acting probably wasn't really about me, but it's been hurting all the same.

To make matters worse, we both attended a multiple company interview last week (something I had been looking forward to and something she'd been dreading) and she got an offer for an internship. With my degree and life experience I thought I was a shoo in; I guess I'm trying to say that it made me jealous somewhat and I know that's pointless and that if I really care I need to be happy for her. I think her total disconnect really bothered me. She did apologize a couple times for being a bitch, but honestly she wasn't a bitch to me, she just had a very bad attitude and I told her it was no big deal, especially considering the circumstances and how she'd been feeling.

Sorry, I know this is really long. I just sometimes feel like I get so emotionally attached that it consumes me and I've really been trying to leave that part of me behind. What can I do? Are relationships just too emotionally demanding for me?

TL;DR GF and I date for two months; sex life is good, first good sex life I've had in years. Girl reveals past abortion and and grows distant and breaks up with me.

I work as a legal assistant for a law firm, and am going to law school in the fall. She is a lawyer at a firm, just graduated law school last spring. At the party, she and I instantly made eye contact. I’m pretty sure she thought I was a lawyer. Anyway, I felt like she was sort of wanting to talk to me. We made eye contact several times. Unfortunately, I was with my boss, and he sort of dictates where I can sit, etc., otherwise I would have sat down right next to her.

Anyway, the whole time I’m there, I’m thinking ways that I can talk to her. Finally, this kid who was an intern at the firm where the lawyer worked sort of hung around me the whole time, so I asked him about her. He said she just graduated from X law school. I actually had just been accepted to X law school, so I told the intern and asked him if he would mind introducing us so I could talk to her about it. He did, and I actually pulled this girl away from the tables where everyone was sitting, and into a corner. Now that I think about it, that move either was what she wanted, or made her feel uncomfortable. But she followed. I start talking to her, and have to tell her I’m a legal assistant looking at law school, and I’m not sure how that made her feel, because, well, I’m two years younger than her and she’s a lawyer. She seems receptive: lots of eye contact, willingness to talk, etc., but I can’t tell if that was because of the business environment or what. She tells me a bit about the school, but my boss interrupted me and said we had to leave… so I spoke to her for all of 30 seconds. I ask her if she has her card, and we exchanged cards. I told her I would like to talk more and she seemed open to that.

This was around Christmas, so it’s been almost three months. But I actually AM deciding about law school right now, and considering the school she went to, but not really. But, if this girl actually was interested in getting to know me, which is maybe the feeling I was getting when we were making all kinds of eye contact in the beginning, if I am reading the signs right, then that would be awesome.

So, I have her business card. Do I send her an email and ask? She has my contact info and never contacted me, but obviously that doesn’t mean she’s not interested. And what should I even say? Should I ask if she would want to meet up after work? I have no idea if she has a boyfriend (husband?) or what, I know nothing about her. The only thing I know is that she is really attractive, two years older than me, and I have her email address. It’s just a bit intimidating (not because of the age--I have dated older girls) but because she’s a lawyer, and that sort of says she is at a very different point in her life. Nonetheless, she was a fox and seemed to be making lots of eye contact with me from afar. Advice please!!

TL;DR: I am a 24m legal assistant, going to law school in the fall. Met this 26f lawyer at a Christmas function, got her contact info to discuss the law school she just graduated from which I just was accepted to. We made a bunch of eye contact with each other from afar at the party, but can’t entirely tell what the deal is. Conversation got cut short. How do I proceed."

I actually had just been accepted to X law school, so I told the intern and asked him if he would mind introducing us so I could talk to her about it. He did, and I actually pulled this girl away from the tables where everyone was sitting, and into a corner. Now that I think about it, that move either was what she wanted, or made her feel uncomfortable. But she followed. I start talking to her, and have to tell her I’m a legal assistant looking at law school, and I’m not sure how that made her feel, because, well, I’m two years younger than her and she’s a lawyer. She seems receptive: lots of eye contact, willingness to talk, etc., but I can’t tell if that was because of the business environment or what. She tells me a bit about the school, but my boss interrupted me and said we had to leave… so I spoke to her for all of 30 seconds. I ask her if she has her card, and we exchanged cards. I told her I would like to talk more and she seemed open to that.

This was around Christmas, so it’s been almost three months. But I actually AM deciding about law school right now, and considering the school she went to, but not really. But, if this girl actually was interested in getting to know me, which is maybe the feeling I was getting when we were making all kinds of eye contact in the beginning, if I am reading the signs right, then that would be awesome.

So, I have her business card. Do I send her an email and ask? She has my contact info and never contacted me, but obviously that doesn’t mean she’s not interested.  And what should I even say? Should I ask if she would want to meet up after work? I have no idea if she has a boyfriend (husband?) or what, I know nothing about her. The only thing I know is that she is really attractive, two years older than me, and I have her email address. It’s just a bit intimidating (not because of the age--I have dated older girls) but because she’s a lawyer, and that sort of says she is at a very different point in her life. Nonetheless, she was a fox and seemed to be making lots of eye contact with me from afar. Advice please!!

TL;DR: I am a 24m legal assistant, going to law school in the fall. Met this 26f lawyer at a Christmas function, got her contact info to discuss the law school she just graduated from which I just was accepted to. We made a bunch of eye contact with each other from afar at the party, but can’t entirely tell what the deal is. Conversation got cut short. How do I proceed.

I am a 21 year old who studies teaching. I'm from Belgium so my native language is Dutch. 

Next year is my final year and i have the possibility to do a foreign internship. My college gives my a lot of freedom so i can choose the destination myself. The only demand is that i can teach history and economics. My native langues is dutch but my English is decent (writing could be better but i'm working on it).  So basicly i'm searching for an international school where i can teach history and economics too high school children (12 till 17 years old). 

Does anybody got experience with certain international schools ? I'm open for anything but University cities like Chiang Mai in Thailand have my preference.

However, I had taken 2-3 years off college prior, due to personal and family issues (depression, etc) before coming back Fall 2012 to finish up my last remaining courses towards my degree.  

Of course, this means the last activity I really have was years and years ago.  When I first came into college, I was fairly active with internships with the local hospital and an on-campus job and a freelance web designing job for a local business.  With my bout of depression though, I've been cooped up at my parents' place for a few years with no jobs, internships or anything.

Once I graduate, I will likely be moving to Florida to join my SO (who's already there for grad school) and hopefully find some job, any job really to get started.  I'm worried that my situation will leave me hard-pressed to find any job really.  Plus, the area is a college-town so lots of young people looking for jobs.  I'm trying to touch up my resume and preparing myself for the task of looking for **anything** that'll put money in the bank and food on the table, but any advice for what I can do meanwhile/what I can work towards?

I have been applying to multiple places with no luck and decided to apply to some internships. I interviewed with one very prestigious company 2 weeks ago for an accounting internship and they called back today to offer me an internship position with them for the summer. The pay is 1.75x more than what I currently make. I have been toying with the idea of just going back to school full time this fall so this would really work perfectly. I'm then hoping I would be considered for a full time position with the company after graduating.

1alixw,5,2013-03-19,"First time posting here, here is my journey so far.",Rhombus_of_Terror,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1alixw/first_time_posting_here_here_is_my_journey_so_far/,"Bare with me, a wall of text is incoming. It seems like the normal thing to do first time posters.

So, I have recently had a 5 year stretch of self inflicted isolation. It is only until this year that I decided to take action. I'm 28 years old. I have not had a full diagnosis yet, but all signs point to social anxiety and exclusion, implicated by my lack of self confidence. My CBT program begins in a month or so. I have had many a situation evolve into me not engaging in any kind of conversation unless I am spoken too, which gives me information to work with in order to talk. I have the added complication of Dyslexia. I don't go out to socialise, which many of you would expect, or more importantly, network.

I feel better talking about anything rather than who I am and what I do, the only thing I want to say is that I stay at home spending many hours drawing to keep myself busy. I never waste time playing video games, it's counter-productive. But the environment I am in is too comfortable for this to be of any success. It's not as good as talking about my “job” working in a design agency for example. This does not bode well for my future life, especially when my chosen career in illustration relies heavily in selling yourself as an individual. Mostly, my artwork reflect the complexities I go through in life and how it affects me, contorted caricatures of people, sometimes extensions of myself, to paintings of the cosmos to reflect my distancing away from my surroundings. The people I know don't know that, but you and I do. When approaching anything regarding work and making decisions for  myself in that area, I feel a great sense of enclosure and not in a comforting way. I haven't got anything to fall back on or back me up along the way. I am also very self aware of my surroundings in public, so I always go out with my headphones to distract me.

So a lot has happened in two months since making the decision to fix this.

How I have managed it for now by somewhat forcing myself to do things, not too often but enough to build on before my CBT takes hold. I am never comfortable with this process though it has yielded one good result. I found, via twitter, a group of creatives that meet-up bi-weekly. This turned out to be a good exercise in how I can handle a situation like the on I described above. I had one or two moments of like; “oh, what should I talk about now” as most of the group were graphic designers / illustrators my questions were very constrained. I had learnt quickly I was the only one without a job, they all had internships, mentors and / or prospering jobs etc, so that was at the forefront of my mind for most of the evening. I meet them again this Thursday.

Speaking.....typing of careers and work, this area is my most worrisome area. I have never formerly had a conventional job since my A-levels in 2004, or ever in my adult life. The idea of being in a constantly public place was and still is too taunting to me and worried how people I recognised would view me as. I do not believe at this time that I don't have the capacity to describe what my assets are. I don't believe that I possess many of them when I think about it but I do know I will be able to to when my CBT takes effect. This in-turn has made my job searching tastes very picky and I often come across that the requirements ultimately put me off applying. My most valuable experience was at an artspace which ended with me being swept under the rug so-to-speak after a year of being there, but it taught me a lot about my hometown's art scene and how it is such a push-pull part of my life right now. Most of the art is un-engaging but it is an area of great interest career wise. This has also given me the impetus to try and set-up an artspace beginning with those who are in a similar position like myself. A twitter friend came up with the idea of gaining support from a charity so we could establish ourselves, she had anxiety which has since been treated. So there's another avenue that I am keen to explore.

My family loosely knows about my position and I have no best friends to speak to about it, let alone reveal the truth. Right now, I am resting my hopes on these creatives meet-ups, my involvement with my local mental charity and the forthcoming CBT sessions. The pieces are there but my next challenge is to put them together.

If anyone is interested viewing my work (it's a shameless self plug but it helps) you will see how I convey my feelings, feel free to go here: [my art work](www.michaelclulee.co.uk)"

I'll have roughly 140+ credits, will be attending fall recruiting as a senior, save ~$20,000, and should have 3 college internships under my belt. I know some people here have gotten winter internships so graduating early would allow me to do this too. Has anyone had a negative experience with this or is a finance second major really what it's cracked up to be? I have no real intention of going into finance down the road. I also will experience 0 time unemployed if I can't find a job, as my dad owns his own insurance firm so I have a weak, but present safety net. 

So my questions... when is the winter recruitment period? Did anyone regret doing this? Is a finance double major worth the opportunity cost? Other than missing the stereotypical graduation experience will I miss anything else? Do I have a leg up on my competition for FT work?"

Welcome back from a long time without a Mailout. (hopefully won't happen again)  I hope you had an awesome spring break.  I for one definitely needed a break from the 2-test-2-paper-goto-GDC-gotta-be-in-a-wedding week right before spring break.  Sleeping longer than 4 hours felt good.

I learned a couple of things this break: 1) Gas is expensive.  2) Taxes are expensive.  3) Anything at the Renaissance Faire is expensive.  4) 6th during SXSW is expensive.  5) Going 60 in a 45 is expensive. 6) Avoiding all of those thing is not expensive.

On a more serious note, please be mindful of how you and those around you treat the super nice place we get to call home.  I've received messages discussing how some of the furniture in the building is requiring cleaning much earlier than anticipated.  While I know none of you would put muddy shoes on a sofa, be careful with how you treat furniture and what you do with your trash also well as keep an eye out for jerks that put muddy shoes on sofas.

So what's going on now that school's back in?

5:00-6:45pm

A great student once said, ""Wow, I think I have the perfect schedule next semester!""  This great student was no extraordinary person with super-human form populating capabilities  No, after attending an event, this perfectly normal student was given a power, a power of knowledge.  How can I attend such an event and gain the power of knowledge to become a great student with a perfect schedule and a perfect GPA and a perfect job and a perfect K/D ratio? Simple, you go to CS 378-101.  Hear about the components of a perfect schedule (read: short 5 min descriptions of electives) and meet the individuals who can make it happen (read: professors of those courses). Afterwards, get a little taste of what the perfect schedule tastes like (read: milk &amp; cookies and triangle-cut PB&amp;Js).  This is something you do not want to miss.

1akq16,1,2013-03-19,I feel like the world just hates me and will continue to do so. ,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1akq16/i_feel_like_the_world_just_hates_me_and_will/,"Just as the title suggests. It doesn't matter what it is about me, it just never seems to go right and/or isn't ideal. I have a lot of things going on in my life, so bare with my long explanation please. 

General: I'm a 21 year old college student

Education: I study political science. I've always been good with relating to people no matter how different they really are from me. All I want to do with my life is help people. I want to help other people like me out of poverty and to a good life. But unfortunately for me it seems like the only way I can get into politics or a decent job with a non-profit is if I graduated from Ivy League with a 4.0. Truth is I go to a shitty state school and I have a 3.07 GPA. As I see graduation coming I feel like I can say goodbye to my career dreams. Hell I can't even get an internship, let alone a real job in my field. On top of this I'm currently taking 18 credits of 400 level political science classes and studying for my GRE exam. I also work in my university's library 20 hours a week for a boss who threatens me daily and is very discriminatory about my gender (if you read til the end you will know more)

Personal Relationships: I haven't had a real relationship since I was 17. Haven't dated anyone since. I haven't had sex in a year and a half. Why? I'm scared to death of it. The last girl I slept with falsely accused me of rape and then proceeded to drag my name through the mud til she found out I tried to kill myself over it. Then she admitted that she lied after finding out. 

Family: I've never had much of a family. My mother is a good person, but she is an alcoholic and she has dated an abusive alcoholic most of my life. My father is controlling, like military controlling. He was psychologically and physically abusive to me growing up. I barely talk to them anymore. My only close family member is my brother and he lives 1500 miles away from me now. Its hard to keep in touch as he lives his own life now. 

Random: It kills me on almost a daily basis how I fucked everything up. Once upon a time I played football, basketball, baseball, and track. I was recruited for everything except baseball. I got a scholarship to Division I for track. I ran the 110m/400m hurdles, high jump, and 4x100 relay. High jump was my best event though. Why is this a problem right now? I couldn't handle college as a freshman, I let my anxiety and depression get the best of me and I failed out. Thus giving up my passion and scholarship. Every spring I get that itch to go out and run on the track again. But I can't do that anymore. I just pissed away my amazing physical gifts. 


The biggest issue: I'm a pre-op male-to-female transgender. I'm far past the point of questioning and I'm completely out to everyone in my life. No one at this point refers to me by my birth name and as a male, they all refer to me as a girl and by my girl name. Right now I'm currently waiting to see a doctor for my estrogen therapy. I'm seeing arguably the best doctor in the world in the field, but unfortunately she has a long waiting list. I've already been waiting three months, I've still got a month and half left to go. It hurts really bad inside every day to get up and look in the mirror. My body doesn't match who I am on the inside. The waiting game for the hormones is killing me inside.

Other than my general waiting for my hormones, there is a plethora of issue on my mind in relation. I've hid my being transgender from my family for the past two years (that is how long I've been out). Last month I came out to every family member. They all have been supportive, but its very overwhelming. I also have to worry about how I'm suppose to pay for everything, since insurance thinks its all cosmetic. I have to worry that I won't get a job because of who I am. I worry every time I leave my apartment that someone is going to insult me or attack me. I worry that I can't find a real boyfriend because it seems like every guy interested in me is some porn addicted freak trying to satisfy a fetish. My boss is discriminatory in the fact she won't call me my name or refer to me as a girl. This whole gender transition thing is majorly depressing. I wish I could just wake up tomorrow as a girl. 

All of these things together makes me feel like the weight of the world is constantly on my shoulders. Its been this way for years now. I see a therapist, but it doesn't help. Being that, what brings me to make my first post to this subreddit? I had a girlfriend of mine earlier style one of my wigs for me. It took her hours to do, so I decided to a take a pic with it on. I really loved the pic, I thought that I looked beautiful and for the first time in a long time I saw myself as a girl. There is a subreddit on here for transpeople where a person submits a photo of themselves trying to pass as their gender. The forum generally is positive and upvotes nearly everything no matter how much the person doesn't pass. I've submitted before and had a lot of success and positive comments. Being that, I submitted the photo I took. I was feeling really happy and good about myself prior to that. I posted it and within ten minutes I was downvoted into oblivion. I know I shouldn't care about such ridiculous things like upvote/downvoting, but for someone like me, passing as my gender is everything and for me to look that fucking bad kind of kills me inside. When I saw how many downvotes I had, I deleted it and promptly cried. Needless to say, I think I'm going to avoid the transgender subreddits for a while. 

I'm sorry if this was too long. Thank you so much if you read all of it. I've just never felt this depressed in my life and I kind of needed to talk to someone about everything. Either way, I think I'm going to go cry myself to sleep now :(

I appreciate whatever advice you can give me. I'm a second-year biology student a highly ranked public university. I came in with honors and from top percent of my high school class and I'm generally described as a bright guy. Lately my grades have been slipping, leading me to a 3.25 gpa, but this quarter I'm looking at pretty much all Cs and Ds. There's one class I need to pass in order to even get my biology degree (it's a lower-div requirement, and if I get below a C then I have to choose a different major), and right now my grade is a 24%. The average is about a 60%. If I get 100% on the final then my raw score will only be a 64. Basically, without a serious curve I'm at risk of not even getting a biology degree. I'm below the average in all my other classes and I dropped oChem last month because I failed the first test. I just got fired from my research internship because I didn't put enough effort into it, and I got rejected from a returning student leadership position just because I missed my interview appointment. I like science and learning, and I'm captivated by the idea of going into research but I don't know if I'm just lying to myself. I put off my work until the last minute, sometimes really screwing myself over because I'm rushing into class late with unfinished assignments. I don't know what I want to do with my life, and whenever I ask myself I shrug and procrastinate. If I'm not half-assing a project or studying, then I'm mentally or literally masturbating. I find myself lurking on Reddit more than ever, and some weeks I go with barely any sleep and I let my room become a mess. I don't think I'm depressed so much as apathetic, but it's really stressing me out and I hate myself for not being the person I want to be! And I hate myself for not even having a real idea of who I want to be! I'm scared of confronting this hole that I've dug myself, and I've started to lie to my girlfriend and my parents about my grades. I'm starting to feel sick thinking about the mess I'm in and I could really use some advice, Reddit. Why am I doing this to myself? I want to stop being so apathetic, but thinking about my other actions as of late, I think the only thing I ever really want is approval. I'm sad and angry and I want help!"

Theres a giant fear in me because I know shes going to try to see me next week when she visits town. She wants to work on being friends and move on.. I need to gather the courage to say It's not a good idea. I just dont want to get hurt more. Since she broke up with me, Ive checked this subreddit every single day, I guess it makes me feel better to know that I'm not alone. Ive googled everything about breakups. Ive read everything out there. I blocked her from popping up on my facebook newsfeed but I wont defriend her. Now, Everytime I logon i see her in the chat area, with the green circle or the mobile img. I always want to click but I never do. I just wont let myself do it. FB always puts her name first when she likes my friends status. I think it doesnt understand that we broke up, It just knows that I used to talk to her a lot so it thinks we are best friends. 

I just don't know what to do with myself I think im falling into depression. Ive thought about going to the campus counseling but I know ultimately they cant get her back to me. They would only help me focus on me.  Ive kept NC only breaking it once to send a letter 3 weeks into the breakup. The fact that she hasnt said anything to me since she broke up with me hurts. I thought I could always count on her to talk to about life. Everyone else is leaving me in the dark. I don't have that many friends and no one seems to be texting me or fb chatting me anymore. I feel alone. The thoughts and memories of her are always on my mind. I wish I could just go back to being happy. I wish I was still with her. 

She said It wasn't my fault, I didn't do anything wrong and I dont need to change and that I am a good guy but she cant be with me anymore. I cant stop wishing that I was a different person, whatever she wanted me to be. Then we both could be happy. Sometimes I wish one day I would find a post from her here, but she doesnt even use reddit. I feel like if she ever knew just how much time i spent moping about her she would think im so pathetic and that I need to move on. Im convinced she doesn't think about me everyday. It's so different for the one who initiates the break up.

I live life day by day now. I go to school, I do my work, I workout but shes always in my mind. She'll never leave. Im scared to see her again when she gets back from her internship, I don't want to just be friends like she wants.

Ill still be here for you guys. I read your stories everyday. Ill comment on your posts and try to help you, I know you hurt like I do. I want everyone to get better."

I appreciate whatever advice you can give me. I'm a second-year biology student a highly ranked public university. I came in with honors and from top percent of my high school class and I'm generally described as a bright guy. Lately my grades have been slipping, leading me to a 3.25 gpa, but this quarter I'm looking at pretty much all Cs and Ds. There's one class I need to pass in order to even get my biology degree (it's a lower-div requirement, and if I get below a C then I have to choose a different major), and right now my grade is a 24%. The average is about a 60%. If I get 100% on the final then my raw score will only be a 64. Basically, without a serious curve I'm at risk of not even getting a biology degree. I'm below the average in all my other classes and I dropped oChem last month because I failed the first test. I just got fired from my research internship because I didn't put enough effort into it, and I got rejected from a returning student leadership position just because I missed my interview appointment. I like science and learning, and I'm captivated by the idea of going into research but I don't know if I'm just lying to myself. I put off my work until the last minute, sometimes really screwing myself over because I'm rushing into class late with unfinished assignments. I don't know what I want to do with my life, and whenever I ask myself I shrug and procrastinate. If I'm not half-assing a project or studying, then I'm mentally or literally masturbating. I find myself lurking on Reddit more than ever, and some weeks I go with barely any sleep and I let my room become a mess. I don't think I'm depressed so much as apathetic, but it's really stressing me out and I hate myself for not being the person I want to be! And I hate myself for not even having a real idea of who I want to be! I'm scared of confronting this hole that I've dug myself, and I've started to lie to my girlfriend and my parents about my grades. I'm starting to feel sick thinking about the mess I'm in and I could really use some advice, Reddit. Why am I doing this to myself? I want to stop being so apathetic, but thinking about my other actions as of late, I think the only thing I ever really want is approval. I'm sad and angry and I want help!"

At a pivotal moment in my undergrad I have been offered two different position and need to decide by Friday which one to take, and I am nearly making myself sick over it. Redditors with your endless wisdom help a girl out!

Some quick background, I am a 21 female CSE major at a large university, both of these positions are internships.

Job 1: In the city where I attend school, and of course where all my friends are. The position begins April 1 and I have technically already accepted it (before I found out I was offered the other one). Anyways this position is appealing because I could stay here and I would be working on the accessibility of the software this company develops, definitely something I am interested in experiencing. The office is very traditional and they seem to be very eager to have me seeing as they offered me the job the day after my interview. I could definitely see myself enjoying my time here. 

Job 2: In the city I was raised (would be living with my parents, not ideal but not awful). This company does exactly the kind of software I hope to work on after graduation. I am hesitant because 1) I would miss my friends (I know I have some serious FOMO going on) and 2) I am fairly certain I was only hired because they have ZERO female employees in the engineering department. In fact the entire company only has females in the HR dept and reception, not exactly exciting for me. Also this office operates a little less traditionally (by which I mean scooters and nerf guns) which from my perspective isn't a great work environment but I realize that's a lame excuse. 

Reddit I just don't know what to do! Job #1 in the #2 location or job #2 in the #1 location. I realize I am young and have a whole career ahead of me but this could be a very pivotal moment for me and I am paralyzed by the fear of making the wrong decision.

Do any of you think you made a wrong decision based on location? Mind you the cities are two hours apart so its not like I couldn't go back and forth on the weekends. I am just so torn!"

We've only been married for 6 months. We are very much in love and we are great together, but my problems seem to weigh him down so much, specially my anxiety and fibromyalgia.

I haven't graduated yet. I've had severe depression and he's always been there for me. I've had many jobs, and there was a time I actually succeeded, but since my pain began everything just went downhill.
Four years ago I had an ""accident"", I was drinking with him and fell on my ass. It was really funny until next day I could barely walk, and I realized I had broken my coccyx, and the doctor just told me to rest for a few weeks and put ice on it, but my pain never fully went away. A couple of years after the accident it became unbearable, to the point I couldn't get out of bed and had to leave work (I was an english teacher) and college. 

In a year I did get better and get back to work, found a job I loved in a great family company where everyone loved me... but soon it all came back, so I had to leave. It was really disappointing, especially because I felt horrible for the company who had just put so much work into me. Around the same time I was really depressed and decided to leave my college course, which I hated. He supported me fully and helped me follow my dreams. I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia (and the accident had just triggered it), after going to many doctors who didn't believe me because all my tests were normal. 

Another year went by and I was feeling better again. I was in a new college, studying what I love, and had found an internship I loved too. Then I got an awesome job offer: a company I really wanted to work for had decided to open an internship spot for me, because they loved me so much and I didn't have time for a full time job (because of school). I was thrilled! But then... all over again. This time was worse because I was so miserable there I didn't even want to go. 
They didn't know exactly what to do with me so I was working as a filler and I had to carry heavy stuff all the time. I told my manager that I could not carry it because it hurt me and he just said ""well, don't"", which isn't easy to do when you're trying to do a good job and dirty plates keep piling up beside you and no one takes them to the kitchen. Also people have always looked at me weirdly when I say I'm in pain because it's invisible - I've gotten so used to it you can't tell I'm in that much pain. So a lot of people just think I'm making excuses. Anyway, I stopped even showing up after a month... which is really unlike me.

It's been 8 months and I'm completely terrified of looking for new jobs. I've applied myself to studying and I want to do a masters... But I don't want to depend on my husband! He works so hard and I'd like to be able to contribute... but every time I even think about working I get freaked out. My anxiety is getting worse and I'm starting to miss classes (and lie to him about it because I'm so ashamed), having panic attacks, sleeping terribly. I feel another bout of depression coming and I can't handle anything in my life anymore. I'm on medication and psychiatric treatment, he is really sweet and supportive... But I feel like my depression, anxiety and pain are weighing him down. He deserves to work less, not to worry about me and to be completely happy. I'm afraid I'll never be able to contribute.

I don't even know what to do anymore. We are in a good place in our relationship but we are not exactly happy because I'm not happy, and he loves me so much I know he keeps his pain inside not to trouble me. I want to help him be happy.

Oh, and my pain has horribly affected our sex life. It used to be amazing, then it started to be painful, and now I get so nervous when he touches me that we barely ever have sex. Probably once every 2 weeks when I'm drunk and feel no pain/anxiety. I really miss the intimacy. I miss being close to the love of my life... And I feel like we're slowly drifting apart. :(

Why can't I just be normal? I have everything I could ever want and need, and I just lose it or ruin it or make it sad. I know it's not my fault but it's hard not to blame yourself when there's no one to blame. I just want to be able to do normal things, even the smallest things are SO HARD for me! I have all this capability and intelligence locked inside a depressed brain and a weak failing body. ARGH.

I know I should be happy, I am going to college without that much debt, having fun, getting good grades, I have a part time job that allows me to have a life, etc...

But I just hate it. I have a crappy job as a student fundraisor for my school, where I get bitched at by everyone I am calling, and then bitched at my my manager because I let the unemployed psych major go because she had to rush about and get her three kids to bed without asking for all four levels of money. I feel so shitty about what I am doing, I can't stand it. I only have $500 to my name that I can spend, and &amp;250 will soon be spent because a ""friend"" of mine was smoking in my dorm's bathroom, and when he was cought claimed I told him it was okay (yeah, that never happoned.)

And I am pursueing a double major in History and Geography, because I enjoy both subjects and I am too stupid for the math required for the good majors. Honestly I would be better off dropping out and starting to work at McDonalds now, but my parents would be devastated. On both sides of my family, everyone fucking went to college, I am always compared to my cousins (3 engineering students, a Physics major, and a nurse). My parents don't know that I chose such shitty subjects, because they would never accept it. 

I thought I was on the right track, I was all prim and proper throughout High School, got decent grades, studied what needed to be studied, easily found out that I love History and Geography, got accepted to every college I applied to, got a near-full ride to an okay school, chose to go there because my parent's expected me to pay for it by myself. 

I am about to just call it, and drop out. I don't give a fuck anymore. Every day I am reminded that no matter what my shitty BAs in History and Geography won't mean SHIT. I have had it. Don't even want to finish my reading for tomarrow. I love history, and love geography, I have enjoyed all of my classes this past year, enjoyed the freedom, made new friends, but it is all for naught. Every day I go in for work I am reminded just how fucking pointless it is. I talk to liberal arts graduates with no job, working in wawa, or getting paid $7/hour to scrub urinals as a ""History Intern"". 

I can't seem to find another job. Work-study job are only available to those who have an inside connection and the rest just ignore my application and resume. I worked my Junior and Senior year in high school, had a internship at a federal agency during High School, have excellent references, and a fairly strong resume. 

Fuck me, right?"

1akldc,3,2013-03-18,I need some career advice. Currently a graphic designer..,X-23,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1akldc/i_need_some_career_advice_currently_a_graphic/,"Hey there, Reddit. 

So I'm 21, and am currently a project manager/graphic designer/web designer at a small web design &amp; online marketing company. I get paid $9.00 an hour. I started a year ago, and then I was being paid $9.00 but my boss demoted me for a bit because project management wasn't working out. I started working as a project manager again in late October I think, and since then I've been making $8.50. I only recently(this past week) got back to $9.00 an hour. 

I got this job because I did a two month long unpaid internship, and my boss thought I had potential and hired me. 

This is like my first job, the only other job I had was volunteer work for about a year at a special ed elementary school.

I'm not making enough, and I doubt I'll ever make enough since I only just barely got back to where I began. The thing is, I like this job, it's what I'd like to do for the rest of my life. I want to be a graphic/web designer. I just need more money so that my life is more comfortable. I don't know whether to stay or find some job at starbucks and make more. 

Our programmers in India were swamped with transferring old websites to responsive templates, and I volunteered to my boss to work on one of the websites since I was confident I could do it. He didn't really believe me, but we made the deal that if I could do it he would only pay me $10 an hour for 6 hours max. So I got it done and he paid me the $60. The thing is, after that, he wanted me to do the same thing, transferring content from client websites to responsive templates. But then he wanted me to do it in the office for $8.50 an hour. And I can't help but feel a bit used. 

I don't know what to do. I like this job, I'm comfortable. But I feel like my boss doesn't value me at all even though he needs me. I'm the only graphic designer, and the only one in the office with knowledge of HTML(we outsource this stuff).

I just want to know what my value actually is, and what you guys think I should do next?

&gt;Perform on-site or remote diagnosing of hardware related and software problems using highly integrated diagnostic tools and techniques with elevated privileges.

&gt;Maintain up to date structured diagrams for the specification of databases, communication systems, servers, storage area networks or any other infrastructure service.

&gt;Make recommendations on new maintenance procedures, services, protocols and security practices.

&gt;Manage and implement best practices for maintenance and operation procedures for the support of databases, applications, hardware systems, operating systems and network systems.

&gt;Create documentation at the onset of an infrastructure initiative and maintain such documentation through the project lifecycle in preparation for operational handoff.

&gt;Assist managing and implementing the IS architecture plan, ensuring the IS infrastructure meets existing and future requirements.

&gt;Assist in the maintenance of policies and procedures for IS administration to ensure consistency and adherence to standards.

1akkx5,4,2013-03-18,"I got street harassed, I reacted badly, and now I think my harasser might be staking me out by my apartment building. Any advice? [TRIGGER: stalking, harassment]",secretagentemeline,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1akkx5/i_got_street_harassed_i_reacted_badly_and_now_i/,"I just moved to Washington, D.C. from a smaller city out west to do a semester-long internship. While I've been harassed on the street at home, I feel like it's been more frequent and more virulent while I've been here. It happens at all times of day, regardless of what I'm wearing (not that it matters, whatsoever) and in all sorts of situations and locations. I'm usually pretty good at putting up my bullshit blinders and just ignoring street harassing scumbags, but a recent street harassment incident has left me really scared, really intimidated and really pissed off.

I was on my way back from a yoga class on Sunday afternoon when, not twenty feet from the front door to my apartment building, a man standing on the corner whistled at me. 

Again, usually, I just ignore this stuff and refuse to engage with that kind of behavior, but something happened this time that made me snap. I was physically tired, from my class, but also tired of feeling unsafe, freaked out and sad every time I leave my apartment. I flipped him off as I walked away, without looking back. He immediately shouted, ""Asshole!"" back at me. (Not what I was expecting from a street harasser -- I've heard ""bitch"" and ""whore"" before but such a gender-neutral insult was surprising). Again, out of character, I yelled back to him, ""No, you're the asshole!"" as I walked into my building.

I immediately regretted it and wished that I had just ignored him, but I forgot about it pretty quickly and went on with my life. 

However, when I was getting off the Metro on the way back from work tonight (Monday), I saw the same man standing at the top of the escalators with another man. (I should note that my apartment building is right above this Metro stop -- the place where I saw him again is about 30 feet from where the whistling happened). Luckily, I was with a friend, and as I passed by him, I deliberately didn't make eye contact or even look in his direction, and when I glanced back, he wasn't looking at me. It's pretty normal for people to hang out under the covered area by the escalators, but something just made me feel like he was waiting for someone.

I want to think that my response somehow deterred him from harassing other people, and that all of this can just be chalked up to some huge coincidence -- maybe he lives or works around here and we just overlap because we share a neighborhood. But I've always been told to follow my instincts, and something about this feels weird.

I guess I'm just trying to figure out if I'm reading too much into this, if I'm blowing it up too much or not enough, if I should get the police involved, if I should tell my building's front desk/security people. I've kind of thought that maybe I should see if he's hanging around the next few nights and proceed from there, but is that risky, or the right move at this point? I would really, really appreciate any advice, feedback, stories, etc. I know I'm not alone in this, but it sure feels that way.

**TL;DR A guy whistled at me as I was walking into my apartment, I flipped him off and a small shouting match ensued. Saw the same man near my apartment tonight. Wondering if I should be concerned.**

I'm a Junior at the University of Pittsburgh, and I have zero fashion sense.

But it has come time for internships and jobs that require professional attire.  I've googled professional junior attire, and I've browsed the websites of stores that are near me attempting to piece together outfits suitable for internships...except I'm having a really hard time finding anything! Maybe it's my poor fashion sense, but it seems like everything is either too casual or weird or just doesn't fit for an office. In case you need an idea of what is around here, I've looked at Forever 21, Charlotte Russe, Kohls, Wet Seal, American Eagle, etc.

I've seen people on reddit who love to online shop and have offered to help find outfits that someone is looking for, so I was hoping that maybe someone could help me by doing this. I really want to improve my closet. (**sigh** If only I could have a personal shopper haha!) Cost is not an issue, but I'd rather not pay $50 for a blazer if I can help it!

About me: I'm 5'3"", pale, 100lbs, pear-shaped I suppose, and my cup size is a 32A. Also...I have a terrible time walking in heels. Are flats acceptable or should I start practicing for heels??

[Trigger warning for stalking/street harassment]",[deleted],AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1akghr/im_so_sick_of_street_harassment_it_happens_a_lot/,"I just moved to Washington, DC from a smaller city in the west, and since I've been here I've been getting cat-called and street harassed all the time -- riding the Metro to my internship, on my way back from the grocery store, etc. This rarely happened in my hometown, and while I'm pretty good at putting up my bullshit blinders and not letting it get to me, an incident last weekend has scared me, intimidated me and made me fear for my safety.

The day before yesterday (Sunday) I was on my way home from a yoga class and just steps from the front door to my apartment building when a man standing on the corner whistled at me. Again, these smaller cat calls (not to say that any form street harassment is less serious than another) usually don't receive a response from me, as I feel like I shouldn't even dignify their bullshit with a response. But I was tired -- physically from my class, and tired of being harangued like my body is a public object that is somehow open to commentary -- and I snapped. I flipped him off as I walked away, not looking back. Immediately, he called out, ""Asshole!"" Then, without hesitating, I shouted back, ""You're the asshole!"" Not the most tactful response, but it felt like I was a branch snapping under the weight of months of this behavior. 

I immediately regretted it and wished that I had completely ignored him, but I didn't think anything of it until I came back from work tonight (Monday). As I was getting off the Metro (luckily I was with a friend) I saw him standing at the top of the escalators with another man. It's pretty normal for people in my neighborhood to hang out under the covered area by the escalators down to the Metro, and it was raining tonight, but it felt looked like he was standing there waiting for someone. 

I want to believe deep down that somehow my comeback opened his mind to how offensive, rude and gross street harassing is, or that it at least put him off it, that he wasn't waiting outside the Metro for me, that he just lives around here and it's all a coincidence. However, a big part of me feels like I've provoked a violent reaction in a person who obviously has a hard time with respecting boundaries, and I'm afraid of what could happen as a result of that. I'm also afraid of jumping the gun and filing a police report or talking to the front desk/security folks at my apartment building, just in case this is a total coincidence. I thought maybe I should wait a few more nights to see if it keeps happening. Luckily, I'm going out of town this weekend so I'll have some safe-time away from here. Most of all, I guess I'm just freaked out that he knows where I live and where I commute. It makes me feel unsafe in my home and in my body, and that really sucks.

Should I even be worried about seeing him tonight? Am I blowing this up, or should I be blowing this up? Is it worth reporting to the police at this point or should I wait to see what happens tomorrow night? Is pepper spray or some other self-defense mechanism a good investment at this point? 

**TL;DR Got street harassed outside my apartment building, responded with my middle finger and a small shouting match ensued, saw harasser again the next night right by my apartment building, felt like he was waiting for me. Super freaked out and trying to figure out the next step. **

1akepr,0,2013-03-18,[26/m] not understanding what my capricious relationship with my interest is exactly [25/f],PsyLaw,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1akepr/26m_not_understanding_what_my_capricious/,"So I met this girl in May 2012 through, of all people, my mom's friend. She introduced me to her employee (school tutor and student) and asked if I could help her with the LSAT, since I'm currently in law school. She is very capricious, and we're now 2 career choices past law school... I had just gotten out of a terrible, abusive (Her to me. She had borderline personality disorder) relationship with my ex. 

I was instantly attracted to her. Beautiful, witty, funny, head on straight, and now a college grad. Unfortunately, we met the summer before I moved 5 hours away to attend law school. We never really established anything other than dating which later became more of a friend zone thing. We eventually started calling more and more. 

In November, we finally admitted that we had feelings for each other. We would talk for hours almost every night. In fact she helped reassure me that I was going to be fine on my finals; that I'm way too smart not to do well. Come winter break, I come home and finally we get to see each other. Kissing led to heavy petting, but she stopped it since we really had no where to be other than my car. I was okay with that. After a week and a half of that, she called me to tell me that she just isn't ready. She really likes me, but she needs me to be her friend for now until she's ready. I said I understood. I didn't...
 
I guess I never treated her as a friend. She was still sweet to me and we talked romantically quite a bit. I may have smothered her a bit by sending her a stuffed animal, candy, and a really long overly emotional letter (Feb 2013) telling her how great she was and how I would wait for her (mistake). She soon got weird after that and became very distant. She wouldn't answer my calls (never more than 1 call within 2 days). She ignored my texts. We finally got to talking and se said that she just doesn't feel the same way she did when she talks to me now. 

Fair enough. I accepted it. I gave her plenty of space and prepared to move on. Well... I came home for spring break (last week), and I texted her... She called me about an hour later to see how I was doing. I was short and mentioned that I was well. She told me she was at her best friends for a get together. About 1 that night she ""accidentally"" called and hung up. I returned the call, and she apologized for accidentally calling. She told me that she missed me and was glad I was home. I said I missed her too and I let her go. About an hour later her friend ""accidentally"" calls me from her phone. She just said sorry. About an hour later she calls me and said she may have drank a little too much, but she didn't want to stay there. She asked if I could get her. Then she immediately changed her mind and said that she didn't trust herself with me. I said that I was already in the car. Anyway...

I get there and she got in my car. She seemed happy to see me. When we go to her neighborhood, I asked her if I should drop her off right away, or park around the corner (implying that we would sit and talk). She elected to park around the corner. She then asked me if she could give me a hug, and she gave me the sweetest 10 second hug ever. We got flirty, we kissed. She seemed a bit apprehensive, but she still kept leaning in. We talked until sunrise and I dropped her off and kissed her goodnight.  

Her family (and my own) being in town kept us from seeing each other the rest of the week. We still texted back and forth and talked on the phone, which was reassuring. But then Sunday came and I had to leave back to school... I texted her and no response... I have no idea what she's thinking. She is a good girl, and I know she is old fashioned and decent. I have no reason to think that there is someone else. She's mentioned that she has a commitment issue. She isn't even comfortable with us kissing or messing around because we're not committed. She's mentioned before that she doesn't want to be a distraction to me and my studies. The night I picked her up she was counting how many minutes I spent with her and made a comment about how I'm not always around. 

This summer, I have a job back home as an intern. She's getting her teaching certificate, so we will both be home. I have no idea what to do. She hates being backed into a corner and has a really tough time making hard decisions. She also hates confrontation. She is a complicated girl, but I really care about her. Sorry about the long post. Please advise..."

This is my first 48 hours sober in over three months and its given me a little too much time to articulate my thoughts. I'm drying up for a week or two until I get accustomed with working again and then it's back to destroying myself.

Anyway, life is somewhat grand. I'll be making decent money again, I have an internship this summer, and I'm going away to nice private school in the fall to finish my accountancy degree. Despite this, the only reason I'm doing any of it is so that I can fund my drinking habits. Any sort of real interpersonal relationships utterly exhaust me. I don't have the energy neither sober nor drunk to maintain actually caring about someone else when I have so much on my own plate to take care of. Adding someone else into the picture seems detrimental.

However knowing this doesn't really explain why I can't fully reach peace with this lifestyle. The only thing I can think of is that because it doesn't fit in with societal norms, it's causing a conflict. "

TL;DR: Does it make that big of a deal if the place you go to school is far from where you want to end up?"

CompSci major.",[deleted],SyracuseU,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyracuseU/comments/1ak5qx/advice_not_sure_what_to_do_big_move_compsci_major/,"Hi everyone, just wanted to thank you ahead of time for any advice. I have been accepted into the LCS CompSci program for Fall as a transfer student. I currently live in Texas and this will be a big move for me to a place where I have no family for at least close to 2000 miles, so I'm trying to be very careful in planning! I really like Syracuse and I miss cold weather (I'm English, and have lived in Texas for 9 years) so that isn't an issue for me. I'm fairly certain I can get in a CompSci-related paid internship with my current employer in the vicinity, but it will be a big pay cut for me (it pays roughly $900 a month working about 15 hours a week during the school semester, then full time outside of that). It has no benefits, and I currently have a $400 a month car payment so my bills are high at the moment. I think I could work out a refinance or figure that out. I have my financial aid letter from SU and it covers a nice chunk of tuition, but I think I can get it re-evaluated if I take a very large pay cut to an internship. I also have a small dog, non-aggressive breed and won't get bigger than 30lb.

I am currently financially flexible but I definitely won't be going forward if I make the leap. So I guess my main question is, do I make the leap? There are alternative schools here where I currently live in Texas, but I think I have my heart set on SU and the Upstate NY area after trips there. Thank you so much.

1ap5n3,1,2013-03-20,When is it okay to send in a revised resume? Background inside...,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ap5n3/when_is_it_okay_to_send_in_a_revised_resume/,"Background:

I have been accepted to a Counseling MA program, and about a month ago went for an interview for a graduate assistantship that has the potential to pay for all of my tuition for the next 2 years. I had not heard back from the department, so I called my interviewer, got her secretary, and left a message thanking her for the interview and asking if the assistantship had been filled. 

Strangely (or so I thought), my call was not returned but I did receive an e-mail this morning from my interviewer (and my interview was on February 22, just for time-reference's sake). She informed me that they are still reviewing applicants and would get back to me as soon as they could.

A few questions...    
**1)** They're still reviewing/interviewing applicants...does that necessarily mean that they're still looking for someone they want, and it wasn't me?    
**2)** Should I take this opportunity to e-mail her back, thank her, express that I am EXTREMELY interested in this position and eager to hear back from her?    
**3)** My resume has been updated since my initial interview (I began an internship several days after). Is it in bad taste to e-mail my revised resume? I don't want it to make me look bad, or like I was unprepared the first time; but at the same time, I'm a 21-year-old undergrad with limited job experience and I want to give myself a fighting chance for this assistantship.

Obviously, I am a little inexperienced with the whole interview/job search thing. I meet the qualifications for this position, but I know that I look inexperienced due to the fact that I'm not out of undergrad yet and I just want someone to give me a chance. How do I give myself a fighting chance to get this assistantship? I really want the department to know how interested I am in this position; not even for the money, but because it is a position I am extremely interested in doing as a career and would love the experience.

1ap5mg,1,2013-03-20,I quit my first post-college job after a year and am reentering the job market. I need some opinions on taking an unpaid internship to build up my resume for an industry I wish to work in... ,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ap5mg/i_quit_my_first_postcollege_job_after_a_year_and/,"I graduated from a mid-level state university in November of 2011 with dual degrees in political science and psychology. During college I had only one internship (really regret not doing more...) which was related to psychology.

After a full-time exhaustive job search lasting about three months I was offered a position in a PR firm. The firm needed to fill an entry-level position that was related to the 2012 election, essentially they needed someone to do the inglorious leg-work, research, etc. I was glad to take any offer and happy to accept the low pay they offered, which was essentially a stipend, just enough to get by. 

I was being contracted (did not receive benefits) in intervals, 3 months, 4 months, just whatever set intervals worked for them, and declined to accept an extension for a contract past February (so the title isn't exactly correct, I didn't quit). The rationale was that I had a year's worth of work for a prestigious firm on my resume, an opportunity I will be forever grateful for, but did not in anyway feel fulfilled by the work. The job was very antithetical to my nature and could foresee that if I stayed in the firm I would have been miserable. Life's too short, we already work an absurd amount of our time so it might as well be something that I enjoy or at least tolerate doing, right? 

Anyways, after the job was over I traveled for a month. I got back last week and have started my job search again. As I try to find something I would gladly spend at least 1/3 of my waking hours doing, I have run into the expected roadblocks. I wish to be involved with an industry that relies on some type of creative input - creative writing (whether it be in journalism, an editorial position, or even working as a publisher) would be ideal. I've also been applying to radio (NPR, PRI, etc) and publishing houses (just to be close to the process would satisfy me). It's hard to exactly spell out jobs that I would desire but I know it when I see it. 

To have any type of role in these industries that isn't related to sales or administrative work requires previous experience. **My question is:** what would the pros and cons be of accepting an unpaid internship in one of these industries after already having post-college work experience? Would this look strange on a resume? If I was to sit down in a room with an interviewer, or even give an elevator pitch, I would be able to explain why I am willing to take this (seemingly) step backwards to pursue a passion. But on an application, it may appear odd. 

A very important side note - I wouldn't be supported by my parents or anyone else. I would most likely have to work weekend nights as a bartender or waiter to be able to pay the rent. My student loans are deferred until October, but that will come up sooner than I imagine so I also need to keep that in mind. I am more than willing to work long hours, to essentially have no free time, so long as I am doing something I love. An internship would most like be 6 months or less, so I think I could tough out an extremely stressful few months to be able to get a foot in the door in a desired industry.

Is this realistic? Am I living in a fantasy world? I always assumed that I would be able to find a job I love ""sometime in the future,"" after I put in my dues as a young adult. It would be heartbreaking to learn that I'm forced to be in an undesired, soul-crushing job for the rest of my life, while even at a young age I was willing to put in the effort for a better position.

If there is a better subreddit for this let me know. BTW - I'm 23. "

Warning:  this is not your typical red-blooded celebration of success with females – in fact, it is all personal.

We all know that the best way to combat urges is to stay busy, but how do we cope when high activity is not an option?

While stricken with the Flu these past three days, I pondered this question.  Through the aches, nausea, resurfacing of my respiratory lining aka asthmatic coughing, and general misery, I looked endlessly for distractions, but stayed strong and purposeful in choosing them.  Previously, when not zoning out in front of the TV, I used to fap to feel some temporary euphoria, pass the time, and simply heat up my body when necessary (don’t act like you don’t miss it on cold nights too).  This time around, I actually took care of some minor matters, and administered my regimen of visual and auditory stimuli, in a deliberate fashion.

As around 100 hours of my time are generally accounted for each week (work, school, internship, fitness &amp; hobbies) I made it pretty far in this attempt at NoFap (34 days at onset of symptoms) without any serious crisis of commitment, so I was well prepared for the ordeal.  I truly realize now that one of the most important skills that I have been cultivating while living NoFap is constructive mitigation of boredom, and distraction from destructive urges of all kinds.  I am glad to say that in spite of my weariness of body and fogginess of mind, I was lucid enough to discover that the method to alleviate the symptoms of sickness and addiction are one and the same, and that I was consequently equipped with the tools to deal with both simultaneously.  Yet another facet to the diamond-in-the-rough that is NoFap?

Admittedly, I was not as productive as I would have liked to be on otherwise normal day stuck at home, but what I accomplished was more than I ever had on such an occasion.  I caught up on some important emails, started the process of organizing my various journals and sundry, and set up a new system of self-accountability – a task I had been waiting for a rainy day to do anyway.  Most significantly for me, this here is one of my first real posts on a forum of any kind, as I still struggle with some social anxiety (not even internet forums are quite anonymous enough for me).  This is testament to not only the progress that I have made towards overcoming some especially irrational aspects of my anxiety, but to the energy and perseverance that I have cultivated while living NoFap.

Thanks for reading, folks, and keep writing too.

Until next time, 
fap not, Fapstronauts!"

I found I still have some Arctic Silver 5 thermal paste left over from doing the X-clamp fix to my xbox so I probably won't buy the listed thermal compound. I also have a segate 500GB external HDD I might salvage and place inside this build, its been gathering dust since I bought a 2 TB backup drive.

Edit: Also is a mid tower good for this or will I need a full tower?"
1ap2de,6,2013-03-20,"I (23m) am completely depressed with my gf (25f) of 4 years. Please help, I can't handle this anymore. ",-Illumination-,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ap2de/i_23m_am_completely_depressed_with_my_gf_25f_of_4/,"Hello reddit.

So my girlfriend and I met online in 2009. Live in the same city, actually met through a friend who was into BDSM (we were both active in the community at the time), hit it off. Totally connect, amazing sex, similar future paths. We were in college at the time. She's pretty, hilarious, has introduced me to some amazing stuff and on the whole is just totally mentally stimulating. I truly love her as a human being.

She's in her final year, I am done and have a solid intro job (save about 1000 a month). 

My girlfriend suffers from depression and when her mom moved away across the country and gave her 2 weeks notice to leave, she started to withdraw in the winter of 2011. We got a place and she seemed to warn up and her depression faded in February. Her stepfather admitted to her in April that he was a serious alcoholic and I think this sent her into a harder depression, but by May things seemed to seriously be ok. I helped her in every way I could. Even took 2 weeks vacation off of work just to help her through it. 

My mother died of pancreatic cancer in June and I basically had a mental breakdown for almost 3 months. I was incredibly close with my mom and for like 10 weeks I could barely eat, I cried every day, etc. She was only 38 years old and it really just broke my heart. 

Instead of supporting me my girlfriend got so upset that she was like going into the bathroom and throwing up. She hated being around me. Her support waned after about 5 days.  Ever since then she has been incredibly passive aggressive.

The slightest thing that never bothered her before, like me forgetting to fill the car with gasoline or do the dishes, causes her to totally shut down and go ""I think you should leave for a little while."" When I prod further she just starts crying and goes ""Get the fuck out of the room, please."" At this point she is inconsolable. Sometimes for minutes, sometimes for days.

At this point I honestly think she is just totally broken as a human being and I don't know why. We've only had sex 5 times since June and last time was early December and ended with her crying mid-intercourse. The last time we had pleasurable sex was October, when I took her on a trip to PA.

I feel like everything about our relationship is just gone. I'm out of college now so I don't really have my college friendbase to associate with even though we play online games and such a few days a week and I have about 4-5 friends locally that I enjoying being with. 

My girlfriend at this point has lost connection with all of her friends. She doesn't hang out with anyone, including her family whom she was previously very close with.

I am honestly afraid to come home some days because I feel like I might make some mistake like forget to feed the dog or do the dishes and she'll just guilt me or threaten to leave the house if I don't go out for a few hours.

There are periods of lucidity where she with collapse and tell me how horrible she's been. We'll make up. But in a few weeks it always ends up the same as it is now.

I think we're done. It's kind of hard to accept but I reached out to my best friend and he's willing to move out her for an internship for 2 years and live with me in September. I've considered it seriously.

I really love this woman. And I wish I could salvage it but she seems so emotionally broken and I just have no idea what caused it. I don't know if that's what is causing her pain or if she feels like I'm not reliable because of my mother's deaths affect on me 

What used to be texts of ""I love you~ Want to go out tonight?"" and ""Hey so I got this crazy thing from the adult store. Come into the bathroom when you get home."" has become ""My head hurts. Kind of feel dead."" and ""I honestly can't stand working anymore."" I am honestly concerned about her. She has not exhibited any self-harm at all. 


I have tried **repeatedly** to get her into therapy for almost a year and a half now. It is not working, she refuses to go. There is always an excuse.

I am at my wits end. Please, any advice or experience is welcome and very, very accepted.

Tl;dr

-Mom died, broke down
-Girlfriend basically treated me like shit over it
-Girlfriend has had some horrible experiences, is pretty much broken spirited, won't seek therapy
-Am honestly concerned about her well being
-Don't know what to do. It just feels so over."

This state is not willing to send me a new one, and it is not possible for someone to pick it up for me. A new photo must be taken each time a license is printed, apparently. 

What risks am I facing if I decide to wait until the end of the semester (in May) to return to my parents' house and get a new license? I have the license # written down, but I (stupidly) failed to photocopy the entire license.

I want to raise that as much as I can. I'm friends with a lot of EEs who have GPAs much higher than mine, (some) internships have minimum GPA requirements, and my parents have been pissed as of late. I go to class, take notes and study for exams (there have been 2-3 exams I have not studied for since I've been here). I do go to office hours, however maybe I should go more often.

I am about to graduate with an EE degree and have had an internship for the last few years and I'm guaranteed a job when I get out, so it isn't like I'm a complete math failure....but I've never been able to figure out the following:

How does one learn math WELL?

I feel like every difficult subject in college I learned stuff the following way... first I glanced over the book, maybe attempted to read it but didn't really understand a lot of it, so then I would go online and maybe watch some khan academy (or similar) youtube videos on the subject.

 After a while it started to feel like all of my knowledge was built upon a giant pile of shit, because I never fully understood much of anything to the degree I wanted. Even when I was in classes like Diff Eq, Electromagnetics (a lot of calc 3 stuff) if someone was to hand me a random problem, I would have no idea where to even start. Primarily because everything I did consisted of learning just enough of what the teacher wanted us to be able to write down on the test.

So I guess it doesn't even apply to math, but learning anything of considerable difficulty. I've heard some people mention in other threads that they go through a textbook and read every chapter and do every single problem in the book. Is this what it takes to learn something well and fully understand it?

I think it has partly been the American education system babying people like me, and I was never forced to actually develop the skills necessary to learn difficult material."

1aosal,15,2013-03-20,Am I (f25)dating a mommy's boy (m22)? ,gotaqstn,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1aosal/am_i_f25dating_a_mommys_boy_m22/,"This is something I have been struggling with for some time now, and even after reading different articles about I am still not sure what to think.
General facts about us: we have been dating more than a year now. Knew each other for half a year before that. We see each other  2-3 night a week and either Sat or Sunday.

His family lives with him, and he currently goes to school so he can transfer. Before that he held a full time job which supported his family (his mom, his 3 siblings and him). He got laid off about 1.5 months ago, so now he is looking for internship and/or a job. His mom just started working after 2.5 years of not doing anything. His siblings just go to school.

My bf is the middle child and has an older brother.

I work full time, live with my parents so I can pay off students loans faster, which (yay!) will happen really soon.
My parents like my bf and have no problem with him coming over, especially since he helped us a lot by helping me to take care of my sick grandma.

Story: My bf generally is a nice guy, cares for his family and me. He has his issues and struggles with different emotional traumas which are caused by his parents not getting along (they are currently separated) and fighting all the time when he was a kid and then a teen. He generally avoids confrontations with his family or me, and he doesn't like fighting at all (it reminds him of his parents fighting), however he has a bit of a temper.

My issue with all of this that sometimes he refuses to do different relationship activities with me or lies to his mom about it because she doesn't like it or starts to asks him questions which he doesn't want to answer or deal with.

One of those issues is that she doesn't like when he comes over to my house. He says that she doesn't like it when he spends time at other people's places in general but for as long as I've known him he never did it. Another issue is that he doesn't tell her he's going away with me up until the day before we leave. Or he lies to her about it.

Another is that she guilttrips him when he chooses to actually do something very couply with me. Or that he rarely buys me those little things that generally girls love (like flowers or something small and cute, because it just doesn't occur to him) but when we go out and I decide to actually buy myself those little cute things (like $5-$10) he usually exclaims ""Oh my mom would love it! I should buy it for her!"". Happens every single time. Even when I just point out something because I like it. Not a big issue but it just falls into general pattern of their relationship.

One of those issues came up yesterday. We were going away for 2 nights, so I told my bf to tell his mom about it maybe 2 weeks before we actually went. He waited till 2 days before to tell her, and I actually had to remind him about it again. Okay. We come back and I ask him to stay over since I don't work today and he doesn't have school, but does have an interview at 3.30pm. He says he can't since his mom is home. I just raise my eyebrows and ask him ""so?"". He says he can't come over because his mom expects him to be home. Which again makes me to raise my eyebrows to which he says that I don't understand. I end up saying whatever mostly for the sake of the interview which he didn't think about until I brought it up myself.

At the same time it is really bugging me. It happened a few times before, when he refused to stay over simply because she doesn't like when he does it. 

His sister in comparison is 18. 2.5 months ago she got a bf, who comes over and stays at their place. They recently went away with her bf's family and his mom didn't say anything. When me and my bf hit about 5 month mark we went away for 3 days, which my bf lied to his mom about because she would be upset that he went away with me, and when we came back he bought her flowers to apologize about it. At 9 month mark we went away for 4 days, to which he lied about to his mom too. He said to her that he's going camping with my parents and me, while it was just me and him going somewhere else completely.

Sometimes he lies to her about when he's spending time with me when to her he says that he's with his friends. Again his 18 year old sister spends all of her free time with her bf, which is every day. Her mom only said something to her when she started skipping classes. His sister would be out up until very late, whether up until recently my bf always got calls about where he is and when he's going to be home while he's out with me.

When I try to bring this up he just says that I don't understand, and when I ask to explain he just gets quiet. It's been bugging me for a long time now but I don't know what to do.

Is it him just being a mommy's boy? Him not wanting to hurt her cause his dad hurt her? Him not wanting to be a bad son?  Or is it really me not understanding their dynamic?

TLdr: Boyfriend lies to his mom about the amount of time he spends with me cause she doesn't like. Brings her up when I talk about something that I like in the way that she might like the same thing. Or he doesn't do coupley things with me because of her. It makes me sad and uncomfortable. Not sure why he does it.

Edit: something I remembered that put a damper on our relationship at the very beginning.
At about 3 months I was invited to his family friend gathering. There were a lot of family and friends there, it was in a park and it was a pretty good day. I have met his mom and siblings and it went pretty good. Next day I obviously asked if his family liked me. He happily tells me that they loved me. Few days later I see him, and he is in a very bad mood. Very upset and almost looks like he's about to cry. After some prodding I learn that his mom doesn't think he should be with me, and that she thinks he should break up with me. That it's nothing personal and that his mom likes me, but she doesn't want him to be with me. It went on for a few months after and we did break up for 3 days because of it."

* Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND): 20%
* Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI): 50%
* Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund (VXUS): 30%

After leaving a couple thousand in a savings account for an emergency fund, I had another 6k or so that I currently have put into [VASGX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0122&amp;FundIntExt=INT) (a Vanguard mutal fund with a similar 80/20 ratio to the ETFs in my IRA)

Is this a good move? I will move another 5500 into my IRA each year, and probably add another ~5-8 into the non-IRA part of my vanguard account each year. Or should I put the money outside of the IRA into something more conservative like [VASIX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0723&amp;FundIntExt=INT)?

Basically, I'm wondering if VASGX is a good place to park my money for a few years, or if I should buy some ETFs to achieve a similar allocation, or maybe buy a more conservative fund like VASIX instead. 

Some details on my financial situation:

I'm currently working on a PhD, and have no option for a 401k, that'll change in 3-4 years. I save between 2-8k per year depending on if I do a summer internship. (Summer internships effectively double my salary)

I'm trying to save as much as possible to offset the opportunity cost of the PhD. Post PhD I will make ~100k and have zero debt, but probably live in a high cost of living area (SF.)

I'm currently a senior at the University of Notre Dame and am planning to relocate to New York. I am earning a Bachelors in Business Administration majoring in IT Management from the Mendoza College of Business (ranked #1 undergraduate b-school by Business Week) as well as in Film. 

I am open to working in a variety of fields. My key interests are sports, television broadcasting, or business/systems analysis and consulting. 

I have 3 years experience in working in live broadcast production for sports, working through www.und.com - the Notre Dame athletic department's media outlet.

I also have a summer internship experience in sports marketing research and analysis. I was based in London during the 2012 Olympics for this internship. 
On that note, I also have a very international background mindset , having grown up in 6 different countries, which could be valuable to businesses hoping to grow.

And I also interned for the IT department of a start-up based in New Jersey doing basic support tasks, such as help-desk or documentation, as well as engaging in social media campaigns and web traffic analytics.

I'm very familiar with business settings and work patterns. I've done numerous projects consulting for local, national, and international brands (MillerCoors, international non-profits, local libraries..) on various topics (product design, user-experience, social media strategies) and have presented findings numerous times in reports and presentations to management personnel in those firms.

-31 Years old, starting a new career
-Currently I am an office manager for a financial planner. I do not do anything financially related
-Just graduated with a BBA in accounting about 9 months ago, with a 4.0

My original goal was/is to get my CPA. I have over 150 credit hours, and meet all requirements. I've been looking for an entry level job with a CPA firm since a little before I graduated. I go to every career fair, networking events...yet I have a hard time getting interviews. I know I am personable and I interview well, yet not one offer. I feel like I am stuck in a bad position. Ever firm I speak with is either looking for interns or seniors...nothing entry level. Unfortunately, I can't take an internship because I have a wife, baby, mortgage, etc...

Now back to my current job. I work for a small financial planning firm, and my boss loves me, and is doing everything possible to keep me (including a raise when he found out I was looking for other jobs). He wants me to join him as a CFP. I can't lie, while I know the basics of what he does, I know next to nothing on a deeper level of financial planning (the only finance course I took was a principles course required for the accounting degree).

I'm not sure which direction to go at this point. I feel like the CPA route, if and when I do find something, would be more financially stable, but financial planning could be much more lucrative and less rigid. Obviously I have no idea, and that is why I started this post.

All advice, anecdotes, sarcastic remarks are welcomed.

Also, I'm sure I'm missing a bunch of details about my situation, so feel free to ask questions. "

So I just finished up an internship with a national firm on the east coast. I really enjoyed the experience and ended up with a job offer. However, due to personal reasons that arose during the internship, I'm now interested in moving to Austin, Texas. While the firm I interned with would like to accommodate me, the best they can do is Houston or Dallas. Neither of these options are really ideal. 

That being the case, I'm now interested in looking at other firms with offices down there. I've e-mailed recruiters who I met during the fall recruiting period, explaining my desire to move to Austin. So far, I'm not having much luck. They obviously have interns that are matriculating to the associate positions ahead of me. 

Do you guys have any advice? I'd be open to working at a smaller firm, but my graduate program pretty much only entertains the Big 4 plus large regional firms. As such, I haven't had much contact with recruiters from smaller firms around the Texas area. "

I was unfortunately rejected by the grad schools I applied to, and I haven't had much luck with jobs and internships, though I am still trying.  Even if I get a job, my plan is to still reapply for biophysics graduate programs within the next year or two, because it's where my passion lies. 

 So here's what I'm looking for advice on:  The idea occurred to me that I could choose not to graduate this year, and instead pursue adding another major to my undergrad, I'm debating between a BS in biology or biochemistry.  Probably leaning towards biochem.  I should be able to graduate with the double major in physics/biochem within 2 years, I've got all my gen ed stuff covered really well.  This would also give me an opportunity to get my GPA up.  Also, I plan on trying to do biochem/biophysics related research for the next two years, so that plus my previous 2 years of condensed matter research should look really really good, right?

Is there some obvious reason this is a terrible idea? In my mind, the physics/biochem double major ought to really boost my application creds when I apply again in two years for a Ph.D. program.  I know there's the obvious downside of two more years of student loans and tuition, but biophysics is really my one career goal.  

So thoughts.  And thanks to anyone who takes the time to read this, I really appreciate any advice, it's been a rough year with the grad school rejections, and I've had to adjust my plans far too many times.  "

I just woke myself up about 20 minutes ago and called my closest buddy and told him my dream so I don't forget it. 



A little background: I've been able to lucid dream since I was about 10 years old (I am 22 now) and this dream I had tonight really scared me for some reason. I am going to go through the story best I can and I would appreciate some sort of feedback of discussion. My heart is still pounding. 



So it starts out at some house, a large house, which somehow in my dream I perceive as my house. This house was hosting a birthday party for my brother (who is 30) and was packed full of people. Everyone was sitting, enjoying themselves, and there was a ton of people there. I remember my mother was there, my father, a bunch of family friends, random people, etc.; the house was packed. So I walk over to this couch as the party has started but is a little quiet and I was tired so I go to sleep on the couch to take a nap. I wake up a couple hours later (in dream time) to a raging party! Everyone was still there but it was out of control. People were drinking like crazy. My overly conservative mother was standing on a chair yelling things out. She looked like she had tanned WAY too much and had leatherskin I remember telling her to stop going out into the sun. There was an old friend of mine from high school with his family and his girlfriend. He was making out with her. He is currently in the navy I haven't seen him or talked with him in years. I remember going into a room where people were partying even harder. There was an elderly lady snorting cocaine off of the table and everyone was asking where I was and I kept repeating that I took a nap and I would keep sarcastically telling everyone, ""thanks for waking me up jerks!"" or something like that. Then all the sudden I end up in a hallway to what I presume to be my ""brothers room"" with a bodyguard and I think they were playing poker inside. I yell to let me in and my brother just says ""who the fuck said that I'm gonna kick your ass!"" Then he realized it was me so he didn't mean what he said and I asked him why he didn't wake me up for the party. 


Somehow I end up stumbling outside of this house. It's sort of a jungle like environment with a futuristic house in the middle. Outside my dad is keeled over I could tell he drank a little. I instantly start crying in my dream and saying ""I just want you to get better dad."" (In real life he has had some heart/health conditions which I always think of and how we want him to make healthy choices) Anyways, he began telling me he is doing fine and follows me around to the front of the house. He was explaining to me that he is doing great because he got $7,100 back on his tax return. He was saying it was originally supposed to be $6,100 but somehow the tax people had a commercial saying they get you $1000 more on a tax return so he got extra money. He was very excited about this. Next thing you know, I'm outside of this house and everyone is outside and there's these two catering chefs behind a counter wearing all white. It's almost like we are all out on some concrete runway at this point. Everyone is getting breakfast SANDWICHES made for them. I notice how rude everyone is being to the cooks so I don't order and I wait until they are not busy. Eventually I ask the catering chef for a sandwich, and he makes me a lunch sandwich (I LOVE BREAKFAST SANDWICHES) because they ran out of eggs or something or it was later in the day at this point. He makes me a sandwich and I peek around the corner of the table and all the sudden it turns into a cockpit of some sort of futuristic jet or plane. 


The other catering chef is there too and one of my friends ( I think his name was Thomas from real life). The other chef keeps going on about how much tips they made in such a short amount of time. And keeps telling the chef that was helping me how good it is that he is an intern making $60 some odd dollars a hour while working or something. Then all the sudden our group of 4 decides that we want to leave the party so we strap in. I guess the main catering chef was also a pilot so he started to fly the plane away. This takeoff was weird it had a long takeoff with a ramp at the end with a lip to launch us up. So we takeoff and I'm a little scared at this point and the pilot is laughing as we take off about ""WE AREN'T GONNA MAKE IT WE AREN'T GONNA MAKE IT"" and then he says ""Just kidding"" as he turns the plane around to avoid crashing (it just bumped the mountain instead) and we think we are safe. Then he hits some sort of bar or debris in the sky that starts to crash out plane. I remember the other three people holding onto the planes part to remain safe and I flew WAY OUTSIDE UP IN THE SKY. I would keep coming down and bouncing off the plane. (This is when I realize I am dreaming and begin to fully lucid dream) So I eventually grab hold of some part of the plane and I'm with my ""friend"" who was originally Thomas except at this point I don't see his face so I just perceive him as a new friend or something. 



ALRIGHT THIS IS WHERE IT GETS WEIRD. 
So me and this new friend somehow crash land at night at the end of my street. I know 100% I am lucid dreaming and I know this is my street. EVERY HOUSE, EVERY CAR, EVERY STEP WAS THE SAME. (I've lived here my whole life.) I look up into the sky and point out that there are multiple moons, they are different shapes and colors. I somehow realize that I'm on some sort of different dimension planet or alternate dimension of where I live. So we decide to go down the street to my house. The garage is open. I look back before going in. I remember seeing a projector on a garage across the street of an image of Doug Funny from nickelodeon. (Haven't seen that show since I was a kid) Random. So we are about to sneak into my house through the garage door. The garage is dark, the door is cracked open I can see inside. Once my friend enters then me, we quickly sneak our way through the living ro and kitchen, past the hall and into my room. My ""new friend"" was somewhat faster and sneaker than me so he beat me to it. So as I get to my room, it gets darker, I can see a light at my bedstand however. I notice my ""new friend"" has already crawled into my bed. (keep in mind I already started getting an eerie feeling and was feeling scared when I walked in my house, my room especially.) I pull this new friend out of my bed. And I notice someone sleeping behind him. I recognize HER as my ex girlfriend from over a year ago. She had a little distorted face, but it's because I recently saw a picture of her that made her face look weird I think. Now as I realize it's her? I forget about my ""new friend"". Now I'm scared. I notice there's a ladder behind my headboard of my bed. And it's very very dark at the top. But I see feet on the ladder leading to darkness as if someone was watching over my bed as my ex girlfriend was sleeping there. IT FREAKED ME OUT WTFFFF. I proceeded to grab my ex gf QUICKLY out of disbelief and horror out of my bed. I literally dragged her out on the floor and then into the hall. She started waking up. At this point I was so scared I let go and just ran outside of the door. I ran into the street. At this point I'm so scared I decide to wake myself up. So I just open my eyes. 


My heart was pounding, I still can't sleep. It's scary. And now I would like to hear what you think?


I wish I could see it all again, but not be so scared. 


TL;DR -- This is a crazy random exciting scary lucid dream. You should read it. If you don't have time, sorry, I can't TL;DR this. 



Please please talk to me! What do you think?!

1anx2p,1,2013-03-20,Applied for several internships at the same company,vandertramp,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1anx2p/applied_for_several_internships_at_the_same/,"Hi guys, a few weeks ago, I applied to several (probably five) internships at the same place. It's all under the same summer programme. I wrote custom cover letters for each and tweaked my CV for each. However, after applying, there was a problem with some of the files I attached so I contacted the HR person and she said she lifted the CV from my other application.

Since I had made CVs specially for each position I sent her the right one and things were ok. Thing is, it was definitely (at least technologically) possible to apply for several internships. Each had a separate application. But the fact that this HR woman saw them all feels like it was a bit unfair of me to apply for several.

A few days ago, I got an interview invitation for one - yay. However, it confused me because of the five I applied to, arguably I was the least qualified for this internship. The cover letter was written more smoothly, though. In any case, the HR woman sent me the email invitation and since then I haven't heard about the others I thought I was more qualified for. Do you think it means I've been disqualified from the other positions? I don't want to ask for fear of being pushy or getting an instant 'actually, you were only supposed to get one'. Finally, I realise that it's not in their best interests to use their time to interview me more than once (different interviewers, but transportation paid for). If somehow I was offered more than one, I'd have to turn down one and that seems troublesome. In general if I only get an interview for this one, I feel that my chances aren't very good. 

Then again, I might just be worrying too much and maybe the interviewers liked my application in a way I didn't think of. Also the interviews aren't until early April so I suppose there's still time for the other internships. Maybe they're just slow.

**TL;DR applied for five internships at same company, processed through same HR woman. I feel like this disadvantaged me since so far the only interview invitation I got was for my least qualified application.**"

I'm currently attending college in Maine, but I'm committed to an internship this summer in Chicago. It runs from mid-May to mid-August, so I'm trying to find a either month-to-month or short-term lease for the summer.

My brother currently lives in Chicago, but his lease will be up around the same time so we're looking at getting a place together for the summer.

Does anyone have any tips or advice on finding a sublet or temporary 2br in the city for the summer? So far we've tried AirBNB and Craigslist to not much success. Thanks!

I have the option of getting my university to help place me in an internship for September or graduating in September. My university will help place me as long as I have 1 CS course left undone. Over this summer I could take that 1 CS course and graduate, or I could leave it out and get aid in finding an internship. However coming back to school for the sake of 1 course seems annoying, and ideally I want to move away to work so I'd have to deal with transfer credits.

 I am hoping to work in Winnipeg, Canada since I have friends there. I am concerned that if I enter the work force with no work experience I will not be able to get a job. The highlights of my resume will be:

* BSc Hons Applied Mathematics &amp; Physics, BA Computer Science (worked on all 3 majors concurrently across 5 years)

* 2 years running the undergraduate Mathematics Society (shows leadership and social skills)

* I have won a few scholarships over my university career

* Was awarded summer research position in mathematics

* Knows Java, C#, C++, SQL, and a bit of javascript. 

* I'll have 2 good letters of reference. One from a CS prof, one from a math prof

I am honestly open to working almost of any type programming job, I just worry that my lack of work experience will make me unhireable...

1anqjj,2,2013-03-20,I'm starting to feel a little burned out; hoping to push through this semester. ,NeedSomeAdvice23,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1anqjj/im_starting_to_feel_a_little_burned_out_hoping_to/,"This semester I packed my schedule, and at first I was handling it pretty well, but now I seem to be slowing down. I'm just looking toward the finish line when I can start all over. 

This semester I loaded my schedule up with 2 internships (4 days a week/24 hrs) a full course load of classes and extracurricular activities. It's starting to hit prime time to reapply for new internships, and I'm so tired of it. Applying to internships takes so much effort, and unlike a job, I have to do it every semester. 

I always look back on last semester when I had time to go to the gym and work out. It's so difficult to fit in gym time now. Waking up at 6 am to work out before my internships was helping , but this week I've just been skipping out on it and sleeping extra, and coping with it by trying to eat less. I used to constantly body-check for muscle/fat/bones, and while I still do, I think about it a lot less. My mindset now is just, ""wait until the semester is over and then worry about getting back into top shape."" 

It's tiring to get up at 6/8 am, leave the house, get back around 9 p.m. and worry about sleeping in two hours when I still have to eat, shower, study and fit in some leisure time. 

I'm also worried my friends and I will fall apart. I'm usually too busy until the weekend to hang out, and I feel like they think I'm neglecting them. "

I didn't even really change my diet. I went from 2 sodas per day, to none (when I was younger my parents let me drink two a day and when I was older that habit stuck with me), I started eating less, and someone deserves a Nobel prize for inventing the elliptical- its a lovely device where even a 250lb kid with a muscular disorder can ""run"" for hours (its how I started is what I'm saying). 

Anyway... here is where I would post pictures if I had them (the reason that I am not is because I do not have access to a decent camera). 

I always felt the posting of pictures was paramount. They inspire others, and they must feel really satisfying. Hell, a few months ago I wouldn't go out without a coat, a sweatshirt, or at least a vest to try to conceal a few pounds. Now I go out proudly on most days. But what inspires me to write this is that 30 by my name. I am not breaking any speed records for weight loss over time (guesstimating that at this rate I'll be just shy of 90lbs lost in a year) but looking at that scale and seeing the change is something you really just wanna share with EVERYBODY.


Anyway, here it is: Male, just turned 20, started 250lbs, now 220lbs and falling.

**Edit** By popular demand I'll tell more of a story, also because I love to talk. I grew up with sick parents. Mom has 3 rare disorders and I happened to catch the unlucky gene which causes my muscles to prefer to eat themselves than heal normally. I lucked out in a way though, my weight issues from the American side of my family, my dad's side, may well prevent me from dying of a heart failure in my mid to late thirties. My dad himself is a 3 time cancer survivor, and a decorated former state trooper. Needless to say, I can tell you all about the wonderful hospital facilities up and down the east coast of the United States from Duke University to Johns Hopkins and Kennedy Kruger. I can also tell you what its like taking care of your little brother and the most important of life lessons: ""Don't panic"". With my mom's frequent, lengthy hospital trips her death went from something I feared to something I expected, each time they'd call for an ambulance, I would respond similarly, fear- but I also had a job to do, which started with not being helpless. Of course, this mentality and a dark sense of humor that comes with it does not garnish you with many friends on the playground. Socially I was a fish out of water, and I was living off of TV dinners and pizza. Fortunately no one in my family died and slowly things have actually gotten better. 

Fast forward a bit and I am 16 or 17 in firefighter 1 training. I can't exactly explain why, but I had been a volunteer for years and finally I was old enough to carry a hose and 60+ pounds of gear while working a part time job at Micky Dees (not where you typically go to lose weight, mind you) at this time I'm 210lbs, maybe 220 and growing. I'm in a car accident, the girl I had lost my virginity to about 2 years prior was killed on impact. I was pretty seriously wounded. Badly enough that just out of the Firefighter classroom and into live burns I could not complete training. I enrolled in EMT because of the ability to ""transform from such a total idiot into a hero in the presence of immediate danger"" as my dad worded it once, and a lack of empathy that is kind of vital to the job (or as I called it, ""my own little protective bubble of PTSD""). Unlike my dad who is and was a great man, a hero to say the least who describes himself as the kind of guy who is likely to cry in the ditch with the survivors, I am cold and calculating- I can keep my emotions out of the way and treat horrible injuries and think nothing of it until I have safely delivered the patient to the emergency department, and step outside where the first breeze to hit my face gently carries away all the stress. Go back to base, write my report, turn in my report, rinse, repeat. If I had to say why I went for EMT I could say that its because of seeing too many of my friends (by this point of my life (2 with a 3rd dying) Tango Uniform. Realistically its because the worst feeling in the whole world is feeling completely helpless and useless. With medical training and my years of experience, I have generally kicked that feeling even though 90% of your calls are BS, those 10% where I truly make a difference- or at least bear witness are somewhat empowering. 

When I was 18, I carried that attitude into college where it was largely beaten out of me by the redundancies and the fact that college no matter how you slice it is a business just like everything else and I fell into most of the pitfalls, drinking somewhat, a sociology and criminal justice major, and the fact that everyone has the same political and social beliefs and insists on repeating new stories from the Colbert Report. It ate away at me and quickly I became bitter and self-righteous (like a standard college student), and I hated-loved it and continue to love-hate it. The unemployment especially takes its toll, while I spend 6 months out of year on campus, and 6 months ""back home"" (roughly), no one wants to pay me if I spend half a year homeless as far as they are concerned. I continued my volunteer efforts, an EMT back home, a senior member of the Civil Air Patrol, and an unpaid internship (the Diane Champe Institute). Life on a budget of about nothing and being WAY too proud to ask my parents to send me money. 

So here I am, a second year, overweight, a minor success with the ladies, a proud smoker, and a volunteer, spreading myself way to thin on a never ending quest to put my name everywhere that I can throw it. HATING how I look as an overweight guy. [Pic](http://i.imgur.com/Zh80Itc.jpg) dated about a year ago exploring the ruins of the Tome School for Boys (1890-1942) in Port Deposit (later converted, with 70 surrounding farms, to the USNTC Bainbridge 1942-1976). Something had to change. I began working out, started calorie counting with MFP (hardly changing my diet) went from eating ~2000-2500cal/day to about ~1000-1500 virtually overnight and as long as I was plugging it in and SEEING that I was eating enough, I didn't feel that hungry. There was some pain and suffering, but nothing major. Meals became less about eating, and more about sitting back and chatting with the few friends I have made. I also began hitting the gym, running mostly, because I had never used weights that werent machines and its really hard to screw up running (eliptical and treadmill). You can adjust your form to run faster/longer/etc... but if you run or even briskly walk long enough, you will lose weight. Then I find r/losit and r/fitness and I learn that its easier to lose weight by lifting weights and gaining muscle (complicated by a muscular disorder, but not impossible) because muscle eats up your fat storage to maintain, a win-win. So I track down every lead I might have on friends who can show me what to do in the school's fitness center so I don't look like such an idiot lifting heavy things and putting them down. Dead lifts and leg presses are my favorite, but I am picking up on all of it. and Here I am, 30lbs down, and a lot more to go. Working out about 4 times a week, and running almost every day. Any tips are welcome. Thank you for reading. OH! Also I switched from smoking to vaping with the help of r/electronic_cigarette. Vaping is wonderful and you should all do it. That is all"

So where do I go from here? I'm a freshman CS major and I wanna get an internship this summer but I feel so inadequate whenever I look at any job or internship ads because they all expect you to know so much more than just the language and core standard library. The past 3 days I've been researching and reading nonstop trying just to wrap my head around all of the following:



**Build Tools?** Ant? Maven? Gradle?

**Databases?** SQL? PostgreSQL? ORM? Hibernate? JPA? MongoDB?

**Web development?** Spring? Struts? GWT? DOM? jQuery? AJAX? XML? JSON? SOAP? REST?

**And there's more?** Commons? Guava? CDI? Guice? Hadoop?

I want to be a skilled and marketable java developer, but how do I get there? Which frameworks/technologies should I focus on? What books do I read? What tutorials do I follow? What kind of projects can I do to apply my learned knowledge and show off on my portfolio to potential employers?"
1angun,5,2013-03-20,Negotiating starting salary as a fresh CS PhD... what leverage do I have?,snapmaster,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1angun/negotiating_starting_salary_as_a_fresh_cs_phd/,"I recently finished a PhD from a very prestigious CS program.  I have zero work experience, but my research was fairly specialized and relevant to a company that recently extended me an offer.  The company basically only hires PhDs.

Looking at glassdoor.com and talking to a friend that works there, it's clear they are lowballing me by at least 10% (offer is barely over 100 for a silicon valley location).  I've read on here that new BS/MS grads have zero leverage.  Does that also apply to PhD students?

If that is true, can I gain more leverage by getting a competing offer?  I believe one is on the way, but I am not sure how much more they will offer me.  Unfortunately the first company is pushing me hard to respond while I buy time to get a second offer.  Bonus question- how long can I put them off?  They initially only gave me like 3 days!

EDIT - I've completed the negotiation process and got a job.  Here's what happened:

1. I got a competing offer.
2. I put off both places for just under 2 weeks.  They will pressure you, but they will wait if they want you.  The way you do this is by asking lots of questions and asking to talk to people in their organization.  This takes time, and they will respect you taking time to get more information.  They will not be happy if you take time just for the hell of it.
3. Having a highly ranked PhD was helpful, but didn't really get me leverage until I got the second offer.  Once I got the second offer, it was clear that both places were gunning for me hard.  I do believe that the weight of the PhD helped, but only once the second offer showed up.
4. The competing offer is truly how you get leverage.  Just send it to the first place, they will match or beat it.  Send the next offer to the second place, they will match or beat.  Then go back to the first.  That's all it took to go from just over 100 to almost 120.  During the process, be very cordial about everything, and express surprise at new offers; say that your goal is simply to get equivalent offers on the table.  Continually express how excited you are to join.  HR people know that competitors will try to counter- do not be shy about going back and forth.  Don't do it more than twice though.

NO ONE GAVE TWO SHITS that I didn't do an internship.  If you don't understand why, you don't understand the CS PhD process.

I know a lot of kids my age don't, however I just have no idea what to do in the here and now. I have a bad tendency to think long term and plan out my life. I know this never works, however I feel like I have to plan ahead. I just got my grades back today and they averaged to a 3.3 gpa. I know this is a decent gpa however I was quite disappointed.

Right now I am applying to jobs and internships however I am worried that I won't get a single one, in that case I have nothing to do this summer and will be broke when I get back to school in the fall.

I have scholarships to both places however aside from the scholarships I will have to pay for everything with loans and part time work/ summer internships.

1ancov,1,2013-03-20,Need a new field,blackny97gsx,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1ancov/need_a_new_field/,"So, after 3 years full time and 3 years before that as an intern when not at school, I've realized I really do not enjoy HVAC, Plumbing, and Fire Protection design consulting.  I'm starting to look for a new job, but I don't even know what fields I should be looking at.  I need suggestions.
  
  
I graduated a few years ago as an ME Bachelor from a top 40 USA engineering school.  I started work at a very small (6 person) design consulting firm I had been interning at when not in school.  I do HVAC, Plumbing, and FP design and, since it's a tiny firm, I do everything from client relations, to estimating, specifying, and construction administration.  I'm pretty sure I hate it.  I absolutely do not want to be doing it for the rest of my life.  I spend almost every day behind a desk on a computer.
  
  
I need suggestions on different mechanical careers that I should be looking at.  I've had a thought for a while that something like being a field engineer for an energy company like Schlumberger or Exxon would be fun.  I think I like the idea of being in the wilderness, or at sea, on some kind of adventure (if you'll humor me).  I'd at least like to do something that involves more physical activity and less sitting behind a computer.   I want to have more of an impact than just replacing an old RTU on a building at the local community college, or providing minimal air conditioning to some retail space for a landlord.  

  
 
At the same time, I want to eventually make a lot of money.  I know I'll have to eventually go back to school to really make a lot of money, but I want to start down a new career path that is more suited to that than HVAC design consulting.

**TL;DR**  I'm an HVAC design consulting engineer, and I want to change to some other, less desk oriented, more adventurous mechanical field.  I don't know what though, I'm looking for suggestions.
 
So, please, any career field suggestions would be appreciated.

$1000 a month, for a cheap ass intern looking to eat out a couple times and go out on the weekends in dives/brooklyn, how doable is this? I will cover my Subway pass before hand, so i will have $1000 a month or $250 a week in Manhattan.

The other CSU I got accepted to and debating to go to is close to home and I would live at home; at the CSU  I will change my major (if possible) to nutrition. If I don't decide to I'm going to UCD, its much more expensive and I have fears about not being able to make any friends and living on my own for the first time. I also am fearing that if I choose UCD my grades will go down because I am not that smart. But pros is it gives me more opportunity for internships and a new environment where I have to force myself to find field experience. I also have no idea what I want to do w/ my life after I graduate but I am very studious. I will also have to lose my job at home if I choose UCD. Would this be a waste of money if I go to UCD?
Also, if I choose state school I can change my major to nutrition (if they let me), but I will be stuck living at home. This I feel is a more applicable major but will take me another extra year to graduate. I feel more in my ""comfort zone"" when I live at home, but I don't think I will be forced to do anything like internships or anything new. I also am a female and my parents are very protective of me, so I feel if I stay here they will still be. The CSU is also much much cheaper then UCD and I won't have any fear of going to college and living on my own. Also, I won't lose my job (I coach a sport).

Again,feelngSick,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1an91u/i_was_thinking_about_it_today_again/,"My life has been pretty weird and kinda shitty. My mom went skitsophrenic when I was like 14, unmedicated, and my dad did nothing about it. Every night I was afraid she'd kill me in my sleep.

Finally, she burned the house down and got some help, and I left for college. She's getting better now, but when she calls me it hurts me, she's not the same person she was before I was a teenager, she's someone else, a sad broken person wearing her skin.

I got to college, and I was super unsocialized- I was a pretty weird quiet kid. I went totally nuts over this girl- asked her out, she said yes, and then queue weird psudo-psud-relationship with a deprresed, mixed up girl. The situation was complicated so I wont describe it, but it made me ridiculously depressed for a year.

after that it got better, I became super productive. I got a 4.0 gpa in the good semster, my social skills went up, I was taking graduate level physics classes and acing them. I thoght the next semester would be even better. THats whats supposed to happen, we improve.

Im dropping a class, I was rejeced from the internship I wanted, I was fired from my research job, and I feel empty inside. Im not sure what went wrong, but something did. I feel worthless and inadequate. Today I woke up, walked around campus all day doing nothing, and now im here. I feel empty. I feel like I felt during the bad times, and im tinking about suicide again.

 Im going to die eventually anyway. Ill never be as beutiful as I should be. Im wired wrong, and I cant achieve what I want, and I cant want to do what I want to want to do. Im empty and horrible. Im suicidal even though there are billions who have had it worse than me. What the fuck. Why should I do anything. Im just a weird system ment to make sure I mate, and then I die. Whats the point of going on.  I want to start over, with normal parents and a normal upbringng, I dont want to keep living out this fucked up traumatized piece of shit that will neer be as good as he knows he could be. Its always one step forward two steps back

And fuck LT, why was I born myself and not him

Everybody else on this subreddit has it worse than me. I go to a good college, I have a good gpa in a good major, because I somehow pull it off even when I feel like shit, and my dad has money. But I stil feel ike this. What the actual fuck."

Unfortunately, I must say goodbye to r/trees for a little while. As a young, up-and-coming college student, I have acquired an internship, but recently found out that my employer will be drug testing, so I'm taking a break. Honestly, I am not too bitter about it, mainly because I need a tolerance break anyway.

However, I was on the phone earlier talking to my mom, and I picked up on how she noted ""you can drink all you want,"" but no smoking.

This is what bothers me. How the HELL is it legal for us to imbibe substances that essentially kill parts of our body (liver, stomach, etc.), but weed - which is not lethal in any way, shape, or form - is deemed illegal? College students such as myself die every year from over-drinking, but weed kills virtually (and literally) NO ONE. That notion just doesn't sit right with me.

And with that, I'm out! Toke up for me frents!"

Any advice?,Africalove,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1an0kq/leaving_for_the_peace_corps_in_may_2013_any_advice/,"I will be leaving for Paraguay for a community economic development role in late May (2 months AAAHH). I just wanted some advice on the Peace Corps/South America before I depart. 

A little bit about me. I graduated from BU in 2011 with a degree in economics and statistics. I held various finance internships in college and wanted to go into banking, but a volunteer trip to Kenya before college really caused me to pursue volunteering/traveling. I have worked in real estate and operated an up and coming real estate internet startup in Boston for the past 3 years. I always traveled when I was a kid and was fortunate enough through saving money through internships to backpack around Europe twice in college. I recently came back from a teaching stint in Ghana (amazing, best experience of my life), traveling to Israel for birthright, and now back working my old jobs until I leave in May.

I have always wanted to see South America and the Peace Corps was always on my mind after my first trip to Africa. My recent trip to Ghana really cemented my desire to do the Peace Corps since I was living at the semi-local level for 4 months (although the Peace Corps is 27 months). Everyone I have talked to throughout my traveling has mentioned South America as being more beautiful than Africa. Is this true? 

I was nominated for Central/South America (I took spanish through out high school and 4 semesters in college) and was fortunate enough to get invited to a Latin American country. My other question is how much traveling you can do while in-service. The World Cup is in Brazil next summer and I have college friends in Brazil. Thanks for the advice!"

My emotions are swinging so dramatically that I'm afraid of myself. I've been fighting the urge to do things like cut or slam my head/fist into the wall.

I journaled to kind of get it out, and all I could keep thinking was ""I just want to die. I want to give up and kill myself and have it be over with."" And I know that means I should go to the hospital, but I just can't do that. I have my husband and school and a home to look after. I can't just drop everything and *lord forbid* take **care** of myself. 

Impossible. There's too much to do here that I can't take any time off. I'm at the home stretch of the class I'm taking, all I have to do after that is get through my internship and then maybe I can lose my mind a little louder and possibly go to the hospital... If I'm still feeling this way that is.

But tomorrow will be different, it always is.

I'll start off feeling okay, doing alright, but then one wrong thing will happen tomorrow and I'll be back to hating myself again. 

I feel like a failure, and a hollowed out shell of my former self. I don't do anything because I don't *want* to do anything except cry and hate myself. 

And I feel so pathetic because of this. 

I refuse to tell my husband about this though, because I don't want him to think I'm making this up or something. I know that's probably irrational, but that's where my mind is right now. I'm convinced that if I tell anyone just how low I am that they'll all hate me and send me away. 

Fuck. I'm getting all teary eyed again.

I just want this to stop. All of it. The bad memories, the side effects, the mood swings, me trying to keep it all together when in reality I'm dying on the inside. 

Someone else posted not too long ago that if their mental illness was physical, they'd have a huge tumor crushing them (I'm probably paraphrasing really horribly, sorry).

My head is full of chatter that isn't mine. Thoughts on thoughts on thoughts on thoughts... All this static in my head is killing me.

I need a hug. I've needed a hug for like a month. :("
1amsil,37,2013-03-19,"I [F/26] just freaked out at my boyfriend [M/24] about a girl he met abroad, never had jealousy issues before, I'm lost.",fezfjepjfezpfgeg,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1amsil/i_f26_just_freaked_out_at_my_boyfriend_m24_about/,"**Bit of background:** 
We've been together for nearly a year now, during this year we've both lost our respective places and we are currently living with friends.
We were both working on and off but never enough to get a flat, in November he found an internship with a school, he started helping them with an event abroad and organized the whole shebang.

I had suspicions about that place from day one, and I was right to, once he was hired full time they started the dance of not giving him his contract, complete with the non-payment of wages.
They didn't pay anyone in fact, and by being pushy he managed to get some advances to get to work and get food and such.

He decided to stay with them until he finished the event, cause he wanted to see it through, and I was okay with it.

During his journey, he asked me to take a picture of me kissing a dude off of my Facebook, as a favour, because he found it whilst casually stalking me and thought it was my (abusive) ex, which made him sad.
In exchange, he'd change his status to 'in a relationship'.
I have never been too fussed about it, but I accepted the deal. Upon checking his page I discovered that he'd friended mainly girls whilst away.
One of which commented to his relationship status with a strange message going ""Oh wow, well you need to treat me"".
I thought that was a bit off, and brushed it off as random jealousy.

He came back, happy to see me of course but things were strange, I couldn't quite pin it, he was sad, and we talked about him moving back to his country and I was trying to cope with it.
He then suddenly felt better, as he usually does and we resumed normal activities.

However, he's going to work with the girl who left the weird comment, about a project I'm not understanding fully because he keeps being evasive about the exact terms of it.
He finally explained everything, he was only talking to her because of work and nothing else and I'm obviously such a silly girl.
He had to apologize to her this week as he was not being able to work with her after all because he found another placement.

**What happened tonight:** he was talking to her and a friend of his on Facebook on my laptop, and he left to go have a cigarette, and I did the psycho thing, I went to read their conversation.

He was comforting her because her dad is in a bad way, apparently he met him (I didn't know that) and her dad asked how he was doing, if he's married and if they're ""more than just friends ;)"".
He only answered ""tell your Dad I'm not getting married yet"".
In their entire history I found her to be overly nice and it made me feel sick. 
She even said that she was so glad he came into her life and she was glad to have a friend like him. They spent three weeks together like.
I wasn't mentioned at all, ever. He didn't mention me to her, even when he was talking about life at home or even his plans tomorrow.

I confronted him about it, he laughed me off because it's funny that I'm jealous and it doesn't matter because she lives on another continent.
He also said that I'm nuts, which is fair enough, I have acted nothing but insane about it, but I have this gut feeling that something is wrong.

It's just, all my exes have lied to me and quite a few cheated.
I'm usually quite a decent judge of character, except when it comes to pick my partners, but my intense fear of being abandoned and lied to means that I'm currently unable to see if I'm judging her too harshly because she's just nice or if she's actually trying to do something.
I can't shake off the fact that all he said was that she's too far. Not that it's ridiculous, but ""she's too far"".

**I should add**, that I have never been the jealous type, I have über close male friends and I understand that other people have super close friends too.
This is quite new to me and I don't know what to do.

My most recent ex started seeing someone I knew when we were still living together (but separated) and they both lied to my face for weeks, but I knew, I knew from the second they met that it was going to happen. 
This is feeling exactly like it.

I know I fucked up and I'm glad he's not mad at me for reading his emails but I don't know what to do.
I'm leaving tomorrow for a week and we haven't talked or touched each other since, he's asleep next to me and I'm awake, crying and dealing with travel anxieties.


**TL;DR: I went through my boyfriend's emails and I found no comfort in it, unfortunately, being hysterical means that I can't see where my crazy starts and where the dodgy ends.**


**EDIT: Thank you all for your messages and for the help, I'm going to talk to him online tonight as I won't get a chance this morning. No ultimatums, no paranoia (hopefully), gonna aim for conveying of feelings and trust issues.**

Not sure how to feel.,throwawayawkfks,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1amqo3/brother_arrested_with_drugs_not_sure_how_to_feel/,"I'm in college, and my little brother back home is 16. For almost four years now, he's been struggling with addiction. Up until yesterday, we only thought it was marijuana and alcohol, which changed to cigarettes recently. Nope, it's been cocaine, morphine, amphetamine, k-pins, every drug you can think of. He's dealt pot to pay for his hobbies, and got his start-up money by stealing jewelry, electronics, and cash from our home. He's forged a check for $250, and recently when my mom asked him how much it would take to pay off his dealers so they wouldn't threaten him with guns and follow him home anymore, he said $900. She paid it.

My mom found out and has been actively doing something about it for two years now. He was in therapy before that, because my parents were divorced, and has continued in therapy and specifically addiction therapy with extreme reluctance for the entire duration of these events. His money has been restricted, Mom prevented him from getting a license for over a year, he was watched until he could be trusted and then broke the trust again and again.

He was a very sensitive, loving kid, who never hurt animals and wanted nothing more than hugs, up until age 12, when he met a friend who was dealing drugs at that age. We all went through a difficult time at that time, because my parents divorced and we moved to a new state. But he has continued to make poor choices, again and again, so it's not just that.

Our parents are a doctor and a lawyer. We live in an upper-middle class setting, with good education and small luxuries.

I'm at a top university, on merit scholarships, doing internships at other top universities that have offered me entry to grad programs. I've never been drunk or smoked a cigarette, let alone seen illegal drugs. During the divorce, I remember one night when my dad passed out from drinking and I had to make dinner and put my two siblings to bed. I realized that our family had an addiction problem and stayed away from that shit at all costs. My brother knew it too. I am extremely confused at how we have come to such different places in our lives so far.

My little sister is stuck at home with my emotionally drained mother and my brother. I hate to leave her there, but through my own years of therapy, I've realized I can't make their problems mine, and I'm enjoying my life on my own. I only feel this kind of helplessness, anxiety, etc, when I get a call from home because something big has happened. Also, guilt.

This time, the call was because he was arrested last night. Thankfully, it was his friend's pot and paraphanalia, and the bugged cop car caught him asking my brother to take the fall for him since he had priors. So, it looks like he won't get charged with intent to distribute, just possession. Nonetheless, he is in the system. They have his name and his prints and his license. They're after distributors, after all, and not so long ago he was one.

I'm confused. I'm a psych major, and I've studied human development from a comparative perspective. I understand that people sometimes rely on maladaptive coping strategies when they have too few supports compared to their challenges. But how is it that I developed resilience, and he has not? Why has therapy been beneficial to me but not him? Why do the antidepressants work for me and not him? Why does he hate me? Why won't he let anyone help him? Why does he push away anyone who wants to support him? How did he become this person I don't know so quickly and so completely?

His ferret died recently from neglect. I'm still mourning that, because I took care of it too, and don't know what to think about that situation either.

I'm confused. I don't know if anyone can shed any light on what he's going through, or some observations about what I am. I just needed to vent."

Internship A is at ARM (in California). I live several states (read: about 1000 mi and several mountain ranges) away, and would have to move for the summer. I was completely fine with that, until I got offered Internship B.

Company B is located about 45 minutes from my house, and is a small collective of two electrical engineers, a couple of computer science people, and a mech-eng who can code. They basically work on commission and farm all the profits out to the employees. Their offer pays about $3 less per hour , but I wouldn't have to move, wouldn't have to sublet my apartment/do a more expensive month-to-month in CA. I'd be doing everything from FPGA design work to debugging an iphone app in Objective-C at company B, while at ARM I'd be working on a specific project that's already been at least vaguely outlined to me.

In both cases I would learn a lot of cool stuff and get a lot of experience. Both companies seem like they've got a good work atmosphere, both seem excited to have me. I signed and returned the offer letter for company B because I hadn't gotten a final offer letter from ARM  and was getting worried, and then literally that same day they came back with a formal offer.

I am divided between the big name for what actually would be less money, given the cost of living in Cali compared to where I live, cost of moving, etc, and going with the total unknown who does awesome stuff for anybody who wants to hire them, for several thousand dollars more over the course of the summer. 

tl;dr got offered two internships, one with a tech giant, one with a local collective of contract engineers. which to take? I need advice!"

My girlfriend (f22) and I (f20) met about two and a half years ago out of the blue at a small social gathering. Instant and explosive connection. After less than eight months, I dropped out of university because my mom got sick. We decided to stay together because of how in love we were. Everything was fine for a while. We talked a lot and skyped a lot and I got my license so I could go see her. (my old college town is 3 hours from where I live with my parents)

I decided to go for an associates degree at my local community college while she remained. Then a lot of shit started happening. There was a flood and her father's business was destroyed. They were denied aid by FEMA and have still not opened the business again. My SO's sister's violent marriage broke up and the ex husband burned down their other business. The fire and the flood happened less than four months apart.

Meanwhile I'm working full time and school full time while trying to complete a required student internship. My sister steals $1000s of dollars in jewelry and cash from me and my family and finally gets checked into rehab. 

Right now it's been a few months since that happened but we have never been the same. We are trying to balance her working seven days a week and me working or at school seven days a week. We barely talk  and I have a tendency to brood (really insense introvert). I have a really negative outlook because her parents won't accept us and I'm afraid more things will happen that will prevent her from moving in with me this summer. 

This isn't even the whole story, just a summed up version, but I really need some support today because everything feels so fucked up in our lives and our relationship has really serious context for how young we are and it is so incredibly stressful. No one understands."

So I have been accepted into Santa Clara University on a scholarship, and I'll be going there this fall.  I recently was looking for a paid paralegal gig in San Francisco (I'm located in San Jose) and I actually got a response from the prospective employer.  [Background: graduated from UCLA, 3.33 GPA, Undergrad Law Journal, ACLU Internship in college, worked at a civil rights advocacy group for a year before applying to law school, worked on a pretty big lawsuit.]

The general gist was that while my resume was impressive, they wanted someone who was going to be there for more time than I was if they were going to invest the time in training me.

To that, I extended the possibility of not only working there this summer, but the next (my 1L) as well.  

As I was typing out the email, I wondered whether or not this would actually be a good arrangement for me - on the one hand, I'm not going to a highly ranked school, but on the other hand, its a very good local school.  I might be missing out on a really high paying corporate or firm gig compared to the money I'd be making in SF (probably making between 11 and 15$ hourly), but on the other hand, finding any paid legal gig my 1L summer might be difficult regardless, and I might be grateful to have found anything at all.

So really, without more information, I can't make a judgement as to if this is a good long-term decision.  I've heard of folks making 1500 a week their 1L summer - is that at all realistic for me to reach for?   And could I do better than 12$ an hour locally rather than MAYBE 15$ an hour and having to commute to it?"

Is this normal?,hippiemachine,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ar2j7/company_is_moving_incredibly_fast_through_the/,"So I applied for a summer internship at a local software company this Monday and a few hours later, I was asked to do a preliminary phone interview. We ended up doing it on Tuesday and immediately scheduled a technical test for Friday. Now they're telling me that I'll also be interviewing with the CTO on the same day as my test.

*Note:* I'm *not* super-qualified. In addition to the stuff I already know, they also want someone who's worked with Linux/Unix, Perl, and PHP and I haven't. Also unfortunately, they're going to test my non-existent knowledge of Unix/Perl/PHP tomorrow, which won't be fun. I'm trying to cram, though. 


I've never seen an interview process go by this fast, but I'm still relatively inexperienced (1+ year experience at my current company, plus a handful of interviews here and there). Could someone more wizened tell me if this is a good sign?

I'm thinking that they either...

a) **really like me.** This is possible, but they don't really know very much about me or my skills yet, other than that I'm picky because I let them know that they had a HUGE fuck-up in their job description (typos and the wrong job description). They seemed grateful for it, so I'm guessing that I did the right thing. 

b) **really need someone ASAP.** The end date for the intern applications isn't until late April, so maybe they just want me to start sooner?

c) **are super efficient.** I hope this is the case, as they're an international company with a long history in their specialization. However, that job description fuck-up makes me wonder...

d) **want to pick an intern and get this process over with** and I just happened to be the first to apply. 

e) **???** ??????

**tl;dr - Applied for a summer internship Monday, got a phone interview Tuesday, and now have an interview with the CTO and a technical test tomorrow. I'm not super qualified, and the closing date for internship isn't until next month. Good sign or weird sign?**

I was really happy she was able to go and follow her dreams and have such a wonderful experience. But she has changed quite a bit since she's been back, almost a lack of interest when compared to how we were before she left. At first I figured it was just her adjusting back to the US and healing from the new friendships that had been lost, but weeks later there still seems to be a wall that wasn't there before both sexually and emotionally. I started feeling really shitty and kept wondering what it was, I tried to talk to her about it but the answers were all the same. So (I really don't like admitting that I did this) I checked on her facebook and saw a message string from on of the guys she had met in Rwanda, he was an intern that worked and went out to party with their group. There was no indication that they hooked up but it was apparent she had fallen for him, she said multiple times how much she loved him and wanted to be back in Africa with him ( oh and she is planning a trip there after graduation next year, and want to work there for a little at least after college). The last two messages she sent him were about how she found out that he had done it with previous girls that went on the trip and that it broke her heart and she never wanted to talk to him again. I just don't know that I can trust her any more, but the worst part about it is we live in the same house for another 6 months and I need to try to make it work at least until the end. Should I trust her? Should I break up with her after we move out? And should I start searching for someone else right now. I really did have strong feelings for her and it hurt so bad to read what she had said."
1aqvva,0,2013-03-21,Mechanical Engineering Student Wanting to Join the Air Force.,[deleted],Military,https://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/1aqvva/mechanical_engineering_student_wanting_to_join/,"Hey all,

I'm 22 years old, work at Ford as an intern and attend Wayne State for a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering (ME). I'm a real easy going guy and I have a desire to travel and get away from home. Lately I've been interested in the Air Force. What I would like to do is work in the Air Force and continue my ME degree, I realize I will only be taking classes part time, and working 8 hours M-F. At my current rate in college i'll be finished with all of my classes in roughly 3-4 years (I'm almost done with my Gen Eds, took me 3 years. So I'm just now getting into core engineering classes. My adviser told me I have a lot of credits that should transfer if I go into the Air Force). I go to school full time (sometimes excluding summers), work part time at Ford and I'm also in a fraternity. I realize I would have to leave all of this. I want to make sure I'm making a good decision. Now there is the option of finishing my degree then joining, which is what I hear the most. But I would rather start now, and finish while serving my term, ultimately working for the Air Force.

The job I'd like is the job dealing with aircraft (testing, repairing, analysis) then ultimately being a developmental engineer. I worked at Sears Automotive for a while, so I have some mechanical background and with that, I love hands on. I was looking at 62E? Seems pretty interesting. I just don't know what to do as my job while i'm pursuing my degree or even where to start, and what comes after! I hear to do research before talking to a recruiter, as they ""sugar coat"" information and get you to try to sign and join right away.

So my questions are:

Is this a good path?
Where do I start? 
What steps do I need to take?
What job might suit me best?
How many terms might I have to serve?
Can I still get an engineering job after the Air Force?

Those are my main questions, i'll ask more as the discussion rises. I appreciate your time, opinions and experiences. Thank you!

1aqrwg,2,2013-03-21,Am I being selfish? [21F],friendvsboyfriend,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1aqrwg/am_i_being_selfish_21f/,"Okay, so:

I've been dating my boyfriend [21M], ""A"" for 6 months now. I think we're in a great place, we have amazing sex, but neither of us has had a serious relationship before, so sometimes we have problems - but who doesn't?, and we've always been able to work them out with minimal drama.

I've known my ""best friend""/roommate (read: my only female friend) for only a few months longer than my BF. She doesn't like him (as you can tell if you read any of my past posts), although she's grown to accept him as part of my life and will sometimes jokingly tell him, ""You're not so bad"" with a fist-bump. 

Ever since the first month of my relationship, she's been badgering me about spending too much time with him. She's lightened up since she got a boyfriend of her own and started seeing how easy it is to lose track of time with someone you like a lot. But recently, it's flared up again. She will text me at all hours of the night asking when I'm coming home (I usually spend the night at A's apartment), tell me to come home to take my meds (I take an SSRI and I keep some on me for my sleepovers), and, about every other night, tell me that she needs the room for her own sexual purposes. Whatever, I have another place to sleep, she doesn't (her boyfriend has a double room with a hermit-like roommate), so I don't usually mind.

Last night, after sleeping at A's two nights in a row, I decided to spend the night in MY bed. I have to get up at 6am a few days a week to go to an internship in the city, and it's way easier to get ready in my own room. She was initially happy that A and I were in the room for the night, but then decided that she wanted her boyfriend to sleep over - and so she told us to get back to A's apartment and sleep there. I told her my reasoning for wanting to stay, but she continued to push the point. ""But X and I haven't had sex in X days"" ""But you're barely in the room anyways"" ""But I'm very accommodating when A stays over"" (although I have never once asked for solitary use of the room, because I know she has nowhere else to go)

I finally snapped (we were having this conversation in front of mutual friends, which I hate) and told her that I was done talking about it. Before I went to bed, I changed the password on my computer (she spilled tea on hers a few weeks ago and has been commandeering mine ever since), which was probably unwarranted, but it made me feel a little better.

This morning, she texted me about how she is going to change rooms, backing out of our plan to get an apartment (we currently live in the dorms), and nullifying our ""sharing items"" agreement (fine by me, this means I get my ipod and half my wardrobe back). 

I don't really feel that I'm in the wrong here, but selfish people rarely do. We spend a few nights a week together, go shopping, etc, but I've told her time and time again that between my internship and my deepening feelings for A, it's natural that we won't see each other as much. 

Was I wrong for not giving her the room, if this is the end result? She's crazy, but she's my friend, and I don't hold down female friendships well. This also really fucks up housing plans, because I don't have a very friendly household and I was really looking forward to getting a place of my own. A and I have discussed the possibility of moving in together, but it's a distant possibility because we're still so young and the relationship is still relatively new. 

**TD;LR: My roommat/""best friend"" of 8 months tried to sexile me on a night before I had to get up early, I refused, she immediately ends our friendship and future housing plans. Feeling a little lost and confused.**"
1aqr2z,3,2013-03-21,I want to start responsibly planning my personal finances. I'm 17 and preparing to graduate high school. Any help?,highschoolmoneyhelp,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1aqr2z/i_want_to_start_responsibly_planning_my_personal/,"I'll give a lot of information but if anyone has any questions, feel free to ask. By the way, I'm currently in Pennsylvania, US and will be attending school in PA as well (in case this helps).

* **Current Savings:** I currently have $500 in savings. I know this isn't a lot, but I'm working on building it up.

* **Current Income:** Currently, I work part time at a chain clothing store. I make $8.25/hour before taxes. I work between 8-20 hours a week. On average, I bring in $100 each pay period (every 2 weeks). I save as much as possible. I also do occasionally babysit, bu it's not significant. Most of that money goes towards immediate expenses (i.e. gas). I am looking for a higher-paying summer job where I can save more money. Keep in mind my income is limited because I am a full-time high school student.

* **Current Expenses:** I pay for my gas which is about $50 every 2 weeks. I live far enough from school and my work where riding a bike isn't really an option. I also have an internship after school that I need to drive to, so I can't take the bus to school either. I never buy myself clothing and I rarely spend money on extras. Occasionally I'll go to Starbucks with a friend (once every few weeks), but other than that, virtually nothing is purchased.

* **Near-Future Income:** I have applied to MANY scholarships but I haven't heard from any of them yet, so I don't want to count on those just yet. I also intend to work part-time throughout next school year, so I should be able to make ~$2,000 throughout the year. 

* **Near-Future Expenses:** My primary expense will be education. I will be graduating high school this June and will be attending college in the fall. I am planning on majoring in biology and eventually pursuing neuroscience research in grad school. The undergrad school costs ~$50,000/year for 5 years. However, I plan to do partake in the ""3 co-op option"". This extends my education to 5 years (same cost as 4 years, but able to stretch payments over 5 years). The 3 co-ops will allow me to bring in ~$45,000 total over my second, third, and fourth years of school. My parent's can pay $15,000/year towards my education costs. My financial aid package this year was $12,500. This leaves about $23,000 left for me to pay. I will be working this whole summer, allowing me to put ~$3,000 towards tuition. The remaining $18,000 will be in loans. However, this loan will hopefully be a one-time thing, as I have a few things to count on: 1) I will make $15,000 each year during my 2nd-4th years, 2) In my 3rd year, my brother will begin college, so my financial aid will go up, and/or 3) I may transfer to a better school that meets 100% of financial need. I understand loans are a huge deal (I plan on applying for one for students with low interest during and after school). My grandmother offered to purchase my laptop for school and my parents will be able to pay for clothing/dorm supplies I may need.

* **Far-Future Income:** I plan on going to graduate school for neuroscience research and obtaining my PhD. By obtaining a PhD, I will receive a stipend (average is $30,000/year) and a tuition waiver. I can then concentrate primarily on paying my loans.

* **Far-Future Expenses:** I have been with my current boyfriend for 3 years. Yes, I understand that we're young and it's possible we won't end up marrying each other, but it's something I want to take into consideration. He's currently at an Ivy League school and will have zero debt. However, he's very interested in going to law school (which is crazy expensive). He'll probably have debt from law school with none from undergrad. I'll have debt from undergrad with none from grad school.

* **Other Notes:** I truly believe this undergrad program is a great investment. It'll allow me to go straight to work with a good job (some high percentage of students end up working full-time with their co-ops after graduation) and/or allow me to get into a great grad program. I know it's expensive but I love the school and I think it'll be very beneficial. Unfortunately, it's not a program I can transfer into.


How should I prepare for all of this? Any advice on how to budget for all of this? You all know so much and have been through so much and experienced a lot of the same things so I'd love any advice on ANYTHING from you all.

Thank you so much!

Here's a quick definition.  A qualifying offer is a minimum salary that a team must offer (in a 1 year deal) in order to retain the right to match the salary of restricted free agents *after* the contract is up.  It is absolutely not part of the current contract.  A team is not required to make the offer and players are free to negotiate contracts for higher than the qualifying offer.

This is a serious error.  It makes good contracts seem better because it makes it look like they have an extra year at below market value.  It makes bad contracts seem worse because it makes it look like there is an extra year and several more million added to the contract when there is not.  I actually wonder if Bill did this intentionally.


.


Here are all the errors from the best contracts column

.


Kyrie Irving (reported as 4 years $28.6 million)  (reality is 3 years $18.1 mil)

Kenneth Faried (reported as 4 years , $8.6 million) (reality is 3 years $4.9 mil)

Avery Bradley (reported as 3 years, $7.7 million) (reality is 2 years $4.1 mil)

Jimmy Butler (reported as 4 years, $7.6 million) (reality is 3 years $4.2 mil)

Larry Sanders (reported as 3 years, $9.3 million) (reality is 2 years $5 mil)

Eric Bledsoe (reported as 3 years, $8 million) (reality is 2 years $4.3 mil)

Festus Ezeli (reported as 3 years, $3.2 million) (reality is 4 years $5.2 mil)

Nikola Vucevic (reported as 4 years, $10.6 million) (reality is 3 years, $6.3 million)

Greivis Vasquez (reported as 3 years, $6.5 million) (reality is 2 years, $3.3 million)

.


The Ezeli one is weird because Bill didn't include the qualifying offer there, but also did not include the last year of his contract.  Bill did correctly report Kyle Singler's (3 years, $3.13 million), Isaiah Thomas' (2 years, $1.65 million) and Chandler Parsons (3 years, $2.78 million) deals and did not erroneously include qualifying offers.  Anyway, that is 3 for 10 on correct reporting of rookie deals in the best bargains column.


.


I also can't understand why some rookie deals were allowed to be counted among the ""best contracts"" but others were not.  But whatever.

.


The only error in the worst contracts column was Jan Vesely (reported as four years, $17.3 million).  But this is an egregious error.  First of all, the qualifying offer is included, which is absolutely not part of the contract.  Second, his final year is a team option.  So even counting this year (almost over) the Wizards are committed to paying him $6.5 million over 2 years.  And Bill ranks this as the #20 worst contract in the entire league?  Worse than the $16.5 million Bynum deal when Bynum will never play for his team on that contract?  How does that make any sense?  I suspect it was done so Bill could make a crack about his draft night kiss, but it's still wrong.

I'm doing tech support mostly, and it's actually not that bad a job. I enjoy it, even. However, as soon as I arrive at work I just feel less confident and I'm less effective. 

I'm not under a lot of pressure, and not under any stress either. Outside of work I'm fairly confident. Not amazingly so, I'd say I'm moderately confident, but I feel confident enough. When I'm at work I'm constantly doubting myself. My thinking isn't clear, I can't think well on my feet (something I'm not great at outside of work either, but I'm not bad at it) and I'm much less spontaneous towards others. It also takes me way longer to get used to things than usual (i.e. asking certain questions depending on the problems the user is experiencing) and when I'm on the phone I honestly feel like I can't think straight, and it's like I'm under a lot of pressure. In reality, I'm not.

I'm thinking this has to do with feeling the pressure to do well, but as I said I'm not under a lot of pressure at work. Can anyone else relate to this, or experienced anything similar? What can I do about this?"

I'll be graduating in May and moving to NYC in June for an internship in the Chelsea area.  I am originally from the South.  I visited New York for one week in February, but I really don't know much.  I am looking for advice!    
    
First and foremost, I need a place to live.  I'd like to be close(r) to work but I also need somewhere ""affordable.""  Good news, the internship pays and I have some money saved. It's worth noting that I'd like to sublet for June, July and August since it's a 3 month internship, and I want to make sure things work out before committing.    
    
Secondly, what about the car?  I am planning on just flying up and bringing some essentials for the internship period.  If I decide to sign a lease and start my career in NYC, should I sell my car? Driving up is another option but I don't think it would make sense to have a car in the city.    
    
What are some things I should know? What did you learn moving to or living in NYC?  I lived in Los Angeles last summer, and it was awesome but much different.  I have always lived in houses/apartments and understand that my living situation will be much different in new york.    
    
Any advice is welcome and appreciated!  I should be moving up the first week of June.    
    
**edit** - I've found a place to live! Nothing fancy, I'm splitting a studio with 2 other guys but it will be $750/month and it's a mile away from where I'll work.  "

As the title states I am a restaurant manager, with general manager experience, and I would love to work for a brewery.  Specifically I am not looking for the glory of a head or assistant brewer, but I would love to work on the business side of a local brewery working on things like P+L, Revenue Tracking, Marketing, Sales, and so on.  I am a current 30 something college student with a little extra time on my hands, and I would love to use that time to get more experience in the business of brewing, as that is a field I would like to enter after I graduate.

Because I am a college student I am available to intern for credit as long as my internship meets specific criteria which we can go over later.  I am also writing my thesis on the history and science of beer, so any work that can give me some real world experience would be great.

If you would like someone to come in and work a couple of days a week (or full time), or know someone at a brewery that is looking for a little business assistance please let me know.

It started out as a lot of fun, a lot of neat projects to help out with, and a really great learning experience. However, I don't feel as though I have accomplished a lot while working there. I have helped out with various projects, but nothing I can completely claim as my own. Most recently, there really has not been much for us two interns to work on, so we spend most of our days trying to keep ourselves busy. Our supervisors do not communicate a whole lot with us anymore, and we feel as though we have been put by the wayside. Unique situation about our plant is that it is in the process of being moved to a different plant, which I attribute to most of these problems. I understand that we are after all interns, but I was really hoping to have accomplished something that I could put on my resume to really impress employers and get into grad school. This is not my first internship, and at my previous internship I felt as though I was able to accomplish more, but I also had more freedom to act there. I am very grateful to have an opportunity for an internship, because I know many students do not. At the same time though, that makes me want to make sure that I do not waste this opportunity. Has anyone else had these sorts of problem while working their internship, or am I just expecting too much?

I hope to go on to law school afterwards and I'm on track to graduate in two more years. I want to go into civil rights and/or constitutional law. I'm torn between continuing my education here or transferring to a public university across the state. Most of my credits would transfer (54 instead of 62) and I would get just as many extracurricular opportunities there (study abroad, honors college, internships, et cetera).

There are few major differences between the two schools intrinsically.The private school will assuredly put me in debt. The public school will also put me in debt, but the level of indebtedness is about $5,000 less than the private. Not much difference over the long run in terms of student loan payments. The public school offers me more classes in my interests and major (Political Sciene with a Philosophy minor). Those at the private are interesting, sure, but I'm pulling teeth for classes that will prepare me for the type of law I'm pursuing. It is a great business pre-law school, though.

On the surface it seems to be a pretty simple choice. However, there is a major consideration that's slowing me down. I'm currently a NCAA athlete for the private school; I run cross country and track. I'm pretty good at my sport. Not the best but I'm definetely closer to the front pack than the middle. I've had dreams of running in the NCAA since I was in high school. From there I wanted to become a ""serious amature."" Basically, run in national class road races and meets. Maybe even run professionally if I got my 5k down fast enough. It wouldn't be easy, but it would be feasible. 

But reality's been rather prohibitive. If I go to law school, I won't have the time to pursue that high level. Afterwards would be even less possible. I could only defer those goals if I already achieved a professional qualifying time before graduation. My coach's training philosophy doesn't promote that level of skill. His philosophy is good, don't get me wrong, but I know my body. It wouldn't be enough.

Furthermore, I'm uncertain if I can continue my tutelage under him for the next two years. His philosophy, again, is great. His communication ability, not so much. He shows up late to workouts, doesn't tell us what our training is ahead of time (some workouts can't just be done. They need some mental prep), he doesn't know when events are at the meets and as such we don't know what races we're running and we arrive way early unintentionally. I'm forced to host all of the recruits and he's inconsistent in his advice (""I want you to do x,y,z after every workout. Everyday. It'll make you great."" A week later as I do it: ""Why are you doing x,y,z? You're going to burn yourself out."" It flipflops all season).

I know if I transferred that I'll get the chance to achieve my ultimate goals. Even if I find I don't like the pursuit, there's still the option to run for that school. Emotionally, I'd more than likely be happier there since I would live with my best friend, have a more active social life, and see my girlfriend and family more often. But, not too long ago, I was convinced that this school was perfect for me. Now it's appearing to be the contrary and I don't want that to happen to me when I transfer. In the end, here is safe predictability that allows me to run my 3 years and go to law school while struggling to find classes that interest me. There, few things are as static. It's a slightly higher risk with a significantly higher reward. What would you guys recommend? 

Ps: thank you for reading through the long post. You guys are awesome!"

SON, IN THIS HOUSE, THE DOOR ONLY SWINGS IN ONE DIRECTION.""
One dad puts his foot down about his son's sexual preference.....

I was a college professor for many years. One day one of my students, a 19 year old young man, told me he was gay, and had known he was gay since he was 11, but that he could not tell his parents. I got him into contact with a support group on campus and a good counselor.

At the mid-year he went home for Christmas with plans to tell his parents.

His mom was very understanding and let him know that she had pretty much known for years, but his dad was could not accept the truth. He told his son that ""in this house there is a right way and a wrong way and this is wrong. The door only swings in one direction son and if you can't accept that you need to leave.""

This was his Sophomore Year. For the remainder of that year and into the next  he did not go home. He saw his mom and a sister every now and then. I did not see a lot of him senior year. He was very busy with internships etc.

Then come a the graduate honors banquet. He was being honored. I was astounded to see him setting at a table with his boyfriend AND both of his parents, sister and brother. They were all chatting away.

Later I got my former student aside and asked him what was up. He said that at Thanksgiving earlier in the academic year, his mom had insisted that he AND his boyfriend be invited to the house for Thanksgiving.  Mom, and the siblings ganged up on Dad.

It was not an easy afternoon but they made it. My student and his boyfriend drove down and back the same day. At Christmas, they were invited to say for a week. When my student asked if they could share a room, the mom said they could if they were discreet.

Dad grit his teeth and accepted the situation.

On New Years Day, a series of odd circumstances led to his Dad spending the better part of the day with his son and his son's partner. To his great surpise, he discovered he liked the boyfriend and for the first time saw how happy his son was with him. That night at dinner, the dad made a toast to the two of them.

The son looked up and asked: ""I thought the door only swung in one direction?"" His dad grinned back and said: ""It did. So I got a new door.""


Edit: I just re-read it and saw that it said preference in the beginning. I replied to the author with this: ""This is awesome. Thank you for the story. However, I would change the word ""preference"" to orientation. The way I like to describe it is: Preference is WHAT you like to do in bed and  orientation is WHO you do in bed. Preference implies choice, while orientation is innate."""

What I am going to say is why I personally donated to The Trevor Project through our effort.

One of the many  reasons I come to our sub as much as I do is the community and the chance to be able to do some good for others and The Trevor Project does just that. Do you even realize all the things that The Trevor Project does? I sure didn’t before this effort. Not only does it offer the only nationwide, around-the-clock crisis and suicide prevention helpline for LGBTQ youth. But it also offers: ([From Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trevor_Project))


**Dear Trevor**

""Dear Trevor"" is an online non-time-sensitive question-and-answer resource for young people with questions surrounding sexual orientation and gender identity.


**TrevorChat**


TrevorChat is a free, confidential, live and secure online messaging service provided by The Trevor Project. TrevorChat is only intended to assist those who are not at risk for suicide.


**TrevorSpace**


TrevorSpace is an online social networking community for LGBTQ youth ages 13 through 24, along with their friends and allies. Youth can create personal profiles and connect with other young people throughout the country, as well as find resources within their communities. TrevorSpace is carefully monitored by administrators designated by the project to ensure all content is age appropriate, youth-friendly and factual. TrevorSpace links members to The Trevor Project's home page, where information about The Trevor Lifeline, ""Dear Trevor,"" and other resources is available. The software used to create TrevorSpace was donated to the project by Tim Gill, an American software entrepreneur and philanthropist.

**Palette Fund Internship Program**


Through the Palette Fund Internship Program, the project provides for five internships in both its Los Angeles, California, and New York City, New York, offices. Interns are placed among the program, communication and development departments and provides an opportunity for young people to learn about working in the non-profit sector. Palette Fund internships are specifically designed to introduce young leaders to the LGBTQ movement.

**Youth Advisory Council**


The Youth Advisory Council serves as a liaison between youth nationwide and the project, as it relates to young people and the issues surrounding suicide, sexuality and gender identity. The council submits recommendations to the project in an effort to increase Trevor visibility and best serve the LGBTQ youth population.
School workshops
The project's Lifeguard Workshop Program uses a structured, age-appropriate curriculum to address topics around sexuality, gender identity, the impacts of language and behavior, and what it means for young people to feel different. The program also teaches young people to recognize depression and suicide amongst their peers, the impacts of language and behavior on LGBTQ youth, and suicide prevention skills in schools.

And now for the whine...

I'm a one man IT band for a SMB manufacturing company, and I'll admit it, most of the time I'm slacking off and procrastinating on just about everything. I'll take responsibility for that. That being said, despite having a decent education and modest chops, due to the culture of the company (technophobic) and various other factors, I constantly feel as though nothing I do matters. I mean, I just don't feel appreciated, and it seems like I'm continually being stuck with coworker's busy work, meaning that if they find it even slightly challenging, and can make anything near a half baked case for it being something I should do, or ""help"" (meaning I'll have to do it myself) with, I get stuck with it. 

I want out, but it just seems like there's nothing out there that would be a good opportunity for me. I want to use my MS in InfoSec, but the majority of what I do currently isn't what I'd call direct experience towards a security related job, even though I'm responsible for everything technology related for a $14M company. And we all know that the ""entry level"" is a bygone idea.

Currently, I'm just trying to keep my head above water, study for certs (CCNA first, then Sec+, maybe CISA or I'll just bite the bullet and CISSP and be an associate until I can get the rest of the experience) and keep looking for jobs.

I know I'm capable of so much more, but every time in the past that I've put together a project or proposal to improve the company, even when it's been requested, it has been marginalized, backburnered, and eventually forgotten about, despite the countless hours that went into research, planning, and vendor negotiations (who will then be bugging me for weeks about when to expect a decision). I'm just not sure how much more of this lack of professionalism, or basic competency I can reasonably tolerate.

And then there's the pay. I make what I did when I started 3 years ago (gross)  straight out of college, and deductions for benefits have gone up (lowering take home pay). Even then, I started making less than the bottom 10% for entry level in my area (which is already below national and regional averages). It's disheartening. Especially with 9+ years of education, and 6 years of previous internships (thanks to the market crash of 2007.)

Anyway, any words of encouragement or abuse to motivate me?

TL;DR I'm responsible for my future, any words of encouragement or abuse for motivation?

I had a question regarding a certain Big 4 firm that promotes to senior after 3 years while all the others do 2. I have an internship with that firm this summer in my top city choice (got three interviews total, one other offer but not top city), and would definitely like to just get a FT offer, accept it, and relax my final year of school, and by relax I mean study for the CPA exam lol. 

But, I'm one of those people that is pretty sure I want to just leave after a year at senior to go to industry (but will keep an open mind of course). That said, a year of senior at this firm tends to come after 3 years at associate, while the other guys would just be 2. Has anyone been in this situation and chosen another firm based on this reason? I know its not a *huge* deal, but if you think about it, 1 extra year added on to 3 already is a sorta high percentage increase. 

Do you guys think it would be really stupid to try to do recruiting with the other 3 next fall instead of just taking the offer that is (probably going to be) right in front of me, for the reason of a slower promotion schedule?"

Now in my intern for modeling I can have abit more free time/head as when i went to school, so i can also program for myself.

Earlier I already had a look at certain beginner courses for programming but they tend to talk about what a loop is and how to write a very basic program.

I am currently glancing over the lists on Coursera and Udacity to find an appropiate Course to get me deeper into Programming.

Now I would like to know if you guys can suggest a course wich I could take on. I would prefere a course using C++ but would also go for Web Development(Design or Programming) or C#.

The course should be inspiring not giving the basics of something and tell me how fun it is to add 5+5, yeah at my beginning it was fun but now i want to draw bigger and more detailed pictures. I think there are guys who know what i mean with that.

I grew up in a single mom family of four boys, and long story short I was abused and emasculated for basically anything that came out of my mouth.  It has taken me a long time and a lot of therapy to get over the depression. Most of my teachers and bosses over the years have been women, and that has not been a problem. 

But I am a university student at a really radical feminist/female chauvinist campus, and the general view is that unless you state that you are a feminist then you are ostracized (and it is a largely female campus - about 70%). Pretty much every week I am confronted in a conversation that I will give my opinion (which is egalitarian if I were to pick an -ism), and be chastised for it because it doesn't agree completely with the female position. Or at times I will apply for positions and after being told 'no' I will check back and find that the staff is almost exclusively female except for a few support positions. I realize that most of the candidates might be women but I can't help but feel this is somewhat unfair.

In fact if I wasn't in the Army reserves I am pretty sure that I would be fucked.

Look, I am not stupid, racist, evil, sexist, or a bad guy. I come from a working class background from a small town in the middle of nowhere, put myself through university with no debt, and am told I am one of the nicest persons other people have met (testimony from members of a youth group I work with and from two ex-girlfriends) but I can definitely look after myself and can be assertive/bad ass when called for (PI, investigative journalist, lock pick, card shark, read a lot, martial artist, chess strategist, marksman, kick ass cook and BBQer among other things). 

It just seems at times I just feel that I am being penalized for being male, and it is making me angry at women. Very angry. I meditate (practicing Zen Buddhist) and try and understand the source, but the anger keeps returning.

So my general question is, am I out of line? Any advice?

TL;DR: white male putting himself through university feels that there is a bias against him for being male, and has a history of abuse from emasculating single mom, and being occasionally harassed by radical feminists on university campus. Grew up w/o a father."

I am currently living in the United States and am attending a four year university in North Carolina. At the moment my summer job looks like working maintenance in Southeast D.C. and I'm not too pumped about it, but its a job and it pays decently. So here's where am I going with this, I would like to become involved in some way with the Esports scene over the summer and have no idea where to start, I am aware of Riot's summer internship program, but that filled up weeks if not months ago as far as I know. I am not planning on dropping out of school or anything of the sort, I am just unemployed and I would like to get involved in something that has a greater meaning to me. Any ideas are well appreciated here, and I mean any and every idea will be appreciated. I'm not even looking for an internship with Riot specifically although that would be an incredible opportunity, but some way of becoming involved in the overall esports scene.

If you took the time to read this thank you, I truly appreciate it.

1apmcj,3,2013-03-20,I'm so exhausted all the time.,sadthrowaway504,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1apmcj/im_so_exhausted_all_the_time/,"This is my first time in this subreddit, so I'm sorry if I've completely missed the point.


I have not seen any kind of professional, so I don't have any kind of diagnosis, but I've been struggling on-and-off with what I believe to be depression for a while now. I'll go a few weeks feeling fine, and then a few weeks feeling awful. I'm at a low point right now, and have been for a couple of weeks, and I have to say I think this is the worst I've been, especially in terms of the physical symptoms. I'm afraid that I'm getting worse; not only are my periods of depression worse, but the periods where I feel okay feel like they're getting shorter and more infrequent. 


I'm a sophomore in college, and I feel like I completely messed up my college experience. I failed to join any kind of organization that I felt I fit in with, and the friends I made as a freshman in my dorm are so flakey that no matter how hard I try, I never see them now that we don't live together anymore. All I have is my boyfriend, who is wonderful, but just not enough. I'm incredibly lonely and isolated. Most days, he is the only person I even talk to. 


I also have a lot of anxiety and feelings of failure when it comes to my future. As I said, I am not a part of any clubs or organizations, so my resume is pretty bare. I tried to find an internship in my field for this summer, and failed. My application to study abroad next semester also didn't work out. I am terrified that I'm not doing enough to be able to get a job after I graduate. The only thing I do have going for me is a high GPA, but I'm struggling to maintain that as my depression worsens.


The hardest thing to deal with, though, is the physical aspects of it. I have headaches most days. In the last week, I've also experienced a lot of nausea every day. Mostly I'm just tired, and it's been getting worse and worse. Here's a typical day for me in the last two weeks: I set a series of alarms every 15 minutes for an hour or two. The first one wakes me up, but I usually can't find the energy to get out of bed and I drift in and out of sleep until about half an hour after the last alarm sounds, meaning that it usually takes me around two hours to get up in the morning. 

Once I finally do get up, I shower and get ready (about an hour), and by then I'm usually exhausted again, so I get back in bed for an hour or two. 

I go to class, and within an hour of leaving my bed, I am so physically exhausted that I can barely keep my eyes open. Twice a week, I have several classes in a row, and lately I've had to skip the least important one to sleep just so I can make it through the others.

I return from class, and immediately get back in bed for another hour or two, then get up and do the bare minimum of homework. I can usually only last for a couple of hours, and I really struggle to motivate myself, so not much gets done. By nine or ten, I'm exhausted again and go to bed. My boyfriend obviously doesn't go to bed this early, so we have only had sex three times in the last two weeks.


I'm at a loss for what to do. I have no good reason to be depressed: I'm 20 years old, reasonably attractive, I go to a great school, I'm studying a field I love, and I have an incredible boyfriend who worships the ground I walk on. But here I am, and I really can't go on like this. The past few weeks, I've spent a grand total of maybe six hours out of bed each day. I'm wary of antidepressants as I do have good periods, and I just don't really want to alter my brain chemistry that way. I'm also very concerned about side effects, especially considering my libido is already shit thanks to my birth control. I considered St. John's Wort, but that isn't an option because of interactions with birth control (I don't think an unplanned pregnancy is going to help my depression).


What can I do? Is this depression? Am I sick? I just want my energy back. I'm not even really sad anymore because I don't have the energy to be sad; all I do is sleep. I know I need help, but I don't know where to get it. Do I need a therapist or a doctor? I'd really appreciate any comments, advice, whatever. Especially on the energy levels, because this is REALLY not working out for my personal or academic life."

I am currently in a bit of an awkward situation.  For the past 4 summers, I have interned for a software company which I'll refer to as TechnoSoft.  TechnoSoft pays very well for the area, and I've built up a good rapport with the people over at TechnoSoft.  Unfortunately, I live and attend school in a different city as TS.  In fact it's about 80 miles away.

As a result, working at TS during the school semester is not an option.  This school year, in order to make some money during the semester, I took an internship at a local company which I'll call DigiCorp.  I've been working at DigiCorp since the fall of last year.  I like DigiCorp too, and I have built up good relationships with my team members there, however they don't pay nearly as well as TechnoSoft.

Today, my boss from TechnoSoft e-mailed me to let me know that he'd like to have me back again this summer, and he wants to know if I'm planning on coming back.  DigiCorp would also like to have me on for the summer.  Since TS is in a different city, it does cost a bit more to live there for three months and move back.  As a result, a decent raise from DigiCorp would be enough to make it financially sound to stay with DigiCorp for the summer.  As well, I'd like to work for DigiCorp in the fall semester of this year, and I don't know how eager they'd be to have me back after leaving for another company for the summer.

To make things even more complicated, I graduate in December of this year, and I would enjoy working full time at either of these companies.  My boss at TechnoSoft has said outright that he wants to hire me when I graduate, and my boss at DigiCorp has been dropping hints lately that he would like to hire me too.  If I leave DigiCorp to work for TechnoSoft this summer, I fear that I may be screwing myself out of an internship in the fall and possibly a position at the end of the year at DigiCorp.  But if I skip out on going back to TechnoSoft again, I feel like I may be hurting my ability to work for *them* after I graduate.

Are these valid concerns?  Do companies hate when employees jump around like this?  Will I be building up a reputation for working short term and jumping at the first deal which is slightly better?  Is there a third option?  Do interns ever get raises?

Sorry, I can't summarize this in a TL;DR.  Also, after writing most of this, I found out that both TechnoSoft and DigiCorp are real companies.  Disregard this fact.

I thank anyone who responds in advance, and I will definitely stick around to answer questions of context or clarification."

I'm currently pursuing a career in the entertainment industry on the network/studio side of things, not creative. I've done several different internships with really strong companies and am in LA looking for entry level jobs but still unemployed.    
     
The opportunity arose for me to interview in a different state for some different positions, still with a recognizable company but not in NY/LA. These positions are above entry level and would be very exciting with a high level of responsibility. My fear though is that if I am offered and accept a position, how would it effect my ability to later receive a job again in NY/LA. This company and location would be great for now, but not for long term, and I do want to be back in NY/LA in the future.     
     
So would taking the cool job with more responsibilities in a non-major location be a bad move if after 1-2 years I want to be in NY/LA again? Comments appreciated

Thus, once again, do you guys have any advice on things I should start trying to learn and understand in order to appeal to companies?

Thanks a ton guys."

I am a 1L at a T1 school with my first summer internship interview tomorrow. I was wondering if anyone who has gone through the process before had any tips etc. on things that law job interviewers look for / how the process might differ from a normal job interview. Generally things you wish you might have known when you had your first interview.

I don't know if context will help, but in case it might...
I am top 15% of my class, and have had work experience before law school, but I am already getting nervous as this one of those summer experiences that is both paid and in the field I want to work (corporate / industrial).

Thanks so much!"

1atm3s,1,2013-03-22,Don't really have anyone I can talk to about this,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1atm3s/dont_really_have_anyone_i_can_talk_to_about_this/,"I apologize for the upcoming essay.  Don't really care if anyone reads this, just have to air it, and I'm probably going to sound like an ungrateful brat.

As a little background.  I'm a 22 year old male university student in a good sized city (Boston).  I am majoring in an IT related field one year from graduation, and by all accounts I have it pretty good, aside from a mountain of student loans.  I've had internships and co-ops and my prospects for having a job as soon as I graduate are pretty good.  But there is something that has been starting to bother me as I got further in school.  I have started to become absolutely terrified about having this normal life.  I'm setting myself up to be working 9-5 in an office until I retire and I absolutely can't stand that idea to the point that I actually get stressed out about it.  My passions don't lie with IT, they are with producing progressive house music.  The problem is that everyone expects me to just fall into the normal routine of getting a job once I graduate and just trying to climb the stupid corporate ladder until I retire.  I'm scared that running in corporate hamster wheel grind will just leave me unfulfilled.

Why does it feel like that I'm not allowed to try and pursue my dream of being an EDM producer?  Why is it something that is reserved just a hilariously small few that doesn't include me? I know the music industry is hard, I don't even have to make it big.  If I break even with enough to eat and sleep by making music that I love and playing in clubs and festivals, I would be happy..more than happy actually.  If I could even do it for just a year, I could go back to whatever normal life I'm supposed to have with the knowledge that I experienced things and did what I loved.  I honestly think that I have the talent to do it, I just don't have the time right now to dedicate to it and give it a serious go because of school and getting ready for ""real life"".  I've been producing house music when I have time between classes and work and such for about a year and I'm just starting to get to a point where I'm happy with what I've been making. But I can't even imagine what my family and friends would think if I just decided that I needed to take a year or something and give it a shot (I don't even think I can do this because of student loans).  I'm afraid that the crushing weight of student debt that I didn't fully understand until I got further in my college career has literally killed following my dream before I could even start.  I tried talking to my parents about it and they just laugh ""You want to do what you love? you and everyone else"". To them its just the wishings of youth.  I love my parents, but I don't think they realize how much this eats away at me. How can they? To everyone else, I should be happy with what I have.  

I honestly don't know how to say all this without sounding like and ungrateful little prick who wants to be a rockstar like everyone else, but that isn't it.  I do appreciate what I have, and its not that I want MORE, I just want something different.  I don't feel right setting myself up for a career I just know I won't like and will leave me feeling unfulfilled.  I WANT to pursue my passion of house music, even if I fail, I don't want to regret not trying and just falling into the status quo because that is what is expected of me.  I just don't even know how I can honestly give it my all considering my situation with student debt.  If you have advice, I would be forever grateful, but I just needed to get all of this out of my head.  Its been stewing in there for awhile now. "
1atm0n,1,2013-03-22,Two internship stigma?,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1atm0n/two_internship_stigma/,"The recruiters and advisors at my school recommend completing one internship the summer before you graduate. I get their reasoning, as firms don't want to take you on as an intern twice, and turning down a job offer could burn bridges for you later on.

However, I know many of you cite several internship experiences. Were those local jobs, or did you establish that you weren't looking for a job beforehand?

My situation is that I want to graduate with a masters (one year) before working full time. Ideally, I would have internships for two summers with bookkeeping/oddjobs in between. By that time, I'd have a better understanding of my interest in tax vs audit.

So did you intern at large regionals or big 4 twice?"

A little background on my situation... 
-32 Years old, starting a new career 
-Currently I am an office manager for a financial planner. I do not do anything financially related 
-Just graduated with a BBA in accounting about 9 months ago, with a 4.0

My original goal was/is to get my CPA. I have over 150 credit hours, and meet all requirements. I've been looking for an entry level job with a CPA firm since a little before I graduated. I go to every career fair, networking events...yet I have a hard time getting interviews. I know I am personable and I interview well, yet not one offer. I feel like I am stuck in a bad position. Ever firm I speak with is either looking for interns or seniors...nothing entry level. Unfortunately, I can't take an internship because I have a wife, baby, mortgage, etc...

Now back to my current job. I work for a small financial planning firm, and my boss loves me, and is doing everything possible to keep me (including a raise when he found out I was looking for other jobs). He wants me to join him as a CFP. I can't lie, while I know the basics of what he does, I know next to nothing on a deeper level of financial planning (the only finance course I took was a principles course required for the accounting degree).

I'm not sure which direction to go at this point. I feel like the CPA route, if and when I do find something, would be more financially stable, but financial planning could be much more lucrative and less rigid. Obviously I have no idea, and that is why I started this post.

All advice, anecdotes, sarcastic remarks are welcomed.

Also, I'm sure I'm missing a bunch of details about my situation, so feel free to ask questions.

I feel like the 12/hour offer is a rip off, as they said I had the best interview and seemed really eager to hire me.  I was told the conglomerate of companies had a meeting to discuss where I would be the best fit, so there is also some proof that I am actually *wanted*, I think.  I'd like to negotiate the hourly pay (and the start date, but that's different), but I'm not sure how or what I should offer.

(+ some more questions),[deleted],actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1asx8z/whats_a_good_timeline_for_a_college_student_with/,"Hello, I'm a freshman majoring in Math (might minor in quantitative finance). With summer nearly coming, I wanted to spend that free time preparing for an actuarial career.

 Should I try to sit down for the first actuarial exam already? What are some of the college classes I should have already taken in order to have an easier time with the first exam? So far, I will have only taken general ed courses (calc I-II, physics I-II, chem I-II, bio, comp sci I), that I wonder how some people I see online already pass their first actuarial exam during their first semester of college. Is it just mostly self study?

I was hoping to take an exam this summer so that the summer after my soph year, I can try for an actuarial internship.

I have some questions about this though.

 Do actuarial internships require at least one exam? What are the credentials I would need to be marketable and get an actuarial job when I graduate? (like how many exams, how many internships) What would be a good timeline during the 4 years of my college to achieve this?

I do apologize for so many questions, I just wanna get a head start.

Long-time restaurateur Brock Shepherd is bringing Toronto’s ultra-local brewery trend to Kensington Market—but he needs your help.
BY: CRYSTAL LUXMORE
Starting a brewery isn’t cheap. Usually, would-be brewers rely on friends, family, and a generous bank loan to finance an extremely expensive venture. Brock Shepherd, however, is taking a different approach: He’s counting on ale-loving locals to pitch in.
Like many beginners, 44-year-old Shepherd first crafted his recipes—Augusta Ale and Baldwin FishEYE-PA—at existing breweries. (In his case, Oakville’s Black Oak Brewing and Guelph’s Wellington Brewery.) But the plan was always to open a brick-and-mortar outfit in his own Kensington Market ’hood.
In December, Shepherd took the plunge, bidding adieu to his 15-year-old restaurant, Burger Bar. Two weeks ago he inked a long-term lease on part of a new retail development under construction at 299 Augusta. The plan is to open this fall, with an on-site retail store. David Lee, a 31-year-old Mill Street veteran, will be brewmaster, and says he’s eager to start crafting all-new recipes at a smaller shop.
But even small shops cost big bucks—about 500,000 of them. That’s where Shepherd hopes the community will step in and help. “I heard about a few people doing community-supported breweries in the States, and thought, that’s a really good way of involving people and letting them watch something grow.”
Shepherd’s plan is one-part community-supported agriculture, where customers pay up front for a share of the harvest, and one-part Kickstarter, with top-tier investors getting access to members-only privileges.
Shepherd wants to raise $50,000 to $100,000—at best, just one-fifth of the total cost. But he also hopes the venture will help win the hearts of market locals who might not love the slick new structure going up on the block (which will soon replace the building that housed the bar and performance space Bread and Circus, and more recently, Electric Theatre).
“Kensington is like its own little town, in its quirky way,” says Shepherd. So bringing the neighbours on board makes good business sense here, maybe more than anywhere else in the city. And if the locals show the love for their namesake brewery, then surely the rest of the city will, too.

1aspne,174,2013-03-22,"I've (m24) been with my partner (f23) for 4 years, but now work on the other side of the planet 60% of the time. She understands the reasons (I make very good money), but after 12 months of doing this, she's told me to quit my job.",throwaway75329,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1aspne/ive_m24_been_with_my_partner_f23_for_4_years_but/,"Long ass back story (or skip to TL;DR)

So we've been together for about 4 years now. We met at university, we've both had a bunch of short- and long(ish)-term relationships beforehand, and things just went perfectly.


We're both from, and studied in, the UK.


Before I graduated, I was (almost out of the blue, but from a very legitimate source) offered a very well-paying job ($80k) as a software engineer in the US. The deal was for me to spend 2 months in the US, then I would work remotely from the UK, and visit the US for a few weeks at a time, a few times a year. Initially the idea of spending 2 months away from her sounded like hell, but we both saw that with the UK's economy in the state it was (and still is) in, it was a pretty damn good deal.


We were living together in an apartment that (with a little help from my father) we'd bought, and had just moved in when I had to leave for the US.


After the 2 months, and a Christmas break, I was offered a raise (to $100k); in exchange for another 6 weeks in the US, but this time they'd pay for her to come along for the ride too. She was still studying at that point, so came along, but only for 3 weeks.


After that, we lived together very happily for about 4 months. Then one day, I was offered another raise. To $140k. But from then on I'd have to spend at least half my time in the US. It took some time for it to sink in to both of us what was on the cards; trading a very nice cohabiting situation, for a part-time long-distance thing. There's obviously a whole debate on that itself, but in the end, we decided that I should take it.


We came to the agreement that I'd spend 6 weeks in the US, then 3-4 weeks in the UK. And just roll with that. She came over and chilled for 3 months in the summer after she graduated; we travelled the US, went to Canada, and had two very luxurious weeks in Hawaii. 


She'd graduated with a degree in crime / law, and through a contact of my boss's, got [legal gray area] an internship with a private investigator[/legal gray area]. After a month of that, he wanted to employ her full time, and sponsor her for a visa. If you're unfamiliar with the US visa system -- from an outsiders point of view, even those with higher education qualifications (I have a Masters degree, and I barely got in) it's one of the worst systems going. She's basically ineligible, because the US decided that the number of years spent in education outweighs the globally standardized levels of certification. An undergraduate degree in the US is 4 years, but in plenty of other places it's 3. We were told she's not even eligible to apply. Go back to school and get a Masters degree, or 3 years progressive work experience. 


She can stay in the US for as long as I'm there -- we're not married but there is a non-working visa for long-term cohabiting partners of people who have a working visa, and we have enough proof of that (proof of our joint mortgage is enough). But for her, it would likely suck, because she cannot work.


Since then, she's been back in the UK, and I've been travelling to and from my office and her. It's not easy, on either of us. But we've had enough long, hard conversations about it, and decided that we should give it a year, and reassess things. I work for a startup company. There's a fair chance that my job won't even exist in 12 months time. My visa allows me to transfer to another company, but it might be hard to find one that's quite so lenient on me disappearing from the office every 6 weeks. So I'd probably come home.


But if my job does exist in 12 months, then it means were doing well. I'm on track to have a raise and a bonus that would put me at $180-200k for this year; not including the fairly significant number of company stocks I own.


The trouble is; as much as we both see the upside to this, it really isn't easy on our relationship. She recently got a decent job in the UK, with some good prospects for advancing, and pays about $30k. We both work long hours (both our jobs expect at least 50 hours per week, and I've worked both days of the weekend for weeks in a row in the past), and with an 8 hour time difference, communicating isn't easy. We email each other from when I wake up to when she goes to sleep, but a phone call during the week probably only happens 2-3 times, for 30 minutes, when I get chance to take a break from working.


At the weekend, we Skype for about 3 hours each day, unless she's got plans otherwise (it's morning in the US, so I'm always available). When I'm back in the UK, things are usually excellent. At the weekend, we'll drive to another city for a couple of nights, or get a cheap flight to somewhere in Europe that we've never been. But a few weeks in, and I have to leave again.


I've come to the conclusion in my mind, that this is the situation we're in. I think it's far from perfect, but considering not many people are as fortunate as I've been, I think it would be wise to ride it out. Keep collecting the pay checks until I have to come home, or if the company survives the year, stick it out and get a pretty big payout in the end. I try and remove as many negative thoughts about how this is affecting our relationship as possible; not because I don't care (which is what she thinks I do it for), but because thinking like that is going to do nothing but make both of us feel bad.


She's very good at hiding her feelings, and will one day sit down and talk over all this, we'll agree on things, and move on. But then a few weeks later, she'll burst out into tears and anger at how I've escaped across the world. This is usually after she hangs out with her ""friends"" (right now, people she's been working with for about a month, have never met me, and don't really know her) that just make her feel stupid; by making out that she's some sort of idiot for putting up with me. ""My boyfriend would never, *EVER*, do that to me!"".


Last night, was the first time we've had an argument about this situation while I haven't been over in the US. Usually it comes after I've been gone for about 4 weeks, and one of us gets too busy that we don't get chance to speak for a few days. We talk it over, and then we're fine again. She's always said that she doesn't want this to go on for longer than a year, but this was the first time she said ""if you're still over there in 12 months, I'll have to leave you"".


My long-term friends, are all just mostly jealous because they know I make more money than they do (though they actually think it's quite a bit less than it really is), and think my girlfriend is ""so lucky"".


Her long-term friends, are generally very supportive.


Both our families are supportive, but hers have suggested to her in private that I should probably quit my job and come home. Though they don't know all the details, and aren't really aware that I'm not going to be able to get a job of this caliber in the UK.


**TL;DR
I've been with my girlfriend for 4 years, I took a job that requires me to spend 60% of my time on the other side of the world, about 18 months ago. I make a truckload of money, enough to support both of us comfortably, but if she joins me she'll have to quit her job, and won't be able to work.**


Has anyone else that's been in a situation like this got any advice/experience to share?


Was I just a massive cock for taking the job in the first place?


Am I the greedy, immoral slime ball that her co-workers think I am?


Is it unreasonable of me to want to make (a lot) of money while I can?


If you were me, would you have taken the job?


If you were me, would you quit my job?


If you were her, would you move to the US knowing you couldn't work (the deal includes a puppy of your choice, and 5 minutes walking distance to the beach)?


If you were her, would you just leave me now, because it's already been long enough?


What the hell can I say to her that I haven't already?"

Thanks for reading this post. I recently have been in the process of filing paperwork in preparation of a summer gov't internship. They have already offered the position to me, and I have already accepted. Because of the nature of the internship, a background check was requested. I just received an email that the organization would like to speak with me about an issue that came up in my background. Up until this point, the process of preparing for this summer has gone very smoothly.

Next week, I will go in to the organization's office to speak with a supervisor about this ""issue."" This ""issue"" is either a DUI (conviction about 2 years ago), or an arrest on an erroneous outstanding warrant (I didn't know about the warrant, but I called the police to my residence while detoxing. I was having auditory hallucinations and I thought that I heard people banging on my door and threatening me). If this second arrest comes up, I assume that they will want to know the circumstances surrounding it, and why the police were there in the first place. I'm unsure how to describe these incidents. I don't want to downplay them, yet I want to show them that those behaviors are in the past. It's all embarrassing, to be sure, but it's all part of my story and my bottom.

Thing is, I want to reassure them that these are not liabilities, and I wanted to know if the fine people in this community had any advice, thoughts, or opinions about how I should discuss these incidents. HP willing, I will have 1 year of sobriety in 2 weeks.

* Do I identify as an alcoholic?
* Assure them that I am working an active recovery program?
* Do I tell them that I am about to be one year sober as evidence that this behavior is in the past?
* How in-depth into the DTs should I discuss if they ask me why I called the police in the first place (hallucinations)? I feel like these things would scare people that have not experienced them or do not know they are all about.

I will go more in depth in PM about my circumstances if anyone is interested, I'm just not comfortable discussing potentially identifiable information in my post. Thank you for taking the time to read this and thinking about whether you have any advice to offer!"

My name is Blake. Ten years ago, the solar system passed through an interstellar dust cloud and drew the attention of primordial entities that saw our world with envious and covetous eyes. 

I was once an intern for the Washington Post, but when the Brass King and his family came, they smashed almost every attempt at defending our planet. Rumor is that we killed two of them with nuclear devices, but the war was short and we came out on the losing side. 

The Brass King is the closest of this family that resembles us. He's tall (somewhere around 8 feet), has long and thin limbs, and is coated in brass plates that cover and disguise something that clearly isn't human. Still, he wears a human mask and opulent robes and clothing.
He is cruel and vicious at a moment's notice, but prefers to watch over his land with dark amusement. 

I've heard of his family. The rulers of Europe and Eurasia are much more vicious and much more 'destroy at a whim.' The Brass King is far more interested in displays of power and political manipulations- 
Last summer he took over the wilds of northern Canada and now rules everything above the Rio Grande.

I wake up at eight in the morning, I jog to work, I'm expected to clean and prepare food and see to his needs, along with some twenty other workers for up to fourteen hours a day, every day. Even the slightest failure results in tremendous consequences.

Words cannot describe how much I hate him.
I hope the rumored rebellion in the north is true- If there's any way to continue fighting these things, we have to try. 

Feel free to ask me anything about me, my work or the world I live in.
I'll try to answer everything I can.

1asa5m,2,2013-03-22,the end of an 11 year relationship. starting a new happier life. ,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1asa5m/the_end_of_an_11_year_relationship_starting_a_new/,"just wanted to share this story with you gals incase any of you are in the same situation. its a long story...

we started dating when we were 15. my first 'real' boyfriend. i was his first girlfriend ever. our relationship was pretty solid for 9 years, we had out ups and downs but always worked things out. 2 years ago he moved halfway across the country for an 8 month long internship. he flew back home once a month, it was tough but we did ok for the first 6 months. the last few months he became very distant. we wouldnt talk, he would get mad if i wanted to talk etc. then he dropped the ""i dont think i love you anymore, i think we should take a break"" i was heart broken. i had no idea what to do. i begged him to change his mind, i did whatever i could to convince him he loved me. 

my biggest issue was, i have known NOTHING other than my life with him. he was everything to me. he came back home and i was basically his slave. i did everything he wanted me to, i needed to make sure he stayed with me, i wouldnt know what to do without him. everything i did was to make him happy. i was horribly depressed but i knew if he left i would be worse off than just pretending i was happy. 

eventually i convinced myself everything was fine. i just assumed this would be my life forever so i just went with it. i let him lie to me, i forgave him. he told me i was getting fat, i started dieting and working out, i needed him to love me and be attracted to me, i did whatever it took. 

after a year of completely losing all respect for myself, a friend died and i started talking to one of his friends via facebook messenger. we started out just talking about our friend and his passing, then we started talking about other things, ourselves what we like etc etc. we were texting continuously, it was all completely innocent just friend talk but i really really connected with him. after a few months i realized i had developed a major crush on him and was really torn at what to do. after thinking i decided my current relationship was great throwing away an 11 year relationship for someone would be foolish and way too much work. i was comfortable where i was. so i decided to stay in my relationship. i decided i needed to stop talking to him as much as possible. 

months passed and my relationship was falling apart. i started standing up for myself. if i didnt want to do something and he wanted me to, i didnt do it. i think talking to 'the other guy' about myself and what i liked and how we liked similar things really made me realize how much i was giving up in my current relationship and how truly unhappy i was. my boyfriend would lie to me, he would go out every night come home drunk, puke all night, he was rude, he dropped out of school, he slept all day and barely worked. all he did was go out with friends. he never did chores, i was paying some of his bills. 

it got to the point where i actually told him to ""get your shit together or leave"" and he left, and didnt come back for 3 days. at this point i knew what i wanted in life, i knew what i had given up to try to get him to stay. i wanted him to change. i wanted him to realize what he was doing and i wanted him to be like he was years ago. and i just kept hanging on thinking one day he would change. 

when he returned he told me he didnt want to be in a relationship anymore. for 3 days i cried and felt hopeless. i had no idea what my future would be. i knew nothing about being single. no one would want to date someone who has been in one relationship for 11 years! after my pity party i realized this was the best thing that had ever happened to me. i was finally free to be me and to stop living HIS life. i could finally live my life. 

i knew it was way soon but about 2 weeks after the break up i flat out told 'other guy' that i liked him and wanted to date him. i as sick of hiding my feelings and pretending things. his response was he had a crush on me but knew i was in a relationship at the time and figured hed never have a chance to date me. 

weve been together for almost 4 months now and its everything i could possibly ask for. hes understanding, hes sweet, we enjoy a lot of the same things but also have enough different hobbies and interests that we are each still separate people. we give each other enough space but we always have a wonderful time when we spend it together. there is nothing about him that makes me think twice about being with him. 

this is such a learning experience. i have no idea how relationships generally work, but so far things must be going ok because we are both super happy. 

i am no longer depressed. ive lost about 15lbs just because ive been taking care of myself for once. i like myself again. i am confident and i am happy with my life. 

my new boyfriend is not THE reason i am happy. i was hesitant to jump into a new relationship right away because i wanted to be ok with 'me' before just transferring to someone else. and i wanted him to know that. he sure helps make life amazing, but i am the major reason i am happy. i stood up for myself, i survived a breakup (pretty much a divorce) and came out a stronger, smarter, amazing person. new guy just helps me realize that. 

any girls stuck in a LONG long term relationship and feel trapped because they dont know what to do without their boyfriend or girlfriend in their lives, really think about what you want, what makes you happy and if staying in a relationship just because you are scared to not be in one is taking your dreams and happiness away, you need to get out. its hard, but its very worth it to actually be with someone who treats you right and helps you succeed in life. 

tldr: ended loveless relationship of 11 years, started dating new guy who is awesome. dont stay in a relationship because you are too lazy or scared to be alone or start over.

So I went to the one that was the cheapest and closest. 

I obviously didn't do my research, as the school is not ABET certified, and the degree is Computer Information Science, where you have the choice of being either Information Systems concentration or Computer Science concentration. When I Google ""Computer Information Science"" not many schools come up, and most links bring you to something Information Systems related. 


I am in the Computer Science concentration, and the only real difference is that we have classes like OS, Analysis of Algorithms, and Programming Languages; meanwhile IS has business classes, but most of the same. 


This has not yet presented me with any problems, although it can be confusing filling out forms with no ""Computer Information Science"" choice. However, many people on this subreddit are very quick to shout that a CIS or MIS degree is worthless. 

I have an internship set up for this summer at a top Fortune 50 company, in the same position, developing, with CS majors (some from schools like MIT), and not with Information Systems students.

I am no longer your crutch,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ars31/i_am_so_done_with_you_i_am_no_longer_your_crutch/,"We have been friends since kindergarden. And since then we have always been friends. Not a day since kindergarden has gone by without the both of us going to bed and thinking of each other as friends. That changes tonight. 

This has been building up for such a *fucking* long time. All through out high school you were contemptful towards everyone. I didn't mind, I was the same back then, with all my anxiety and depression weighing on my shoulders. 

I knew you felt bad because of your dad dying and that the girl you loved walked out on you. But you blamed it all on the world, you took no guilt for yourself at all. You could've ripped the cigarettes out of his mouth, you could've asked him to stop drinking. But you were never sincere enough. 

He died eight years ago. I know it must still hurt, and I can't even imagine, but it's how you carry the weight that matters. I tried to carry as much of it as I've could, but I can't do it anymore. I've cried so many tears with you, I've listened to so much, I've said so much.  

You are so rude to your mom, who just tries to get by. The jobs she has taken to provide for you doesn't make you grateful. It just makes you scornful and ashamed. 

Every time you got drunk you threw shit around, broke things, hurt people's feelings. You threw your brand new phone for a thousand dollars into the wall just because a girl wouldn't talk to you. Ever think about why? Maybe because you got so drunk you couldn't even talk, yelled into her ears and acted hostile toward your own *fucking* friends. 

It's not even friends you hardly know that you try to push around. IT'S JOHN, YOU'VE KNOWN JOHN FOR FIVE YEARS. 
You are going abroad with him in just a few months, he's one of the few people left now who can even stand the real you.  

When we both met Jenna and I called dibs, you never let that one go, did you? I felt that every time I've tried to get back together with her you've been scornful and tried to shoot it down every time. She was so great for me, and all you ever did was to pour your negativity and hate all over our relationship. I can't remember you saying one positive note on the subject at all. Not even a single, shallow ""Way to hit that"". 

And after all this time, after all I've done for you, this very night, you called me ungrateful. You said that I didn't stick up for you, that I'm never there for you. I think I've never been so hurt, disappointed and above all **angry** before in my entire life. 

I told you at three separate occassions to go see a shrink. Each time you promised me you would. I got you all sorts of numbers to call, I set everything up for you. You didn't show. 

I picked up the phone every night you drunkenly called me late on *week-days*. I GOT WORK. Just because its an internship that involves music and I enjoy it doesn't mean its not ""a real job"" you fucktwat. Just because you're miserable and getting used at your workplace you have to drag me down with you?

You gave me a pair of headphones you got for free and then you expect me to buy you an expensive gift in return? You got them for *fucking* free man. You haven't given me a single dime in gas money, ever. You also make way more than I do, and have so much more money in the bank. It's easy for you to throw around twenty bucks as a gift, the problem is that those twenty bucks doesn't stay a gift when you want more than you spent back. 

The money doesn't matter at all to me, but you're so obsessed with it. You can't see that a gift only has value if it means something to you as well, not just a mind game to make me ""owe"" you something. You act like such a big-shot when you pay for something as well, to impress strangers, then outside you turn around as demand the gift to be repaid in both equal amount of cash and a bunch of gratitude.

That night when you called me and said you wish you never lived, I stayed up all night and felt bad for you while you were blazing with your douchebag friends. 

I drove you around since I know you have a hard time getting your license. Tonight I didn't wanna go pick you up in the middle of the freaking night since I have to get up at 6 am, and tonight you called me out on never being there for you. 

""WHEN HAVE YOU EVER BEEN THERE FOR ME!?"" I yelled at you on the phone after that self-righteous text you sent me. When you were quiet for three seconds, I realized that you haven't been there for me ever. I can't remember the last sincere thing you ever even said to me. You don't care about my paintings, my music, my dreams. When I try to share them you just shoot me down since you can't handle other peoples' success that you perceive as socially superior to your own. 

I've tried so hard to help you, I've always put you before me. Always. I feel so bad, because I know you need someone like me. I can't be him anymore. I'm sorry.

All you've ever cared about is you. Soon you're not gonna have anyone else to care about anyway. "

1arr89,6,2013-03-21,Here's a small set of rules for people with computer problems/projects seeking resolution to their dilemmas.,NOTaMango,geek,https://www.reddit.com/r/geek/comments/1arr89/heres_a_small_set_of_rules_for_people_with/,"Here's a small set of rules for people with computer problems/projects seeking resolution to their dilemmas.


1.) Please do not get upset with the person helping you, they are trying to help you, not remove your spleen when you aren't looking.


2.) You aren't a computer person; that's why you are seeking help. What you are asking may not make sense to someone who is a computer person as you do not speak the language. I've heard questions that are equivalent to a translation from  japanese-to-english then to japanese and back to english again, sort of along the lines of ""would you rape my mother's goat?"" You can imagine your reaction to this question if someone were to walk up to you straight faced and ask such a thing. Yeah that face you just made, that's the face you get when you ask questions about why your mouse won't connect to your printer. If said helper is not quite understanding you please refer to rule #1 and restate your question using different words.


3.) Computer people are not only technical, they are incredibly creative, most people come up to computer-heads with abstract ideas of what they want without any steps in between, sort of like walking up to a chef and asking can you build me a functioning airplane? Then walking off with no blueprints, or clues as to if you want a jet, a prop plane, a private jet, or a commercial airliner, without this clarification we are left to interpret what we think you really want and then execute steps that get to the end goal of what you asked. My point here is what you have in your head and vaguely asked for, may not be exactly what you get. In such a case as the end goal isn't precise, please refer to rule #1 and attempt to explain in different words and descriptions of what you want, and what is wrong with the creative process that was just invented for you, again rule #1 is really important here. 


4.) Time… This crap takes time to build, that video game you play and love where you blow the heads off people, that had HUNDREDS if not THOUSANDS of programmers working for years on it. This process I invented for you won't be built in a day, and maybe not a week or even a month. I am one person, while I do have access to resources for help, I am not Microsoft or Apple, I do not have teams of people working on your project. Relax, we can go to lunch and talk about it, and it will get done, but not on your schedule, it's on mine, it may be your idea, but it's my project, my time, and my work.


5.) I know that you want to learn how to use a computer, and more importantly how to fix your own problems. So watching over my shoulder while I pound at a keyboard like an internet cowboy is probably entertaining to you. While generally I do not mind this, it is inherently distracting as you will undoubtedly ask me hundreds of awkwardly misworded questions that will force my brain into a spiral of definitions that I must now have to explain to you, just so we can begin to even address your question. This vocabulary lesson will ultimately derail my attempt to help you, destroying any timeline I have set forth for you, or any client other than you.


6.) While I do not mind helping immediate friends and family with computer problems, friends of friends who I can't even pronounce their names who got my phone number off a bathroom wall… I am not a computer genius whose sole purpose in life is to fix your 15 year old printer that the company hasn't released a toner/ink cartridge for in the last 8. Fixing printers is generally an intern's job. It's like asking Picasso to use crayons in a 2 year old's coloring book, wait, that's how he paints… It's like asking Dali, Van Gogh, or Rembrandt to color in a 2 year old's coloring book and take no artistic license with the picture. It's demeaning...


7.) I will not fix your printer.


8.) I will not fix your printer.


9.) I can probably replace your job with a 12 line shell script. Don't ask me to fix your printer.


10.) Wait I just learned a shortcut, I can now replace you with an 8 line shell script.

I'm a CS student in my last year, and already had a 3 year apprenticeship in programming. I did an internship at a small software company in VB.net and another one at a chip manufacturer in China (ERP System). 
In China I did some management work and I thought it was really fun and interesting, but my mentor there adviced me to study computer engineering for my last year (embedded softare, microcontrollers, assembler etc.) to get some knowledge on the engineering side, then do my masters in some economic related major to understand the ""economic side"". He said I would then be well prepared for a consulting or later a management job. 

But since this is only one source, I wanted to know what other people think of this theory. I already specialized in computer engineering and it appears a little ""raw"" to me, none of the nice IDEs I'm used to like visual studio, no code-completion etc. it feels a little bit cold to me. I'm a bit of a motivational/charismatic person according to my mentor and he thought management would fit me very well.

I have 2 options for my summer/fall Co-op this year. For those of you who aren't familiar with it, a co-op is where you intern at a company for half the year, then attend school for the other half until you finish with a degree

The first company is pretty local to my school, ~30 min commute using public transit. The job itself is mostly hardware oriented, designing and testing embedded systems stuff. Writing code in C, and using some linux distros. 

The second company is in California (I go to school on the east coast). It's mainly concerned with writing software for a project they're working on. They mainly use Python (I've never written python, but I'm willing to learn) and some C++. 

They pay essentially the same, and rent in each city is about the same. The only additional cost is travel, which the company would help with.

I've always been more of a software person (hence the CE major, not EE), and Python is a language that I definitely should learn at some point which makes me lean towards the second position. This is basically my ""dream"" job.

Here's the kicker. I received a formal offer from the first company, and have until Monday to respond. The second company sent offers to two people, one of which rejected it, and I'm next in line to be awarded an offer. I should hopefully hear from them sometime Monday, but no guarantees.

If they don't respond during the day Monday, do I risk losing the first job to get the better one?

TL;DR Got offered one hardware job, and should receive an offer from my ""dream"" job the same day I have to respond to my first offer. Do I risk losing a good offer to get a great one?

Edit: Just got the offer from the second company. Higher pay (25 vs. 18), round trip airfare, and a housing stipend.

I've been working for past 2 months as an intern in as small software company. My HR is a 30 year old woman. She's sexually harassing me.

It first started as simple flirting. She would stop me in office after hours and ask me about my experience in the workplace, how I am feeling. All the while playing with her hair, fixing her lipstick and such. She would share her personal life with me and ask about mine. 

At first I thought this is her job as an HR to make my life comfortable. For soon it escalated beyond that. Just a couple weeks ago when we were the only two people in office she called me in her office. When I reached there I say that she was fixing her underclothes with door open. I quickly ran away from there, called her from outside and told her that I am not well. Her antics just don't stop.

Don't get me wrong, I am a hot blooded male too but I know the distinction between wrong and right. 

Please suggest something. I can't just go to police as it will ruin my internship and my career. I know in such situation, we are supposed to go to HR, but she's the HR.

What to do?

EDIT:: 

[UPDATE]
Thanks you all for replying. I see that many of you think that I am trolling but I am not.
Also thank you everyone who instead of making fun of my confusing situation, gave sincere advice.

As ranjan sir and many of you suggested I am now sharing this with my fellow interns and my team lead. 
I've also started collecting evidence.

As ek_ladki has guessed, she's a bit weird on mental side.. so I am scared of confronting her.

My team-lead seems to think I am overreacting (which I am not). He says this kind of flirting is normal but he will still look into it else will try to transfer me to another office which works for me.

Previous to entering college I had done little to no programming, partly because I had no idea what I wanted to major in until senior year, and partly because my high school did not offer any Computer Science/Programming related courses. So far I have really enjoyed programming (my school starts students off in Java, so that is what I have exclusively used so far), I have taken ""Introduction to Programming"" which was as the title describes, I am currently nearly finished with ""Data Structures"" and CS specific ""Logic, Sets, and Functions"". I estimate my GPA will be ~3.7 after this semester is over with, which I feel is decent because my school has a pretty rigorous CS department (In the top 15 in the US supposedly). As of right now I am considered an ""entry level"" CS student, which restricts me on the classes I can take, but after the completion of this semester I will be promoted. This will allow me to take more specific Programming ""electives"" in the area that I am interested in. I'm currently in the second round of the interviewing process for an SE technical internship at eBay, which might help me answer some of my question below.


**Question:** How should I go about finding what areas I am interested in? As of right now, nearly all avenues sound interesting to me (SE, data mining, data analysis, OS, crypto..etc). I have done some research on a few topics but I feel that I could wind up disliking it once I get into the thick of it. 

What specific avenues of specialization are ""hot"" right now? While I do want to do something I truly enjoy, I also want to be able to comfortably support myself and my future family, which would require getting a good job. 
--Or the opposite of the question above, What areas are not so ""hot"" right now?



Of all the specializations I feel that I am most interested in **Security/Crypto.** Is there/will there continue to be a large demand for this type of work, and is it plausible to graduate with a BS and receive a job doing such work?
Although I am interested in Crypto, I do understand that it is heavily math and logic based, which I feel I am not that ""great"" in. (The only class I'm not going to make an A in will be my Logic and 2nd sequence of Calculus). 



Any and all advice is welcome. Thanks for taking the time to read my (first ever) post!"

I’m about to graduate in May, and this was a welcome opportunity, as I haven’t had much exposure to real-world CS applications. There is a lot to do, and I’m comfortable with my new coworkers, and all that jazz. But, the IT department basically consists of ME + a hard drive of images, illustrator files, and other miscellany given to them by the web design firm, that just redid their website. So, here are my concerns, of which everyone can feel free to tell me to run like hell, or dig in.

-	Their entire security apparatus consists of a password on their (1) wireless router.
-	Short of them buying me a monitor, I’m using my own laptop, with my own copy of Adobe CS6. They are open to supplying me my own hardware and software, but that process has been slow.
-	I was tasked with making a marketing site, and when I couldn’t get it done within a couple hours, my boss panicked and started making his own on GoDaddy, which I had to completely re-do, and because GoDaddy’s web designer is a giant clusterfuck.
-	They want to make some sort of database to handle customer calls, but again, there is neither a support team nor guidance on what I would use to craft such a database.
-	I am communicating how difficult it is to make a site from scratch, within the span of a couple hours, but they need things done so fast it collapses back to shitting out a domain on GoDaddy’s WYSIWYG.
-	Its all a big mess, but I look at it as a challenge, sort of the wild west at a company that has a need for someone with a passion for technology. 
-	It’s a growing company , selling a great product, with a possible salary position at the end of my 3 month paid internship period, which is why I have a slightly positive outlook on the whole experience.

I am really nervous about an internship that I almost have nailed down, so I'm hoping you all can calm my nerves/tell me what to expect.

I just applied for an internship and I practically have the position. I can tell by how my (hopefully) soon-to-be-supervisors have spoken with me over the phone that they like me quite a bit and are excited to have me work for them. I am at the point in the application process where they are about to perform a background check. I have a spotless record for basically everything, the worst thing ever happening to me legally being a speeding ticket. The only dark mark that I have is a small possession charge from last year on my school disciplinary record. I had to deal with student conduct and was put on disciplinary probation (would get in worse trouble if I misbehaved again and had to pass 2 drug tests, which I did), but it wasn't anything that went on a criminal record, just with my university.

Basically, I'm terrified that this might show up on my background check and the company will revoke my job offer. If any of you have been in a similar situation, can you tell me what to expect? Will they just outright say I don't have the job anymore? Will they let me explain the situation? I haven't waived my FERPA rights, so not even my parents know about the situation (I don't know if that will come into play with this) I tend to get overly nervous/paranoid about things of this nature, so I am hoping that I'm making a mountain out of a molehill here. If anyone could please lend me some insight I would really appreciate it.

**TL;DR Crystal clean record except for a small possession charge on my COLLEGE record, not criminal. Will it show up on an employment background check, and if so what should I expect the company to do?**"

First of all I had been feeling very moody, not nessisarily tired, but I felt like I could sleep all day, and I was getting cramps. On top of that I was superrrr constipated. 

I assumed the cramps were my period about to start as well as the constipation, which is strange since I am very irregular to begin with, I seem to not get my period often. 

I woke up yesterday and I just felt like I had to take a pregnancy test, which is normally what I do when I get cramps and don't get my period, but it always ends up negative. So I took a test yesterday morning and low and behold, positive. 

I absolutely freaked out, woke up my significant other screaming saying ""we have to go to Walmart NOW"" we picked up some tests and three more positive tests later, pregnant. 

I won't lie, I am positively terrified and excited all at the same time. I'm only 23, and I JUST got accepted into a paid internship program that lasts two months that will give me my CNA certification. It starts with two weeks of class then we are on the floor. 

My concerns are currently my cramping and pulling sensations I am getting. It can be on the left or right, sometimes right where my uterus is and I'm scared. No bleeding at all though. They feel like regular period cramps. 

I don't want to lose this baby, I was considering abortion simply because I'm working 40 hours a week and will be going to class another 40 ontop of that for two months. But I already feel this intense bond with what is growing inside me. I know the first trimester is an important development milestone. I really just don't know what to do. I'm scared and could use some advice about my cramps and what they could mean. 

I already made an appointment for April 3rd for an ultrasound and pap to make sure it's all good. Until then I'm just a sitting duck. Although I am going to call around come monday and see if I can find anything earlier.

They have had a lot of interns in the past and will have lots more in the future, so sometimes I feel very insignificant, and I wasn't expecting any sort of recognition or appreciation when I took the job....

Anyway, yesterday I had a lot to do for several different engineers who all wanted me to finish by the end of the day. I worked really hard to get everything right and double checked all of my work because making a mistake can be a big problem; I was stressing out internally but stayed very positive and professional externally.

The end of the day rolled around but I still wasn't done with one task for one of the lead engineers. I decided to just stay late because I hate leaving things unfinished, even though he didn't really need it until Monday. I finished it up and was getting ready to head out when another engineer (one who's been very nice to me and given me a lot of responsibility, which I appreciate) walked over and asked me if I had finished that task he had asked me to do.

You know, the one thing - the ONLY thing - I didn't get to.

So I had to say no, and he wasn't angry but he was clearly overworked and a little bummed that I hadn't gotten to it, even though it was a very minor thing. He said not to worry, that I had clearly already stayed late by about half an hour, and that he would wrap it up. However, it was a five-minute task that was super easy to complete, so after he left, I finished it (in less than five minutes, actually) and walked over and gave him what he needed.

He said thanks, but that I didn't need to stay late to do it. I shrugged and said that I was already there, and that it didn't take long at all, and that I didn't mind since I liked working for him. I went back to my desk to collect my things, and as I passed his desk on my way out for the weekend, he stopped me and said...

""Thank you. You're doing a really great job.""

and then proceeded to comment on how impressed he is with my attention to detail and active participation, especially since this is my first-ever position at a real engineering company. He even said he wants to give me more responsibility, since I've proved that I'm a hard worker!

Isn't it funny how something as simple as that can still make me smile hours after it happened? But since it's my first professional job, it means so much to me that he noticed my hard work, and then to compliment me for it.

I'm so thankful to be able to truthfully say that I am someone who looks forward to going to work in the morning : )

As an aside: if you are in charge of an intern at your job and they are doing well, letting them know that will probably encourage them and get them to work even harder! Obviously don't give praise where it is not deserved, but there is nothing quite like recognition for a job well done. After all, the best compliments are the ones you earn.

I dropped out of high school to play [secular] music, which I did for several years. When I was 20, I got a call to fill in at a medium-sized megachurch. I started playing for them fairly regularly after that. I believed in God at the time but it was more what I'd now call theism. 

After a few months of experiencing how welcoming everyone was, I had an emotional experience during a Sunday service that I now recognize was just being overwhelmed by the music. At the time, I was thoroughly convinced that this was the Holy Spirit telling me that I should give up playing secular music and in order to play worship music professionally. I got ""saved"" and converted to Christianity. For two years or so, that was my life.

I decided that I should learn as much as I could about Christianity if I wanted to call myself a good Christian. I'd never read the Bible cover-to-cover, so I read the NIV and the King James. Then I thought, this is silly, there are dozens of English translations. If I really want to know what Jesus taught and how I should live my life, I should go to the source: I wanted to learn to read the original manuscripts. I found a classics grad student who was willing to tutor me and started learning Latin and Greek. We met twice a week for two years. I found out pretty quickly that you can't read the original manuscripts because we don't have them, just fragments of copies of copies of copies. I started reading books by people like Bart Ehrman, Karen Armstrong, Robert Price, Richard Carrier, and David Fitzgerald. I started learning more about epistemology and ancient history and it was not long before I went from Bible-believing Christian to closeted atheist.

I remained in the closet for a year. After 5 years as a worship musician, I didn't want to lose my job nor all my friends. But I knew I couldn't continue living a lie, and so eventually I had to come out. When I did, I was asked to resign from playing worship music. I lost many of my friends. Not knowing what else to do with myself, I enrolled in college, where I met Brother Jed.

Brother Jed and I have had some really great spats. We are friends; I have had dinner at his house several times in addition to doing two formal, moderated debates and dozens upon dozens of informal hecklings when he would do his street-preaching schtick. It was because of Brother Jed that I first became aware of the Secular Student Alliance/Center for Inquiry affiliate at my school, MU SASHA (Univ. of Missouri Skeptics, Atheists, Secular Humanists, &amp; Agnostics). I quickly joined and ran for a position of public relations officer. The next year I ran for VP and started a blog for SASHA.

This is where /r/atheism comes in.
-
The SASHA blog could have easily faded into obscurity like so many millions of blogs on the internet. It is because of /r/atheism that the SASHA blog started to get a really positive reputation in the atheist community. Since April of 2011 I've written about 170 articles for the SASHA blog, and we've also had guest posts from David Fitzgerald, Damon Fowler, and others. Several of our articles have made the front page here. When I attended my first SSA leadership conference in summer 2011, I was amazed at how many student leaders were well aware of my group because they regularly read our blog. That is also where I saw David Silverman speak for the first time. That summer I also attended the CFI leadership conference, where (among others) I saw Amanda Knief speak for the first time.

Because of you, r/atheism--the world's largest atheism forum--via the traffic you brought to the SASHA blog, I started getting invitations to do public speaking. I spoke at some other universities and appeared on a panel at Reasonfest 2, where I met James Croft and Greg Epstein from the Humanist Community at Harvard. James was impressed enough with my panel appearance that he invited me to start blogging for Harvard's site. I attended the Reason Rally and the American Atheists convention last year a few months later.

Blogging for the Humanist Community at Harvard led to a summer internship at the Secular Student Alliance under the wonderful Lyz Liddell and working alongside JT Eberhard, after which I took some time off school to focus on writing and public speaking. This led to an invitation to apply for the Public Relations Director position at American Atheists' national headquarters in New Jersey, where I am today.

There's a saying: ""Don't meet your heroes."" I presume this is because if they turn out to be not what you expected, you'll be disappointed, and it's better to keep the fantasy alive. Frankly, this is bullshit. The first time I met Amanda Knief, I told her I wanted to work with her someday. Dave Silverman has been a hero of mine since I first became aware of American Atheists in 2010. I still sometimes have trouble grasping the fact that my office is two doors down from his and three down from Amanda's; it just feels surreal. This is my dream job, and it blows my mind that I get to do what I love every single day. My coworkers are some of the most passionate people I know. I say this with entirely pure intentions (and I hope Dave isn't reading this!), but Dave Silverman is one of the smartest people I have ever met. Working for him is not only a dream come true but a real intellectual challenge. I don't know if I'm explaining this very well, but there's a reason he's famous: He's brilliant, he's decisive, and he has very high standards. He gets things *done* and he doesn't take crap from anyone. My point is that I absolutely love my job; I simply could not be happier with what I do and who I do it for, and I intend to keep doing it until I'm so old I'm physically incapable. I am so much happier now than I ever was as a worship musician with all those nagging doubts. I feel so free!

If it had not been for you, /r/atheism, I would not be where I am here in New Jersey, working at my dream job, doing work that I feel confident is really making a positive difference in the world. If it had not been for you, I would still be in Columbia, Missouri, an unemployed musician and part-time student, blogging away about atheism to the vastness of the intertoobz and trying to figure out what to do with my life.

This year is American Atheists' 50th anniversary, and I'm so proud to be part of the team during such an important time in history. I owe a great debt of gratitude to all of you. Thank you so much for existing, thank you so much for reading the blog, thank you so much for your comments and input and feedback, for your arguments that led to some great blog articles, for all you are and everything that you do, thank you.

**53,576** junkies for **1 year!**

Have you ever wondered about how computers work? Have you ever thought about getting down to the very basics of what makes a machine like that run? Have you ever just wanted to mess with metal parts until lights lit up or smoke appeared, whichever comes first? If so, welcome to the wonderful world of VXJunkies.

In my case, the story starts in 1996. While most tech-inclined people were fascinated by the rapid rise of the Internet, I was more of the type to hang with my grandpa in his workshop. Right there, in his backyard, we worked with strange tools and wondrous machines, dodging the occasional pipe or offset valve. He kept using terms I only heard from him, constantly muttering something about ""ferrocores"" not complying with ""DL hashing standards"" or cursing under his breath at ""Yalgeth"" and ""her fu-- oh, sorry... very stupid limit"". I never quite understood what he was working on, but it was fascinating. I grew up, though, and eventually stopped coming over to see him. Life, school (and growing up in general) got in the way, and I never really heard of him again until I got a package in the mail a few years ago.

Friday, February 29th, 2008. It was raining. It was cold. The UPS guy hastily made me sign the receiving slip and retreated into his truck, pointing to the lumbering package he left on my porch. Shivering, I brought it inside. It was heavy, and... *vibrating* somehow. I slowly opened it, and there it was: a machine I had seen a hundred times, so familiar and yet so distant in my memory. As it turns out, my grandpa had passed on and left this box in my name. I had just gotten my first very own VX Machine.

It was a beauty of a VX4 Mark III. I flipped a few switches that I recognized by sight, and it gently hummed back to life. The 7-LED numerical display on the right showed my current delta: 0.07. Far from perfect - my grandpa used to reach 0.40 with ease - but I couldn't do much without any documentation. Fast forward a couple of years, and this is where /r/VXJunkies comes in: there I found [everything I'd need to get started](http://www.reddit.com/r/VXJunkies/comments/ewihz/) and more. With the help of the community, I've been able to reach the 0.40 Delta mark my grandpa had set, and I'm still learning and getting better all the time. For example, simply [upgrading my ferrocores](http://www.reddit.com/r/VXJunkies/comments/ewxef/) from the stock VX4 set to the ones I built (completing grandpa's blueprints) made my dephasing interval shrink from 9.10 to 8.02! Throw some adjustments due to recent discoveries regarding Holt's Junction, and BAM: 0.45 Delta, *on a VX4!* It might not be impressive to most, but it sure was to me. The folks over at /r/VXJunkies can help anyone get going with a basic module in no time - just add passion, patience and curiosity.

And now, a few words from the mod team:

&gt;##1. I see a few of you are directors in well known VX-related companies. Why did you choose to establish a presence on Reddit?
&gt;&gt; **oneisnotprime** This is where the community is growing. Just 10 years ago a CRD-20 cost over $62k for a unit with only 9 static pinboards, and which took 80 cubic meters to produce a dual-tachyotic signal! With the rapid advancement of the periolith coil comes less of a need for palladium structures and we are now seeing an improved legal environment for ultraband-O-K12s. Someday soon I fully believe we'll be seeing VX gear at Walmart and basic VXing as part of a general education.

&gt;##2. Could you share a highlight of your VX career?
&gt;&gt; **oneisnotprime** I am mostly known in the community for my 10e-16 Yalgeth Run and my 7 year tenure with Dr. Miljavic Ernada on parallel alignments with reduced harmonics, but nothing for me can beat the time I synchronized manually (no å-subD suppression) an entire ten-bay of copper prongboards on the first try. Best day of my life.

&gt;##3. What is the highest *stable* delta you've reached pre-Holt's Junction?
&gt;&gt; **oneisnotprime** We have a YL minus 10e-13 minimum delta requirement for modding in the community.

&gt;##4. What do you think will be the state of VX Modules in 10 years? 20 years?
&gt;&gt; **Dragonai** VX is to computing as Bitcoin is to currency. Currently, mainstream methods of achieving steady-state thermoefficient deltas are nowhere near as potent as VX modules, and yet, these lesser methods are popular in physics and chemistry labs all over the country (I'd venture to say even across the globe, though Switzerland and the Iberian nations are taking great strides to standardize). I'd say within a decade or two, every modern home will be host to a VX module.

&gt;##5. What VX model would you recommend for soon-to-be-junkies reading this? Everyone has their preferences, but please try to be unbiased.
&gt;&gt; **Dragonai** The VX5 with a Rockwell chromatosilicate ferrocore, without question. Yes, this is against the grain. Most people would say I'm a heretic and slice my deimometer circuit out of disgust, but hear me out. The 5 lends itself extraordinarily well to low-resistance magnitude compression due to the copper gasket, which is perfect for the amateur enthusiast. They top out at about 4300 kTr, so no worrying about destroying any microwaves!

&gt;##6. Great, now if you could give them *one* tip (aside from ""Read the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/VXJunkies/comments/ewihz/)), what would it be?
&gt;&gt; **oneisnotprime** It can be difficult for a new VXer to distinguish between pseudo-scientific nonsense (like compacting Yalgeth's Limit in a variable wavelength diamatic structure) and true cutting edge advancement in the field (such as some of the work coming out of Australia on uniform distribution of delta cohesion, or sinusoidal particulate structures). Stick to the basics. And for crying out loud, do not leave your diode clock uncalibrated! We don't need another Reykjavik '97.

It is hard to complain about my life to others because I come from a well off family that has supported me. I feel like I can't say anything bad about my life because from the outside it looks like I have it all. I am in college that is being entirely paid for and I have a job for the summer at my Dad's company if I want it. But this semester I have had my current roommate who is one of my only friends at college ditch me for rooming next year and did not tell me till i found out through a different friend. Then I asked the only other people I hang out with and they accepted to only reject me weeks later as the person they though was moving out was going to stay. Also three different internships i was really excited about getting turned my down after they had told me on the phone that I was going to get it because of company restructuring. I know most of this is just bad luck and not my fault and even after all of it I am still better off than most. But some days just hit hard and i am left wondering  how i did i ever get so alone. I was always taught to solve my own problems. To everyone i look like i am doing great, making good grades and doing well in life, but on the inside i just want to give up. I don't want to talk to friends or family because they would get concerned but i can't live with the idea of being weak in their eyes. I know they would do what is right but don't want them to see someone to pity and help. I think at this point i would rather it looks like an accident or a single bad decision than a problem that has been brewing, i can't leave them with that guilt.

1auald,0,2013-03-22,Breaking into the neuro job world,[deleted],neuro,https://www.reddit.com/r/neuro/comments/1auald/breaking_into_the_neuro_job_world/,"After applying to grad school this year and not getting in because the GRE test center put down my birthday wrong (applications were complete, but schools couldnt access my scores), I'm ready to move on and break into the neuro working world.

I have one semester of neuro lab work and have worked at Ion Torrent for 10 months since graduating in May 2012. I have been applying everywhere, but with no luck. I had three interviews on Monday at Genentech, and some looked promising, but they are probably going to end up choosing masters or PhD students for these summer internship positions. I don't know how to compete. I thought my ten months at Ion, which only hires the top 10%, would make me a stronger candidate, but it has seemed to do nothing or even hurt my chances. 

I am a man of many talents and grew up around biotech in the Bay Area. It seems like my well-roundedness is also a hindrance. PI's and Lab heads want someone who lives, breathes, and shits neuro, and I don't think I'm up for a total takeover of my capabilities. Being a renaissance man means nothing.

So here, I'm looking for advice. I've put myself out as a person who is brilliant at many things, but focused on neuro. I tell everyone that I hope to get my PhD and hope to eventually have my own lab studying microglia in disease. How does one compete with people that are in grad school? How does one look like a good candidate for a position even though they are well-rounded?"

My ultimate goals are to get in to organizational development, management consulting, or change management and work in an education system (ie. work for a university).

I have scholarships to both places however aside from the scholarships I will have to pay for everything with loans and part time work/ summer internships. I will be about 80K in debt from Vanderbilt and 110K from Columbia after completing the masters programs. Both programs are prestigious, Columbia is an ivy league so that speaks for itself. I was admitted to the Peabody College at Vanderbilt which is ranked #1 for education. The schools are both very similar in regards to amenities, cohort size, student faculty ratio etc. I cannot find much data on job placement after graduation however for either place. 

I have been to New York a few times and every time I have left feeling overwhelmed and stressed. Can anyone from Columbia or living in morningside heights attest to this? I visited Nashville recently and loved it, everyone was friendly and it was a slower pace of life. Clearly nashville does not have the same job opportunities as NYC and so my biggest concern with choosing Vanderbilt is that I would be sacrificing an ivy league school located in a place with more internship prospects. On the flip side I don't know if Columbia will guarantee me a job where I can pay off 100K (plus 30K in undergrad loans). 

My safety choice if I chicken out on moving is San Francisco State, I was admitted to an I/O psych program here, but feel I might regret my choice if I turned down Vanderbilt and Columbia for SFSU, although the plus side is that I would have wayyy fewer loans. 

I applied to these programs instead of MBA programs because I was told they are more desirable since they are more specific. MBA's touch on every aspect of business but tend to be a little more shallow, whereas these programs focus in on people, leadership qualities, change management etc.

Any thoughtful advice, opinions or personal experience would be appreciated. If anyone has any experience at any of these schools or moved across the country and has advice, anything would be helpful. I am clearly debating between schools but also trying to decide if an expense like this is worth it. I am really excited that I have great schools to choose from but I am feel very stuck in my decision and do not want to regret my choice. This is probably the biggest decision of my life to date. "

My career interests are in water quality. I figured I would get some sort of field sampling tech job after grad school and work my way up from there, although I've been applying for a wide range of jobs including those I am barely qualified for. Despite applying constantly since last year, I've only interviewed for one position and didn't get the job (obviously). I started out looking specifically for government jobs, mainly state and local, and I just recently moved into applying for entry-level consulting jobs. I've mostly been looking for jobs in the U.S. East and Midwest.


Is there a good back-up plan if I don't have a job yet when I graduate? Should I start stocking shelves at a grocery store until I find a ""real"" job? My assistantship is my only source of income right now, so I will be totally without income upon graduating.


My advisor has proposed that I can choose to not graduate in May. That way, I can receive an $1800 summer stipend if I continue to take summer classes. Instead of receiving my degree in May, I wouldn't get it until August. I would prefer to not use this option, but I don't have any better ideas right now.


Any advice would be appreciated!


Edit: I should also mention that I did two full years of full-time internships in resource management at a national park between undergrad and grad school. I figured that would be decent experience that would help land a job (including one year of GIS experience), but no luck so far."
1atyzp,1,2013-03-22,My (M25) Fiancee's (F23) parents are getting divorced. She is withdrawing and acting irrational. Together 4yrs.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1atyzp/my_m25_fiancees_f23_parents_are_getting_divorced/,"Sorry in advance if this isn't dramatic enough for /r/relationships. I'm a long time lurker here and would appreciate your advice.

Her parents are getting divorced. We all know its going to be a long process since they share a business and multiple houses.

When she fist found out about it she was level headed and we talked for days about her feelings and how it was better for them but selfish that they were doing it the year she and her brother are getting married. She did all the talking I just validated her feelings and supported her like a good listener since i have not gone through anything like this in my own life.

Now, 4 months later and 4 months before our wedding, she is becoming withdrawn. The latest blow was when the Easter celebration she planned with our friends fell through (they all sited money or the obvious family conflict that was preventing them from going). She is saying things like 'none of them care about me' and 'I'm going to die alone'. i point out that ill be with her and i care about her and she will change it to 'we will be alone'. I've never heard her say such irrational things before. She brilliant and knows none of that is true.

She is getting a masters degree in psychology and is working with sex offenders at a prison as part of her internship (which i know isn't helping her feel good about people.) She is always very rational and open about her feelings and accepting of my comfort and emotional support. But not lately. I'm planning to tell her she may want to talk to someone professionally about the divorce, being a psych major she has often suggested that as a solution. But i don't consider her as depressed since the behavior has only gone on for about 3 weeks and only really bad this last week when the plans fell through, I'm not sure if suggesting that at this point is the best move.

Any advice for reaching her and making her feel better? I want to get her friends together and I'm trying to reach out to them to tell them she needs their support, but I'm struggling to do that effectively and to plan something when they don't seem willing or able to travel to our state (CT to RI, about 2 hour drive) for an evening. I may be her only support until we move back to CT in May.

I'm going to get her a cheesecake now (because I'm just that awesome), but i feel whenever she smiles and starts to act herself again that she is actually hiding these feeling and putting on a mask.

TL:DR; any advice for helping an SO through divorce? Any advice for gathering her friends when they don't seem willing to go the extra mile to come to us? And any advice for recognizing depression in someone who has a masters in hiding the symptoms of it?"

I've been in a long term relationship with girl, just over two years now. We don't live together, she lives with her family, I live with mine, and we can't live together due to our culture. I'm white-washed. We've had a good relationship, and had a lot of ups-and-downs. She used to be the very flirtatious type with other guys. After a while that died down, and our relationship became very vanilla. 

Our sex is generally good, from point of view, even though I do most of the work. From hers, she says it's alright. 

Other than that, she interns at a hospital. But she mentioned that once we get married she doesn't want to work. She just generally seems like the lazy type, where I busted my ass for a good 6 years, to put myself through school, and pay off debt. 

I bought her a dog last year and she fully invests her time into that dog. And we both love him to death. 

At first I was mostly satisfied, but I was much more disappointed in this relationship than she ever was. I do a lot for her, take her out to dinner, buy her clothes, buy her whatever she needs on occasion, help her with any school work when I'm not busy. I'm basically the guy that goes the extra mile to please her.

Fast forward to last December, I was in Texas (I'm from a big city in Canada) for some technical training, and decided to hit up a good restaurant for steaks on Monday night for dinner. Since I go alone, I general hit up the bar since it's easy and far less awkward. The bartender was a cute lil mexican girl (girl-next-door type), and she chatted me up the whole time I was there. I usually didn't think anything of it, because bartended..tips, yea...
Until she handed me her business card with her number on it. I was just thinking, whoa, doesn't usually happen. She said give her a call next time I'm around. This is generally what I call an ego boost for myself.

I didn't speak to her for the rest of the week, but I decided on my last night in Texas I'd hit up the same restaurant and hopefully catch her again. I did, and she was surprised to see me, mainly because she thought I had already left. I spoke with her throughout the night again, and then asked her if she wanted to grab something to eat, dessert or whatnot. She obliged and after her shift we went out. It was a good night, and we talked, and were out till about 1-2am. Called it a night and I hugged her and she went home. 

I had that butterfly in stomach feeling when you have a crush on someone:

 * She was cute/short
 * She was in school
 * She was very friendly/outgoing
 * She has a killer smile
 * Very hardworking, takes care of her brother, works and schools at the same time.

The next day I went back home. Felt really down, because I don't know if/when I'd ever see her again. 

I texted her about a month ago after I found out I was coming back to Texas for more training. And she seemed uninterested in talking, claiming that she was gonna  be on spring-break, and she was busy with exams and stuff. So I said alright no problem.

Was back in Texas for training again this passed week and figured she wouldn't be working because I was certain she was on spring-break. So I hit up that restaurant with a friend on Friday night, and didn't see her working at the bar. Figured she wasn't there at all. My buddy and I sat down, placed our orders and whatnot and the regular stuff. Then out of nowhere, I see her moving around waiting tables. I was like HOLY SH*T. I tried my best not to catch her eyes, but she saw me and came up to my table. She seemed overly excited to see me (I was as well). She came by our table 3-4 times, and we chatted. At the end of our meal, told her I was leaving, and gave her a hug. Told her to call/text me if she wanted to hangout later. She said cool.

Now I didn't really expect her to, but several hours later she texted me! And told me where she was etc, asked me if i wanted to come by. Of course the stupid me decided not to drive since I was drinking heavily that night. But she had to leave for personal reasons. She seemed insistent that I come. But it didn't work out that night anyway.

We texted back/forth a few more times that night, then next morning, to which she asked me if I had facebook. I replied yes, but I restrict my profile for Career-related issues, and because my girlfriend tends to go on my FB.

Last night we texted and were being a bit flirty, with her winking at me and such.

She told me to let her know when i'd be back so she can book a night off from work to hang out with me.

So reddit, tell me: I feel she's the one, she fits all the criteria of a woman I'd want to spend my life with. But how does she feel? Is she just being overly friendly? What do I do considering long-term relationship?

**TL;DR --&gt; Have gf of over two years, who's mostly meh. Met a girl from Texas who's amazing in everyway. I have a crush on texas-girl, don't know how texas-girl feels about me.**

I'm definitely one of those people, and the past couple of years, I've been collecting tips from various sources on how I can eventually achieve this goal. I figured I'd throw a little post together since I'm bored on Spring Break. To be clear, I'm just an undergraduate college student. I am **not a LEO of any kind.** It's just a career aspiration of mine. That said, some people who read this will probably have much more of an insight than I do. If any of these tips aren't as accurate as I think they are, feel free to correct them please.

* **Keep your record clean:** This is a given. Don't break the law. Unless they change things in the coming years, you *will* be polygraphed by the feds if you wanna work for them. Also, their background investigations are very stringent. Chances are, you'll be getting top secret clearance if you become a federal LEO. They don't just hand those out. As always, on the application process, be entirely honest. They forgive lots of stuff within reason, but one thing they do not ever forgive is lying.

* **College:** Chances are very good that you will not get hired by a federal agency unless you have, at minimum, a four-year degree. I believe it's a minimum requirement for most agencies on the federal level. In fact, it's so competitive you might want to even think about getting a graduate degree. They don't have any requirements in terms of what degree they want, but there are some that stand out to them. For example, the feds like computer-related degrees nowadays with the increase in cyber crimes. Many federal agencies like international relations for degrees/experience. The FBI tends to like accountants for some reason. If you're interested in a particular agency, then research what degrees/experience might be appealing to them.

* **Look for internships:** There are tons of agencies out there. Look for internships with them. You have to start somewhere, and internships are a great way to both get your foot in the door and gain relevant experience. I've applied for a few internships, and I finally got my first interview with a federal agency coming up. If you don't get accepted the first few times around, keep trying.

* **Don't plan on getting hired right out of school:** All federal agencies are extremely competitive. I applied for an FBI **internship** and was apparently up against ex-military and people with Ph.D's. No, I didn't get it (shocking!). Prepare to work elsewhere immediately after college, whether it's in law enforcement or not.

* **Think about the military:** Consider joining the military, especially as an officer. Even better, if you get into a relevant career like military intelligence, they'll like that a lot. It's just something to consider. 

* **Learn a language:** This will be useful for any career, especially within law enforcement. According to the guys with whom I've talked, it doesn't really matter what language you learn (though if you're fluent in Arabic, that'd be nice). Just become fluent in *some*thing on top of English. It'll help you get hired quite a bit.

* **Do your research:** Look for career fairs, try to find emails, and contact agencies directly. Of course, use your discretion with this; don't be an annoying pest and bother people all the time, but think about it. Most of these guys worked really hard to get where they are, which means they probably take pride in their work. That also means that they often enjoy mentoring young people. I've talked to a handful of federal agents; a few have had me call them and were excited to see my initiative. An FBI agent with whom I've communicated quite a bit via email was very helpful and provided very detailed responses; I could tell he cared. Think about all the LEO's on this subreddit. They all enjoy talking to us as long as we're reasonable with our questions.

* **Do your research, part 2:** Yes, people will often not mind chatting with you about the job, but ask intelligent questions that aren't necessarily easy to find on the agency's website. This means you have to also do your own research. Learn about each agency and what their mission is. Most agencies have a website with info on how to get hired (minimum requirements, the process, etc.). Make sure you look at that stuff before asking people questions. You want to be an investigator for the U.S. government? Start by investigating the career you want.

* **Federal LEO's are not ""above"" local LEO's:** The reason I personally want to go federal is not because I think it's better than local; it's simply because I think I'd enjoy that kind of work more. I like the opportunities offered on the federal level (i.e. travel), and I like the idea of investigations more than patrol-type work. That said, what local LEO's do is just as important and just as difficult. If you ever get a job as a federal LEO, just remember that you're not any better than local LEO's. Chances are, they'll be making your job much easier, and hopefully, you'll be doing the same for them.

Here are some federal agencies:

**Misc:** [NASA OIG](http://oig.nasa.gov/rec_current.html); [State Department Bureau of Diplomatic Security](http://www.state.gov/m/ds/career/); [FBI](https://www.fbijobs.gov/index.asp); [Secret Service](http://www.secretservice.gov/opportunities.shtml); [DEA](http://www.justice.gov/dea/careers/occupations.shtml); [ATF](http://www.atf.gov/careers/); [DHS HSI](http://www.ice.gov/about/offices/homeland-security-investigations/)

There are tons I didn't mention. For example, NASA is definitely not the only agency with an Office of the Inspector General. I mean, even the CIA has federal investigators. 

**Military Agencies with Civilian Agents:** [Army CID](http://www.cid.army.mil/join_CID.html); [Air Force OSI](http://www.osi.andrews.af.mil/questions/civilians/index.asp); [NCIS (Yes, it's real)](http://www.ncis.navy.mil/Careers/Pages/default.aspx); [CGIS](http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg2/cgis/)

Here's a list with a lot more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_law_enforcement_in_the_United_States


Mods, not sure if this is worthy, but feel free to put this in the side-bar. I know a lot of stuff about getting into federal law enforcement is often asked here. If anyone else has tips, feel free to comment with them, and I'll add it here (I'll be sure to give you credit).

Lastly, if you found any of these tips helpful, please make you sure apply after I get a job. :-)

1axnd9,21,2013-03-24,Dr. B,[deleted],LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1axnd9/dr_b/,"This took place about 5 years ago in the fall of 2008, my senior year at the university.  Background: I am a gay 27 year old female.  At the time these events occurred I was still sexually confused.  I knew I liked girls, but I hadn’t completely eliminated guys yet.  I had switched my major multiple times and had finally settled on criminology.  

It was fall of ’08 and I had 4 crim courses and 1 italian course.  For one of my crim courses I had an instructor who went by Dr. B.  Dr. B seemed like your typical white woman at first.  She was quite tall, slender and very pale with dark, wavy hair in a cropped cut and big blue eyes.  She looked like she had recently lost a lot of weight and was somewhat on the emaciated side.  She had delicate features and she walked slowly in a deliberate manner.  I did not pay much attention to her during lecture as there was this girl I had a crush on the previous semester sitting in the front row of the class.  I sat with my friend Gabby in the 2nd row, directly in front of Dr. B’s desk.

One day Dr. B put us in groups for a small group discussion.  Each group had to pick an answer to whatever question it was.  Dr. B was going from group to group and when she got to our group she stood across from me for a while, starring and smiling at me.  She looked at me with her eyes sparkling and twinkling like she was a pirate who had just uncovered a treasure chest full of gold.  This went on for about 5 seconds when I blanked out on our answer because I felt embarrassed and I looked away to this other girl in my group, who then answered the question.  I didn’t know why Dr. B only looked at me for the answer but I assumed she just decided to pick someone at random in our group to answer.

Anyway I forgot about that group question fail and during the next few lectures I just sat next to my friend, trying to pay attention.  During the beginning of the semester Dr. B never looked in my direction, she just randomly looked around and glanced quickly at the sea of faces that were my classmates, never really focusing on one face.  

However not soon after our small group discussion I started to notice Dr. B looking in my direction more often.  I didn’t really think it was odd, as some professors would sometimes focus on one person’s face as they spoke, as if they were speaking to a specific person and then move on to the next random student.  I had a few professors do this, and the professor I had after Dr. B did this a lot to me because I was one of the only people who actually tried to pay attention in class.  

But with Dr. B her glances started to feel different.  She started to focus on me all the time while she was lecturing, with that same twinkle in her eye when we did the group discussions.  It didn’t bother me at first but then during her lectures her stares became more intense, to the point I had to look away or look down when I saw her starting to roam her eyes in my direction again.  I started to feel uncomfortable and a bit unnerved during her lectures.  It didn’t seem to me as if anyone else had noticed because I looked around and no one was paying much attention anyways, and I always had tried to make an effort to focus on the lecture.  

Her class focused on deviant behavior and one time she was discussing bi-sexuality and she joked about having a girlfriend.  I tried to avoid eye contact during this part of her lecture so I bent down in my desk and pulled out some gum, offering some to my friend.  Right as I got back up I had accidently locked eye contact with Dr. B after her strange joke and she was starring me down earnestly, smiling at me.  I wanted to nope the fuck right out of there.  

You would think that me being sexually confused and this professor eye-fucking me during class would have been exciting but in reality I was terrified.  I didn’t want to be there and I felt trapped.  I’ve gotten creepy stares before but I was always able to escape the situation and in her class I just couldn’t up and leave.  I contemplated taking an F by being a no show but I had already been on academic probation so if I failed another class my GPA would be in the danger zone again.  I tried to endure the rest of the semester as much as I could.

During class sometimes Dr. B would mention things that seemed out of place.  She bragged about attending 4 different popular universities.  She joked once that she was a slut and another time that she was a pothead.  Another weird comment she threw out once when I was biting my nails, and she said that nail biting was a bad habit, something along those lines.  Sometimes she would lash out on the class as a whole, treating us like 6th graders.  She made us stand up once because we weren’t paying attention and until everyone shut up then we were allowed to sit back down again.  Another time she reprimanded us for not coming to her office for help on a paper.  The thing that stuck out to me the most was she had done research on sex offenders and at one point she tracked sex offenders’ activities online.  This is important later in the story.

The next several classes after this class she seemed to avoid looking at me for long periods of time.  I was somewhat confused yet relieved I wasn’t getting much attention anymore.  Maybe she had finally understood that I had felt uncomfortable and decided to lay off the creeping.  Unfortunately this didn't last for long.  

During one class we had to watch an instructional video and the lights were off.  I had my eyes focused on the projector screen but I could see in the corner of my eye that Dr. B had her gaze on me.  I felt creeped out and just ignored her staring but the whole time I could feel it and my stomach would turn.  I began to have anxiety problems towards the middle of the semester.  I remember one day coming in class and I sat down, my hands started to shake when Dr. B sat at her desk.  I couldn’t pay attention anymore and I would avoid eye contact with her at all costs.  

By the end of the semester I would just be doodling in my notebook, drawing circles repeatedly and just wishing class would be over.  A couple times I turned instinctively to glance at the clock, she would catch me and bitch that class wasn’t over yet.  If I did look up I would just stare directly at the projector at the powerpoint slides, acting concentrated on taking notes.  

One time I was staring at the powerpoint projecting onto the board and I felt Dr. B’s eyes on me, I tried to ignore it but she wouldn’t stop.  So I looked away from the projector really quick to glance at her and she was giving me a really mean glare, making my blood run cold.  I didn’t understand why no one noticed this but me.  Was I imagining all this?  I skipped the next class after that because I didn’t want to deal.

The next class after that was our last, I remember.  I don’t recall what our class was about but I remember her mega stare down which I completely ignored.  I could smell the desperation off her as this was her last lecture of the course.  Next week was finals and I had to turn in a paper during her class.  I looked completely ragged as I had done two all-nighters in a row and had not gotten much sleep in between writing papers for my other courses as well.  She was late to pick up the papers and we were all waiting to turn them in.  I was getting rather desperate because we couldn’t just leave the papers on her desk since she required us to be “signed off” after turning in the papers.  

When she did show up she would call us up row by row, I finally gave her my paper and I although I didn’t want to look at her I noticed that she was avoiding my face and she looked somewhat shaken up for some reason.  As I turned around to nope the fuck out and started to quickly walk away she calls out in a high-pitched voice, “Have a safe winter break!”  I hightailed it out of there, not once looking back and never felt so relieved to finish a class.

After I finished her class and I went on home to finally catch some sleep.  Towards the end of the night I checked my school email for some compelling reason.  I saw an email from Dr. B wishing us a generic happy holiday.  I think my anger and lack of sleep had gotten the best of me and I emailed her back calling her a creep.  On the computer I felt safe being a dick.  The next day she replied to me saying, “I’m sorry what???” and I got nervous.  I could have gotten in deep shit for talking back at a professor so I replied and lied saying I meant it towards a friend!  

Then a few days later I swear to God, Dr. B sent me an email only to me, saying a quick hello and to tell me she made a mistake inputting my grade into the computer system.  She had put on Blackboard that I earned a B, but on the university website it showed that I received an A.  At this point I didn’t trust anything she said.  If it were a mistake then okay whatever... but I did not understand her intentions if it wasn’t.

I was working in a major retail store at the time during this Christmas season and I was just hired as holiday recovery help.  Basically I only had to fold clothes on the display tables and clean out the fitting rooms after they were trashed.  So there I was folding clothes on one of the display tables near the elevators.  One of the managers that worked in the department came up to me and asked me to go towards the fitting rooms instead because customers had trashed them.  I said I would be there shortly and I quickly finished up at the table I was working on.  

Well as I was slightly bent over the table folding I felt a pair of eyes starring at me from my left side, towards the Traditional Women’s Clothes section.  I look over, and there was Dr. B hiding behind a rack of cashmere sweaters.  It couldn’t have been more than 3 seconds when I had looked over and we locked eyes.  The thing that terrified me the most was when I looked right at her she didn’t even look away, but she was completely frozen, with this intense stare on her face.  I quickly looked away and pretended I didn’t see anything.  Instead of confronting her and asking what she was doing I briskly walked away to the fitting rooms and for the rest of the day I denied what had actually happened, but in the back of my mind I had thoughts racing over what had occurred.  

I had actually made a Facebook account a couple days before Christmas because I remember my first picture post were photos from Christmas Eve.  I had my account public and had posted where I currently worked at.  It really didn’t occur to me at the time that Dr. B would look me up on FB and go to my place of work.  I had barely made a FB account a few days ago!  Needless to say I changed my profile quickly from public to friends only.  Her finding me so fast on FB made me think of when she had mentioned tracking sex offenders online and it made me wonder if she had used some type of software to track my online activity.  

Just thinking about it gives me the creeps.  Also after I saw her at my work and I checked my grade again, my grade had finally been fixed to a B.  After this went down at my place of work I never saw her there again, but I recall being afraid while walking outside at night into my work parking lot.  Sometimes I would feel like I was being watched and I would quickly make my way into my car and lock all doors a.s.a.p.  At school the next semester I would also look around in the parking lot while getting into and out of my car, having that being watched feeling from time to time.  

I did tell someone about what had went down during my fall semester with Dr. B.  I talked to my friend Gabby that was in the same class with me about it.  We started emailing each other after the fall semester had ended and I had confided in her that Dr. B was being creepy.  Gabby said that was strange because when she went into Dr. B’s office one day to ask for help on her paper, Dr. B had offered Gabby a job to work with her and her husband!  I thought wow that woman had some fucking nerve in class.  It made me think how she just had this power trip, starring down girls to make them feel uncomfortable and getting off on it.  That made me so angry to find out.  Gabby did confirm to me that Dr. B was kind of acting weird and sometimes would give her mean looks which she didn’t understand since Dr. B had offered her a job after she graduated school.

Anyway one day Gabby and I were sitting at the university’s cafe when she confided in me that something weird happened.  She had to ask professors for references over an internship she was pursuing and thinking Dr. B would for sure give her a reference, she contacted her via the school email.  She then said Dr. B refused to give her a reference, saying that she didn’t know Gabby that well.  This was after Dr. B had offered Gabby a job!  For some reason I felt like it was partly my fault and I apologized to my friend.  Gabby shortly after this had her a flat tire and her boyfriend said it looked like someone had slashed it.  I automatically thought of Dr. B but figured there was no proof and really no good reason.

Luckily I did not see or run into Dr. B at all during the spring semester.  However towards the end of April before finals week, I remember lying in bed, writhing in pain and crying because I had menstrual cramps.  They were so painful that I would just lie there for at least an hour until the pain subsided.  It was a little before midnight and I was lying face down into a pillow with a blanket pulled over me while I cried into my pillow.  I had my window slightly open because the weather was getting warmer and I liked the cool breeze blowing into my room.  Well I’m just lying still and almost out of pain, silently crying when I hear something move outside.  I kept completely still, holding in my breath to see if I could hear it again.  

Our house had mulch that ran around the perimeter of the house and it was underneath my window so it sounded like someone was shifting from foot to foot in the mulch.  It seemed like deliberate movements, and not reckless thrashing like if it were an animal.  I realized someone was standing at my window, watching me for who knows how long.  I froze in my bed and kept still for a minute until I couldn’t take it anymore and I got up, screaming and running to find my mom.  After I told her and I came back I looked out my window but no one was there.

A few months after that, when spring semester was over and I had graduated from the university, I was sleeping in my bed and around 3 am in the morning I woke to a noise outside.  I was disoriented and half-asleep when I heard something like someone was sawing off the screen of my window.  I remember getting out of my bed and turning on the lights.  After that it stopped and again I ran to find my parents.  They thought I was dreaming and had a bad dream but I knew otherwise because I was sleeping peacefully when this sound abruptly woke me up out of my deep slumber.  

The next day I wanted to confirm that I wasn’t dreaming and I observed that my window screen had been pushed in somewhat but not enough to be removed.  My dad had recently replaced the windows after the incident with [my creepy neighbor](http://redd.it/1aifwn).  I thank my dad for that because I really don’t know if it was Dr. B or my creepy neighbor at my window again.  This time however it was clear someone was trying to get inside my room while I was asleep.  Fucking creepy as hell.  I still don’t know who did but I am leaning either to Dr. B or my neighbor.  

I wish I could say it stopped there but from time to time I would see someone who looks like Dr. B from behind and I would freak out.  Shortly after someone tried to break into my window, I was at Target looking at the lipsticks when I would feel someone glance my way before walking past.  To me this was nothing out of the ordinary but in this moment I had a weird feeling in my gut and after this woman had walked past I looked over and from behind it would look like Dr. B.  I remember my heart stopped but I would try to reason that it wasn’t.  

About 5 minutes later I tried searching for this woman to get a good look at her face but I didn’t want her to see that I was obviously looking her over, in case it wasn’t and I didn’t want to be creepy.  I spotted her in one of the aisles and I approached slowly with my cart, and the closer I got to make out her face the more I came to recognize that it was almost positively Dr. B.  I freaked out before getting too close where she would notice me and I made a 180 and got the fuck out of there.  I almost had an anxiety attack and the whole time I was trying to figure out why she would pass by me and keep going as if nothing.

Years have passed and every once in a while I would see a woman pass and when I turn to look from behind it looks exactly like her.  Never from the front, only from behind after she had already passed by me.  Most of the time I feel like I am overreacting and I try to reason that it is just a random stranger, but I can’t help but feel sometimes that it is Dr. B.

**TL;DR**: I had a professor creep on me in class and later weird shit ensued."

This is the second wedding for which I've been a maid of honor. In the first situation last year, the bride was generally pretty unpleasant to work with, but it was sort of par for the course for her at that time. After the wedding, she lightened up considerably and we have a better relationship than we even had before her engagement.

Because of all the trouble I'd had with the first gal, I was psyched for the second one to get engaged. I consider this person my sister. We've been best friends for many years and I have always known her to be a steady, understanding, laid-back person. I thought her shower/bachelorette/everything would go smoothly and be a joy. 

Everything was pretty much fine until a couple months ago (the wedding is in July). We'd had a couple disagreements because she kept badgering me to ""lock down"" my own boyfriend (I presumed maybe because she wanted a partner in the planning process?) and it's not the right time for us, so I had to shut her down repeatedly. No big deal. The real trouble is that now she is being overwhelmingly negative about everything. The flowers, the DJ, the pictures, the venue, the money, the dress, I've heard her complain about all of it--but the real trouble is the dates/details of the shower. She drags her feet every time I try to set a date (I'm throwing her 2 showers in 2 cities so things need to come together soon). She is snarky with me about my choice of date--it's limited because I'm in med school and just trying to eke out my first year, and I have finals/ceremonies/mandatory internships I have to work around. 

Negativity is one thing. But now she isn't responding to my requests to hang out. When we hang out in a group, she ignores me, to the point where her fiance recognizes what's happening, looks visibly uncomfortable, and goes out of his way to include me. There was a death in my extended family a couple months ago and she barely talked to me about it, even when I brought it up. I can forget about venting about school to her; she just launches into how much harder her situation is because of wedding-this and wedding-that. 

I am honestly doing my best, and I started out with the best of intentions. I worried for a long time that maybe she was being hostile to me because she'd heard me vent about the first friend's wedding and thought that I'd adopt the same attitude to hers. But I truly didn't think anything like that until she started getting cranky with me. I know I am probably at least partially at fault but I have done everything I can think of to correct my own behavior and nothing has improved. If anything, it's worse now that ever.

So I need advice. The fact that my first friend totally returned to baseline after her wedding makes me want to hold my tongue. I know that this friend is incredibly sensitive and holds some major grudges, and I don't want to get on the bad side of that. Is wedding planning really so consuming and important that it can temporarily morph a person's personality, only to return to normal? Or is this something I need to hash out right now, since the problem won't evaporate in August? My best friend is unrecognizable to me and my feelings are getting hurt. 

I understand that this is ridiculously long but I'd appreciate any insight. Tell me your stories and help me understand the wedding-planning mindset. Thank you :)

1axejo,25,2013-03-24,Any Advice for Entering Marketing Research Industry?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1axejo/any_advice_for_entering_marketing_research/,"My background is in political science (BA) and sociology (MS). I just finished my Master's at the end of summer 2012 and have been job searching since last June.
I have had little luck finding a job in the non-profit or political world, let alone one that pays enough for me to support myself in the cities that actually offer this type of work. (If I could afford to be an unpaid intern forever, then finding a job wouldn't be a problem...). My attempts at casting a wider (but unrelated) net have failed as well - as I tried for management consulting associate positions and business graduate schemes. 

After starting to think more about my strengths and passions (at the advice of career councilors and the endless assortment of career development books I've gathered), I realize I truly enjoy research. However, aside from experimental design, my quantitative skills are limited.  

What level of statistics would I need to realistically enter this field? Is this something I can learn using resources like Khan Academy or workbooks? 

Any words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated. Thank you! 

TL;DR: How do you enter the marketing research industry? How much stats knowledge do you need and where do you get it?"

Let's stop making 50 posts a day about ""OMG Guyz only 25,000 more signatures until the president has to give us the exact same response as the last 5 petitions!"" and instead *actually contact our representatives directly* in support of H.R. 499 the end federal marijuana prohibition act of 2013. This actually changes the law of the land instead of getting the same rehashed bullshit response we always get from the white house.

[Here is a link to a really great post by gothangelblood yesterday explaining whats going on and what you can do that's actually productive](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/1awdsg/federal_petition_to_end_prohibition_on_marijuana/). I know actually searching for your representatives number and then speaking on the phone to a real human being is more difficult than clicking ""vote"" online, but you have to actually do a minimal amount of leg work to get anything done. Whitehouse.gov petitions have shown themselves to be nothing more than a PR campaign to make people think the president cares, but we have the opportunity to make some real progress, so get out there and show your representative that this matters to you and make them represent you.

And as is pointed out in the linked post above, please be polite and have an organized train of thought when you call the unpaid college intern. If you sound like you're stoned they're much less likely to take you seriously, it's just how the world works."

I have been doing it ever since. I've heard people say that over 90% of men do it, so I thought it was a part of life and that I shouldn't think twice about it. I mean, if everyone does it, then why shouldn't I? It feels good, so I'll just enjoy it. A couple of months ago, I went on a backpacking trip for a couple of days with a group of guys I know. I obviously wasn't able to do anything that whole 3 day long trip. At the end of the trip I was extremely energetic. Even with hiking miles, I still had energy and just felt clear headed. When I got home, I ended up fapping that night and didn't think twice. The next day I felt extremely fatigued and my head was foggy. I thought this was from hiking (probably partly true) but it made me think that maybe it was because I hadn't fapped. After that, I decided to start trying to resist the urges see what happened. After just 2 days, I felt much more energetic, talkative, and happy. Noticing this, I really wanted to continue. I was a fap a day guy and didn't think twice about it, but I had no idea how strong this addiction was. I tried to stay away, but I failed on the 3rd day. Since then, I've tried multiple times, but only got 5 days in before I couldn't resist the urges. I haven't gone a week without fapping since I've known about it. I felt alone and like I was stuck in a pit. I wanted to talk to someone about it, but there aren't many people you can actually talk openly to about this. Regardless, I decided to ask my youth pastor about how I could stop because I didn't want PMO junking up my life. (I intern at my youth group) After talking with him for a wile, all he told me was that I need to just stop. Like it is just that easy or something. He also said that if he found out I was still doing it, I would get kicked out of my internship. At that point, I felt totally alone. I couldn't do it on my own and the only person I could really talk to just threatened to end my internship. I just kind of lost hope and kept doing it. Then I found this place. It blew my mind that you guys are so understanding and helpful. No one talks down to anyone, and even atheists as well as people from other religious backgrounds get along here. You've found a common enemy and unite against it. There is power in numbers, and you guys have really shown that. I want to be a part of this because I think this could totally change my life. I think this could actually help me, and I wanted to thank you guys just for being here when a lot of other people weren't. Well here I go. Wish me luck!"

Reaching Financial Independence Early!,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ax9kd/22_years_old_reaching_financial_independence_early/,"22yrs old. I have one more semester of school to complete and will graduate with a bachelor's in computer engineering  in December 2013. 
Currently have no debt.

Have $10,500 in an Ally savings account

$2,500 in Wells Fargo Checkings/Savings

Have a reliable car that's paid off.

I have a 12 week internship from May 20th-Aug 9th where I expect to clear ~$10,000 after taxes

Able to keep my monthly expenses May 20th-August20th ~$1100 rent/food/entertainment/insurance(Rent is the killer here!)

Expenses from now to May 20th ~$700 (Rent is already paid)

Expecting to pay ~$3500 in September for last semester of school

Expecting to pay about ~$4000 for last semester living expenses.

I also have an side gig that I made ~$5000 last year but that is not guaranteed whatsoever this year but I may make about that amount again so I don't like to count on it.

Those are the big numbers. I am wondering how to make the money work for me as best as possible! I would like to make the max contribution to my 2012 Roth($5000) before the April 15th deadline.

Funds I have been looking at are

VFINX- Vanguard 500 Index Fund Investor Shares

VASGX- Vanguard LifeStrategy Growth Fund

VISGX-Vanguard Small-Cap Growth Index Fund Investor Shares 

VHDYX-	Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund Investor Shares

Being only 22 I have a pretty high tolerance for risk as I won't be touching most of these funds for a while. That being said I also have a goal of early ""retirement"" or better said financial independence.  Once I reach the crossover point of where my investments are making enough money to live on I intend to ""retire"". 

I live pretty well but also frugally at this point and have no real need to have a flashy new car or things of similar natures. I am setting a goal of having this done by age 31 but depending on my spending obligations in the future(Possible children etc..)  set a max age of 35. I intend to save &gt;%50 of my income if possible.

Speaking of income I intend on making anywhere from $50,000-$60,000 out of college(January 1st, 2014 or so)  and should have room for salary growth.
My employer this summer even as an intern offers a %4 match on 401k(Traditional or Roth) contributions with %100 immediate vesting and allows me to manage the 401k myself. So I am thinking I should definitely take advantage of this! I am hoping to stay with this employer after I graduate but due to their many locations around the country I don't really know where I will end up geographically.

So really I am searching for direction on what to do. How much should I invest now? Funds to invest in now? Should I put money into my 2013 Roth at the same time when I put my 2012 contribution in? Should they be different funds? How to structure my portfolio?  Should my 401k investing be any different? Hopefully I was descriptive enough, let me know if you need any more information! Thank you so much in advance!

This story is about my finding and breaking up with the only girl who I have felt a true connection with. It all begins with in the summer of 2011. It was a normal day at work for me, at the time I was working as an audio visual tech in an office building. As I was doing my normal routine checking in on meetings, etc, I saw a truly gorgeous woman. A woman so attractive and elegant that I was awe struck. She had everything that I wanted, physically. She was tall yet cute, her hair was dark and poofy (I love poofy hair), and and top of all that her body was full and curvaceous. Immediately I decided that such a woman was out of my league because I was not used to such seeing humility paired with beauty in such a way. To my surprise, she was sweeter, and more caring, and more humble than she was beautiful. 

One day at lunch she just sat down at the same table and we sparked a conversation. I was even more delighted that she, like I, was a little nerdy so immediately we had a bit of a connection. I couldn't wait for the next move. I found out that she was younger than I thought, she was only 18 (as opposed to being in her mid twenties which I had initially thought) and I was 21. Normally I would have been put off by this but she proved herself to be quite mature. 

As time passed we had become close, but, there was a huge obstacle in the way. She had been the first girl that I had become close to after a very destructive and manipulative relationship that I had been extremely affected by. There had been a year's time between these events but I was still quite affected and I knew it. As I was wrestling with the idea of pursuing this amazing woman she had beat me to the punch and told me that she had feelings for me. I was unable to give an answer at the point, and I left with one thought heavy on my conscience. I was sad that this girl had took the risk of tell me her feelings and wasn't able to provide her with anything substantial. I then told her exactly why I couldn't make up my mind. I brought to my home and showed her the empty nursery that I had built for my baby boy. My son was born from the previous relationship which I had mentioned before. My ex girlfriend had done everything possible to tear me down and I was still recovering from all of it. I told her that I could not guarantee that things would go well between us. 

Afterward she stayed. We still hung out, even more in fact. I saw that she was really goodhearted and simply wonderful. So, I went for it. However, what I feared had started to happen. My anger with my ex had started to perverse the relationship. I had found myself being unreasonable and apathetic. Even though it pained me to leave her, I forced myself to because I knew I was not being fair to. 

Over the following year I was able to open my eyes and find a way out the cave in which I had retreated due to my other relationship. I had stopped being pessimistic and unreasonable, things within myself were returning to normal. It was at this point, more than any time, that I would miss her the most. I couldn't help but think ""Why couldn't I have been this way with her? If only I could see her again, to apologize at the very least"". To be honest I believe that the guilt I felt, and still feel, from the way I didn't treat as she deserved had been the thing to allow me to transcend myself and get over what had happened to me. For this I am forever indebted.

Fast forward to the summer of 2012. The summer is the start of the college internships at my job which she was a part of. For a whole month I searched for her in hopes that she had returned. Just when was about to accept that she wasn't coming back I saw her. I couldn't believe it. As cliche as it sounds I felt like the luckiest guy in the world that I was given a second chance. That moment of elation was short lived with the thought of how she must feel towards me. When I found myself right next to her I wasn't to confront her at all. How could I say the things I wanted in such a casual atmosphere? How could I begin to bring up what in a professional setting? At the same time, how could I simply say ""hi""?

I did about the lamest thing possible I sent her an email saying that I'm glad your back and asked if she wanted to have lunch some time. It worked.

We went out after work one day had a bit of small talk and she quickly asked ""why did you want to talk?"". Relieved, I told her the truth. I told her that I was very sorry for the way I treated her and that I missed her, I really missed her. Before parting ways she told me that this changed her perception of the situation and some time to think. 

After hearing her side of the relationship and hearing her anger towards me she decided to give me another chance. Not only was I overcome with joy, this time, I was ready. Holding her at that moment was indescribable. I was sure that I had lost her and yet, there I had her. 

After some time had passed she had begun trusting me and I had continued to treat as the beautiful and wonderful woman that she was. Everything was right. My family had liked her, her family seemed to like me. There was an issue. Something that I still think about today. It seemed that the closer we got a part of her became that much more distant. It was discreet and by the time I had notice it had become too late. In an instance it was over. She had abruptly ended the relationship.

Her reason was that our sex life was bringing her further away from her religion. I found this to be odd primarily because I let her progress things sexually. I never pressured her into trying new things and always made sure that she was comfortable with what we were doing.

I wish that I could elaborate on this but she wasn't able to elaborate on this herself. She tried to explain but couldn't find the right words. I always knew that this was a possibility because she was religious and I am an atheist, but we are both rational and respectful people. Though I don't accept her religion as my own I respected her right to believe what ever she wants. For these reasons I honestly thought this wouldn't happen.

She admitted that she enjoyed being with me and that I was good to her, better than she felt she deserved even. So I am left to wonder if this is the real reason she ended things. I don't want to believe this to be the truth because it is simply unfair. I'd rather it be anything else. I'd rather it be that I didn't deserve her, or even that this was payback for our first encounter. Then I would at least be able to accept my own fault. This relationship ended late august of 2012 and I still have not been able to come to terms with what happened.

Or don't take Calc II and do something what my University calls a fundamentals of business minor, which would be three courses per semester for my last two semesters assuming no schedule conflict spring semester next year.

I've done internships one in China and one right now in Germany as part of my year long study abroad in Germany and I am pretty decent CS student so I'm not worried about finding a job after I graduate, but just how good of a quality job I can get after graduating.

I like technology and have always been a computer nerd, but I don't know if I want to work for someone else my entire life.  I would like to be in a situation where I could earn enough money from passive income to not have to worry about things like food and rent.  **So with that goal in mind should I pursue the business minor at the expense of the math minor?**  I could squeeze the Math minor by doing Calc II over the summer but since I would still be doing my internship then, time and money would be concerns of mine.

It was initially slow going. We would see each other a couple times a week for drinks, a meal, what have you. We continued like this for a month or so. 

After we started having sex the pattern developed into her coming over to my place, usually around 930 to 1030 at night(she lives with her parents currently) and we would have sex, hang in bed for a couple hours and then she would leave, as she works in the morning. She says she is uncomfortable sleeping somewhere other than her house because she has a morning routine. I have witnessed her morning routine, she dresses and eats breakfast. I'm pretty sure she could pull that off at my place.

Filling out the picture here, she works full time, has irregular weekends, and also plays roller derby. The derby stuff, because her coach is a fucking asshole, takes up many hours a week, 10 minimum. this coupled with her job essentially means she has 50+ hours a week totally blocked out that can't be messed with. 

So getting to me, I am a full time student and intern, I too have friends and personal interests, albeit nothing that demands me practice for four hours three times a week and go to regular sorority-esque social functions. I have become very attached to this girl, I like her a lot. We are different in many ways but that is something I appreciate. I'm extremely attracted to her and look forward to the prospect of actually building a relationship with this person. But here is the issue.

I am willing to shape my fairly full schedule around her, I am willing to tell friends that ""No, I am busy tonight, plans with the ladyfriend are taking precedence."" I am also willing to go do something that she wants to do, even if I may be little tired or would rather stay in, go out or whatever. I don't see that coming from her side. She constantly makes plans that I am not aware of and then, when I call or text, tells me oh no, sorry Im busy tonight with the team or my friends, or parents or whatever. I get to hang out with her maybe two to three times a week, usually only for  two or three hours. She says that I'm lovely, she misses me etc, but is that a cop out? I'm not built for just hanging around and throwing myself into her schedule whenever its convenient for her. What do you guys think? Is she just not into me? Is she just a loner? Do I actually have room to complain? All I know is that this is making me progressively more frustrated, angry, distracted, and somewhat sad.

TLDR; Girlfriend is unable/unwilling to spend what I consider to be enough time on us. She doesn't seem interested in engaging with my life. I make time for her, and it isn't reciprocated. I also wouldn't mind having sex more than twice a week, I am 22 after all."

From the student reviews I've read  it seems like the internships they hook you up with are all at nightclubs or small Long Island businesses. It's kindof a dream of mine to work at GQ. Could Hofstra make this happen?

Also I've heard that there's really nothing to do but go to bars on weekends and that it's a big commuter school so campus is basically empty. I'm not one to go to bars and I come from out of state so I'd be stuck on campus. Is it really that bad or could I find people to hang out with and do fun things like any other school?

Lastly, has anyone had any experience with the duel degree program?

I'm looking at U of Tampa as well as Hofstra. I know campus life there is obviously more involved but I've heard Hofstra gives you a better education and they internships they claim to have available sound incredible.  I just don't want to be miserable and keep commuting home because I'm bored. Any advice?"
1awyv5,5,2013-03-24,European student studying accounting hoping to emigrate to the US. Looking for some advice.,cantaccount,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1awyv5/european_student_studying_accounting_hoping_to/,"I'm currently doing a four year honours bachelor degree in accounting in Ireland and I will graduate in May 2014. I would love to emigrate to the United States immediately afterwards but I don't think this is a viable option as I don't have a working visa and I doubt I would secure an American graduate training contract as a European.

With this in mind, I hope to secure a graduate training contract in Ireland with one of the big four firms after I graduate in 2014. You might be aware that unemployment is high in Ireland and competition for summer internships and graduate contracts is extremely tough so more than likely I will have to settle for a small accounting practice in order to get the necessary experience.

My ultimate goal is to emigrate to the United States as soon as I can. Can any American accountants advise me on what would be the best way of approaching this. For example, I'm thinking about studying with ACCA after I graduate because I will get exemptions from 10 of the 14 exams but would I get employment as a a fully qualified ACCA accountant in the US? What areas should I be looking to get experience in, etc.

Thanks.

[update from ealier post]",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1awwsv/finally_a_win_update_from_ealier_post/,"About 2 months ago, I [posted on here](http://redd.it/16l0qp) as I was on my way to the Psych-ER.  After years of barely keeping my head above water, trying to act like my depression wasn't real, I finally caved.  At the time it was the most embarrassing thing i could imagine doing.  At 24 years old, living at home is bad enough, let alone asking your mom to take you to the hospital for depression.  The back-story is long and unnecessary right now, but what does matter is the INCREDIBLE impact in my life after the 10 days I spent in the hospital.  I've been out since late January and while it was a rollercoaster for the first few weeks, I really can't remember the last time I was truly this happy inside.  I can finally sleep at night which was a huge problem for me for so long.  With the strength I gained by being able to admit that I needed help, I've made strides in my life that my depression told me were impossible.  I went from having literally $0 to my name and a dead end job, to working as a paid intern in the field that I have dreamed of for years.  I'll gladly share my story with anyone who's curious, but the purpose of this post is less to flaunt my personal victories, but to share the hope with anyone who is considering other options.  I made sure I waited this long to make this post to show that my new found happiness wasn't just the high of being free from the hospital, this shit is real.  "
1awufs,2,2013-03-24,Struggling with my decision to move there.,[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1awufs/struggling_with_my_decision_to_move_there/,"So my bf (29) and I (22) have been dating since early November, but have known each other since July/August. He lives in the Netherlands, I live in Germany but am originally from the US. He asked me a few weeks ago to move in with him, and I have to say it's incredibly tempting. I would get a visa that allows me to work anywhere I want as long as we live together and are dating. Whereas here my visa relies entirely on my job.

I'm absolutely petrified about telling my parents that I am going to live with him, as they are relatively old fashioned and think that me moving to another country just for a guy is ridiculous.

However, there are some extenuating circumstances that make my decision more difficult: I have a job here. It's not a very good job, and at the end of April it may no longer be a job. But I've worked my ass off and gone from intern to head of the Community Management department in a matter of months. Considering I do not have a degree that's a HUGE accomplishment. My boss is still waiting on getting our increased funding approved by our investors, and if that doesn't go through then the company is going under and I'm out of a job and a visa. In that situation moving is obvious.

However, if the funding does go through I have a well paying job here in the gaming industry. That's not something I could even imagine getting in the Netherlands. There are some places, but my resume looks quite lame and I doubt they'd even give me a second glance.

I'm just so stressed. If I do choose to move there then I may not have a job and may not find one for months, as I speak 0 Dutch. But my bf claims that's not a problem. I'm also worried that the dynamic will change drastically when we're finally together and have to work and do other stuff as well. Whenever we see each other now no one has to work, and we're sort of in this bubble of happiness.

I'm sorry I'm rambling. I'm just nervous and unsure of what to do. I know so many of you will think I'm nuts for considering not moving there. But if the funding goes through this job can be huge for me. I HATE where I am now. I hate my roommates, I hate my friends here, I hate being in a city, and I hate seeing my bf once every few weeks (which is better than most of you, I know I shouldn't complain). But I'm so afraid that I'll move in with him, have no friends, and just be miserable and bored and lonely all the time.

Our house will be in a really tiny town pretty far from any major city, and I don't know anyone in the country other than him, his friends, and his family. I'm just.. worried and needed someone to vent to, sorry."

Needless to say, that didn't happen, and now I am doing an easy job where the only requirement is to have white skin and a college degree.

To put it bluntly, how much weight does the degree hold when seeking out jobs and internships?

Also, I was wondering how flexible the curriculum is. I realize that the program has an emphasis on design (and on media arts I suppose), but I'd also like to learn about programming in a more traditional computer science context. To what extent would I be able to supplement my major with classes from other departments, namely in computer science? In the past, have students been able to pursue a minor or second major in another area of interest?

1awtbx,81,2013-03-24,"My life has ""sucked"" for years and I'm still having trouble getting it better. Can I have some advice?",artelus,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1awtbx/my_life_has_sucked_for_years_and_im_still_having/,"I guess this is both a post for help and a post to journal my thoughts...

First of all, some positive things:

1. I got a license and a car. It took me years to motivate myself to go practice driving with my dad so I can feel confident enough to take the driving test and to drive my own car (My driving school was bad, so I had to learn most of it myself after I got the green slip from them).

2. I got and maintained a high GPA, though a lot of it is from unnecessary stress that could be avoided by procrastination and doing what I need to do before the last minute.

But my life still feels...sucky. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I think I have mild depression that gets extra bad during times of high stress (exams, etc). and that has gotten in the way of a lot of things. What I want to fix is my habits, and I believe having good habits would help me cope with my depression.

Things I want to do:

* 1. **Go to bed at a reasonable time.** Right now it's 8am and I'm still up. I don't know why, but I'll go to bed as soon as I submit this post. Or maybe I'll browse Reddit a little more, but I hope I won't. 

The fact is, I need sleep to not feel depressed. Right now it's the weekend so it's fine, but during weekdays I am busy as hell and I have classes all day, and yet I only get 5-6 hours of sleep each day. I just have a habit of staying up. If I don't get enough sleep, I have issues with my thoughts. I'm more negative. Lack of sleep can affect me to the point of suicide idelation. But even knowing that, I can't seem to get into the habit of sleeping early.

* 2. Doing the things I need to do.
Apply for internships, applying for classes, etc. Those take me days or weeks to do. I don't know why. I just keep putting them off and time keeps on passing. I don't know what is holding me back. Maybe it's fear, or maybe I'm just lazy. I don't know myself enough to figure this out, and maybe someone with more personal insight can help me.

Also, homework and studying for exams. I'm also pretty terrible at stopping, sitting down and doing those things.

* 3. Working out and being fit.
I've tried to start this habit several times during high school and college. It just never worked. Fitness is a completely different lifestyle than what I am living right now.

I am posting because I feel worried. Time is passing very fast to me, and I still feel like I am holding myself back. I want to do all these things but every time I've tried, I failed. 

I lose myself all the time. I burn away all my free time, reading stupid shit on reddit, watching stupid tv shows that numb my brain, playing games that consume me. This eats up hours of my day. Hours that I need to use for studying, having a fit lifestyle, going outside and making friends, and making my life not feel like shit anymore (the depression).

I remember during the last few sessions with my therapist (the sessions had to end, and I have to find a new one now but I haven't been doing that either like I should), we went over the topic of disappointment. I have been very disappointed in myself, and my life. I feel like it's out of control sometimes. I don't like how I need to send my headphones for repair, and I've been putting it off for over 6 months, and if I've done it sooner I could be using them right now. I don't like how I've never had a girlfriend before, or gotten laid, or did anything impressive like all my friends. But my therapist also suggested that my fear of disappointment is what's been keeping me from making any significant changes in my life, but our sessions ended before we could explore this further. 

Oh well, this is just a random offloading of my worries. I hope I get some good advice out of this."

Over the last weeks I've made some significant changes in my life, and I really felt the need to share it with other people. I guess this is as much for me as for you, for me to hopefully end a period in my life and mark the beginning of another one. And I hope that by posting this, I can also inspire or help some of you guys who are struggling with the same things I've struggled with and still am.

I've been struggling with myself and my habits for a long, long time. It has never gotten out of hand completely; I still got out of the house for classes, did my (bare minimum of) homework, did volleyball 2x/week, hanging out with friends every now and then. However, every spare moment I would spend on the computer: mostly playing videogames, but also fair amounts of watching series or browsing the internet. I guess I can be happy that MMORPGs don't really appeal to me, I'm mostly a single-player gamer, constantly downloading new games, though rarely finishing a game because I got bored of most of them really fast.  
For a couple years, I've been denying to myself that I had a problem. Sure, I used to play video games a lot, but there were still times I didn't need to play at all. During the holidays, when I didn't have a laptop with me, I could read books whole days without any urge whatsoever. And when I was busy with other things or had a deadline coming, I had days that I didn't play and didn't miss it.  
However, when I had access and time to play, I did. It just became a habit for me, the thing I did whenever I didn't have anything to do at that moment. And I started procrastinating; I think I have an instinct for guessing how much time I need for certain tasks, so I would procrastinate up to the moment I had just enough time to finish it (though never enough to actually satisfy the perfectionist I do have in me). I started skirting the edge more and more, spending less time on my study, but I still got very high grades, so I didn't have any extra motivation there to change my ways.  
Of course I had nagging parents that kept saying every once in a while that I needed to stop procrastinating and that I was addicted to the computer. However, at first I didn't see it myself, so I didn't believe them and wanted to ignore it. And later, I did see it myself, but I couldn't talk to them about it; I thought they wouldn't understand; it felt too painful admitting I had a problem to them; I wanted to fix this myself and didn't want to rely on other people.  
After this had been going on for a couple years, I started realizing what it all did to me. I didn't play games or watched series anymore because it was fun or because I wanted to. It was just this routine I was getting into and I didn't know what to do else or how I could change. I really wanted to change by then, and tried several times, but always ended up back where I was before.

Until some months ago, when I started realizing some things about my problems and gradually making some lasting changes.  
I started with an internship, working 50+ hours/week. I really wasn't used to this, coming from 15-20 hours/week of lectures and classes. Most days, I was very tired, mentally and physically. I had to find new ways to reload and relax and didn't have time any more to waste it on things I didn't need.  
Because of this change, I started seeing my habits from a different perspective, how damaging they were to me, but I also saw why I still had to do them.  
- It was my way of coping with negative emotions or feelings. When I was playing a game or watching some series, I didn't need to think of anything else for some time and could pretend I didn't have any problems, even though I knew I had.  
- It was just easier; most of the things I wanted to do instead, would take some kind of effort or energy. The computer always gives instant gratification with minimal effort, so it takes much willpower to not give in.  
- I used the gaming to fill a void; whenever I had a spare moment, I was afraid to waste time, but if I finished a level or killed the next boss, it always felt like I achieved something.   

But I realized these weren't true:   
	- It might give me instant gratification, but after some time the guilt would come creeping up on me, and afterwards I would just feel bad about myself. However, if I would study or do other important stuff, I would feel genuinely good about myself and like I've accomplished something that day.  
	- Procrastinating didn't solve my negative emotions or make them disappear, all it did was add another layer of guilt that I couldn't do something better with my life, every day again. Which of course only added to the negative emotions and made it more important to flee from them, keeping the system going.  
	- Because it can only cause more negativity, it can never fill that void for me. For that I need genuine work, real things I've accomplished, connections with real people. Perhaps it's like throwing acid in a deep hole; it seems like you're filling it with something, but all it does is burn and make it deeper.

Over the years, I've tried many things and read a lot about these things, but it wasn't until now that I found a combination of changes that allowed me to keep them going and sustain them.  
- Meditation. For my birthday, I got a book about mindfulness. I was a bit sceptic at first, but I was still curious about what it could do for me. I did struggle a bit with my busy schedule to find time for meditation, but I'm glad I persisted. In the moment, it can be very relaxing, just focusing on your breath or body and to leave all your worries for some time. But in the long term, I noticed some other very big changes. I became much more aware of my thoughts and my urges, which is indispensable when you want to change and do what you need or want to do. And I also started noticing the world again: flocks of birds flying through the sky, the snow on my way to work, the sunset out of my window. I guess I got numb after all these years, and found my senses back. This was very important for me, in realizing what procrastinating did to me and how much better I feel, now that I've made these changes.  
	- A diary. More than 3 years ago, I already found that writing every day is something that I need to do. Back then, I was introduced to the concept of morning pages of Julia Cameron (summarized: as the first thing you do every morning, write by longhand for three pages, whatever is on your mind). I followed that a couple months and it helped me enormously in creating quietness in my mind, by getting all the random thoughts out of my head and allowing me to actually think them through. Since then I've failed at this habit many times because I simply forgot or got busy, but I also kept starting again because I found it's so valuable. I've written in different formats (writing longhand,  Word, 750words.com, [Penzu](http://www.penzu.com)), they have all their own strengths, weaknesses and appeals. Since a week now, I've started using OneNote again. But I guess this is really personal, and all you need is something that feels right to you and keeps you writing.  
	- Most Important Tasks (MIT). This is a concept I've learned from Zenhabits: every morning (or evening before you go to bed, if that suits you better) you pick the 1-3 tasks that are most important to you at that moment. Write them down somewhere (gives you extra motivation and accountability). At first, just start with doing it, even if it's just for 1 minute, before you start with anything else. Everyone can do that right? But by actually starting, you're making a start at beating your procrastination, and from there you can expand. Right now, I pick one or a few tasks every day, that I know I can complete. If I've done those, I can work on other things or relax, it doesn't matter, as I've already accomplished my day there, which is a great feeling.  
	- [Beeminder](http://beeminder.com). This is the one thing that has been the basis for all the other changes to succeed. Without this, I probably would have failed again just like all those times before. It's a great site for tracking all kinds of goals. It tracks your progress on a graph and forces you to keep moving toward your goal, otherwise you will fall off the road. You can adjust the steepness of the road at any time, so you can make it as hard or as easy as you want. The changes will only go into effect 7 days from now though, so that you can't weasel out of your commitment in the short term. It has integrations with various different services (GitHub, Withings, Trello, RescueTime, Gmail) and you can schedule daily reminders to mail or SMS if you want to. Their business model is that you commit to pay for their service if you derail from your goal (the first one is free, then it's just $5). However, as long as you stay on your road, everything is free. By just tracking and being accountable, I'm much more motivated every day to actually do the goals I wanted to do anyway (thanks to Beeminder I've written in my diary and meditated for 4 months now, done my MIT every day, started exercising more often and reduced my email inbox to zero from 1500+ emails). By starting slowly and with the extra motivation and accountability, you'll probably succeed anyway, but the actual money that is on the line adds another layer of motivation. And if you derail due to a technicality, you can just email them and they'll just reset your graph (their support is really great and personal, and they helped me a couple times when I had problems).  
	- [Trello](http://trello.com): here, you can easily make and organise lists. I started using Trello for keeping track of my To Do list, from which I can then just drag and drop a task to my MIT list, and from there I can then drag them to my Done list, which keeps growing and growing. I have even set up a goal in Beeminder, to automatically keep track the amount of MITs I completed.  
	- Change your unproductive routines. Every morning, I already started surfing or watching series before I completely went to the shower and got dressed, usually while eating my breakfast. By changing that up (getting dressed and ready before I breakfast, and adding in a short meditation), I already start the day with a more productive mind-set and the need for the internet fades away.   
	- Organise the bookmarks for websites you visit frequently in folders. I used to spend much time checking some sites again and again (e.g. Facebook, Gmail, Reddit, Feedly, Youtube, news sites). I realized some sites are very important for me (Trello, Beeminder, my online diary), so I put those together in one folder. By organising a few of the other sites in another folder (Gmail, Facebook, Feedly), I could just open that folder, look through them for something new, and then be done with them. In this way, I can create some moments during the day that I allow myself to check those sites, but reduce the need to go to those sites when I'm busy with something else. And by organising the remaining time wasters in another folder, I also reduce the temptation for visiting those. This doesn't seem like a big thing, but those little things can actually be a huge help.

A very important thing I've found: don't try to change too much all at once. Most diets fail because the people didn't make any lasting changes in their life, but they make some drastic temporary changes and then go back to their old ways and end up even fatter than before. Just like that, don't try to go cold turkey by banning all video games or TV or Facebook or whatever your vice is. You'll last a few days, maybe a few weeks or months, but you'll probably end up just like with a regular diet: back at square one.   
Instead, look at all those years those habits had to form and settle in your life. It's not realistic to be able to change them on a whim. Instead, take the time to change your life. Build other habits that will support you and nourish you. Try to take one step at a time. Pick one small thing to start with, something not too big or too hard, that you know you can do. If you managed to keep that habit going, maybe try expanding it a little more after 1-2 weeks. And then maybe try adding another habit, and another after that, just try to keep improving yourself. Maybe you won't see the results as quickly, but in this way you'll actually have a chance to succeed. And as long as you keep moving forward, you'll get there. Your future self will thank you, if you actually took the time to change and didn't try to rush it and fail miserably.

All this isn't to say that I'm perfect or anything. A couple weeks back I realized I hadn't actually played any games for some time and I realized I hadn't really missed it; in fact, I was more aware of all the negativity that it made me feel. So I decided to keep it that way and just do other things instead. However, those habits are very persistent, so I'm still struggling with Facebook or Reddit or watching series every now and then (and I have to admit I have played some games for a short time again), especially if I'm experiencing stress from something. However, I feel I have built a framework by now that keeps me on track and allows me to intervene if I'm going back hill again.

Well, that is what I found and realized during those years. I hope it isn't too incoherent or irrelevant, and sorry for the massive wall of text. It's great to get it off my chest though.   
If you've read all that (or some of it), I hope it will help you in some way or inspire you to try out some of the things that have helped me so far and will maybe work for you too.  
And if you have questions or comments, feel free to leave them here, I'll try to come back and answer them.


Tl;dr: don't try to change too much all at once, but take the time to change your habits step by step. Some things that have helped me so far: meditation, keeping a diary, picking a task to do every day, Beeminder and Trello.

It started when I was 12, with the standard middle school bullying where my ineptitude at sports and getting along with people made me a friendless pariah-- much like everyone else in middle school, I imagine.

I let myself go to places I shouldn't have back then, and I refused to talk about them. I think my sister had some of the issues as me-- she was the one who brought up the idea of suicide to me when she was fourteen, but she only brought it up once. Either she got better, or I wasn't a good person for her to vent to.

I refused to talk about it for a long time. Doesn't mean it didn't hit me. I stopped functioning every so often. I remember one day, in particular, something caused me to shut down, and I lay down in the hammock in the side yard and refused to respond to any stimulus.

My mother sat next to me the whole time. She knew something was wrong. I refused to tell her. For absolutely no reason, except that I was positive I wasn't supposed to be feeling how I was, and that revealing that was just revealing more of what was wrong with me.

I didn't bring it up. I toughed it out through middle school, mostly because I was fortunate enough not to have any means of suicide available to me. I got to high school. Things got better. I got to college.... things got worse.

For Christmas, I couldn't enjoy the holiday. My family and I have become estranged. I only feel comfortable with my mother out of my whole family. I tried my hardest to avoid the family for the whole three weeks of break that I was home, and mom noticed. She pressured why I was drinking more and interacting with family less, and I finally admitted that I hadn't trusted anyone in the family in a long time, ever since I decided that I didn't like how hypercritical they all were of one another and, I extrapolated, me. We talked it over, I convinced her not to talk about it with the family at all.

Back to college. I'm in my senior year with no work experience, nothing lined up for the summer, and a GPA below 3.0, which means nobody wants to hire me as an engineering intern or full-time worker. Add to that the way I *knew* that I wanted to be an engineer since I was seven and find myself questioning it now, plus the issues that came to the forefront in my first relationship to last all the way into the six month mark... well, I guess it's all rather silly when you look at it from afar, but I got very depressed from it, and I went further with the suicidal stuff than I ever have.

I tried to find what the least painful way to die was online. All I found were people saying not to do it, no relevant data. I settled on an overdose on sleeping pills in hopes that I would be asleep when the overdose effects ended me. I registered on Amazon and ordered a bottle. I wrote a note. I made sure to absolve everyone who might feel responsible. Anyone I'd ever made the mistake of opening up to. I took full responsibility for what I did, I left what I had financially available to the people who had been friends to me since I was young.

But somehow, thousands of miles away, with me being just as silent and shitty a son as I've always been, my mother figured out that something was wrong. She texted me and made me call her, made me talk to her. I told her that I was depressed. I told her that I felt worthless. I didn't tell her that I was considering suicide. I can't tell her that. I can't do that to her.

But I've started going to a counselor now. The pills came in the mail and I threw them away. I'm still having issues with depression sporadically. My girlfriend and I decided that our problems were insurmountable and broke up today. It's ups and downs, and I'm taking it one day at a time.

I'm a college freshman who, after experimenting with classes has determined that I will likely pursue a degree in Cognitive Science or possibly Psychology.

Now, before you laugh, I am also considering adding Computer Science to this as well but I am curious to know the differences between majoring and minoring in the subject. I think my job expectations are pretty broad, I won't be upset with a business-related job but an ideal situation would be to help in creating virtual realities for people such as soldiers suffering PTSD. Of course I'm only a freshman so anything good or bad can happen :P

I'm asking this because although I have exposure to programming during high school I have not taken a programming course in university yet and while obtaining a minor will be easy to fit, double majoring will be harder.

If it helps, I am currently attending the University of Pennsylvania so I believe I can use the networking and potential internships to my advantage throughout undergrad."

I've recently found some grad programs for interaction design and user experience.

What would be better for a career in user experience at large companies (dream job is at google as director of android user experience some day) going into industry right away after undergrad, and perhaps getting a masters a few years down the line? Or is it better to get the masters right away and then apply for different jobs?

As far as career details go here are some for me:

I'm currently majoring in Computer Science with a specialization in Human Computer Interaction. I attend Stony Brook University and I'm enrolled in the Computer Science Honors program there.

I've interned at a small (~30 people) doing mostly database/report generation/very little front end web dev for them.

I'm currently interning part time at CA technologies doing User Experience and Design work for them during the Spring semester and I will continue doing this for them after the summer in the Fall Semester.

I will be interning at Amazon this summer as an SDE intern in the Kindle Content and Experience branch.

This is my first post to reddit. I've seen some great advice here so I'm hoping now I can get some. 

My boyfriend and I have been dating for about two years now, we moved in together after dating for a year. He's a graphic design student, a senior, graduating this May. I am an assistant manager of a drugstore, I graduated with a degree in business administration just after we met. 

This summer, he's planning to work as an intern for a graphic design position in NYC (We live in Texas.) Of course internships in an art field don't normally pay much, if at all. He is lucky enough to get paid for internship, but it isn't much. Less than minimum wage if he were to work a 40 hour week. He's fortunate enough to have found living accommodations with a friend and won't have to pay rent. Seems like everything is pretty sorted out, except one thing. Our apartment here in Texas. 

When he goes to New York he'll be making less than half what he makes now. The apartment we live in now I can't afford on my own; we can barely afford it together. In retrospect, not the brightest financial decision. He has decided, without my input, that he will not be paying rent for the duration of the internship. Our lease is up in 90 days, so that leaves us with 30 days to make a decision whether to renew the lease or not. Obviously if he's not going to pay the rent I have to make arrangements to live affordably. 

I'm very proud of him and love him endlessly. I love that he has the drive to follow such a path in life. I want him to intern for this company. I know it'll be great for his future, all the connections and experience. I fear the financial strain from this ordeal may be more than our bond can bear. I'll have to move alone while he's across the country, putting a significant amount of furniture in storage as I downsize to an apartment half the size. I wouldn't even be able to visit him in New York because moving is so expensive that even with the money saved from the downsize I will be flat broke. 

Am I in the wrong for asking him for financial help while he's away? Or is he wrong for saying no? "

Hi all, I am an international student here. I am studying finance in a state school. My aggregate GPA is really bad but I have been improving ever since I started my major courses. I have a small dilemma and I would really appreciate some input.

One of the adjuncts at the school owns a community bank in the area where I am going to school. I asked him if I could intern at his place during the summer and he said I could. I do not know what I will be doing there specifically. I was all set to do it but then all of a sudden I get a job offer from one of my cousins where I will be making roughly ~$6k a month. This opportunity is outside the United States and all my living expenses will be taken over by my cousin. It is not related with the world of finance at all. It is more like a sort of store/construction kind of deal. 

My question is, is the internship worth it? I am an international student and have a bad GPA (2.5), from an unranked state school. Will the internship make a night and day difference in my resume? However, this will be my first work experience in the USA. On the other hand, I am living of credit cards and the $18k would be something to look forward to.

Thank you.

I'm currently in Los Angeles pursuing entertainment-y type careers, ie working for a studio, network, etc. I have strong internship experience and have been doing interviews, but nothing has materialized yet.      
      
There is a very interesting and high-responsibility job that I'm in very strong consideration for out of state. If I got it, I feel that it would put me years ahead of the competition and give me excellent experience with a respectable organization, not just clerical/admin stuff like most people start off. I feel that this job if it were in LA or NY, it would be incredibly competitive, but the less-than-ideal location makes many applicants hesitant.    
    
Of course since it isn't in LA or NY, I'm afraid that taking that job (if I'm even offered it) will hinder my ability to eventually be and work in one of those places again. There really isn't much room for growth in this particular organization, and I don't want to be living in this job's city for more than 1-2 years. One thing holding me back early on in the process was that I wasn't physically in NY or LA already, but then again for higher level positions, that may not be an issue for companies when looking for qualified candidates.

https://www.facebook.com/Edherbert09

Long post. You are warned. 

Hello Reddit! This is my first post, although this is not the first time I'm on Reddit. I've read and seen many things all thanks to this lovely website which will be forever burned into my brain. 

Basically, when I was 16, I went to the gym to start training for football but I ended up loving the gym and living the healthy lifestyle that I decided to quit football and put in all of my effort into training. I read, read, read, read and used Bodybuilding.com religiously and over the course of my last two years of High School, people started to see me change, grow, and that was when I truly figured how who I was. People started asking me questions, giving me attention, asking why I wasn’t hanging out with them, but I didn’t care, because all I wanted to do was better myself and train. The gym taught me Motivation, Dedication, Perseverance, and the most important of all, it taught me that if I had the Desire to do something and wanted to achieve Success or a certain goal, I had to put in the Time, Effort and hard work to do so, and I could do something that was physically possible for me to do, with my own hands, because I visualized it in my head and approached it with a Positive Attitude. The gym taught me how to Think. It taught me there are no limits or barriers in Life, only the ones you place yourself, in your own Mind. It gave me everything Psychologically. I would be nothing and a completely different person if it wasn’t for these life lessons which I learned at 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. Then I decided I could apply all of this to every aspect of my Life, and sure enough I was right.  

I'm 20 years old now, will be 21 in June, and I am currently enrolled at a community college (was doing uni/comm) and finishing my pre-reqs to get into Pharmacy School. I am just finishing my internship from a Pharmacy Tech program I completed from University of Florida which will allow me to get my license and I will get my certification for my CPhT. I'm only a few classes away from taking the PCAT but I'm in a struggle. All of this sounds great, but this isn't what I really want. I'll step back abit. Both of my parents have college degrees and I've grown up with a fortunate Life. I've always felt different from everyone, both psychologically and physically, and I've always felt that I have been extremely lucky and fortunate in most of the things I've ever attempted and wanted to do with my Life. My parents want me to go to Pharmacy school and become a Pharmacist because that's the route they went (in terms of College, not their degrees.) My dad specifically is a Computer Programmer for Fidelity Investments and my mom is an Accountant and works for Stahl Consulting Group (located in Tampa, Florida, which is where we live currently.) About a year and a half ago, I met a few individuals at my community college which I became great friends with and we always met up in the library and talked about everything. We originally met in Anatomy and Physiology I. A couple of months later, I started getting really deep into Entrepreneurship. I've always gotten along well with everyone, love talking and communicating with people, mainly from a psychological standpoint and figuring out why people do the things they do and the choices they make in their everyday lives. Well he inspired me to start pursuing an idea for a business. It took me a few weeks. I analyzed everything around me. I started looking at businesses differently, reading about CEO's, and absorbing anything I could about Entrepreneurship.  I started looking into where I put the most of my time and effort into and sure enough, I found my idea. Its abit different now, but it’s still the same core idea. It’s a pretty massive project, and I have absolutely no development experience (not knowing how to code.) You guys are probably thinking why not just ask my dad because he does programming but I’ve asked multiple times and he just isn’t motivated to do it. You’d think with an Accountant and a Computer Programmer and the person with the vision (myself) would be the perfect recipe for a family business but that isn’t the case in this situation. At this point I’m not really sure what to do. I’ve had this idea for almost a year and it seems like nothing has been moving forward. Sure, I’m going to be able to get a job over the summer and make money which will allow me to purchase things like my domain, and I’m currently working on my business plan but I still don’t know how to code and develop the website. I don’t have any sort of money and savings to hire anyone so I feel like it’s getting nowhere. I don’t care how long or how much I have to work in a piece of crap 9-5 job if it moves me forward with my business because I believe it is a great, unique and original idea that will help millions of people because it is fundamentally who I am as a core person, and the experiences and struggles I went through to get to where I am now in terms of Health. I know it can work, because I have visualized it in my head. I see it. That means I can attain it, and I don’t care what I have to do to get there, I know it’s possible. But as I progress further in school, the classes are going to get harder, and from what I’ve read on Reddit about Pharmacy school, you pretty much have absolutely no time to do anything else (especially in the 2nd and 3rd years.) I’m trying to network with as many people as possible,  I’ve looked at going to entrepreneurship events in my area, I’ve even completed an entrepreneurship class at my community college. But it all comes back to my parents and whenever I talk to them, they are interested in my business, but they tell me it can wait until after I graduate from college with my Pharmacy degree and I don’t want to put it off for another 4-5 years. I need to start now, and get this out there now, before it’s too late. I’ve always listened to myself, and I’ve always been close to my parents but it’s been real hard for the past year or so whenever I brought up my business. They always put me in the school mode but then a couple of months later I get into the entrepreneur mode and I question everything and why am I in school.

So what would you guys say? Currently I wanted to take two semesters off (summer and fall) so I could get my CPhT and start making some money, but my parents want me to move out if I do that which will place more burdens on me than I would like. Is it worth it? I’ve read all the books on Entrepreneurship, Motivation, you name it, and they all say just go for it, whatever happens, happens, or another good saying “Fuck it, We’ll do it Live.” I appreciate all of your comments and answers and I will try my best to answer every single one of your comments or if you have any questions for me. Any help would be appreciated. I just don’t want to do the 9-5 grind, not being happy with my Life because I just my Success based on my Achievements and how Happy I am. I ask myself what is the point of going to 4-5 years of more schooling, only to go into another direction (Entrepreneurship) later on. It’s just a means to an end, not an end in itself which is what I don’t like. My parents just can’t get over the “over 100k” salary, but it doesn’t matter what the salary is to me if I don’t like what I do. I know I’m an Entrepreneur at heart because I’ve always been different. I’ve always Thought differently than most of the kids my age, and school just seems like a waste of time to me. I’ve learned almost all of the things through my own experiences anyways. I love my parents with all of my heart and I know all they want is the best for me and to have Success in my Life but in this case I feel that this is where they are wrong and I am right.

1aw13z,7,2013-03-23,Hi r/loseit! 22/f and I'm beginning my weight loss journey (again) tomorrow!,yougottagopherit,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1aw13z/hi_rloseit_22f_and_im_beginning_my_weight_loss/,"This has been a long time coming, and I just found this subreddit and fell in love with all of you (creepy? nah) for being so supportive and motivational! I am 22, graduated from college in May 2012, and have been working a full time job since shortly thereafter. In high school, I ran cross country and played soccer. I remember one of my first drivers licenses reading that my weight was 120 pounds. Long story short, I went to college and freshman year wasn't tough, but sophomore year I moved into my sorority house WAY across a large campus from the rec center, with a cook who was carb-happy, and found myself insanely busy with classes, work, internships, etc.

A friend from high school recently told me that in high school he always thought I was too skinny (I always thought I was on the heavier side of my friend group), and warned me not to get that skinny again.

Now, I'm in-between 5'5"" and 5'6"" and my moment I knew things needed to change was when I stepped on a scale for the first time in probably months and realized the scale read that I was over 180lbs, and again when I went to the doctor and she showed me my chart and I noticed my BMI was WAY too high (according to my standards). I knew I was gaining weight over the last few years, but it didn't really hit me until I saw 180+.  My highest weight was 183, and in the middle of January I started working out to try to lose the weight. I got down to 176 by the middle of February, but then I developed a headache that lasted for two straight weeks and found myself unable to do much, especially high-energy things like working out. I fell off the wagon and haven't worked out since aside from occasionally going for long, brisk walks with my boyfriend after work and on the weekends. I have maintained my weight loss because I have become aware of what I am eating and have been eating much healthier (eating out less, packing lunches for work, etc). So, I still hover around 176-179 depending on fluctuations.

I *need* to make this change, because I hate what I see when I look in the mirror, so I'm getting back on the wagon tomorrow and heading to the gym first thing in the AM. I keep looking at pictures of me from 4 years ago and can see so many differences that I hate - of course in my figure, but also in my face. I will probably need support and motivation from time to time, but I'm glad I found r/loseit! 

I've decided I want to set my goal weight to between 125-135lbs. Tomorrow starts my journey to lose 41-51 pounds! 

Please let me know if you think this sounds healthy. Also, if you have a similar story to mine, how long did it take you to lose this much weight? What kind of program did you do? Thanks for reading my wall of text, and I'm excited to share my progress with you!

After the initial placement round, a lot of bigger companies ended up contacting our department and students that didn't get any prior offers ended up getting the ""better"" jobs.  So now I am kicking myself for not waiting.  This is a long internship too and will last for 16 months.  I'm worried that after graduation, employers will value a university placement less than ones in the industry.  From your experience does it matter? Thanks."

Just a brief overview of what I'm about: I've been working for my dad since I was 13 for his company (he runs basketball tournaments for AAU teams on the East Coast), where at first I ran front-of-house or worked as a clock supervisor, but I have eventually worked up to doing freelance data entry work and contract writing. If anything, I have to attribute my efficient work ethic to my dad, as he taught me early that you should always take pride in your work and that any work can be fun if you make it fun. So if anything, I will say that I raised in an environment that has made me efficient, passionate about what I do and loyal to whomever employs me.

1b01nj,1,2013-03-25,Which school? Portland State University of University of Washington,[deleted],urbanplanning,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/1b01nj/which_school_portland_state_university_of/,"I have the honor of being accepted to Portland State University, University of Washington, and University of Michigan for their Master of Urban Planning programs. PSU and U-W are my top two choices, but I'm not sure which has the better program. Both have around 300 applicants, and both have around 40 slots. I'm looking to practice planning in the Pacific Northwest, which is why I'm debating between the two.

**PSU** is located in a navigable, 20-minute city and their senior capstone is forming a ""**community-based, client-focused workshop** projects [giving us the ]opportunity to form teams to work on projects for community clients, and to produce a professional product by the end of the spring term."" They also require 400 hours of internship experience. From what I can tell, this program is more practice-oriented and they are self-proclaimed to be more reputable than U-W's program. I would pay in-state tuition at PSU ($9,794/year), versus U-W non-resident tuition of $27,849/year. PSU is also located right in downtown Portland. This program is located in the College of Urban and Public Affairs, along with the school for Community Health and Public Policy.

Two drawbacks I see are 1) PSU simply does not have the amount of resources U-W would have. UMich has, for example, has the Spatial and Numeric Data (SAND) Lab, which employs two full-time librarians to help you recover obscure GIS and other spatial datasets. PSU does NOT have something like this, but I'm not sure if U-W has either. 2) PSU is not a name school. As superficial as that sounds, employers do look for schools with good reputations.

**U-W** is located in a sprawling metropolis, surrounded by white-cap mountains, Puget Sound, and endless culture. AFAIK, the program is a bit more theory-intense, but has a similar curriculum with similar specializations (but they have a bonus ""Historic Preservation"" specialization). U-W has tons of resources and a huge campus, but it's located 25 minutes from downtown Seattle. This program is located in the College of Built Environments, along with Architecture, Construction and others.

Two drawbacks are 1) the cost - the difference between U-W (~$28k/year) and PSU (~$10k/year) is stark. 2) Seattle is big - almost too big for me. I also hate Starbucks and Microsoft, lol.

**TL;DR**: Which school will get me the most rewarding job in the Pacific Northwest and prepare me to be the best planner possible? Please discuss the pros and cons of each school, and if you've had any experience with either please share it!

I want to choose the option that would make me a more attractive candidate during recruiting season for the upcoming fall semester. Although the internal audit internship pays less, I feel like it might be the more attractive option, because it would show that I have more experience in the audit practice. Also, the Internal Audit Internship have more flexible hrs, which would allow me to take one or two summer classes, in order to get closer to the 150 credit requirement (At the moment, I am on pace to graduate with about 130 credits).

Would it be better to accept the Financial Reporting Internship or the Internal Audit Internship in conjunction with summer classes?"

So I find myself at a junction, I have two internship offers for the summer and can't decide which to choose. One seems like a smart, safe option but the other one appears to be much more involved, I was hoping that someone might have some applicable advice for a hesitant sophomore ME.
   
 The first position is with a big-name Aerospace company, and it seemed like the right choice initially because of the name, and the connections i could make while there. They have a nuclear division, which Is my end-goal career-wise, but otherwise it is unrelated to my interests.
   The position itself looks fairly bland, lots of analysis. I'm more of a hands-on guy so I'm hesitant to take it on.

 The second position is with a HVAC company as a project management intern. While it isn't all that related to my interests, it looks like a fun opportunity where i'd develop many skills because of the scope of the position. It includes (some) management, communication, thermal design work, and supply ordering. 

  I guess what I'm really wondering is, how did you decide on your internships, and did your career path change because of it?

I interned with a medium sized company for a year and a half doing various things, including System administration, network administration and security. After I graduated they decided not to hire me permanently as I was told they would, and I am now a temp working as a sort-of Sysadmin and making less than the entry level Help Desk workers. I've been told this will eventually lead to permanent position, but of course, that's also what they told me about my internship. 

Unhappy with my situation I've been applying for other Sys admin and Network Admin positions, but there aren't a lot of entry level positions available and i think I am probably not getting responses because I don't have enough experience. Today I received a call from the local library I applied to for a network admin position. They said the position was filled but asked me to interview for a PC Support position. I accepted the interview, but I'm not thrilled about the position. I'd be making about what I'm making now with benefits (plus!) But I would have to support public library patrons. (huge minus)

I know there's room for growth into a sysadmin position from a PC Support position, but honestly I feel like I'm rather overqualified. I have a degree and the things I did as an intern were much more advanced than PC repair. Not to mention the wages for these positions make it difficult for me to put a dent in my student loan debt. So my question is, should I...
1. Continue applying for Sysadmin / Network Admin jobs that require experience
2. Apply for PC Support positions which require no experience or degree with terrible pay and try to move up
3. Stay in my pseudo-sysadmin job that pays terrible just to get more experience

If it makes any difference, my ""dream"" is to be more of a Network Engineer rather than Systems, but I have to get started somewhere."

I'm a senior in high school right now and obviously looking forward to getting out and on to college. For quite a while now though I've just been feeling burned out on school. Most of my classes are painfully simple/soul-sucking and I get no sense of fulfillment from them. I just feel like I'm going from one to the next, trying to keep my head up not slip into a worse state of mind. I have plenty of people at school I enjoy being around, which is nice, but that can only do so much.

But I guess that's probably typical for a lot of high-school students, and the thing is that I'm caught between my own thoughts about myself. I've managed to maintain straight A's throughout high school, I'm the class valedictorian, taking 12 credits worth of college courses on top of the credits I've already earned, one of the better distance runners on the track team (#4/5 depending on the day), accepted to a number of schools with sizable merit scholarships in each one, etc.

And yet it's never enough. I don't feel I deserve what I've accomplished. Sure I'm stressed to continually do well, but why do I deserve to feel stressed? I just go home and goof off online. It's not like I have some unbearable load. I'm kicking myself for missed opportunities: 3rd party scholarships, internships, whatever. Even forgetting to order a goddamn yearbook is a reminder of how much of a screw up I am. Can't even get myself to do such a simple task. How the hell am I at the top of my class?

So yeah. I beat myself up for my shortcomings. My mom isn't much help there though. I know she cares, wants to help and whatnot, but she's just reinforces what I see wrong with myself. So while I'm kicking myself about something she'll come and ask why I haven't been looking for scholarships or whatever.

Today I was relaxing after track practice, glad that spring break is here and she walked up to me and started grilling me on some stuff: a couple summer internships I didn't apply to because I didn't want to burden my parents with transporting me (we agreed that it was better for me to wait until I was 18 so we could avoid some of the BS; I regret that now too), a scholarship to which I missed the application date. I guess it was just too much and I broke down, and she sort of went talking about offering to give me suggestions on not putting things off and whatnot.

It hurts enough that she went through my papers; it feels awful that she didn't understand that I didn't want life advice while I was in tears. She's never been great at communicating and I don't know how to tell her that she just makes things worse and reminds me of my shortcomings. She wanted to talk a bit before I started writing this, but how do I tell my own mom that I don't want to talk to her because it's difficult to see her as someone comforting rather than just a source of stress? I feel awful about it but it's true. If I talk to her about these things she always just seems to come back with the same ""Well you need to figure out how to improve at x y and z"" and it hurts. I hate to sound like a typical teenager but it feels like she doesn't understand and I don't know how to tell her without hurting her feelings and making everything worse.

Sorry about dumping this all on you guys. Today was another rough point and I guess it goes back to a bunch of problems all on different levels. I don't even think it's worth bothering you with but I've typed this all up so I might as well."

I havent seen her since we broke up. Anyways he starts telling me some stuff, things ive never heard before. He told me about how my ex told one of his friends (who's also in the same studio) about how she would sometimes lie about being at studio working on homework just so she didnt have to see me that day. 

At first i got pretty mad at him, thought he was lying, but then it just started making sense to me. She always complained about how much work she had to do and how she never had time to see me, yet everyone else in her class who I hung out with always told me she exaggerated things and that she finished before all of them. If they had time to hang out with me, there should be no reason why she didn't.

I mean it got so bad she made me feel fucking guilty for actually getting mad at her for putting school before me. I always told her school comes first, always. That was her mindset as well. But to hear this shit, now? If she does contact me to meet up this week part of me wants to say yeah sure, then just give her a yell storm when i see her. She didnt deserve that fucking letter I sent her 3 weeks post breakup, I gave her all my emotions and completely opened up to her. I thought it was right. My heart told me I had to send that letter, it was the right thing to do, so i did it. But, As time goes on, you learn shit. That's why people say they come to regret breaking NC, youll eventually see shit you didn't even know existed while you were dating that person. 

Anyways Im pretty much at the point where if she does get in contact with me this week since she is in town right now, I am going to tell her I have no interest in being her friend and leaving it at that. I just feel so fucking betrayed, I mean I gave it all to that girl, tried to be so understanding with how busy she was. I did it all for her. She lost that, and one day she can just fucking realize that without talking to me.

1azkpi,4,2013-03-25,Proofread a scholarship essay about my goals and aspirations?,[deleted],Proofreading,https://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/comments/1azkpi/proofread_a_scholarship_essay_about_my_goals_and/,"Here it is. I couldn't bring myself to write about my GPA, classes, volunteer work, or academic achievements. Instead, I wanted to share a story about my childhood best friend, and how he helped me to become the person I am today.


-------

When I was three years old, my family had to take my dog Buster in to the vet for an emergency surgery. There are only two things I remember about that day. I remember crying because I was scared and didn’t understand what was happening, and I remember the veterinarian smiling and telling me everything was going to be okay. When he said that, I knew everything would be alright. I don’t think I really understood what a vet was back then, but I decided right then and there that I was going to be one when I grew up. From then on, I always wanted to go with my family to watch what the vet was doing, even if it was just for a checkup. 

As I grew older, so did Buster. He slowed down and got a little thicker around the belly. He would still chase tennis balls, go hiking, and bark every time he saw a truck he didn’t like, but the deep sigh he would heave as he lie down by my bed every night was a telling sign that he was getting older. 

When I was 14, Buster started to get sick. All at once, he stopped eating and walking, and would look at us like he knew something was wrong. Almost overnight, he got so sick that my mom knew she had to take him to get checked out. That was the first time I didn’t go with her to the vet, and the last time I saw Buster. He had cancer.

--------

Losing Buster was a difficult experience, but I feel that I have learned many valuable lessons from his life. As a child, I only thought about helping sick puppies and kittens feel better. Looking back, I had never considered the difficult decisions that both family and professional must make in certain situations. I had failed to take into account how frustrating the job could be, and how powerless we really are in the end. Instead of crumbling my resolve to become a veterinarian, though, it solidified it. From my volunteer work and internships, I have learned much more about the difficulties of the field, both for animal and for human.

By time I left home for college, I had decided to pursue not one degree, but three. The first is in veterinary science, as a technician. Understanding how and why we do what we do in the field is of major benefit, and is something you can’t learn in a traditional university. My second degree will be in Environmental and Organismal Biology with a minor in chemistry, and will cover nearly all of the prerequisites to get accepted into a school of veterinary medicine. My third and final undergraduate degree—which I am nearly finished with— will be in Psychology with a minor in anthropology. Too many medical professionals fail to care for their clients as much as they do for their work. I want to be a compassionate and caring veterinarian, and feel that it is extremely important for a professional to understand how and why their clients feel and act as they too.

Though it sounds like a long and difficult journey, I am almost there. Three years from now, I hope to be getting acceptance letters from some of the best veterinary schools in the nation. Ten years from now, I want to be back in my hometown of Ivins, starting the city’s first mixed animal veterinary practice, as well as a family of my own. I want to help animals to grow up to be happy and healthy. I want to mend their broken bones and fix illnesses and injuries. I want to ease their pain when they grow old, and help them to pass when it is no longer possible to go on. Most importantly, I want to give back to the animals, people, and town that helped me to become who I am today.

I'm a student from Belgium, and I would very much like to be able to go to Rio next year on an internship. I'm currently applying for the UFRJ but, as some as you might know, their website has not been working the last 3 days. The deadline for applying is today, and I haven't been able to see any available courses. 

Yes, I'm in some shit. I have sent some private messages and got very helpful and kind replies from redditors nanometro, feliperuiz and nofoxwasgiven. Thanks to them I got an e-mail adress from someone at the UFRJ but so far I haven't gotten any response. Also I got a telephone number from the uni, which I called, but no one speaks English and my Portuguese is really not good enough. 

**So my question to you is this:** Does anyone, by any chance, know what the available courses are at the UFRJ for communication sciences, at masters level (I believe this corresponds to post-graduate)? Even if you don't know them all, do you know some of them? 
Furthermore: If anyone wants to call their number and ask about it in Portuguese , that would help me a lot too. Their number is  +552138735075 . 

I know this is a long shot, and I feel bad about having to resort to this but I'm quite desperate and it would be fucked up to miss this opportunity due to a website malfunction.

1azh9t,7,2013-03-25,Dealing with a Narcissistic Aunt,[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1azh9t/dealing_with_a_narcissistic_aunt/,"Hello! I'm in need of some advice... I hope it's okay to post here as this isn't about my parents acting this way, but rather my aunt. This is a wall of text (a really, really long one at that) so I apologize in advance. This is one of the first times I've ever tried to get this off my chest.

This has a long history. My aunt is the oldest of three, and my father is the middle child and my uncle is the youngest. Everyone in our family knows about how when my aunt was young, about five, she tricked my father into consuming dangerous household chemicals because she wanted to be an only child. My father had to have his stomach pumped multiple times because of it. Some of my family members joke that she was just a child and didn't know what she was doing, really. That was the extent of any physical harm that she caused that I know of. She is now closing in on 50 and has four kids of her own, while my father has four and my uncle has two.

Everyone knows that she likes to lie about her accomplishments. She will frequently say, ""oh, I was only three credit hours away from graduating college"" - when everyone knows that she went to college for one semester and then flunked out.

She constantly made her kids' childhoods and my/my sisters' childhoods a competition. ""Well, MY kids started walking at one year old!"" ""[X] was reading at only 2 years old."" ""[X] was the best on the basketball team, but the coach was horrible so I had him drop out.""

One time she unexpectedly dropped by our house right before Christmas saying that she had bought us a Christmas tree. We had not requested this, we did not want this, and my dad was quite furious she would just show up with a live Christmas tree and expect us to pay for it. He later said he was sure she just wanted to see how big/how many presents were under our existing tree.

Throughout my childhood, I remember many hurtful things - but I have always been the type of person to not make a fuss and to be passive, more or less. I've always been a very quiet person, I don't boast or brag about myself - and I've actually been told many times that I'm too hard on myself and that I tend to downplay my accomplishments.

I taught myself HTML and basic programming at a young age, and while at my grandparents', my dad mentioned how I had built my own website. My grandparents wanted to see it, so I brought it up on their computer. My aunt leans over, and says, ""what is this even... why would anyone look at this?"" I was only about 12 at the time, I didn't say anything although that made me feel very bad.

Fast forward to college... I got into an in-state public university for computer science. Every time we have a family gathering, she insists on bad mouthing it. It's certainly not a bad school, not the best but one of the two major universities in our state. 

I got into an internship out of state at a large metro area that I felt quite proud of. She'd badmouth the internship and the city it was in (""that is the most disgusting place I've ever been to"").

People tell me, ""oh, she's just jealous"". Two of her four kids dropped out of high school and obviously didn't go on to college, and one of them went to a small local college for a degree in psychology. She couldn't find a job so she is a manager at a store at the local mall. 

Is ""jealousy"" really an excuse to badmouth everything that I do?

Now, as her kids and me/my siblings are all about the same age, now we are all getting engaged and married about the same time - as was bound to happen. I started noticing an increase in the nastiness after I got engaged, which was right before I graduated college. Suddenly, her two sons were engaged as well. Suddenly, they had scheduled their weddings immediately before mine. Suddenly, they - their whole family - were acting angry at me, and when I would ask why, they would just say, ""there's nothing wrong, we're not angry at you"".

My sister gets married, and their family shows up long enough for the ceremony, to take some food, and then leaves. They post on Facebook later that they went to a bonfire at someone's house. They didn't even stay for their first dance or the cake cutting. My sister was very upset about this, especially about them blatantly bragging about what they left her wedding for on facebook.

So my cousin's, her son's, wedding rolls around and she comes up to me and asks very snottily, ""are you taking notes?"". This was and still is one of the rudest things I think anyone has ever asked me. At this point, my patience reserves are empty. I just say, ""Nope."" She walks away, and that was the only thing she said to me the entire night.

Then her other son's wedding arrives. She made a section for family, and another section for everyone else. She specifically has my uncle and his family sit with the family, and she leaves our family out of it. This made my father very angry, and my grandparents as well. It was completely obvious she wanted to make us feel excluded.

Now my wedding comes, the last out of the bunch. Her whole family had blown off my bridal shower, I get no apologies from any of them besides my aunt - who says, ""I'm so sorry, I just forgot"". Which was a very hollow and I felt offensive apology - couldn't she have at least said that something unexpected came up? Couldn't she have let me know ahead of time?

She completely blows off my wedding, too, saying that she was going to watch a volleyball game in a town about an hour away. I had been careful to send out save the dates and invitations months ahead of time, and I know they all knew when it was. My cousins come, but none of them speak to me.

At this point, I'm furious. I'm furious because I feel like they - my aunt in particular - have blown off my important life events and acted like I don't matter for the last time. I break down and talk to my dad at length about it, he says that she's just a horrible person, she won't ever change. 

Now my aunt starts posting on facebook with long tirades against atheists. I am an atheist, and she knows this. I do occasionally post things of a religious nature, but I am careful to use facebook lists to my advantage to only post the items for discussion purposes - but only for those who can handle it (she cannot so the list she is on is excluded from those posts).

My sister, who lives overseas, recently had a baby. She posts photos of the baby on facebook due to the fact that is the only way anyone can see him. My aunt downloads the photos of the baby, and reuploads them to her own facebook without my sister's knowledge. My sister has a history that involves stalkers and other nefarious things... and so she is very cautious with photos and privacy. My sister finds out about this, can't get my aunt to take them down, so she reports my aunt for stealing copyrighted content on facebook. My aunt's account gets disabled for something like a week as a result. My cousin immediately takes to social media and starts accusing me of being behind it and otherwise badmouthing me. At this point, I'm on my honeymoon - WHY would I be busy concerning myself with someone else's photos on facebook? My sister gets angry, gets in a fight with them all, and decides to block them all. My cousin then contacts my other sister and completely flies off the handle at her, saying that my aunt was hysterically crying about being blocked from facebook and how we were all being bitches.

It's at this point that I decide that I'm done with them all, too, especially my aunt. This is not normal behavior and after reading about narcissistic personality disorder I am convinced that she has it. I'm convinced that either her kids have it, or she has manipulated them to be like her little puppets carrying out her nastiness when she can't/won't do it herself. So I decide I just want to cut off all contact from all of them - they have been nothing but nasty to me, I've tried to ignore it and not get involved, but enough is enough. I block all of them on facebook. I use google voice, so I set all their numbers to get blocked (so they receive a 'this number is no longer available' message). I decide that I will do the bare minimum if I am forced to see them face to face at family gatherings, but that is it.

Then thanksgiving rolls around and my cousin goes so far as to pull the chairs away from the table that I am sitting at and arrange them around the other table so that none of them have to sit by me. This pisses me off greatly because it's just so incredibly CHILDLIKE - how can you not even be civil at THANKSGIVING?

Now I find myself loathing going to any family events. I don't want to be treated like shit. Now Easter is next weekend, and luckily my husband's family is having something at the same time and I'm already mentally preparing that ""sorry, can't go"" speech. But I feel awful doing this. My grandfather is in poor health, and I don't know how much longer he has. I shouldn't have to give up whatever time I have left with him because they treat me like garbage.

I just... I don't know what to do. Cutting off contact with them has been the best thing - I don't see the constant digs against me and my family on facebook. But I still have to deal with them face to face when we have family gatherings and I just don't know how to handle it. Part of me just wants to cut out that side of the family all together and never deal with any of them again. It makes me feel bad, it makes me stressed out. But I shouldn't have to do that - these are my grandparents, too - but that's how bad it is.

tldr; ... how do you handle narcissistic extended family members? and I'm seriously sorry about how long this is, just so much backstory..."

I'm also taking night classes twice a week, which in itself makes me lose hours at work, tightening my financial situation. After taking on the internship, I'll have to either take another 8-hour pay cut per week, or intern on a day I don't have work, effectively leaving me with one day off per week. It's already considerably difficult for me to have the energy for a social life as it is, and while I'm not at all a go-out-all-the-time type of person, I'm worried about spending the next two years in a state of exhaustion. Part of me knows that it'll only be for two years, and then I can go on and actually be a counselor full-time, but at the moment I'm very resistant.

There are a lot of things I like about my program/career choice: I find the material interesting, and I do believe that I would be a pretty good counselor, but...I just don't know if it's right for me. I deal with intermittent depression (which I'm seeing a therapist for), and some days in makes it difficult to tend to my own life, so I don't know that I want to deal with clients with their own problems throughout the day, every day. Counseling is a high-burnout career, and I'm not sure that I could give my clients the attention they need while still satisfying my own needs.

I do love psychology; I can't deny that at all. But what I love about it is the theorizing and the attempts to figure out why we do what we do, not necessarily the application of different theories. I tend to analyze and process things on a very high level (I dual majored in Philosophy as well as Psych, if that says anything about me), but honestly I get more jollies from ""figuring out"" a client's problem than actually seeing them solve it for themselves.

But if I do drop out of grad school...then I'm just a guy who works in retail, and that scares me.

**For those of you that PM'd me I will still get back to you but I am working hard on getting more plans going right now. Thank everyone for the comments!**

x/posting from r/confession because I feel that I really need to talk to someone about this. It's embarrassing and I just don't know how to feel anymore.

For nine years I haven't done anything at work. I started here and I was supposed to be assigned a supervisor; it just never happened. I befriended IT and learned about their systems. As I am technically savvy I bypass their security without a trace to look at porn, chat online, play video games, browse reddit / 4chan, etc. Sometimes when the weather is nice I put some excuse in my calendar (no one actually checks it anyway) and go for hour long walks.

Everyone likes me at work. The only time I do anything is when I help some of my co-workers on their late or personal projects. I am overqualified so sometimes I help the management understand projects that are over their heads. I probably do about 1-2 hours of work like this in any given month.

My problem: I started at an interns pay and got only one minor raise as a default. I can't ask for more money because it has to go through my supervisor, and I don't have one. If I bring this up I would be fired obviously, and rightfully so. This means that I bring home little money to my family. Legally I make just enough money that don't qualify for food stamps or government cheese, but my student loan payments bring my income to less than minimum wage.

I have used to say 'oh any time now I will work' but it has gone on and on to the point where I only have a vague feeling of what real work is like. I 'want' to find a real job but doing nothing every day is so comfortable. Since I have no alone time at home, 'work' has become my sanctuary of relaxation. I apply for jobs sometimes, asking for way too much money so no one ever calls me back.

I don't deserve this job. I don't deserve my family. I am a huge asshole. I don't even feel fit to be called a man. I am a slug personified. I am a human leech. I am a boil living on the back a maggot feeding on a first world country.

I just can't get off my fucking ass and get a real job."
1az8py,13,2013-03-25,Dear Riot; (Not a complaint),[deleted],leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1az8py/dear_riot_not_a_complaint/,"Your company has done more for me than I thought anything ever could.  League of Legends is an amazing game that is second only to the amazing company that produced it.  I'm really not sure how to word everything that I'm thinking.  It's hard to express what the game has done for me simply for the reason that it's a video game.  It's given me a medium, though, for my frustrations.  It's given me something fun to do with my wife that we both enjoy in our free time.  It's given me a place to talk with friends after a long day at college.  The only bad thing it's done is given me too high of expectations for other video games.  But that's okay, I don't really have time.
The game's even a step farther than just a game to me, and to many others.  I don't play this game just to win, like I do other games.  I watch the LCS games because the players are people living the dream.  I read all of the lore because the universe is so fantastically woven together.  I buy the skins because they're so doggone cute (or badass, pending on the champion).  And the company has not once made it all about the money.  League of Legends is one of, if not the biggest game in the world today.  Millions of people worldwide log on to the fields of justice to escape the mundane.  To be a giant monster of the void, destroying the hopes of their enemies.  To be a small Scout of the Mothership, tactfully and annoyingly assassinating their enemies.  Or my favorite: to be a pony in the forest, clopping through the river.  Everyone has their reasons for logging on.  Some don't even know why they do it anymore.  But they still do.  A player base that is so dedicated and some not even sure why.  And yet, Riot is still full of great people.
They're all about the player and community experience.  They're constantly trying to put out more content, make the community stronger, open themselves up to players to make the experience that much greater.  I believe Riot is one of the greatest companies in the world.  They may not be the most successful (though they are doing pretty damn good), but they truly care about their product and their consumers.  The company makes one of the most enjoyable games I've ever experienced, and for that reason I say thank you.  I've applied to be an intern with Riot, and even if I don't make it, I hope that one day I can contribute to this great entity that has become such a large part of my life.  So, I guess what this whole thing is trying to say is: Thanks Riot.  Keep up the good work, you're making everyone's lives that much better by doing so.

Sincerely,
One of your most loyal customers

I want to remind you about a great event this Tuesday, March 26. Gale Street Inn, 4914 N. Milwaukee, is hosting a joint fundraiser for Arts Alive 45 and the National Veterans Art Museum. 

For $25, attendees will enjoy appetizers, live music, games, cocktails, and prizes. Proceeds will help fund a new veterans mural. I hope to see you there. 
Dates Set for PB45 Project Expos 

As you may recall, I am using participatory budgeting to allocate $1 million of the $1.3 million in 2013 neighborhood capital improvement fund budget, commonly referred to as Aldermanic Menu Funds. The participatory budgeting process gives you the chance to have a major impact, at all stages, in what projects get built in our community. 

Last fall, I hosted six project brainstorming session where hundreds of you came and offered your ideas on what projects would improve our community. Dozens of volunteers from the community have researched those suggestions and have selected projects that will go on the ballot later this spring. 

Those projects include new playgrounds at Roberts Square and Independence parks, a bike lane on Milwaukee Avenue, decorative light poles on Irving Park Road, a dozen viaduct murals, and many other capital improvements. 

The next stage of the process is the project expos. These are science fair-style events where you can learn more about the project on the ballot, ask questions, and make suggestions. 

The project expos are: 
Tuesday, April 9, 7-9 pm, at Filament Theatre, 4041 N. Milwaukee; 
Thursday, April 11, 7-9 pm, at St. Constance Church, 5843 W. Strong; and 
Saturday, April 13, 10 am-2 pm, at Copernicus Center, 5216 W. Lawrence. 

After the expos, the volunteer committees will refine their proposals, and you will get to vote on what proposals receive funding. 

My office will host early voting Monday, April 29, through Friday, May 3, from 8 am to 6 pm, at 4754 N. Milwaukee. Residence also will be able to vote Saturday, May 4, and Sunday, May 5, at locations to be determined. 

All residents who live within the old or new ward boundaries and are 16 or older will get to vote for six projects. In addition, residents will be able to vote on what percentage of the $1 million is used for street repaving and sidewalk replacement. 

This is your chance to determine how we spend your tax dollars. You have the power in this process. I hope you'll make it to a project expo and vote later this spring. 
Benefit Concert Set for Tisdale Family 

I hope you'll be able to join me at the Portage Theater, 4050 N. Milwaukee, on Friday, April 5, at 7:30 pm for a benefit concert to raise money for the Tisdale family. 

The concert will feature the Beatles tribute band Yesterday. Tickets are $35 and are available at on line or at the Portage box office. 

As you likely recall, Dennis Tisdale and his wife were walking to their car at about 2 am March 3 near Milwaukee and Sunnyside. While crossing the street, a silver or gray SUV or sedan brushed up against them. Words were exchanged, and a man got out of the vehicle with a baseball bat. 

Dennis was struck with a baseball bat multiple times and was taken to Lutheran General Hospital in a coma. 

The father of four and veteran of the U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division is out of the hospital now. Members of the community have put together a fundraising page to help pay his expenses. Please consider giving whatever you can afford. 

16th District Police this week have released a sketch of the man they believe attacked Dennis. 

Police believe the man was between 25 and 32 years old, weighing between 160 and 180 pounds, about 5-foot, 7-inches, bald with a light complexion, and wearing a red hooded sweatshirt. 

Dennis and his family are parishioners at Our Lady of Victory Parish, and fellow parishioner Ald. Tim Cullerton has offered a $1,500 reward to anyone who can provide information that leads to an arrest and conviction in this crime. 

Anyone with information is urged to call police at (312) 744-8263. 
Improve Your Home Energy Efficiency 

Energy bills continue to increase, but there are ways to reduce your costs. 

On Monday, March 25, Energy Impact Illinois will host a seminar to show you what you can do to save energy at your home and what rebates are available to help pay for the work. The seminar is at 7 pm at the Copernicus Center, 5216 W. Lawrence. 

As an example, you'll get to see where my older Portage Park home leaks energy, as found during a recent energy assessment. They came to my home and offered energy saving tips to my neighbors and me, and I can tell you that the seminar is very informative. 

I hope to see you there. 
Provide a Student With a Work Study Opportunity 

LYDIA Urban Academy is looking for business owners and managers willing to make a direct impact in the life of a student by hosting them for a work study placement, or by sponsoring their placement with another community organization. 

The LYDIA Urban Academy work study program allows employers to help disadvantaged high school students pay for their education through meaningful employment or sponsorship, while at the same time retaining reliable entry-level help for their company. I've had a couple of LYDIA interns in my office last year and this year, and they have been outstanding. 

This is a unique opportunity to invest in a young person who is striving to succeed in life. The student will work 4 hours per week, after school. Instead of paying the student, the employer will make a tax-deductible contribution towards the student’s tuition. 

For more information please contact Karen Anderson at 773-653-2266 or via email. 
Free Tax Filing Assistance 

The Ladder Up Financial Liberation program is partnering with area colleges to help provide tax preparation services for free to individuals who earned less than $20,000 or families who earned less than $45,000 last year. 

The assistance is available at 13 sites in Chicago, including in Northeastern Illinois University Student Union, 5500 N. St. Louis, and Wright College, 4300 N. Narragansett. Each site is open from 8:30 am to 11:30 am every Saturday through April 13. 

Additionally, NEIU is open from 5:30-8:30 pm on Mondays in February, and the Wright College site is also open 3:30-8:30 pm on Wednesdays and Thursdays. 

Make sure to bring an original Social Security or ITIN card for everyone on the return, a photo i.d., all 2012 tax documents, and your 2011 tax return. 

For a full list of sites or more information, visit the Ladder Up website or call (312) 409-1555."

Interested in applications to neuroscience, biology in general, and finance. The only foreign university I can afford to is in Germany (applied for aid, and rejected almost everywhere in the US), and it's for a physics degree. Not math. 

I don't know if I can handle the long hours in the lab. A friend who went there told me that the labs are fucked up, instructions are poorly translated to English, and that minimal help is given. If you can't finish the lab in the time allocated, you're pretty much screwed. And if I spend my money on a bachelor's there, I'd be on my own for any further studies. But if I can find a job along the way, things should work out, and I could easily study for another 2 years for the master's.

Dad is in his mid-60s, mum is nearly 60 herself.

I also want to be a writer. I write some things. I've started a short story a few weeks ago, but I had zero motivation to complete it. I'm gonna re-start working today. 

I really want to go abroad because I've been more or less ""stuck"" in this place all my life. Going to the US or Germany would entail getting exposed to more people, a better education than here (although on paper, ""here"" is not that bad), and doing more living in general. Easy to imagine a scenario where I get a research gig in Berlin for the summer, and I do some crazy shit while I'm there. Or another summer, I visit my friend in London and we go nuts. 

If I do stay here, the foreseeable highlights of my life would be getting a research internship, reading comics, watching tv shows and Gintama, going clubbing every once in a while. Not much to write about, yeah? 

At this point, my line of thought is ""You aren't going to be in your early 20s ever again. (duh) High school sucked blue donkey balls. Why extend that another 3 years when you could go abroad, hopefully have some adventures, and I dunno, have sex?"" 

And if I do end up having to stay here, I am really, really tempted to use part of my ""college fund"" (~$6500) to go to Europe for a few months. We had this conversation yesterday, and my mother explicitly stated I could do what I wanted with that money. My parents really wants me to stay here. "

It's orphan season, and I fear that she might imprint some of the animals.

I feel uncomfortable with her new authority, but I don't know how to express my opinions as an intern. Any thoughts?"

I just wanted to see if I could get some advice. I am currently a student and only very recently changed my major over from physics to math with a focus in actuarial sciences. My GPA isn't great (2.6), but I'm working as hard as I can to bring that up and make up for some poor choices on my part. I'm hoping to have my exam P out of the way sometime this summer if all goes well. What I want to know is: What would be a decent way to build my credentials? I'm currently looking for internships, but having a hard time in my area.

I am looking through the subreddit for related information, so forgive me if this is redundant, I only just found it.
Thanks!"

I am completing my junior year of college, and I have an petroleum exploration internship lined up for when I graduate, so this is my last summer to waste away. I have roughly three thousand dollars saved up for a two month backpacking trip that will take place from July untill late August. 

During the first portion of my summer I am doing a geologic field camp where we travel through national parks in the USA doing field work, studying the regional and structural geology of the areas, and mapping projects which will last for six weeks. The entire time will be spent camping in the Badlands of Montana, Yellowstone National Park, and in Colorado. After that I will have from July to late August to backpack. 

I would like to start in the UK, go through France, then Spain, travel through Morroco, visit Greece, and end up in Istanbul, Turkey. I have no itinerary but I would like to spend at least two weeks in Turkey and two in Spain. On what budget could I accomplish this trip on? I may go with a friend, but I would like to do it solo. I speak fluent Spanish and passable French. This will be my first time travelling alone, so I need some pointers. Can I do the trip on my budget? Is hitchhiking safe (I am a 6'4"" 210 pound male), so I don't feel threatened? Have you ever done anything similar, and is there anything that you would recommend for me to seem? Thanks!"
1ayeqp,10,2013-03-25,What to do the summer after freshman year?,inviktis,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1ayeqp/what_to_do_the_summer_after_freshman_year/,"I am a freshman in a university located in Philadelphia and I'm feeling kind of paranoid that I won't be able to do anything over the summer. I'm in a school where resources for networking and internships are plentiful, but since I was pre-med and was instead focused on volunteering hours and shadowing physicians I never really utilized them. Now that I may be dropping pre-med and have no idea what to do with my life yet I'm kind of in a tough spot.


Internships are likely out of the question. I have had a job as a research assistant since September and would still consider doing additional research over the summer, but so far I've had no luck with that. Right now all I have is volunteering over the summer at a hospital and possibly an animal shelter, and I may be thinking about grabbing a summer job at a Best Buy or wherever I can improve professional communication skills with customers and people in general.


Any tips for a freshman?"

Last night, I went out with roommate for her birthday. When we got to the bar, heavily intoxicated white woman called me racist names regarding my Arab heritage and then it escalated to her striking me when I walked past her. I spoke with the bar/bouncer about it, and they wouldn't do anything other than to say to 'stay away from her'. But when walking by her again to get back to our table, she hit me in the face; so I defended myself. The response was for the 6'4 300+ Ib bouncer to pull me outside, threw me to the ground, and beat me up. My cell phone was a casualty of this battle.

Well, i'm a very broke social work graduate student and I use my phone for my internship (note: I work for free). My clients contact me via phone. I also use it for the organizing and fundraising work that I do for my clients as well. With the high cost of living in NYC, and working for free, my resources are already very exhausted, and I don't want my clients to suffer because of all of this.
I'm looking for anyone that may have anything to spare to help out. If you could donate anything at all, it would be incredibly helpful. Below is my paypal account email.

Also, if you think that you know someone that could be helpful, please pass this along. Thank you very much for your help.

2) I worked from May - August in Chicago,IL as an intern at a company earning $24,000. 

Now how do I file my state taxes? People are asking me to claim tax credits in Michigan but somehow no one knows how to go about doing so. Tried going to tax advisors but they can't help as I am a non resident and they don't deal with internationals (lack of experience maybe)

1ay4rk,36,2013-03-24,My TL;DR of Budget 2013,illskillz,CanadaPolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaPolitics/comments/1ay4rk/my_tldr_of_budget_2013/,"I thought I'd post this in this subreddit as well this year as usually better discussion is generated here!

I recommend reading Federal Budget 2013 in full as it is the one action plan our government sets out each year. I think we all have an obligation to read it - http://www.budget.gc.ca/2013/doc/plan/toc-tdm-eng.html. However, this TL;DR is the next best thing ;)

Just remember, the budget itself lauds the (conservative) government. I have tried my best to remain unbiased by giving an accurate representation of the budget &amp; it's claims (not a fair representation of all points of view/arguments/criticisms). The budget doesn't criticize itself.


**Budget Thesis**

This budget helps ensure we remain on track to balance the budget by 2015-16 by controlling direct program spending while not raising taxes or cutting transfers to persons/governments. Canada remains in the strongest fiscal position of all G7 countries. 950k net jobs have been created since the recession (5.7% increase) and 1.5 million net jobs have been created since 2006 (9.2% increase) - the best of all G7 countries. We are also the only G7 country that has more than fully recovered from business investment loss since the recession. But there remain challenges, particularly modest U.S economic growth and the euro recession. While controlling program spending, we seek to promote job growth by taking action to ensure that Canadians have the right skills for the jobs that need to be filled.

Canada is expected to maintain by far the lowest net debt to gdp ratio of all g7 countries until at least 2017


**Jobs &amp; Manufacturing**

Create canada job grant (500m/y) to get canadians the right skills training for jobs. Businesses with a plan to train canadians for an existing or better job will be eligible to apply for the canadian job grant. It will provide access to a maximum federal contribution of $5000/person towards training. Canadian job grant funding will also be provided to the provinces and territories and will comprise 300m of the 1.95b funding of the respective labour market agreements. Grant could provide up to $15000 per person if provinicial and employer contributions are added. Federal funding must be matched by both the province and the employer.

124.9 million for a bridge between Nuns islands and the Island of Montreal

25m over 3y for the new detroit-windsor initiative


**Trade**

Lower prices for crude oil &amp; nat gas are reducing our gdp by 28b/year which would result 4b/year in government revenue
Since 2006, canada's export of goods to the u.s have decreased 5.7%. exports have increased by 57% to asia, 31 % to europe  and 36% to the rest of the world. canada will need to continue growing these export markets to foster economic growth.

Commodity prices have increase 4% since the fall update. both global crude oil prices &amp; prices of base metals have gained ground due to solid demand from emerging economies. canada has not reaped the benefits of these increases (particularly crude oil) since we rely so strongly on the U.S market to export to.

Overall prices received by canadian crude oil producers are no 6.5% lower than at the time of the fall update although the WTI price is up 5.4%.

To further the Beyond the border action plan, Canada will upgrade border infrastructure at various ports of crossing. 

Canada will also increase access to the FAST and NEXUS programs

Reform canada's temporary foreign worker program to

1. Ensure that these workers are only used when Canadians cannot fill these jobs

 2. Require employers to increase recruitment efforts before relying on it 

3. Require employers to have a plan in which they will trasnfer over to a Canadian workforce over time. 

4. Ensure employers will no longer able to list fluency of a non-official language as a job requirement if they are using this program

Close tax loopholes by: (see page 269-270 for full list)

1. Further limiting the amount of Canadian profits that can be distributed to non-residents as 'interest payments'
 
2. Enhancing corporate anti-loss rules 

3. Ensuring that derivative transactions cannot be used to convert fully taxable ordinary income into capital gains taxed at a lower rate.

4. Eliminating unintended tax benefits relating to leveraged insured annuities &amp; arrangements

5. Withholding GST/HST refunds to businesses that haven't provided CRA with necessary information 

6. Criminalize use and sale of software designed to help commit tax evasion. Closing of these loopholes will generate an additional 1.2b annually by 2017-18

Require financial intermediaries to report EFT's of $10000 or more to the CRA to help avoid tax evasion

Increase lifetime capital gains exemption to $800,000 and index to inflation

We will continue to push for a canadian securities regulator. If we cannot come to an agreement with the provinces, we will introduce legislation that will enable us to fulfill out regulatory responsibilities as decided by the Supreme Court. It would be much more effective if we had a national securities regulator, as all other industrialized countries have. But we will implement reforms designed to monitor, prevent &amp; respond to systematic risk in capital markets regardless of whether or not a national securities regulator is established.

Since 2006, canada's export of goods to the u.s have decreased 5.7%. exports have increased by 57% to asia, 31 % to europe  and 36% to the rest of the world. canada will need to continue growing these export markets to foster economic growth.

Commodity prices have increase 4% since the fall update. both global crude oil prices &amp; prices of base metals have gained ground due to solid demand from emerging economies. canada has not reaped the benefits of these increases (particularly crude oil) since we rely so strongly on the U.S market to export to.

The IT guy  hasn't set up my computer (I work from my own personal laptop) and my company email. This makes me feel disposable and unappreciated at the company.

So I have decided that I want to major in some type of engineering (not sure what type just yet). But anyway, throughout high school, I worked pretty hard and got a pretty good GPA and great SAT score. I was accepted into Pitt's engineering school and the honors college. Unfortunately, I did not get any merit scholarships. 

For a state school, Pitt is pretty expensive at around 30k a year. Without a scholarship, and i am assuming won't get that much from outside scholarship sources, the price has become my biggest concern about college.

To make matters worse, my parents did not save up a college fund for me, and cannot consign on a loan because they hope to move and buy a house in a few years.  

So I would need to pay for college basically on my own. My question is, is community college a viable option for someone looking into engineering?  Does anyone have expiernece with community college then transferring to a 4 year university? We're you able to find internships while at community college? 

Any advice is welcome. Thank you"

I've been working as a developer for the same employer for about 15 years now, and it's been great, but the environment is changing and it's time for me to think about moving on.

I think I know my stuff on the technical side, but I was lucky enough to get offered a job straight out of college by the group I was already working for as a student, and so, well, I'm pretty damn clueless about job hunting.  I was wondering if anybody would mind giving me feedback on my [resume](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/16248778/johnsmithresume.pdf).

There were a few things in particular I was wondering about:

1. For the last two lines of my Skills section, I included some languages/frameworks that I have experience with, but that I'm not particularly interested in.  I included them because otherwise I feel like I might come across as sort of a one-trick pony, and I wanted to show that I'm at least a *little* better rounded.  Should I get rid of them?

2. For my title, I put ""Lead Programmer"" even though I don't officially have that title (for bizarre bureaucratic reasons I never understood, everybody here has to have the same, utterly non-descriptive title).  I described myself as a lead programmer because I was, until recently, in charge of another full-time programmer and several interns.  They've all since left (part of the changing environment I mentioned), so for the moment it's just me.  We're trying to hire another programmer for what used to be my team, and there's also another developer here, but he works on unrelated projects.  Is that title appropriate?  For that matter, I'm really a hands-on kind of guy, and not really looking to climb too high up the management ladder -- a small team is fine, but I want to do actual coding, and I definitely wouldn't mind working under someone if the job is good.  Is the title a bad idea for that reason?

3. I also split my job into two separate entries, ""Lead Programmer"" and ""Database Administrator.""  Even though there's really only one job, those responsibilities are almost totally separate, and I thought they were both important enough to be highlighted.  Is that appropriate, or just confusing?

4. Any cosmetic issues?  Is the font, layout, and spacing okay?  Any other advice you could give me would be great too!

Thanks!"

So, things went to be as expected. Me and her are no longer dating each other (Been 1 month now). The reason for the breakup is that she wants to pursue her career more than a relationship.

I get completely destroyed when I see her so happy after ending our relationship. Keep in mind, I am all for her happiness and am totally with her on her career choice before a relationship but I believe you should be able to do both (which I can say is not easy to do because of the fact of what she is trying to pursue, cannot give any details as it would be obvious to whom I'm talking about).

All in the end, I feel depressed, I see her updates on facebook and have such a huge heart that I feel like i'm about to break down every second I see her as all the memories I've had with her flashes before my eyes. I know that she is the one for me, I just know it. But I cannot for the life of me be selfish and tell her what she is doing is wrong and she should pursue a relationship with me, because that would make me an idiot. She can easily help this world in the long run if she really put her mind to it, and recently she got accepted to a intern position (international) at a place she REALLY wanted to be at.

I know I should be minding my space, leaving her alone, but the words roll out of my mouth so naturally. I love her, very much. :(

Hopefully somebody can give me decent advice, because me playing games only helps the pain I feel slightly.

**TLDR: I still love her very much.**"

1b29pd,0,2013-03-26,Switching co-op (internship) positions: bad idea?  ,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1b29pd/switching_coop_internship_positions_bad_idea/,"Hey r/engineering, 

I'm a mechanical engineering student currently doing my first co-op rotation with a chemical company, and so far it's been a fantastic learning experience.  My managers are great, and I work really hard to make sure that they (along with the company as a whole) are 100% satisfied with my results.  

However, despite the positive experience I've had with the company, I've come to realize that the chemical industry isn't really where my interests lie as a prospective mechanical engineer.  My interests lie in the dynamic systems aspects of ME (controls, mechatronics, etc) rather than the thermo-fluid aspects of ME.  

The co-op office at my college expects me to stay all three rotations with this chemical company, but I know that I'll be miserable if I'm forced to stay with this company for two more rotations, since I'm not exposed to the fields of ME that I'm truly interested in.  Additionally, if I *do* stay with the chemical company for the rest of my co-op rotations, I'll have an easier time finding a job with other chemical companies and a harder time finding a job related to dynamic systems, mechatronics, controls, vibrations, etc (which truly appeal to me).  

So my question is this:  should I quit my current co-op position after completing my rotation with the chemical company, and then apply for a position that I'm more interested in for my next rotation?  Or should I just tough it out and work with the chemical company for two more rotations?  These days, I feel that *any* college student who gets *any* internship is extremely lucky.  Is it a bad idea for me to just throw that away?  Am I acting spoiled/entitled by wanting a co-op position more aligned with my ME interests?  

An important note:  I can't apply for a new co-op position unless I resign from my current position.  I don't want to be a douche and apply for a different co-op position while I'm in the middle of one already.  However, if I wait too long, there's a chance that I won't find a new co-op at all by the Fall (when my second rotation would begin), which means I'd be in a bit of trouble.

I looked in the sidebar and saw boots, but none that were steel-toed.

I do everything; front end, back end, technical support, training, customer relations. Everything. My duties are, basically, the same as they were when I was an intern, and are the same as my peers in almost every aspect. It's a pretty relaxed environment, jeans and t-shirt kind of place. I really like it. But there is zero room for growth. Hypothetically, if I were still here in 10 years I'd be doing exactly what I'm doing now. Half of the employees still use a dead language I've never heard of until I started here.


I just applied to a company I already interviewed with months ago, and I was certain I was going to get the job until at the last minute they couldn't afford someone new at the time. This is a Tier II internal help desk role. It's quite the jump backwards on the proverbial corporate ladder, and a lot less responsibility (though frankly that's okay with me).

I'm pretty underpaid where I am now, so I'd imagine this new job will probably pay the same, and have room for actual advancement in the future. Do you guys think it would be wise to do it, or stay where I am now and get more experience as a full on developer, even though it's not great experience because I don't have a mentor or anything?"

In 2008 I graduated with a BA in Math and Economics, and could not find a job in business during the financial apocalypse, despite having decent grades and great internship and extracurricular experience. 

I decided to pursue a craft I am passionate about (rather than slaving away in a mediocre position as the financial collapse surrounded me in NYC) and trained to become a chef. I worked like crazy and rose through the ranks to work at a three Michelin star restaurant and a few other fantastic, top rated, intense places.

I moved out of NYC, and in my free time dedicate a great deal of time to independent research projects. For example, a restaurant I worked at was slow for a season and the owner was unsure how to attract more business. 

I noted that our website was insanely out of date, and there was no online marketing strategy whatsoever. I compiled a research report of all James Beard award winning restaurants for our region and their marketing strategy, and how they used their website and various online resources to reach out to more customers. 

I made a mock up version of the website, and sourced a web designer to deliver the site for a very reasonable rate. Mr. Owner didn't bite (he barely knew how to use a cellphone so this was way above his head), but it is a good example of how I approach a problem.

I am currently taking [Model Thinking](https://www.coursera.org/course/modelthinking) and [Passion Driven Statistics](https://www.coursera.org/course/pdstatistics) to strengthen my background in statistics. I'd like to apply the information I learn in these courses to using data to help support research, so the next step would be to work on a few projects.

Thank you for taking the time to read about my experience! I'm interested for feedback from anyone in the Business Intelligence field as to whether my background seems to ""fit in"" anywhere. I greatly appreciate any feedback or discussion!

** UDATE 1 YEAR LATER **
Thank you everyone for your advice. I got a job in the analytics department of a market research company. In the past year I've learned R (mid-advanced level - writing custom packages, visualization, modeling, etc), got a decent foundation for data analysis, and will start for my MS in Business Analytics this fall. The first classes I'm taking are project management and SQL. On my way!"

I'm in my final semester as a CompSci undergrad, and I am an intern at, and have accepted an offer from a medium sized, agile, Software as a Service company.  I've only participated briefly in two game development projects, one, the Battle for Wesnoth where I mostly lurked, but submitted one patch, and another a small failed fan game project.

I'm writing this because I'm currently a few months into a slightly serious game development project, and using practices that I feel aren't used, but should be, in game development.  I'd like to know if I'm completely wrong, in thinking this, or why people use the practices that they do.

* Test Driven Development:

Do you, or any game development companies use test driven, or behavior driven development?  As a gamer, I've always been frustrated when bugs crop up, especially ones that I would feel would be easily testable.  I have personal experience in how hard it is to test front ends, but calculations and corner cases seem like they'd be perfect places for TDD and regression testing.

* Open Source:

I understand many developers are looking to make money with a game, and that open source doesn't make sense for paid for games, and even free to play, software as a service like games.  However, I've noticed and experienced that many fan game development projects, and mod teams are fearful of open source, even though they have little to no chance of monetizing the work they've done.  Why is this?  Is it only because they want to make sure they're credited for their work, or are there other reasons?  To me, it feels laughable that these types of projects aren't open source.

* Agile:

Do any small dev teams use agile, or do you follow a traditional, waterfall method of development?  Do people know of agile, or have tried it in game development?  The majority of the small team I was on for the fan game were still in college, and had never heard of agile.  I was kind of shocked to see how disorganized everything was and discussing them.

I'd love to hear how everyone goes about completing projects, and if you've heard or tried of any of these terms or not.  I'm especially looking forward to reasons why all or any of these things don't work in game development."

I've come to the realization that over the years I've achieved very little and became very depressed over it. Other than the degree I'll be receiving, I'm not sure what else I have to show for my past five years.

* I'm graduating with a low GPA. My entire academic experience was an ordeal. I've struggled to not fail out of school the first two years, the next two to maintain a passing grade, and finally I took an extra year to complete any missing requirements. A regular day consists of going to class, then home to study. If I'm behind in the course, I stop going in order to catch up. During my final year, despite the easier difficulty of the courses I'm taking and very light course load, I'm still performing below average/expectations. I'll have to perform (possibly unrealistically well) on my final exams to hopefully mitigate the damage done to my GPA.
* While struggling with school, I  tried dedicate as much time as I had into focusing on school. So I made minimal impact on my social networking life and career goals. I've made friends here and there but none of them are really people I see outside of school or share hobbies with. I occasionally meet up with my friends for a meal, but that's about the extent of it. I heard it only gets hard to expand your social circle once you're out of college. If it's anything like high school, I expect to lose touch with a lot of people when everyone take's their own directions. 
* I dont think I want to pursue a career in engineering, the outlook in my discipline looks very bleak. It seems to appear spending my 9am-5pm every weekday in front of a computer and I'm not even confident of my ability. Furthermore, I have no academic honors, no job lined up, no work experience, no internships,  and no club involvement. I predict if i do pursue to look for a (the right) job in my field, it will take months and I'm not sure if I want to do so.
* I'm not sure what direction to take now. I think I want to take a break and maybe travel a bit, but I dont think that will happen. Tentatively, I think I'll prepare a resume and begin looking for a job in engineering which will take months. In that time, I'll pursue a few small personal goals and try to find a part time retail job to fill in the void. Experience has taught me the latter was very difficult, I've only be able to find seasonal positions. I honestly don't think this tentative direction I plan on taking will lead me to happiness.

Anyways, it feels a bit better to get this off my chest. I'm hoping Reddit can point me into the right direction into what I could be doing."

1b1za8,34,2013-03-26,Ending the dream,endingthedream,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1b1za8/ending_the_dream/,"Hey leaves,

This is a lot to get off my shoulders so I'll have you know now that it'll be a long read. I'm writing this mostly for myself, to organize my thoughts and strengthen my resolve by being accountable to this post. But if you're trying to quit... if you're thinking about quitting, you will find something, I promise.

I am now 24 years old. I have a decent office job, a place in the big city, and a girlfriend whom I cherish. I live close to my best friends and the things I love to do. 

And yet, I am crushingly unhappy. 

I've been smoking weed since I was 17. It all started one summer in high school in an old drainage ditch. It was still fun and games, until I decided to transfer sophomore year of college to a school across the nation in the northeast (I'm from southern california). There, I couldn't handle the long, frozen winters and totally new social environment and became very stressed. I remember the first night I justified smoking for that reason; I was stressing over the fact that I came to a very expensive private school and wasn't making full use of it. I was throwing my dad's hard earned money away, and the guilt was ravaging me. I should have taken that anger, that energy, and turned it into something positive. Instead, I chose to smother it. 

And so it began, the dream. I started smoking every night in the dorms with a friend that sophomore year to pass the dark and cold winter. Spring came and I didn't stop. In the fall before, before I had started smoking heavily, I'd been pretty social, going to a good amount of parties and trysting with a few ladies. Well, that never happened more than once a semester from that point forward.

For the rest of college I lived that dream. While the rest of my classmates started growing up, scoring internships and getting all that party out of their system, I just chugged by at a dismal pace scoring B minuses and barely graduating. In retrospect, I totally wasted my college years. I was at a prestigious private school and all I could do was balk at the lack of ""chill"" weed smokers, and became a shut-in. I continued to smother my problems and issues in pot, right up until the day I graduated.

Somehow I still got a decent job. It's not what I want to be doing for the rest of my life but it pays pretty well and it's fairly interesting (internet marketing analytics). I came back to socal and established my life here, got back with my old girl. That first year back, I also got a medical card.

Things quickly went from bad to worse. I used that salary to fund a true smoking problem, buying my own scientific glass and top-shelf buds. I probably don't need to tell you that I performed poorly at my job. I would go in late stoned, smoke in my car during lunch, and socialize with nobody for weeks at a time. I was brought on under the pretense that I was entrepreneurial, independent and opportunity seeking; when the company realized that wasn't happening, I was laid off.

Now, this is the first time I found r/leaves and got the idea that things need to change big time. That was the year I also discovered reddit and trees in my 9 hours of doing nothing at work daily. When I got the job news I didn't smoke for one night and tried to shape up. I almost got there to sustained abstinence, but then something else happened: I got another job doing the same shit at a different company. So my sense of security came back, and as sure as can be I fell back into the old routines. 

Holy shit this is getting long, I'm sorry guys if you actually read up till here. It'll come to a head very soon.

Yesterday, it finally happened. My girlfriend and I have been fighting for a while now. It all blew up in my face as she told it to me straight. That she was sick and tired of my inability to regulate. That she thought it was pathetic that I couldn't go a night without a puff. That she had been losing attraction to me for some time as a result of my moody stoner behavior. 

Now this girl isn't a straight edge by a longshot. She was a sorority girl at uc berkeley and did quite the many drugs. For the first year of me being back, she was content to spend our weekends stoned, watching shows, eating and sleeping together. The problem is that, that didn't change. Even as she dropped hints of growing up, changing things, maybe going on a romantic trip together, I was content to just stay put like weed smokers so often are. While I bought her meals, presents, etc., I never really went out of my way to do anything except smoke and sleep together on weekends

But yesterday, as I fought with her for the countless time because of my post-work weed-craving irritable state, she told me she was tired of it all. That I simply was not worth it to her and she is thinking about just taking a break for a while. Now, I'm no fool when it comes to relationships and I know exactly what that means. Guys, I've been slapped in the face. It was here and then I realized that unless I stop now, the problems will only get worse.

I'm tired of it all guys. I'm tired of having my mood so dependent on this external thing, this plant. I'm tired of having to plan my day around getting high, of having to worry about when my next pickup is or if I have a little nug on me. I'm tired of not being able to connect with people and viewing them through a constant foggy glass. 

I'm tired of having my potential and future screwed because I can't cope with a little stress. I'm tired of constantly being blunt and apathetic, and people seeing that as who I am. I'm tired of having no motivation and falling behind my friends.

I truly feel like I have forgotten who I am at this point. My identity and personality is so fused with being high that they are one at the same. I don't know who I am, what I want or where I'm going. That needs to change.

TLDR; Been smoking for 7 years now through college, almost lost my job last year, am in the process of losing my girlfriend, realized I need to quit to get my life back in shape. 

Tonight, I have some melatonin and xanax. I know it's not good to replace one drug with another but I have a feeling that tonight will be the worst. Thanks for reading guys and good luck with your battles.

UPDATE: Day 3. It's getting a little better... can't eat much but I slept a little last night. Will make a week 1 post. cheers."

Will this narrow down prospective employers?,Ryality,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1b1z4a/am_i_spending_too_much_time_in_aerospace/,"Background:Last summer I worked with a professor at my university in a wind tunnel lab. I didn't have any prospective internships at the time so instead of wasting a summer I thought that it would be a good opportunity to get a taste of Aerospace engineering. 

Currently: I've been working with him for about a year now and I've come to realize that this just isn't working out. Maybe its the work that he's given me, but I simply don't have a passion in this field. As a result, I've tried to distance myself and try to get a taste of other fields like energy and robotics. I've applied to a lot of internships for this summer, but I haven't heard back from any of them. I starting to get scared that I won't have any opportunities for this summer. Heres the problem, my professor recently told me about an opportunity where I'll work with him again this summer, but this time I'll be getting paid a pretty substantial amount for 2 month's worth of work, full time and it'll be in the field of research as usual. Since I have extensive work with this professor I feel that the chances that I'll get this are pretty good especially since he's sitting on the committee that'll be selecting individuals for this opportunity. 

I don't know what to do. Should I continue to work with him just to have something to do over the summer? "

Trying to get into this Utility company for three years now- I now have an opportunity to take an engineering technician ( electrical technician work in said utility providing electric/gas )  job which pays about the same but the benefits are better. I’m thinking that this is the only way I can get into an engineering role in the long run. They also pay for a masters. The job is kind of an advanced electrician I suppose because ill be working in power plants and playing with heavy industrial stuff ( not residential wiring)

This is an anonymous account so I’ll say what I feel. I think that im over qualified for this job since it “prefers” a 2 year associates in lieu of no work experience. I have a bachelors , 2 internships in software and almost 2 years in a more advanced role. I think Im downgrading and this could hurt me in the long run. 

Have any of you gone this route? Started at technician level with a bachelors and then moved up? Or has any of you downgraded for any reason from a “better job”? my current workplace has 100 employees and there is no movement up the ladder since everyone has been here for 15+ years. They’ll have to die before i get promoted.

TLDR: Trying to start from scratch so I can move into another industry as an engineer except I'm not sure if this will work out

Just got a job (temporary internship, but still something!!), mixing up my workouts, fitting into clothes that were too tight a few months ago, etc. 

The most important thing about me losing weight right now versus last summer is that last summer I was so focused on losing weight that I completely cut out alcohol, had absolutely no cheat days, etc. I would sometimes even avoid hanging out with friends because the temptation to eat/drink would be so intense, and it's easier to just avoid that. Then, when I moved across the country for a job after getting down to 127 pounds, I started my drinking back up (and my tolerance hadn't even gone down, annoying) and lots of eating out/unhealthy. I stopped exercising because I was exhausted from working. I gained back everything and then some.

Now, however, I pretty much drink and cheat on my diet every weekend. I'm sure I could get faster progress if I didn't, but I don't want this to be a temporary thing like last time - it has to be a permanent change, and in order for that to work, I need to learn how to balance my social life and my health/diet. I think I'm doing a pretty good job of that now.

As for exercising, I'm too interested in everything, so I've been sporadically lifting, doing Tabata sprints and hill sprints, and doing long runs (10.5 mi this past weekend). I'd also like to try pole fitness, but for now I think I need to slooooow down and focus on just a few things before I spread myself too thin, otherwise I won't be able to hit my goals in weight lifting and running (body weight squats/half-marathon). My new job has a gym with barbells (!!) so I'm going to try to get in some weight lifting during lunch, and maybe some HIIT during shorter breaks on the stationary bikes.

Final note, it's amazing what eating right and exercising can do for your self-confidence and mood. I'm happy. That's the best part :)

Female
Age 21
5'5""
191 lbs
Have a fear of reaching 200 lbs. For some reason that just seems like the point of no return.
About a year ago I started losing weight for the first time ever, starting at 191 lbs. I lost almost 20 pounds running three times a week (c25k), keeping track of my calories (shooting for 1200/day), and not really drinking anything besides water. The very strict calorie limit also had a tendency to make me a fairly mean, angry person.

Then I turned 21 and didn't realize how many calories were in alcohol. I *almost* became an alcoholic. I dropped the no soda rule and drank a lot of rum and cokes.

The semester ended, I went on an internship, and I had trouble adjusting my low-calorie diet to the pattern of cooking for myself, going out for lunch with coworkers, and finding time to run. It didn't help that I was in Colorado, and lots of smoke from the fires there made it too hard to breath for running on some days. I did fairly well at the end of the summer when the fires were dying down, but I was still back up to 180 pounds.

Got back to school, started lifting weights, which made me want to eat a lot more. Got into the habit of doing so, which was fine until I stopped lifting weights.

Now I'm right back where I started. 191 lbs. Ugh.

I'm going to need to be on a more sustainable lifestyle plan if I'm going to do well this time, so I have a few guidelines to start:
-One soda a week, on Saturday during pizza night.
-Reduce slices of pizza on pizza night.
-Otherwise, drinks are water or coffee, but for coffee I must know exactly how much creamer and sugar is in it.
-I'll make my own breakfast/lunch/dinner, and have a general idea of the caloric content of my food, even if it isn't exact.
-Running 3x a week. Sign up for another 5k event.
-Bodyweight workouts or weight lifting 2x/week. It doesn't have to be long, but it has to be something.
-Try to eat less carbs (not eliminating altogether). Just not eating Korean takeout five times a week should help with this."
1b1hn6,24,2013-03-26,Campfire Stories: Brian,tridentposeidon,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1b1hn6/campfire_stories_brian/,"So here I am, near the tail end of my national park road-trip across the states, in what is arguably the most beautiful park of them all, Yellowstone. I just recently graduated out of the University of Pennsylvania with a major in biochemistry, and I had landed an extremely well-paying job, but I wasn't due for six more months. How do I spend my time? I am kind of a loner, and besides, the few friends I have are spread far and few across the country busy finding and securing jobs for themselves.  So after some planning, I found myself starting the road-trip with a beat-up Mazda Protégé and a thousand dollars of cash.

4 months later, here I am, in Yellowstone with no friends or family, just a backpack and boots. I call it a day when I see that the sun is halfway to the horizon, and I head back to my camp spot. Sure, I could try to climb this ledge for a little longer, but the nighttime bear killing stories just give me the creeps. I sit down next to my tent and take a bite out of my Granola bar, staring contently at the vast milky swathes of stars that stretch across my entire vision. Suddenly, I hear some yelling in my direction, ""Hey man with the bar! Yea you, wanna join us for some dinner?"" I squint in the direction where the voice came from and see a group of about a dozen people beckoning me over. Sighing, I get up and trudge over. This better be worth it. 

It is quite a diverse group, with people of all ages and colors. One of the people must have seen my confused expression so he explained, ""Haha naw, we are not all together, me and my wife Jenny over here just called everyone in this area together for some good old campfire fun. The name is Brian. What's your name?"" ""Kent, I replied, sitting down on one of the chairs that Brian pulled over. We ate and made small talk a little, and I got to know the group very well in just 20 minutes. 

There was Brian and Jennifer, high school sweethearts from Texas who met each other when Brian recently took up a job in a dentist's office. They soon married after that, and they decided to take a trip to Yellowstone to ""witness the outdoors"". There was Cooper, a National Geographic wildlife photographer intern, who well, came here to photograph animals. Andrew and his best bud Ethan were recent graduates from Cambridge who like me, came here to kill time. August was a veteran camper, who now at the ripe age of 66 had claimed to climbing Mt. Everest just last year. Yeah right, that geezer is just pulling our strings.  Then there was the group of five; Naomi, Tyler, Russel, Kevin, and Sunny, all neighborhood friends from Frisco who needed some adventure and outdoors in their life. Then there is Chris, a heavy built black guy who plays football for his college. He lives just an hour's drive from Yellowstone, and yet this is the first time he has ever visited. Last and most definitely least, was me. 

""So let's get cracking then, shall we!"" exclaimed Brian, with a cheesy smile plastered across his face. ""It's story time! Rules are simple; the story has to be real, it doesn't have to be your story, maybe something a friend or family member once told you. Oh, but one thing is for sure; it has to be scary. So who's first?"" Brian said, scanning the group. How bout the new kid? He said smiling, looking at me. ""Um, sorry, I am a good story creator but I am a lousy story teller. Pass"", I said awkwardly. ""Well then, I will go first”, Brian replied. “Story is short, but good”. “Short and sweet?!” muttered Chris. “More like short and fucked up,” scoffed Brian. “Alright here is why you never sleep in shady motels at night:

It was my junior year of high school, spring break, so mah three best friends and I decided to lose our alcohol virginity. We drove off quite a safe distance from town, and cracked open the beer. Coors Light, if I remember correctly. Anyways, we drunk, played around, and played truth-or-dare for 3 hours. It was about 2 AM when we stopped. I was so drunk; I was seeing 12 people instead of 3. Imagine that! 4 of each of my friends! So Randall, the least drunk of us all, threw us into his car and decided to crash us in a motel for the night. We stopped at the first one we saw, a shanty thing with just 25 rooms total and about 7 light bulbs that worked. Ha! We paid the receptionist and stumbled into our separate room. I slowly fell into a dull sleep.

 I woke up suddenly at around 4:30 AM. I don’t know what woke me up so I stupidly scanned the room, looking for what might have disturbed me. That’s when I saw it. A figure was shambling around the room, or should I say 4 figures, since I was still seeing in fours. The bathroom light was on at the far end, and Travis, one of my buds was not to be seen in the sleeping bag. Figured it must be him who was wandering around. I cursed at Travis for keeping the light on. My throat was parched so I groped around in my pack for some water. Shit. I left it in the car. “Yo Travis, imma get Randall’s keys and get me some water yea?” Travis didn’t reply, he just paced around the room muttering, looking for something. I took Randall’s keys off the table and stumbled out into the cool night air. Taking a grateful whiff, I fumbled with the keys at Randall’s car. Finally, the damn thing opened and I crashed inside. I found the water and drunk it was fast as I could. Shit, this water tastes weird I thought. Looking down at it, I realized it was the Coors Light. Dammit. I started to fell sleepy, so I closed the door and slept soundly.

I woke up to sirens and rapping at my door. I blearily opened my eyes, staring at a fat walrus of a man in a police uniform. I was scared; I was underage. However he didn’t seem concerned with the bottle in my hand. His expression was grave. “Son, I need you to identify some, uh, people for me.” He led me into our room, and I threw up right there. The stench of blood was just too strong. Hanging by the two light fixtures were Randall and Logan, all with a drunken glaze in their eyes. And in the bathroom, oh Travis! It looked like he tried to fight, and he failed. Horribly. His face was peeled off and was placed in his hands. His left leg was in two pieces, one piece resting against the toilet. A huge butcher’s knife protruded out of his chest. It was too much. My best friends. All of them, killed, just like that. “We looked into the motel security cameras kid,” continued the cop, “Well here is the weird part. Lobby security shows you four walking in to get book a room. Then we switched to room security, and at 2:15 AM, you opened the door to your room, and five people walked in. Five. We don’t know where the other one came from and we can’t find him now. We are really sorry, we truly are”.

Brian pulled back and sat on a log, tears now streaming down his face. “And that is why you never stop at a run-down motel for the night”. Whose story is up next?

Recently, my teacher and several of the editors have prospected that I would be a perfect fit to be the editor-in-chief next year. Journalism has been a field I'm passionate about, and the plans I had for my school's paper included actual reporting (instead of being my school's PR firm) and setting a precedent for the quality of the newspaper, since my newspaper mainly consists of horoscopes and spotlighting on single students.

Last week, the editor-in-chief announced that the paper's new editor-in-chief for next year was someone who has editorialized all her articles this year, which I had to edit the shit out of. The justification for letting her become editor-in-chief? She spent more years on the paper. The plans she has for next year includes expanding the 'boredom buster' page, and focusing more on school sports.

 I should already let go of the bitterness I have about this, but the direction of the paper for next year is the same as every year; nowhere. I'm thinking of working my ass even more during newspaper production (editing more articles and newspaper layout), talking about my blogging/writing experience ( I blog for the HuffPo; extremely biased, but it's still relevant), and my writing internship in New York this summer, in order to show that I am qualified for the job.

Should I suck it up and just become the news editor, or try to convince to the current editor-in-chief that I am fit to do the job?"

It reminded of just how important having a job, *any job*, is as early as you can.

Here's the thing.  Your teachers, instructors, coaches, etc, they've all agreed to be babysitters.  They'll guide you, hold your hand, comfort you when life sucks (for the most part, some are pretty bad at it).  Also, they'll often take a an active role of stepping in when you're slacking.  

Any boss you have?  They won't want to be your babysitter.  They won't want to keep track of your progress and let you know when you're not doing exactly what they need.   They'll want to tell you how to do something once and then want you do it.  

They'll answer questions, sure, but often they are so busy with their own work, they don't want to keep tabs on you.

An example.  I work in an office, and the son of a client wanted to intern for our department (ie, work for free to get college credit while gaining ""real world"" experience).   Hiring him was a good move for my company, because his dad was the client, and it would make business with this guy easier. 

This guy was 19, and he had two previous jobs on his resume, working in his aunt's store and being a camp counselor.  And, it turns out this this guy was a good worker.  He listened to what I told him to do, asked a bunch of questions, and learned.  Most importantly, he really helped me out.  

Flash forward two years later, this guy's brother, 18 years old, now wants to intern for us.  I looked at his resume, and there's no work experience at all.  None.  I immediately tell my boss ""We can't hire this guy, he has no work experience whatsoever.  No experience in taking orders, no experience in reporting to someone, etc.""  My boss agrees.

The TL;DR version is that some work experience, *any* work experience is going to shoot you ahead so much further later in life than someone who has none.  People hiring you are too worried about their own jobs to worry if you'll do yours, and if they have some proof that you can do *a* job, they'll be more likely to take their chances with you."

So, I figured I would put together mock ads in addition to the few gems I have. I know my way around illustrator/photoshop since I've been working with those programs since CS2 for years now and I've had three years of experience marketing for a fortune 100 company in higher education; two of which were at account worth 40 million as a marketing intern and a graphic designer before getting being in charge of marketing and graphic design at a 20 million dollar account. I know high caliber design when I see it and I wish I was given the time to create works of visual sales at my current college account but I'm a one man team so mock ads in my free time feels like my only option. I hope it's enough but am sincerely afraid that the competition would blow me away with a degree in advertising and a book from a portfolio finishing school.

I'm a transfer student applying to two state universities for Mechanical Engineering. Unfortunately my 1st choice won't notify me of acceptance for a while so I'm registering for classes for my 2nd choice as a precautionary measure. In talking with the department undergrad adviser and looking at the 4 year curriculum, I'm going to need to make up some ground if I go to my 2nd choice because I have focused my transfer credits for my 1st choice.

In doing so, my first semester there I am registered to take 20 credits of the following.

-Thermodynamics (3xx)

-Circuits (2xx)

-Fluid Dynamics (3xx)

-Engineering Analysis w/lab (3xx)

-Materials Science (2xx)

-Statistics for Engineers (3xx)

along with the following two courses to catch up

-Mechanics of Materials Lab (already taken the lecture) (2xx)

-Intro to CAD (1xx)

I have a 4.0 from my transfer institution with time to spare, but I'm aware that doesn't really mean much, and I also see several people saying Junior year is a new ""monster"" that is going to be tough as is. I won't have a job that semester as I will be moving over a week before classes start and will probably just focus on coursework the first semester anyways.

Along with this, my 2nd choice won't let me ""declare"" my major until I have a semester of credit with a minimum 3.0 GPA.

So I'm curious if you guys had any advice or can share any similar experiences, I'm not afraid of hard work, but I want to remain realistic too. I'm not sure of my alternatives quite yet if I choose to drop the course load down because I want to graduate in 2 years and I plan on doing an internship over the summer between.

1b0r37,1,2013-03-25,"[22/m] Need a romantic date idea for [21/f] ""gf""",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1b0r37/22m_need_a_romantic_date_idea_for_21f_gf/,"Back story: I had been with my girlfriend for 2.5 years this past summer. Then, something extremely stressful happened - a lot of uncertainty about the future. It was causing stress in both of our lives, but it was manageable. By this January, I had found out that I will be in a lot of debt, about 4 times as much as I thought that I would be by the time I graduate college.  I am not in debt because of college, or frivolous spending, it will mostly be a big fine for something that I will have to pay off. I never told my girlfriend about that, but it wasn't really anything that I could talk to anybody about. My solution was to just try super hard -- I have really great grades as a Computer Science student, so I took on a paid internship this semester, as well as taking three senior-level CS classes (and another filler class). I also got a full time paid internship in the summer. My reasoning was that if I work really hard from now until my graduation, I should be able to get a pretty decent paying job, and this debt would be paid off in no time for our future. Let's just say that I got in over my head. 20 hours a week is way more than I thought it was, and these CS courses have pretty big workloads. Most nights I get under 6 hours a week, including weekends, because I just have so much to do and no time.

About two weeks ago, my girlfriend took a trip to another city and ended up cheating on me (making out). I pretty much forgave her, because she was really wasted, told me right away, and I could tell that she was genuinely extremely sorry, and our relationship had been so good, and she had been so attached, I figured it did not mean anything. She continued talking to the other guy, though, and she would tell me about it. I broke up with her once she told me she talked to him a third time. It wasn't until this that we finally talked. She talked about how unhappy she was with me never having time for her anymore. About how neglected she felt, about how awful I made her felt. And she was totally right -- I truly didn't give her enough time, and nowhere near as much as I used to. She would come into the office and ask to see her, and I would be in the midst of a programming assignment and basically tell her to go away because I needed to finish this. She honestly had every reason to feel insecure about us -- she felt like I only cared about getting a good job after school, and that she wasn't my top priority.

Once I told her about the big debt that I have, and that I was trying to get a good job now so that we wouldn't have to deal with it later (we had talked about marriage, together for 3.5 years at the breakup), she started crying and said ""this would all have been different if I had known this -- I wish I didn't have to feel like you didn't think that I was beautiful enough, or that I was annoying to you for the past six months."" We were still living together at this point, just giving eachother more space. I saw something on her phone about her talking to him again, and things went even more downhill. She felt betrayed that I looked at her phone (she should have), but I only did it because I felt betrayed (because she was talking to somebody who she cheated on me with), and so we both had some issues. She is now moving out. However, the story does not end there.

We both talked about what we wanted out of the relationship after we decided that she should move out. I made it very clear that I am still interested in her, but that I am just too busy until the semester is over to give her the time that she deserves. I made it very clear that I wish that I had told her these things, and how much she does mean to me. She said that she feels the same way about me. We both agree that we need some space -- that we would stay broken up, and with such, test the dating market if we so wish. She said that she wanted me to experience other girls (not sexually) so that I would hopefully appreciate her more. I told her that I would not be happy with her dating other guys, but that it wasn't my business, not being her boyfriend after all, and that I would understand. We also said that we would occasionally see eachother, and if we both agreed, would go on dates from time to time -- very casual and start slow -- to see if this is truly what we want. 

I miss her like crazy. We have a date scheduled for this Thursday night, and I want it to be something that it can never be -- something to make up for all of the time that I neglected her. I'm trying to think of things that she has said that she wanted to do but has never done (such as a hot air balloon ride: she always wanted, but I am terrified of heights), but I feel like that is pretty extreme for a ""first date"".

Does anybody have any date ideas? I want it to be something personal to her, not something like dinner and a movie. Something that shows I care, but I don't know if I should do something too extravagant for a ""first date"", etc. Maybe even just advice on what kind of date would be useful.

tl;dr Just broke up with gf of 3.5 years that I lived with because I was super busy with school/work, but we are going on a date this week. Need date ideas, and what type of date might be appropriate if we are trying to ""take it slow"""
1b0r08,10,2013-03-25,What to do with a 2007 Corolla S,[deleted],MechanicAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1b0r08/what_to_do_with_a_2007_corolla_s/,"Hi everyone. My 1996 Plymouth Breeze has finally had it. While hunting for a new car that I could afford (around $5000 or so), my dad decided that it's about time for him to get a new car too, as his 2007 Corolla S is paid off. Anyway, he found a car that he loves today, so he's going to test drive it, and if he likes it, he's going to sell me his Corolla for $2500. This will be the first nice car I've owned (as my Plymouth was a piece of crap when I bought it for $400). 

It has 120,000 miles on it, but has never had to have any work done to it. It runs great and has had regular oil changes, and there is zero rust. He's getting new tires for it next week. 

What should I expect out of the car over the next few years, and what can I do to make my experience the best I can possibly have? 

I'm currently a full time student making minimum wage (with not much to show for it), but I landed an internship for the summer making $20/hr full time, and they'll keep me on part time during the school year. The drive will be about 35 miles each way.

As the relationship has gone on, I have slowly begun to feel powerless in the relationship. 

We currently live about an hour apart and normally see each other about once a week. It has become a common occurrence that when I go to visit her, she talks about how she doesn't think that I really care about her and that I don't really want to be there. She goes on about it until I feel so guilty that I will basically do whatever she wants to for the night/weekend.

This has started to steep into more phone conversations as well, with her guilting me over not visiting enough. She always wants me to come out to her, but I am a full-time student with a paid part-time job, and another unpaid internship (she works a full-time job in her city).

Last week was Finals week for me, and I had to move around some of them so that I could visit campuses of graduate programs I was accepted into. This was a big deal for me. Not only was I having finals with very little time to study due to moving them around, but I was also looking at some places that may change a lot about my future. At every step of the way, she would tell me I wasn't considering her and that I was being narrowminded because I was going to go do these things and wouldn't have time to see her.

I was flying into her city on the way back from one trip (I am in between to coast to coast trips for visiting campuses as I had to come home for another Final), and she expressed how bad of a person I was for not planning to visit her (despite a trip that involved red-eye flights, full days of campus events, and my need to study for my final). I finally gave in and agreed to have dinner with her when I landed. She keeps trying to get me to stay despite my need for sleep and studying, and eventually gives an exasperated, ""Well *I* tried.""

It seems that almost every time we talk now, I end up feeling like a bad BF and person in general. It is making me unhappy overall, but often I feel that I am just being selfish. Someone told me that it wasn't my fault and that she was emotionally abusive and I should leave. Is this the case, or am I just a shit BF?

**TL;DR GF makes me feel guilty for not being with her enough to the point that I almost always feel bad around her. Is it me, or is she emotionally abusive?**"

Most people won't like what I have to say, but I have no one to say it to, as no one wants to hear it.

I didn't choose to be built like a Barbie (with bigger breasts). My best friend's mother warned her not to be friends with me as a child because the ""boys were going to be all over me and she would feel ignored"" (Fucking ignorant and shitty to tell your daughter.. but ok) I knew from a young age that I was ""beautiful"" because everyone fawned over my body. They still do. I realized the privilege that came with this ""beauty"" (people trusting you easily, boys linking you even if you are a twit, etc.) and decided I wasn't going to live my life based off of my looks. I started to volunteer in the 8th grade at a homeless shelter and found my passion for helping people. I will soon be finished Social Work graduate school that I worked very hard to get into. (Social Work is almost 100% women, so looks didn't help get me there :) )

Every. Single. Close. Female. Friend. I have ever had so far has ended up not being my friend anymore because of a few reasons: 

1. Their boyfriend's hit on me behind their backs... and when I tell my friend about it, they ALWAYS blamed me. ""You must have led him on! You are lying.... You slut!"" they say... and then want nothing to do with me. I wan't nothing to do with their scummy boyfriends! ( I am bi, anyway, and for a long time was only interested in women and didn't want anything to do with men!) They don't want their ""hot"" friend around to distract their piece of shit boyfriends (that cheat on them) so they abandon me, no matter how good of a friend I am and no matter how crappy he is.

2. They are jealous. I don't assume this, they always tell me. They are jealous because I am pretty and I work VERY hard to be successful and get good grades. I don't sit at home smoking pot and eating chips and playing video games all day. I save my money wisely, I splurge for things that I enjoy. I saved up to go to Bonnaroo VIP with my s.o. and for a new car and a new macbook because I don't go out every fucking weekend and spend $200 on booze like they do. I work two jobs, go to school and intern. I know that one day, I will be able to work a normal 9-5 but until then, I need to work and study my ass off. They think they are ENTITLED to a 9-5 because they have an associates degree and refuse to intern. I am dedicated, I don't give up, and I have given my life to helping others (NOT because I wan't to make myself feel good, but because the world is shit and I think I need to try and help out as much as I can before I go back into the earth) They go out of their way to insult me or subtly put me down when I am happy (Especially when in the company of others) because their lives suck (A few of them apologize after they do it, they know what they are doing and see how sad it makes me..). When I am happy or feeling successful (I usually keep it to myself and dress down so they don't feel bad) they like to attribute it to my looks, even things that have no fathomable connection to my appearance, like getting into college. 

I know, I know, ""just make new friends!"" but this has been going on ever since I outgrew a trainer bra in 5th grade. It is mainly my female friends, but it happens with (some) male friends as well. I am not perfect and I am not free of fault, but I am a loyal, dedicated friend, and I am fucking sick of people I care about hating me because they are so insecure that they can't get past my drive and appearance and return the gift of friendship to me. The only few friends I have been able to have are lesbians who I work with, because they don't feel the need to compete with me for men. I think this is the main driving issue here, to be honest. Hopefully, I will find more friends in grad school who have self esteem and who enjoy helping others as much as I do, and I can leave these clowns behind..... I just get so lonely. I guess I don't need anyone.
Thanks for hearing me rant. "

Seduction and this board is more than pick up and you can use your social skills to land you awesome things in life.  Here is what I did:

TL;DR: If a girl is showing no IOI's or you are uninterested in pulling her as a gf (or what ever else y'all cats are up to), if you transition your small talk to her studies/work you can have an opportunity to ""professionally"" network with her, and maybe you can help each other in the future.  Being passionate about what ever your are talking about helps as well.

Mini field report:
I am mostly a day game guy,and I have been approaching girls on campus in labs/libraries/in between classes.  I usually start off direct, but have trouble escalating/attracting, usually choding off and talk about school and such, but it can sometimes work out in your favour.

I approached this HB 9 who was studying in a lab on Friday.  I started out direct and said that her eyes were really beautiful and matched her chain (she had this sapphire necklace) .  She blushed, said thanks people had told her that before and that the necklace was a gift from her boyfriend.  At this moment, most puas (I would assume) would have ejected after some talk.

I decided that for what ever reason, I wanted to get her to talk with me and see how long I could keep the conversation going.  I followed some of the guidelines on how to win friends and influence people and showed a genuine interest in her and talked about her studies.  I also gave her a feeling of importance about the impact of her work and the awesome volunteer stuff she did (she was studying social work).  

We talked about myself for a bit and I told her about some of the awesome things I did on campus about clean energy and I showed her how passionate about it I was about it while relating it to her passions.  I ended getting her to add me on Linkedin and she said she would contact me.

Long story short, it turns out her boyfriend's dad was a manager at a big energy company, and he was able to get me an intern position for a different department after looking at my linkedin.  Even skipped the interview process and everything.

Stay networking my friends!"

1b0mtv,2,2013-03-25,"Got let go today with no notice or severance despite contractual obligations, need advice.",LaidOffVet,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1b0mtv/got_let_go_today_with_no_notice_or_severance/,"It's a long story and I don't know all the gory details but I will try to sum it up as concisely and accurately as I can with my current knowledge. This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

I am a veterinarian. I graduated vet school a few years back and haven't been practicing very long, but I finished in the top of my class and completed one of the most prestigious internships available so I would consider myself to be a valuable asset to any practice. For the last 1 year and 8 months I have been employed full time at an after-hours emergency hospital.  The practice is owned by another vet that also owns a few other day practices and a boarding/grooming facility in the area. I signed a one year contract initially and renewed it for another year after its terms had expired. My work attendance has been perfect and all of my performance reviews have been extremely positive. 

I've had my complaints, but overall, it's been a good job. I've known that the owner has been having some financial difficulties due to the economic slump over the past few years, but my understanding was that my hospital was never the problem. Sure, business had its ups and downs, but we generally made money after-hours. The owner's other businesses were less successful, however, and there had been talk of consolidating the day practices and/or selling the boarding facility to cut down on expenses, but this had been months ago and business had been proceeding along per the usual.  

I worked a 12 hour shift yesterday and wasn't scheduled to work again until next Monday (us emergency vets work weird shift schedules). I woke up this morning to a voicemail from the owner, aka my boss, which I thought odd but figured someone called in sick and they needed coverage or some other stupid inconvenience. When I called, my boss regretfully informed me that all hospitals were being closed effective immediately and to come get any of my stuff out today before the bank locks up the property. According to the owner, it was completely unexpected and they had just found out. Having just woken up, and reeling from the shock of the news, this was about the extent of our conversation. I have spoken with several coworkers, both doctors and technicians, but I have not yet spoken again with the owner. As far as anyone is aware, no severance is being offered and employees have been directed to apply for unemployment. The rumor consensus is that the owner has basically lost everything, including their house and is likely declaring bankruptcy. 

This means that 30+ people, many of whom are my good friends, were let go today with no notice and no severance. This makes me sick. Unlike most of the employees, as a doctor, I have a contract. My contract explicitly states the following:

&gt; This agreement and the employment of doctor may be terminated by either party without cause on 90 days written notice prior to [date redacted, late
Summer 2013, about 3-4 months from now] or by 30 days written notice thereafter. It is understood by both parties that the usual transition time is at the end of the contract period and only extreme conditions can result in an exception.

Now, as I've said, I'm not a lawyer, but I think that this means the owner is in breach of contract and I'm owed 90 days pay. Not to mention all my unclaimed sick and vacation days. 

This clause is included due to nature of my profession and the level of my training: a new job often involves an extensive job search and interviewing process and even moving hundreds of miles. 

I realize that my boss is likely in a far worse position than I am and I genuinely feel horrible that they and their family are going through this. I also realize that they may desperately want to give us all a huge severance package and are literally unable to due to whatever financial and legal limitations they are currently under. I have had no major issues with my boss, but I do find it more than a little bit hard to believe that this was truly not foreseeable and even 2-3 weeks notice would have made a huge difference. 

Being still relatively young and irresponsible, I don't have a large savings account to float me. To make it worse, my girlfriend and I had been planning on moving after my current contract ended later this year but we don't even know where yet (she's waiting to hear back from schools) and won't be ready to move for at least a month or two. So I currently feel completely powerless to do anything to improve my job prospects. 

Should I talk to a lawyer about trying to get some of what I believe is contractually owed me? I really don't want to be an asshole to the owner but I also feel like I got absolutely shat on today, and that clause was put into my contract for a damn good reason. I figure there's a good chance that even if I was to lawyer up successfully, it would be many months or even years before I saw anything so it's not going to help me now, but would they be under some sort of protection if they were undergoing bankruptcy? For now, I'm applying for unemployment and hoping that my girlfriend hears back from schools this week so that I can at least get an idea of where we're moving and start looking for a job. 

Sorry if I've not been as concise as I promised. I've literally been in shock all day and writing this was probably as much cathartic as it was advice-seeking. Also, sorry for any typos, I'm lying on the couch typing on my phone. 

TL;DR - The hospital I work at was closed today and all employees let go with no notice or severance. My contract states 90 days written notice is required for my termination without cause. Don't want to be a dick, but should I sue my boss, and do I have a case?

EDIT: Sorry, this is in North Carolina.

EDIT: Confirmed from another Doc in the practice that the owner is definitely filing for bankruptcy, don't know what type/chapter.  "

Portland State or Univ Washington?,nkobel,urbanplanning,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/1b0g3m/which_school_portland_state_or_univ_washington/,"I have the honor of being accepted to Portland State University, University of Washington, and University of Michigan for their Master of Urban Planning programs. PSU and U-W are my top two choices, but I'm not sure which has the better program. Both have around 300 applicants, and both have around 40 slots. I'm looking to practice planning in the Pacific Northwest, which is why I'm debating between the two.

**PSU** is located in a navigable, 20-minute city and their senior capstone is forming a ""community-based, client-focused workshop projects, [giving the] opportunity to form teams to work on projects for community clients, and to produce a professional product."" They also require 400 hours of internship experience. From what I can tell, this program is more practice-oriented, and they are self-proclaimed to be more reputable than U-W's program. I would pay in-state tuition at PSU ($9,794/year), versus U-W non-resident tuition of $27,849/year. PSU is also located right in downtown Portland. This program is located in the College of Urban and Public Affairs, along with the school for Community Health and Public Policy.

Two drawbacks I see are 1) PSU simply does not have the amount of resources U-W would have. UMich has, for example, has the Spatial and Numeric Data (SAND) Lab, which employs two full-time librarians to help you recover obscure GIS and other spatial datasets. PSU does *not* have something like this, but I'm not sure if U-W has got one either. 2) PSU is not a name school. As superficial as that sounds, employers do look for graduates from schools with better reputations, right?

**U-W** is located in a sprawling metropolis, surrounded by white-cap mountains, Puget Sound, and endless culture. AFAIK, the program is a bit more theory-intense, but has a similar curriculum with similar specializations (but they have a bonus ""Historic Preservation"" specialization). U-W has tons of resources and a huge campus, but it's located 25 minutes from downtown Seattle. This program is located in the College of Built Environments, along with Architecture, Construction and others.

Two drawbacks are 1) the cost - the difference between U-W (~$28k/year) and PSU (~$10k/year) is stark. 2) Seattle is big - almost too big for me. I also hate Starbucks and Microsoft, lol.

**TL;DR**: Which school will get me the most rewarding job in the Pacific Northwest and prepare me to be the best planner possible? Please discuss the pros and cons of each school, and if you've had any experience with either, please share it!

1b0fw2,1,2013-03-25,how can I bulk up my resume (CS major) in college (thin resume breeds thin resumes),glareflare,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1b0fw2/how_can_i_bulk_up_my_resume_cs_major_in_college/,"I'm currently a senior in HS and I realized that I haven't done much in my 18 years of life. My peers all have an outstanding transcripts (all A's) and/or leadership skills and some talent to make them stand out.


But I stand right in the middle with decent grades (A's and B's an a few C's) Lots of AP courses with 4's and 3's. SAT with a little above 2000 and ACT of 34. Some club experience but no leadership. No real awards and ongoing extracurricular. A typical part-time job and some volunteer work. 


I want to do better and I know that if I start now I still have a chance, however since I don't have much to stand on it's hard to gain experience.
What do I do now? I'm afraid I won't do better in college since my peers will have a better resume, so the professors will prefer them and they'll gain the leadership opportunities and internships and such...   

(Also I seem to notice that CS majors typically go into college with a fair amount of programming/techy knowledge, while I only know a bit of Java.) 

TL;DR - Did average in HS and the mediocre-cy haunts me and prevents improvement. "

1b0e46,0,2013-03-25,Campfire Stories: Bradley,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1b0e46/campfire_stories_bradley/,"So here I am, near the tail end of my national park road-trip across the states, in what is arguably the most beautiful park of them all, Yellowstone. I just recently graduated out of the University of Pennsylvania with a major in biochemistry, and I had landed an extremely well-paying job, but I wasn't due for six more months. How do I spend my time? I am kind of a loner, and besides, the few friends I have are spread far and few across the country busy finding and securing jobs for themselves.  So after some planning, I found myself starting the road-trip with a beat-up Mazda Protégé and a thousand dollars of cash.

4 months later, here I am, in Yellowstone with no friends or family, just a backpack and boots. I call it a day when I see that the sun is halfway to the horizon, and I head back to my camp spot. Sure, I could try to climb this ledge for a little longer, but the nighttime bear killing stories just give me the creeps. I sit down next to my tent and take a bite out of my Granola bar, staring contently at the vast milky swathes of stars that stretch across my entire vision. Suddenly, I hear some yelling in my direction, ""Hey man with the bar! Yea you, wanna join us for some dinner?"" I squint in the direction where the voice came from and see a group of about a dozen people beckoning me over. Sighing, I get up and trudge over. This better be worth it. 

It is quite a diverse group, with people of all ages and colors. One of the people must have seen my confused expression so he explained, ""Haha naw, we are not all together, me and my wife Jenny over here just called everyone in this area together for some good old campfire fun. The name is Brian. What's your name?"" ""Kent, I replied, sitting down on one of the chairs that Brian pulled over. We ate and made small talk a little, and I got to know the group very well in just 20 minutes. 

There was Brian and Jennifer, high school sweethearts from Texas who met each other when Bradley recently took up a job in a dentist's office. They soon married after that, and they decided to take a trip to Yellowstone to ""witness the outdoors"". There was Cooper, a National Geographic wildlife photographer intern, who well, came here to photograph animals. Andrew and his best bud Ethan were recent graduates from Cambridge who like me, came here to kill time. August was a veteran camper, who now at the ripe age of 66 had claimed to climbing Mt. Everest just last year. Yeah right, that geezer is just pulling our strings.  Then there was the group of five; Naomi, Tyler, Russel, Kevin, and Sunny, all neighborhood friends from Frisco who needed some adventure and outdoors in their life. Then there is Chris, a heavy built black guy who plays football for his college. He lives just an hour's drive from Yellowstone, and yet this is the first time he has ever visited. Last and most definitely least, was me. 

""So let's get cracking then, shall we!"" exclaimed Brian, with a cheesy smile plastered across his face. ""It's story time! Rules are simple; the story has to be real, it doesn't have to be your story, maybe something a friend or family member once told you. Oh, but one thing is for sure; it has to be scary. So who's first?"" Bradley said, scanning the group. How bout the new kid? He said smiling, looking at me. ""Um, sorry, I am a good story creator but I am a lousy story teller. Pass"", I said awkwardly. ""Well then, I will go first”, Brian replied. “Story is short, but good”. “Short and sweet?!” muttered Chris. “More like short and fucked up,” scoffed Brian. “Alright here is why you never sleep in shady motels at night:

It was my junior year of high school, spring break, so mah three best friends and I decided to lose our alcohol virginity. We drove off quite a safe distance from town, and cracked open the beer. Coors Light, if I remember correctly. Anyways, we drunk, played around, and played truth-or-dare for 3 hours. It was about 2 AM when we stopped. I was so drunk; I was seeing 12 people instead of 3. Imagine that! 4 of each of my friends! So Randall, the least drunk of us all, threw us into his car and decided to crash us in a motel for the night. We stopped at the first one we saw, a shanty thing with just 25 rooms total and about 7 light bulbs that worked. Ha! We paid the receptionist and stumbled into our separate room. I slowly fell into a dull sleep.

 I woke up suddenly at around 4:30 AM. I don’t know what woke me up so I stupidly scanned the room, looking for what might have disturbed me. That’s when I saw it. A figure was shambling around the room, or should I say 4 figures, since I was still seeing in fours. The bathroom light was on at the far end, and Travis, one of my buds was not to be seen in the sleeping bag. Figured it must be him who was wandering around. I cursed at Travis for keeping the light on. My throat was parched so I groped around in my pack for some water. Shit. I left it in the car. “Yo Travis, imma get Randall’s keys and get me some water yea?” Travis didn’t reply, he just paced around the room muttering, looking for something. I took Randall’s keys off the table and stumbled out into the cool night air. Taking a grateful whiff, I fumbled with the keys at Randall’s car. Finally, the damn thing opened and I crashed inside. I found the water and drunk it was fast as I could. Shit, this water tastes weird I thought. Looking down at it, I realized it was the Coors Light. Dammit. I started to fell sleepy, so I closed the door and slept soundly.

I woke up to sirens and rapping at my door. I blearily opened my eyes, staring at a fat walrus of a man in a police uniform. I was scared; I was underage. However he didn’t seem concerned with the bottle in my hand. His expression was grave. “Son, I need you to identify some, uh, people for me.” He led me into our room, and I threw up right there. The stench of blood was just too strong. Hanging by the three light fixtures were Randall, Logan, and Jake, all with a drunken glaze in their eyes. And in the bathroom, oh Travis! It looked like he tried to fight, and he failed. Horribly. His face was peeled off and was placed in his hands. His left leg was in two pieces, one piece resting against the toilet. A huge butcher’s knife protruded out of his chest. It was too much. My best friends. All of them, killed, just like that. “We looked into the motel security cameras kid,” continued the cop, “Well here is the weird part. Lobby security shows you four walking in to get book a room. Then we switched to room security, and at 2:15 AM, you opened the door to your room, and five people walked in. Five. We don’t know where the other one came from and we can’t find him now. We are really sorry, we truly are”.

Bradley pulled back and sat on a log, tears now streaming down his face. “And that is why you never stop at a run-down motel for the night”. Whose story is up next?

1b55h7,1,2013-03-27,Everything just accumulates as a weight on my chest,burdurdurchick,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b55h7/everything_just_accumulates_as_a_weight_on_my/,"I don't know how posts are supposed to read, but I've got a lot messing with me and it's got a lot of backstory, so I'm sorry, this will be long. To skip backstory, skip the next five paragraphs and reference as needed.

I think I've been suffering from some sort of depression for most of my life.  I'm 27, female, weight's a bit higher than I'd like it to be but still acceptable on a BMI scale, and I feel like I look (I guess) somewhere between a 4-7 on a hotness scale depending on what kind of day I'm having. I'm the middle child of three, middle-upper class family (I'm actually not sure which one I technically fall into), the only girl, with a mother who's shallow and self-centered and only likes me when she's got a chance to take credit for something or profit somehow, and a dad who is benignly negligent.  None of us are close as we were pretty discouraged against interacting much growing up since my mother didn't have the patience for the inevitable squabbles that kids get into.  I'm pretty clearly the least favorite.  I'm socially awkward since my social life was enthusiastically discouraged/prevented.  I stayed grounded almost all of the time due to rebelling against the pretty intense controls I was put under.  But all in all, I was a good kid: I was lazy and disinterested when it came to schoolwork, but nobody in my friends group smoked or drank and I didn't get anywhere close to losing my virginity til 19, and a respectable amount of that can be attributed to me and not just my inability to have private time with anybody. I spent an awful lot of time hiding in my room reading and became an expert in daydreaming.  By the time I graduated high school, I had a pretty set life plan: I was going to train horses for a living, marry well by 25, and have one or two kids before or around 30.  I was goal oriented in the extreme, mercilessly tomboyish, and absolutely confident about the quality of my future self and life, despite no indications that I was the sort of person I imagined I was going to be.

I think the emotional negligence I had growing up has made me overly dependent on relationships.  I am not happy unless I have my one person to indulge in on a regular basis, but I think that has also been contributing to the failures of those same relationships.  My first serious one at 19 lasted 3 years, but looking back I was extremely emotionally needy and very selfish.  He wasn't the sort of person that could or would meet my probably excessive needs, and when I got frustrated enough, I finally cheated (about a month) and then left (I assure you, I felt plenty, plenty guilty and left him with all of my new-bought furniture, but never have had the balls to admit what I did).  The new guy didn't last long though; he almost immediately pushed me away (lesson firmly learned about cheating).  Reckless, and a bit desperate for love and attention, I moved across the country for a guy I'd met online. That lasted about two months, and then I had to come back home with my tail between my legs (lesson learned about online guys).  At this point I was pretty devastated, and that showed in my dating life.  Desperacy is not an attractive trait for a serious suitor and is happily and easily taken advantage of by those who are not so serious.  At this point I *needed* to prove myself to be better than the cheater I now thought of myself as, and each emotional rejection piled onto the other, I became a mess.  I've always, unfortunately, been dependent on my partner's sexual attraction to me as an indicator that I am attractive and loved, and now, in the lack of anything loving, I simply accepted sex instead.  I needed intimacy in some form, and sex was the best I was good enough for, so I took it, though only from guys who at least put several hours' worth of playing at getting to know me.  Flirting was fun, sex felt good, and those few hours that I was not alone kept me from staying a fetal position in the corner of my room contemplating the bottles in the medicine cabinet.  The need became so strong that for a short time I seriously worried that, while I'd joked about it before due to my high libido, I was actually becoming a nymphomaniac in the worst sense.  This thought did NOT help the depression.  It is truly terrifying to be sitting at work, depressed out of your mind, and feeling a truly overwhelming NEED to have someone fucking you.  Anyone.  

Around the same time, I a) decided it was time for a GOOD change, and registered to return to college (I had earlier had two years of junior college that I did not complete) and b) got involved with a married coworker.  It was the usual story: he was incredibly dissatisfied with his marriage, sexually alienated from his wife, who he was convinced was cheating on him.  He was fun to talk to, and we had crazy, crazy chemistry despite an undeniable age gap. I honestly, honestly hoped I would move away for college before we crossed the sexual lines that we were recklessly flirting with.  But I didn't make it, the sex was glorious, there was something amazing in the way I felt about him, and miraculously, it seemed, *it was mutual*.  Within a couple of months he separated from his wife and I was mostly openly his girlfriend. I was in love with this man in a way that had redefined my definition of the word.  But he was always guilty, and seemed ashamed and embarrassed either of me or being seen with me when we were out in public.  He refused to trust me, and quickly began accusing me of lying of all sorts of things. It became habit to preempt the accusations with full, irrefutable accounts of everything. The amount of sexual debauchery he believed me capable of, whether I was *actually* doing it behind his back or apparently incredibly tempted to, was astounding.  Mind you, we were several hours apart at this point, so that it was even easier to believe these things of me.  I was obsessed with this man, absolutely uninterested in anyone else, and have never been so certain of my entire future.  Every life goal I had became tied with in with this dreamy/fucked up relationship.  I neglected friendships because he got stressed out when I'd go hang out with people, and had to cut off every male friend I had because to everyone but this man, I was just a piece of ass (remember, as a tomboy, a strong and close portion of my friends were male). I loved, loved sex with him since it was unbelievably satisfying on so many levels, but I think my enthusiasm was damning me as a sexual deviant.  I learned to loathe my sexuality.  I pretty quickly lost count of the number of breakups we'd had, but every time, I accepted and even prompted the angry, intense verbal abuse and accusations because I knew that once he got it out of the way, he'd let up and take me back. I wanted to marry him so hard. This relationship matches descriptions I've heard of manic depression - the highs were so addicting that the miserably awful lows were acceptable.  Anyway, to keep from running on, eventually I couldn't accept any new limitations without losing every sense of self that I had, and cut it off.  

After that, more dating, including yet another manipulator who just seemed to be looking for an abuse target, and some weird Match.com dates. At this point, my guard was so high, my self esteem so low, that it was hard to begin even trying to emotionally connect with someone.  When I found out that my ex was already, within months, in another relationship with the word ""love"" being used comfortably, I broke.  The way he had apparently so easily moved on rendered every euphoric feeling and moment of the last almost three years a lie.  Classes became almost impossible to follow because my brain wouldn't shut up with every irony or now-bittersweet memory being replayed over and over. I lost even more friends who got tired of emotional me. One even treated me like I was going to begin ""preying"" on her male friends and made it clear she didn't want me near them, which baffled and surprised me to no end. I, on several occasions, *physically* nearly couldn't breathe while in public, due to fighting tears so hard that my throat closed up on me. I - and I have told *no one* about this - got drunk and took every Benadryl I had in an effort to hurt or kill myself one night, to absolutely no affect, since it seems 30-40 are recreational, hallucinogenic doses (I checked later) and I didn't have half that (laugh if you want, but I've always been scared of taking one too many Tylenol. I didn't comprehend how *much* overdosage would be necessary).  I sought help through campus psych services, but the ""therapist"" I was assigned seemed to be annoyed and impatient with my problems and I stopped going after three sessions - I guess there's only so many college brats you can listen to crying about boys before you don't want to hear it anymore.  I ended up leaning heavily on a male friend.  We were both traumatized by recent breakups so we paired up as mutual crutches so we wouldn't just date to fill the void and get more hurt. With him there, I stabilized and was kept occupied enough that I couldn't focus on miserable thoughts. When he left for an internship, I started crashing again.  

This was last June. Then I started seeing a much younger guy who was very often in the place where I studied.  I was taking an intense course and studying for many hours daily, and he started dropping in more and more frequently, and we'd go get lunch or hang out.  Eventually we were spending so much time together that, although I'd been avoiding mentioning it for fear of rejection, he brought up labeling us a couple, which I accepted.  We quickly were spending so much time together that I pretty much lived with him. We were both very guarded, though, and he especially shared very little about his emotions, though I wasn't much better. Despite the incredible stability with this actually wonderful and caring guy, a genuinely good person, who was a catch by every definition, I still fought a steady, heavy depression that liked to show up in every moment I had alone. I still had nightmares about my ex where I would beg and grovel for him to even acknowledge me, and he would either act like I didn't exist or treat me like shit (I never told this bf this). After eight months and a very cautiously executed official move-in, the L-word had still never been said and I began to fret in earnest. I had been very careful about not pushing relationship subjects since it had backfired so nightmarishly in the last relationship, and had been waiting for him to indicate readiness for the next step. But with graduation and post-graduation planning looming, I finally pushed the subject on Saturday.  While I'd approached this relationship with a refusal to get my hopes up, for fear of another horrendous crash after it failed, I was pitifully hopeful that he would admit that perhaps he *was* ready to take the next emotional step. After all, I'd spent the entire time carefully cultivating ""awesome girlfriend"" points with him and his friends.  Unfortunately, what I *got* was an admission that he wasn't in love with me. I made the obvious, immediate and inevitable decision to officially break up.

**Which brings us to present day**. I have nowhere else to go, so we're still living in the same room. The apartment doesn't have a couch and the roommate has the only other bedroom.  I still care about him so much, and I've spent so much time thoroughly enjoying his company and taking pride in the guy I was privileged to call my boyfriend, that it gnaws on me as a constant pain.  We still talk, and sleep snuggled up together, but all I can see is something I lost, another person I wasn't good enough for, another future snuffed out. I still crave touching him and being touched, but I can almost feel the intense reserve he has against this. He'll hug me and hold me, but by ending our relationship, I've regretfully ensured that touches are strictly platonic.  I have never been able to take breakups well, and I've never been able to shake the loss and disappointment of the previous ones, so this is just another brick (boulder?) in the wall I'm stuck carrying. It's heavy, it *feels physically heavy* and it's with me everywhere I go.  I thankfully don't have any lecture classes in this last semester, but I'm still prone to finding myself staring off into blank misery for way too long.  I try to do things, try to accomplish tiny goals like finally picking up and sorting laundry off the floor (I've been dangerously close to being out of underwear for a week, each clean pair found is a tiny miracle), but I seem to only manage a few moments of momentum before I lapse into blankness again.  I can't even really cry, it's not a sharp pain, it's just so heavy and so overwhelming.  I've been thinking regularly of hurting myself since the previous breakup (though I've tried to hide my depression from my most current ex - nobody likes a sad person), and it just looks like such a welcome relief. I think about it many, many times a day. I don't trust people anymore, I don't trust my value as a person anymore. Goal oriented as I am, I have only one goal for my life that hasn't died off - to have my own intact, loving family with a caring husband and one child who would be the world to me - but I feel nothing but despair that it will ever happen  I feel like men think I'm fun and attractive and perfect for a temporary fling, but never the girl to marry.  I am so broken into so many pieces that I have no idea how I'm still here.  I don't feel like there's any relief for me - I don't even get the sexual release that I used to get.  After the mind-blowing sex that I had with my ex and the way I was made to feel about my sexuality, everything about sexytimes has lost its luster.  Everything feels disappointing.  Obviously, the golden rule of sex is to absolutely never let on about disappointment except through absolutely positive suggestions, and I try to *never* do anything that would harm a partner's sexual ego, but my last few partners seem to have sensed it anyway, and I've been unable to miss the issues it's giving them.  I'm scared I'm stuck in an endless cycle and I'll be the bitter old lady with too many cats and too many shoes with nowhere to wear them.  I desperately don't want to grow old alone.  The idea of being frail and old is unappealing to begin with, but being that way with no family to visit your lonely ass in the shithole of a nursing home you're stuck in is a personal nightmare of mine.  I feel like my only mark on the world will be my hypothetical child, who I vow that I will raise better than I was and set them up to not have the problems I have had. But that takes two, and finding that second is proving impossible.  I feel like I wasted my prime dating years on an abusive asshole who I still, STILL have intense cravings for and who I will always have to be ashamed of. Now it's just a short and painful march towards 30, which I have to convince myself is NOT the beginning of middle age, and then on towards 40 and infertility and the end of everything I've ever wanted.  I have no hopes left that I might manage anything in the next 10 years that I haven't managed in the last.  I feel like I've become such a bitter and guarded and annoyingly hopeless person that I can't even imagine relationships getting off the ground.  It all feels hopeless, like it's all over already. I feel like I should get actual, professional therapy and that it will take anti-depressants to neutralize the world for me enough to stand back up again, but since I'm currently on my parents' dime - they have been shitty parents but I am grateful that I won't be saddled with college loan debt - I'd have to go to them about it first, and I'm pretty sure I'd just get bitched at for being so expensive.  I don't have medical insurance, haven't since I turned 26 and got pushed off my parents' insurance.  Please give me hope, some kind of hope, Reddit."

SW:145  CW:135.6  GW:115-120


I don't have any before pictures, literally the last one showing my body is from almost a year and a half ago but [here's some pics I just took in the mentioned interview clothes.](http://imgur.com/a/yZkOE)


The beginning of this month, my best friend convinced me to start WW with her, she'd already lost about 15lbs since January...seeing that motivated me A LOT.  WW has **really** helped me with portion control and almost killed my sweet tooth (unless my boyfriend makes chocolate cake...).  I now know that I've been overeating for basically my entire life and have learned to have some self control when it comes to portion size. The only exception was a stint of eating almost nothing in high school after my boyfriend at the time told me I was fat for weighing 128lbs.  I got down to 110-115 and kept it basically off until 3 years ago when I started dating my current boyfriend.  Something about being in a happy relationship turns me into a bottomless pit, not to mention, he's a good southern boy who was taught to cook using butter on a Paula Deen level.  His sister legitimately gets nervous when she gets down to **three pounds** of butter (yes, as in 12 entire sticks) in her house.


Two years ago I bought ""interview"" clothes for internship hunting.  I had gained some weight by that point and was horrified that I needed to buy size 6 pants; I was a size 2 up until 2010.  Anyways, when I went to the career fair in early February, ALL of my interview/business casual clothes were tight.  I felt like I had to suck in the whole time to not have fat spilling out everywhere over my pants, which was terrible for talking to prospective employers.


Well, I got invited to an on site interview next week (eek! first real big girl job interview) and I begrudgingly decided to see how awful the interview clothes I had collecting dust in my closet looked on me.  I LOOKED THE SAME IN THEM AS I DID WHEN I BOUGHT THEM!  There was no belly overhang and my torso didn't look lumpy underneath my shirt.

I'll be graduating from Texas A&amp;M: Industrial Distribution next semester.,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1b51ow/any_one_looking_for_a_degree_holder_in_logistics/,"Classes involve accounting techniques, supplier relations, supply chain management, purchasing, sales, hydraulic and pneumatic understanding. 

Other specialties include industrial electricity knowledge, automation, fluid power transmission, and my personal favorite so far has been my quality course. I really enjoy statistics and it tends to come natural to me. I have a firm understanding with P charts, N charts. etc and I know how to apply data gathered into real world action.

I really enjoy my degree, as well as my job which I work full time. Currently employed as an IT helpdesk rep. I worked at HEB previously, which is a large grocery store in southern Texas. I worked an internship with them as well.

The internship entailed introducing new product to ""sister"" stores of a similar demographic that performed well in one area, and might make an impact in another area.

If you or anyone might be interested in this skill set, like I said I'll be picking up my bachelors at the end of December 13' and I'm looking to jump right into a full time job if possible. 

I have an offer for a job in Seattle, WA. However, I would love to consider other fun/interesting locations.

If sending your associates across the country is what you do, I would REALLY love to give that a try. I want to travel and see the world doing what I love, which in my mind has always been a customer service attitude towards business.

Thanks for your time.

Hello r/personalfinance! I'm a student in his penultimate year at a US university who currently has ~ in savings (all in regular savings or checking accounts).

I make ~ during the school year doing web development work and tutoring on the side. This summer I will be doing an internship that will probably pay me .
Given that all my money is in either savings or checking accounts, I'm pretty sure inflation isn't doing happy things to it.

**My main objective here is to be able to save/invest/retain value for as much money as possible for the medium and long term**.

Some of my friends have suggested **a)** sticking money in an IRA so I can get a head start on retirement saving and/or **b)** sticking money in a standalone mutual fund.


**Specific Questions:**

With the above in mind, I'd like to know...

* Are those two (IRA, mutual fund) good options for me?
* If so, should I go for a Roth or Traditional IRA?
* How should I go about actually putting money into an IRA or mutual fund - any recommended brokerages?
* Are there any other ways I should consider storing/investing my money that I haven't thought of?

**Other Things to Consider:**

* Parents are paying for undergraduate education (so no student loans).
* I'm aiming to go to a Top 7 law school right after graduating in 2014; I will have some, but most likely not a lot of parental support for that (so probably will end up getting student loans).

**TL;DR:** I'm a college student. Should I, and how do I, save/invest with IRAs and Mutual funds?

Thanks in advance for everyone's help, and please excuse any lack of financial knowledge!

But then i think ""what would i do""  and i can't really answer that question.  I have a few ideas but nothing concrete and they all seem daunting.  I have this fear that I'll be on my deathbed and look back and think ""why the hell did i waste all that time doing something i hated?""

Despite having a job i hate, from the outside looking in my life looks pretty nice.  I just bought a home, and when i tell people about that they can't believe i bought a home at such a young age.  I don't think it was very difficult but i guess I'm just good with money?  I also have the best friends in the world.  Friends that i can talk to about anything, that would do anything for me, and that will be there for me till i die.  I go to therapy every week; not because I'm sick or crazy but because i want to better myself and strengthen my relationships.

So a lot of my life sounds great, but i feel so unsatisfied with my day to day life...mainly with a career, and the future.

The few ideas i have for a career are going back to school to become a teacher, or a computer engineer(programming), or IT guy.  But for some reason i have a fears behind all of them.  A consistent fear is that I'll spend 4+ years and $40k+ and then be right back where i started.  I went to college for a semester when i got out of high school and i just loathed it.  I hated the teachers, and the idea that you cram as much info into your head for the test just to get an A and then forget everything you learned.  There is a part of me that wants to go back to school and a part of be that just fucking hates that idea.

I'd love to be able to get into a career that i enjoy without college but from my experience trying to volunteer, intern, etc makes it seem impossible.

If anyone has any suggestions, comments, criticisms I'd love to hear them.

TL:DR: 21, just bought a home, have great friends, generally a happy life.  However i feel like my life and career are going no where and i have a huge fear that I'll regret wasting time on things i hate.

Do you have any tips for me? Perhaps you know of a company in these sectors or maybe you can point me towards a website or other source of information? Please reply then, it would be a major help to me!

1b40j6,22,2013-03-27,Went to the Career Fair as an Employer.,TomKappa,utdallas,https://www.reddit.com/r/utdallas/comments/1b40j6/went_to_the_career_fair_as_an_employer/,"I graduated in 2012 with a BS in EE, and now work for an Irving based company. They asked me to attend the UTD Career Fair with the HR rep and I jumped on the opportunity. It was the STEM career fair, but some of my observations might be good for others too.




Here are just a few notes:

* I liked it when people had been to our website and at least knew the basics of the company. 

I understand that might be tough what with all the companies, but looking at two equal resumes I liked the candidate who had been to the website more.


* When people came up to me and listed off their classes, I mostly just laughed. 

It's on your resume (because I know UTD resume format), and it doesn't tell me anything about you. For me especially, it meant nothing. You say you've had a relevant class, but I know that it means mostly squat, which I said to most people. 


* If you know of a certain position or I've mentioned one, ask what the normal activities/duties are. 

I was at the fair looking to hire people into the same position I have, so I could actually tell you first hand what I do. Not always the case, I know. As I was going over details, the more interesting candidates would chime in with projects they had done that were similar.


* Show some interest in your field outside of school. 

For many this is an internship or working in a lab, but as a hobby microcontroller tinkerer, I liked candidates who screwed around with Arduinos or played around with programming at home. One candidate told me he had made the first steps into automating his house, by adding RGB lights that responded based on certain conditions (door bell, temp, etc.) and another one told me about a theater seating program he had written. Those people made it to the top of my pile, literally, because he showed mildly relevant interests, but more importantly their interest to create and then solve their own problems.


* Be sure of yourself. 

I met a couple of candidates who would hardly say a thing, but had a great resume, and I thought less of them than someone who had a worse resume, but good focus on their strengths. This may be tough for many of you, but it's important. At a career fair I'm not looking at a bland piece of paper, I'm looking at you. Do I want you at my company? Do I want to work with you? Do I want to hear about your side projects or your hobbies? If you can't throw little bits of info out there to make yourself unique or interesting, then all I have is your GPA, good or bad.


* Look nice and memorable (if possible)

I could tell who had thrown on a polo, and who had had their suit dry cleaned. They probably tell you to wear calming colors (blues, whites, etc.) but I noticed the more vibrant choices (red shirts, stark black shirts) I could also tell who had come as an after thought; not shaven messier hair, quickly made resumes, and who had been planning for a while; nice haircut/make-up/shaven ironed shirt, etc. If you need help with some of this stuff, go ask your advisor or the career center, they're all really nice and will probably enjoy your cute plea for help.


**If you have any questions, feel free to ask them. (work is slow at the moment so I've got some time)**"
1b3xrk,3,2013-03-27,27[M] having trouble understanding actions of 25[F],[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1b3xrk/27m_having_trouble_understanding_actions_of_25f/,"I have a long history with this one girl I met in Amsterdam. We had been together for a couple of years before she moved to London for what was supposed to be an internship. Her internship turned into something longer and at some point we agreed to break it off. We tried to do long distance for about 6 months or so but I think we both agreed we weren't really wired for doing this type of arrangement. She was too poor to really see me regularly so it was mostly on me to fly over. We cut it off with the view that we could move on with our lives and try again when we were in the same city again. There was no cheating involved and we parted on good terms.

Chances are that she will return within another year or so. I have to visit London pretty regularly for work and I have family there, so quite often I am staying for weekends and seeing her. There is still a large amount of attraction there, and we usually end up hooking up but it's always pretty difficult and emotions and discussions are generally involved.

Last time I was there, we spent the weekend together, had a great timne, we slept in the same bed but she just wanted me to hold her and I respected her wishes (despite protests). I know that she is sleeping with someone else. She tells me that it is meaningless, and that she loves me and that we have something special that she doesn't have with anyone else. She tells me that she is not feeling happy about her sex life right now and wanted to just lie together rather than have sex. She has had a history of having hangups sexually, with a habit of validating self-esteem issues through sleeping with other people that she is trying to move past. 

But all the same she is still occasionally sleeping with this other guy. Personally as a male, I try to be understanding but it obviously infuriates me given this fact she refuses to sleep with me. On the other hand, it could be a case of trying to have my cake and eating it too, it is not like I have not had casual relations with other people since we broke it off as well.

I guess the bottom line is that I still love her, and have thoughts about trying again once she moves back to Amsterdam. She has expressed that she feels the same. She is an honest person and I trust her so I believe that she is not intentionally trying to deceive me, but I think sometimes things go on below the surface that people do not want to admit to themselves. I don't pretend to understand women, I kind of follow where she is coming from but I wonder if any of the women here can relate to what she is saying here to set my mind at ease.

PS. I know my love life's a mess and a more sane person would be excused for moving on, but life doesn't always work that way. Please refrain from making comments that she is a bitch and is obviously playing me or whatever.

TL;DR Girl tells me she loves me yet she is casually sleeping with another guy while refusing to sleep with me. Does this make any sense?"

 * Someone to focus entirely on helping Boom create/edit/maintain the Gym League that is coming to contests. I may need 2 people to help be co-chairs in the league and take on various duties when it comes to monitoring etc.

 * Referees for various league and tournament based battles. If a contest has a requirement to wi-fi battle - it would come to the referee to gather all results and work with both parties to start/finish/report those results and matches to the league leadership. Various other duties within the scope of the league and monitoring everything will also be a part of the work.

 * Specialists in various sub-reddit maintenance - that means someone good with figuring out a bot, someone good with figuring out logos, spreadsheets, banners, lots of media, and organizing it and making it easily accessible to our subscribers. That means either in league play, or outside league play - as the league will require its own icon format in flair and otherwise. Lots of specifics here so if someone was interested, we would have a lot to talk about :)

 * Head of ""HR"" - Basically someone who is in charge of organizing the submitters, league leaders, refs, and anyone below the Moderator in an effort to maintain a fast-working and streamlined leadership and functional ""government"" here, if you will.

 * Master of Rewards - I need a moderator to be focused entirely on creating a list of all rewards given out, from who, to who, and when. This is in an effort to have the most precise and clear database of transactions following tournaments and contests - as well as giving us a very clear picture of the users taking part in various activities here. If issues were found, i.e a cheater or any other issue, the Master would then confer with other moderators to deal with the matter. Just to name a few of his many duties.

 * Internship-Moderators - These Moderators are going to be either full mods, or asked to help assist with our other duties here on PC by fulfilling other positions within the ""Moderation Spectrum"". This includes so many things that it is really hard to name them all, but throughout the thread my responses have a few clews to the duties, and as we take you on the reason it is an internship is to see how you *deal* with the problems you are faced with. 


 All that being said please remember guys, moderating can be fun, but it is also a very serious thing to us here. We are aiming for this to be one of the strongest Pokemon-based Subs out there and without the proper backbone none of that can be accomplished.

 I hope I can count you all among the loyalists to this sub, and know you will always spread the good word and help make this an even STRONGER place to be. That's right, STRONG mofos! :P

 Boom out.

PM me if you have questions - if I don't respond within a few hours, send the same PM again (Been having box overflow issues pushing messages out somehow.. so yea.. sorry guys, busy busy)

 Side note: *I am looking for someone to help me just personally, not be my secretary or some shit, be my confidant, and a go-to guy for me. Someone I can bounce ideas off of, and who has ideas of their own. Interested in the sub, interested in making it a better place, feel like maybe you take things more seriously than everyone else? Maybe hit me up and see if you'd want to help alongside me carry the weight of duties here at PC and assist in making this the best sub we have seen in our Pokemon Community YET.

I dropped it yesterday, it's in a jelly case and it landed face down. No visible damage. I can hear it operating when I get an email it makes a sound, I can also see that the screen is lit up and when it is off. It responds to my touch, as I can hear the apps operating.

This morning, I quickly turned it on and the screen flashed so I could see the home screen (hooray!), and shut off again immediately to the dark screen that shows me it is on, just not projecting the image.

I am unsure what other information you would need, but like I said, as a recent grad making minimum wage, about to take on an unpaid internship in Toronto while my family lives in Nova Scotia, I really can't spend more than a hundred or a hundred and fifty.

1b3nev,2,2013-03-27,Chairsofting Pays Pretty Well,[deleted],airsoft,https://www.reddit.com/r/airsoft/comments/1b3nev/chairsofting_pays_pretty_well/,"I've been a hardcore chairsofter ever since I decided to upgrade my Echo1 MP5 four years ago.  I saw something on AirsoftForum about making MOSFETs so I decided that I was going to make one myself, so I bought a soldering iron and taught myself how to use it, specifically for that purpose.  

Over the next few years I would solder other stuff, like replacing blown out capacitors on a motherboard which were keeping me from being able to adjust the voltage to get the overclock I wanted, or I'd make more MOSFETs, and generally solder any project I had that normal people would just twist wires and forget about.  

Then I went off to college for computer engineering and took an embedded systems class.  With that knowledge, I built a computer controller circuit for Kuba HPA engines and taught myself even more about microcontrollers, circuits, and programming.

A year later, as the end of sophomore year in college approaches, I find myself looking for internships.  During interviews, I found that out of all the stuff on my resume, that single line at the very bottom of my resume that said ""Basic embedded systems experience though hobbies."" garnered the most interest.  They would ask me about that, and I would elaborate on how I designed the circuit in AutoCAD, etched it on a PCB, soldered everything onto it, and then programmed it and debugged it.  And then they would ask what kinds of components I used.  And then they would ask about MOSFETs and transistors and whether I knew anything about them.  One guy told me after a phone interview that I knew more than quite a few graduates did on the subject.

As a result of that, I have a white collar job this summer at $22 an hour with a well known company.  That's more than quite a few jobs that require a degree, and better than most of my friends who have offers for internships, and I have a less than stellar GPA and only two years of college.  As odd as it may be, airsoft gave me that experience with electronics that I wouldn't have had otherwise, and gave me something to talk about with potential employers that could actually be counted as relevant experience when most of the people I'm competing with talked about how they worked at McDonalds or HEB.

This was just something I realized while I was in the shower, and that a few weeks ago I posted in the thread on how airsoft had affected my life that it didn't at all, and I was wrong."

It got to the point where I've been ""floating"" by, unsure of where I wanted to go professionally, and highly skeptical of my abilities as a student and a future employee. My trauma has also caused me to be very skeptical about a happy, stable, or productive future and taking big steps towards it without extreme anxiety. Not a good place to be by the end of your sophomore year of college, trust me.

However... today I drafted my first resume with a LOT of help from a career counselor! It really opened my eyes to a lot of my accomplishments I normally downplay. It was a HUGE hurdle I jumped over. I still don't feel qualified enough to apply for a good internship, but I at least made an action plan to aim for one for next summer, and to get my GPA up a little and find a job for the summer.

Then (yes, there's more!) I was hanging around my department's undergrad lounge when I ended up chatting with a professor I've been on good terms with. I don't have him for any classes (he's an ABC engineering professor, I'm majoring in XYZ engineering), but since ABC and XYZ are in the same department, I've seen him frequently enough to know where he is. He mentioned sort of offhandedly that he was looking for undergrads interested in research and I practically jumped out of my seat with enthusiasm. He asked me what I was doing that afternoon and invites me to his research team meeting to get a feel for things and see if I was interested.

So now I also have a research position on campus! It's hard to get one as an undergrad, so I feel really grateful to have this opportunity! I almost wanted to cry walking back home because I feel like I'm really growing into the person I'm meant to be and recovering from my trauma. :)"

1b3fb0,15,2013-03-27,Volunteer web development -- are my team leader's expectations reasonable? [reposted from cscareerquestions],Mason_son_of_Math,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1b3fb0/volunteer_web_development_are_my_team_leaders/,"**UPDATE: I'm going to try doing it on my own, thanks for the advice everyone.**

Hey everyone,

I've joined a small organization at my school that wants to build a website. The project has had a lot of trouble getting off the ground, and it started almost a year ago.

The goal is to create a website that would allow users to ask other users questions in an interview-style format (sort of like posting text on someone's wall on FB; there's the original post, and then that post has comment replies). It would eventually have features like categories (for finding users), a spam filter, a profanity filter.

We were originally a team of about six programmers, but the leader had different goals (he wanted to make money; we just wanted to make a volunteer effort) so he left and others got discouraged and left too.

That was last school year. This school year we had a somewhat more organized effort, better funding, and so on and so forth. We had a team of three developers, until our lead (or most-seasoned) developer left to pursue her own projects and try to get an internship. So now I'm getting pretty discouraged. We have barely accomplished anything--we have a few URLs with some minimally-functional views and barebones html. The other guy hasn't pushed code in four months, so it's basically down to me as the sole coder now.

I'm trying to convince the leader of this organization that he needs more people, especially since it's a volunteer effort and we're all undergrad students. But he keeps saying that ""he doesn't ask much"" of us and ""all we need to do is put in a little time"". We coders were naive/inexperienced at the beginning, so I'm pretty sure we severely underestimated the man-hours this would require. It seems like a full-blown web development project, something that would at least cost a thousand bucks to pay someone to write.

[Am I wrong?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQl5aYhkF3E) It's true that I've been procrastinating--partly because of school, personal, and job concerns--but it's mostly because I'm concerned this project will never get off the ground, and I'm better off doing a solo project so I'll at least have something in my portfolio.

What I'm most curious about is, if someone were to commission a website like this from you, how much would you charge? How long would it take? Then factor in the consideration that I'm basically getting along with djangobook and the Django documentation. I have no prior web development experience, only super basic programs in C++. (We're writing it in Python 2.7 with Django).

Many thanks."

Background: I graduated with a BA in anthropology in 2006, spent three years working in an office starting at a computer, then moved overseas where I taught English in Korea and Thailand, worked on farms in Australia, and am currently volunteering on the Thai/Burma border teaching young adult Karenni refugees about human rights.

I'm moving back to the States in a couple of months and would love love LOVE to find work with a nonprofit.  My favorite field is refugee resettlement, but that stretches to things like nutrition, womens health, empowerment, community development, esl, etc.

So...how do I go about getting a nonprofit career?  Most of the interesting positions I find are volunteering or internships (including some REALLY AMAZING-looking Americorps VISTA positions) and while I understand that that's a great way to gain experience and show dedication, and I can totally commit to six months of unpaid internship (or a year of VISTA) I can't not get paid for longer than that.  

-how easy is it to turn volunteer work/internship into a paying job?
-in my case (2 years of efl, 4 months volunteering with Burmese refugees, some grant writing) would an internship or a masters degree be more valuable?
-what is YOUR nonprofit job, is it paid, and how did you end up there?  What unpaid steps did you take in that direction?

If you have any other input for a directionless nonprofiteer, please share.  I'm not the only one who can benefit!"

I realize I shouldn't be too optimistic about the kind of change I'd make with it, but that's another post.

What I'm trying to figure out is the role of Americorps in my career development.  I really would like to work for a nonprofit, and I'm particularly interested in refugee resettlement and the issues that surround that.  

How does Americorps fit into your career plan?  What do you feel you've got out of it?  Did it (or can it) lead to a paying position with your organization?  How valuable is the experience, when compared to, say, volunteering with an organization while working elsewhere?

I've seen Americorps volunteers move from VISTA to unpaid internships, and I wonder how common or helpful that is, because while I'm totally willing to commit to a year in poverty, I can't imagine taking an unpaid internship afterward and still not having a paying position in my field.  If that were the case, I'd rather have a paying position elsewhere and continue to volunteer.

Any insight?  Any former volunteers willing to talk about their next steps?

1b3c9c,2,2013-03-27,I'm in the homestretch and I've learned a lot about myself. ,SlapYourFap,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1b3c9c/im_in_the_homestretch_and_ive_learned_a_lot_about/,"I'm writing this right now because I'm unable to sleep tonight because I'm so anxious for what will happen. You guys might remember my success post a few weeks back, and since then I've continued to improve my life.

Well, my 90 days are almost up and I'm proud I was able to do this on my first try. I'm almost feeling nostalgic looking back at the person I was 4 months ago, 22 pounds heavier than I am now, out of shape, with a failing GPA, no girlfriend, and addicted to weed, porn, and video games. I challenged myself to change everything, and here I am after improving my GPA by over a point, a 6 month paid internship, a girlfriend, and for the first time in a long while: happy. 

I think the first step in making any sort of transformation is to do two things:

First you must identify those things about yourself that you cannot change, and accept them. These may not always be clear. To be honest, I thought that my fetish for transgender MtFs was solely because I somehow got roped into the experience through porn. However, I actually delved into my mind during some of the runs I went on over the past 2 months and discovered that a blurring of the genders always interested me in some fashion (going back to some movie I saw when I was 8 when a guy turned into a girl and it blew my mind). So I told myself this was not something that would change, it was something I would need to accept about myself...maybe not broadcast to the world (as it is not generally accepted) but it would simply have to live with it. 

Second you must discover what it is that you can change. I knew everything I could change: my weight, my GPA, everything. And I got angry at myself. I asked myself why I wasn't accomplishing these things. I asked why my peers could be so successful and I was failing at just about everything in life. I was a fuck up, and I knew it. So I decided to completely change myself and how I view myself. If you consider yourself a stoner, you will always be the kind of person who wants to smoke pot and you will spend time with other stoners, perpetuating that mindset for yourself. The same thing goes with porn. Simply envision yourself as a person who does not watch porn, it's just not who you are.

I know that no fap definitely improved my sex life, there is no question there. It fixed just about every issue I had with my penis. Other than that, I'm really not sure if it helped my focus and my concentration. I'd like to think it helped me have more energy, but I just can't tell at this point. We'd all like to think that it's simply a panacea for just about everything, but it's not. It's just a piece of the puzzle for me, but it's definitely helped. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, and most people may never need to do it. But the mere fact that you are here reading this, the admission in your mind that something may be askew or amiss, is evidence enough to me that you should at least try it. And if you're here as a fellow fapstronaught looking for advice or motivation, know this: I can't help you, only you can help you. True change comes from within.

Other than that, I wish the greatest of luck to those of you who are just starting. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask them in the comments and I will answer them to the best of my ability. "

I'm finishing up college and I got an internship for the summer.

I don't want to accidentally buy too small of a bag, and realize I need more, but I don't want to buy a bag that turns out to be massive for what I carry. 

Do most of you bring a laptop to work? Do you bring a tablet of any kind? Notebooks?

I have an internship and a part time design job under my belt, plus the two or three years it took me to complete my university's graphic design program. 

In the very first graphic design class I took, my instructor told the class that years in school count as legitimate experience. I rolled my eyes then, but now that I'm more aware of the field I'm entering, I realize I know plenty of people who seemed to have just woken up one day and said ""I'm going to give design a shot."" 

I've encountered plenty of theses people, and they range from drawing majors who realized there are no jobs for them upon graduation, some 19 year-old with a Macbook and a pirated version of CS4, and the occasional hipster that thinks thick-rimmed glasses and obscure tastes makes a creative. 

Granted, I like to think these types are greatly outnumbered by those who didn't fall into graphic design by accident. That being said, they're still out there, and I can't help but feel that several years of classroom experience count a bit more than the good intentions of an individual entering the workforce untrained. 

So what does everyone think? Was my instructor right, or would I be exaggerating if I said that I have a couple years of experience already?"

I have a question about engineering internships. First off I am a junior chemical engineering student. I have been offered 2 internships. One is with a very large mechanical engineering company. I would be doing lots of mechanical work building compressors. The other is with a smaller electric company. For this one I would be at a coal power plant working along side the senior chemical engineer. 

Here are my concerns,
I would like to work in the electric company because the internship would directly relate to my degree and I would be getting experience in my field. But since it is a coal power plant and coal is a dying source of energy I'm worried if this will look the best on my resume and if this will help me the most in the long run.
The mechanical company is really big and I do really want to get into the oil and gas field later in life. This company could offer me more connections into the business. But will the experience away from my field of study effect my options.

Thanks guys
Would love to hear any ideas. "

I've joined a small organization at my school that wants to build a website. The project has had a lot of trouble getting off the ground, and it started almost a year ago.

The goal is to create a website that would allow users to ask other users questions in an interview-style format (sort of like posting text on someone's wall on FB; there's the original post, and then that post has comment replies). It would eventually have features like categories (for finding users), a spam filter, a profanity filter.

We were originally a team of about six programmers, but the leader had different goals (he wanted to make money; we just wanted to make a volunteer effort) so he left and others got discouraged and left too.

That was last school year. This school year we had a somewhat more organized effort, better funding, and so on and so forth. We had a team of three developers, until our lead (or most-seasoned) developer left to pursue her own projects and try to get an internship. So now I'm getting pretty discouraged. We have barely accomplished anything--we have a few URLs with some minimally-functional views and barebones html. The other guy hasn't pushed code in four months, so it's basically down to me as the sole coder now.

I'm trying to convince the leader of this organization that he needs more people, especially since it's a volunteer effort and we're all undergrad students. But he keeps saying that ""he doesn't ask much"" of us and ""all we need to do is put in a little time"". We coders were naive/inexperienced at the beginning, so I'm pretty sure we severely underestimated the man-hours this would require. It seems like a full-blown web development project, something that would at least cost a thousand bucks to pay someone to write.

[Am I wrong?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQl5aYhkF3E) It's true that I've been procrastinating--partly because of school, personal, and job concerns--but it's mostly because I'm concerned this project will never get off the ground, and I'm better off doing a solo project so I'll at least have something in my portfolio.

What I'm most curious about is, if someone were to commission a website like this from you, how much would you charge? How long would it take? Then factor in the consideration that I'm basically getting along with djangobook and the Django documentation. I have no prior web development experience, only super basic programs in C++. (We're writing it in Python 2.7 with Django).

Many thanks."

Recently, I've started getting into programming and it seems awesome (My work place actually teaches it but only for admin uses, which I still plan on taking) and I wanted to completely computerize 2 of my daily tasks. 

Which are:
(1) going onto ""Website A"" and cross checking the information to make sure it matches up with ""Website B"" none of it is hard and any monkey can do it, but it's just incredibly tedious

(2) I am in charge of making the certificates for the people who take some of our classes and attend them and mail it to them. what I want to do is, basically open program, then go through classes for ""x"" date open each class that appears and then click on a certain phrase (Roster) and click on another phrase (that opens all the attendees names on a blank certificate on a bunch of microsoft word files that we then open each one individually and print) and its all very tedious

What program should I download and where can I start learning how to make a program that can do that for me

I have seen many posts where someone mentions how much they smoke but they follow it up with something like, ""but I'm a 4.5 GPA honors college student who is captain of the school's football team as well as an intern at NASA with Neil deGrasse Tyson."" There are many different levels of smokers, yes and some are not as productive as others but we are all united in the fact that we all enjoy cannabis, why try to convince us that it's okay if we're all doing it?

Secondly, there's been an influx of ""This is why weed should be legal guys:"" posts and I find it absolutely silly that we are trying to convince each other of a thought we all share. ""Medical marijuana is great! Legalize it!"" Of course it's great but why not take your argument to /r/politics? /r/conservativeparty? Why are we acting like it's brave to post these things on a subreddit related to cannabis? This is called a confirmation bias and it's no different than the people who want cannabis to stay illegal, they are reading news reports from FOX news that are telling them that cannabis legalization is the leading cause of gay marriage in this country and it's all a plot by the democrats to kill freedom (I apologize to any right wingers that are reading this that actually have an open mind, it's just the easiest caricature I could think of). 

If we are going to stand up on our soapbox, let's make a rousing speech to the people who matter right now; to the people who DON'T know about the benefits of cannabis, to the people who have the wrong idea, to the people who aren't a part of this counter culture, to the people who are voting ""NO"" when it comes to the issue of legalization. If you tell me a story about how alcohol is a billion times worse than cannabis, I'll believe you. Why? Because I don't necessarily like what alcohol does to me when I'm drunk (I'll have a few tasty beers now and again but I try not to get drunk. Ever.) and I prefer smoking cannabis over drinking. Try using the same story on a different audience and gauge that response to how well thought out your argument is. Let's all do actually do our part and have an open and honest discussion with people who are opposed to legalization/medical cannabis and see if we can win them over.

TL;DR: Let's stop convincing each other that cannabis is okay and try talking and convincing people who actually DON'T want it legalized. There's no point coming up with a discussion topic if 100% of your audience is agreeing with you."

My boyfriend ""Y"" and I have been dating for a total of 3 years. He's 20 and I'm 19. We go to the same STEM university, him for computer science and me for chemical engineering. We'll be moving into a lovely apartment next fall, along with 3 other people. We've already lived together before when he needed to get out of his parents' house, so I know it's going to be nice. Why I'm writing this post: My boyfriend has a lot of problems, and they're becoming hard for both of us to try and handle..

1. My boyfriend has depression. We are sure of that; he's seen a mental health professional, and it runs in both sides of the family. His mother has it and is taking pills for it, his biological dad has it and as far as I know, is not taking anything for it. ""Y"" is not on anything for it yet. He doesn't like the idea of medication, and was reluctant to even start a spasm-controling medicine to help him with his IBS. I understand his aversion to depression medication; a lot of the side effects seem really scary. His mom has really been pushing him to get on the pills she is on, but the way she asks him is not productive. His depression is aiding in a lot of other problems.
2. Dental work = hell. He is terrified of the dentist. This is mostly due to childhood experiences where he would cry and cry, his mother would yell, and they would end up leaving the dentist after 2 hours of this. His mother was not very stable when he was younger (divorce, anger management issues, depression) but she is much, much better now. Anyways, I feel so awful for ""Y"". Because of his childhood fear of the dentist, he never got his teeth flouridated or whatever, and so he's had awful dental problems. This runs on his dad's side of the family. He's needed 4 cavities filled, after which his dental hygene became REALLY good, but he's still needed 2 root canals, and will need fillings. this leads into the next part..
3. He had a seizure when he was getting his fillings. How awful. It was new years eve. I sat along side him after too many blood samples and tests. It was so bad, I wanted to cry after seeing all the pain he was in from the needles and his aching back and head. His family had absolutely 0 history of seizures. ""Y"" is now even more terrified of going back to the dentist to finish his fillings. He can't drive until July, by law. Stressful. After much deliberation, the neurologist recommended him anti-seizure medication. He's terrified of being so dependent on a drug.
4. IBS. Enough said.
5. Not doing well in school, due to all the problems listed above + bad childhood. He has no motivation, but if he doesn't pass this year, he will have to owe 25000 and may not be able to move onto next year. He's doing well in most of his current classes, but need to finish a lot of work from last semester that he got extended due to severe stomach pain (IBS).

It's so much to handle. I love him. We are both at our wits end. ""College is the best time of your life"", WOW, what bull shit. Anyone who said that should be shot in the head. I'm so mad. We're the most stressed out in our lives, there seems to be no solution to anything. 

He recently said he thinks he needs to take anti-depression pills, if only to stop people from thinking he's not doing all he can to better himself. This goes against his values, and whether you agree with that or not, please understand that inner turmoil. I'm scared for the side effects. I'm so fucking scared and he is too.

We're both seeing counselors at our school. I'm doing well in school, but I've always enjoyed school and have always been very good at getting good grades.

My boyfriend is smart. SMART. He is such a fast learner, but once he learns it, he has no motive to do the homework related to it. He doesn't want to be here in school, but he didn't see any other option that was viable. 

I don't know what to do. I don't want to break up, so unless that's the absolute only advice there is, please tell me something else. I feel like he and I are a strong couple; we have good communication, respect, all of it. We're both just so worn out.

Neither of us got any internships for the summer, and that was a huge blow. We feel terrible and hopeless.

Sorry, this is really long. I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm worried for ""Y"". I just want things to fast-forward to where we're 26 or something, and past all of this bullshit. I am so resentful of everyone who gets to have fun or gets a co-op/internship, while we have to deal with all of these problems that just are fucking CRUSHING. We need so much more money to pay for all of these things than we have. Seriously, money would help so much right now. Dental work, apartment, he has no insurance, SCHOOL. ugh

Julie: I'm an intern, I'm 17--

Amir: Owch.

Julie: Um, I'm on--

Amir: Your period, we know.

Julie: A special high school mentor-ship.

Julie: I'm actually 16, I- I lied to seem older but I'd prefer if everyone knew my real age.

Amir: Yeah, Paul also said that his favorite movie was Con Air but nobody called him out on that!

Jake: You did! *Where* did you get that vest?

Amir: Allow me to give *Jake's* interesting fact, we're in love.

Streeter: Okay, what?

Amir: That's right! I once shot 3 holes in one in a row it wasn't an accident either, the killing.

Julie: You *monster*.

Amir: I am a monster. On the golf course I take no prisoners. Also I will never un-see that child's face. Every blink is a reminder and every time my eyes aren't open she's just in my minds eye, taunting me. (Makes a scary face). *Bleh*.

Michael: How could you do that?

Amir: How could *you* do that? Crystal Skull? We saw that, it was garbage! I killed a child? (Amir starts crawling to where Michael is sitting across the table). Yeah, well you killed a franchise!

I took an accounting class last fall and casually mentioned it on my resume, which I've sent out to 25+ internship listing. I was surprised to get a phone call from a recruiter who asked me if I'd be interested in an accounting clerk position. I'm a math major and would have much preferred something that involved more math, but beggars can't be choosers.

She's now sent my resume and I might be working as an accounting clerk during the summer. Now, I've only taken one course so I'm not sure what to expect. I don't have any real-life experience using accounting, haven't used any softwares, etc.
It's not set in stone, but how should I prepare for an accounting clerk internship?

Thank you!"

I don't want my last impression to be a drunk one, even though I don't work for them anymore. 

Is it a good idea to stop by the office with my apologies or forget about it and move on because bringing it up will refresh a bad image since he might not have thought it a big deal? I don't want to assume my actions were forgiven since my boss was probably some drunk happy that night. What's the appropriate professional response?

Doing an Internship right now at a large IT company and hanging out with local computer nerds, so I don't see myself really meeting any more women, as computers are a global sausage fest.

I am working on a better me for the first time in my life, and it is wonderful. I cleared my credit card debt at the bank today, and such a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders that I was able to see a lot of different things for what they were and realize what was going on. I know many have it much worse than I, and I wish the absolute best for you. Maybe this post will be a moment of clarity, or maybe you'll just downvote it into oblivion. I don't care. I'm just glad I can express myself.

A year ago, I was working part time as an IT intern, graduating college in 2 months with absolutely no job prospects. I couldn't make rent (got a loan from parents), car was about to be uninsured (another loan from parents), and I was living off of credit card and checking advances. I maxed out my credit card at $2,000, paying the minimum and then spending it again, and went over my limit for about 4 straight months. It was getting very ugly very quickly.

I managed to get hired on a limited term contract where I was an intern for 6 months starting last June. I busted my tail all summer trying to convince them to keep me employed. I got no paid time off, making things somewhat difficult. I moved in July to a new apartment with a friend who was going to split the rent. He moved out 2 months later, and the only way to avoid paying double the rent I budgeted for, or living with someone on craigslist, was to make a new arrangement in which I am paying 85% of rent, and all of the bills. With all of the legal holidays in November and December, I lost a large amount of pay, and continued to bounce back and forth between credit card and living off of 2 sandwiches a day.

I caught a break about 2 months before my end date at the limited term contract, when someone transferred out of a position, and I was able to get it. I also managed to get a small raise. Two months later, I got hired full time, with benefits and vacation, and a nice raise. Things were beginning to look up, but I was still hurting from the lost wages. 

Tax season came around, and I planned on clearing my credit card (or at least trying) with the money if I was able to. My step-dad (who does my taxes) called to let me know what my return was going to be. It was WELL over my remaining balance for my credit card, leaving some money to spare. I was floored.

My tax returns came yesterday and today. I was able to triple the amount I had in savings, get a hair cut for the first time in about 4 months, pay to have my car repaired, buy new contacts, and, most importantly, I FINALLY PAID OFF MY CREDIT CARD!!! I need to call tomorrow to cancel the card, and I will be cutting it up as soon as I get home after work tomorrow. I could not be more excited.

All of this has allowed me to go from not knowing how I was going to eat to being able to pay all of my own bills (including student loans), eliminate my credit card debt, and save money. It's a great feeling knowing that I can live independently and manage my finances. I have ALWAYS been terrible with money, which is how I got into this mess in the first place. Today begins a new chapter.

Not only have I managed to get my finances in order, but I got engaged to the love of my life and my best friend 3 months ago, and have been working to plan a wonderful wedding for Summer 2014. My fiancee just got accepted into graduate school, has an interview for a job tomorrow, and will be moving in with me in 2 months.

I also started changing my diet so that I could be a healthier person and enjoy my life about 4 months ago, and I managed to lose 20 lbs just by eating better. I recently started a workout routine to get my heart/body in better shape, and I already feel fantastic. Coming from someone who was so depressed and upset with the world that I attempted suicide a few years ago, I am turning my life around in every possible way I can find, and working on a better me for the first time in almost 24 years. It feels amazing to finally see some good in myself. I just wanted to share the turnaround that I've had in my life in hopes that someone may see it as a moment of clarity and inspiration in their own life to begin working on a better them. "

My name is Beth. I am currently a 1L (1st year) student at St. Mary’s University School of Law in Texas. Since a young age, I knew I wanted to be an attorney. Now here I am, finishing my first year of law school in just a matter of weeks. Finals are around the corner, and each day brings me closer to graduating, taking the bar, and finally reaching one of my many goals.

This year, I had the opportunity to apply for St. Mary’s Institute on Chinese Law and Business Program. I also submitted my résumé in order to obtain a coveted internship with a Chinese Law Firm. I am pleased to announce that I was chosen for an internship, and will be representing St. Mary’s University School of Law as the first intern with this particular international law firm. 

Here is some information from the school website:

“St. Mary's University School of Law in San Antonio and Beihang University in Beijing invite students to participate in a summer program on the law of representing clients doing business with China. St. Mary's University School of Law Institute on Chinese Law and Business is a program of legal studies that prepares law students for the challenges of representing clients doing business with Chinese partners. Through an array of business-related courses, field trips, and guest speakers, the Institute introduces students to the Chinese legal system and the instruments of international and domestic law governing cross-border sales of goods, protection of intellectual property and investments.”

This is a wonderful opportunity for me. I have always wanted to study abroad, but I was usually working during non-school hours. I promised myself that if the opportunity ever came up again, I would do whatever I could to be a part of the program.

The time is now. I have chosen two courses I will take during the summer. I have an amazing internship waiting for me. Now I need to get there!

Here is where you come in. I’m asking whoever is reading this to please donate whatever amount you would like in order to allow me to purchase my airline ticket and other travel related items.  The prices go up every week. I have saved half so far, but need help with the other half. Unfortunately, financial aid for the 2012-2013 school year cannot be applied to 2013-2014.  

If you have any questions, please e-mail me at SendBethToChina@gmail.com

Much obliged,
Beth

When: May 26 to June 29, 2013
Where: Beihang University in Beijing

So I'll be graduating in December with a degree in Media Studies from a small urban northeastern University. To be quite honest, my college career has not been stellar. I putted around for a while, I'm pulling about a 3.0 GPA and haven't done much outside the classroom work besides a sketch comedy group that I only recently joined. Most of my free time has been spent trying to keep myself afloat by working various low-paying retail jobs.



I've gotten in touch with my advisor about possibly becoming a TA and am currently working with a professor on making this happen. I'm unsure on the likelihood that I will be able to become a TA, simply because this professor has never used one and is unfamiliar with the process. Despite this, my advisor and Professor both seem cautiously optimistic.


In the coming months I'd like to build my resume with teaching experience but I fear finding the time to do so will be difficult. Obviously if the TA position works out it would be great, but that alone couldn't get me a job. the only other teaching ""experience"" I have would be a winter in High School when I taught 4th graders how to ski. Obviously I'd need to beef up my resume a bit. 

So two questions; 

*what volunteer positions, internships or entry level jobs can I get involved with to help boost a teaching resume? Obviously if I'm supporting myself in an expensive city, time commitment to a non paying job is a big factor.

*As teachers, what do you look for in a TA? 

Thanks guys! Ideally I'd like to be a full time teacher by September 2014. Any advice you could lend me would be amazing."

I don't know what I'm doing typing this on reddit instead of getting back out there, especially since I don't post on many subs often, but I found this sub, so I'm going to post.

Hello fellow thespians!  Let me tell you my story.  I have long since graduated college, where I majored in (among other majors and minors) theatre arts.  I spent many hours back stage, but even more onstage.  Much of my education was focused on either acting, writing, or producing.  I enjoyed making props, and sets, and to this day I'm an avid playwright (unpublished, obviously).  However, it's been just about three years since I've been onstage.  I haven't had a voice lesson in almost as long, and my last work in theatre ended sourly because of an internship with a company that I saw was being run into the ground, and I decided  it wasn't for me.

Now, it's some time later.  I'm back living on the east coast, after some travel, and find myself able to revisit the reasons I wanted to be onstage in the first place.  Here's where I get worried, and suppose the reason I am posting: in my time without theatre I have become rather... illustrated.  Tattoos and piercings are a rather big part of my life.  I'm not saying that I am covered to the point of not being able to hide them, but a full ""sleeve"" and scattered pieces make me more tattooed than the average person, let alone actor.  I can tell you I am a good actor... not the best, there's always work, but I do the work, and the text, and it shows.  

My big fears are: will it be like riding a bike? I've been steadily reading plays, and practicing monologues for fun. Also, just how bad will tattoos inhibit my ability to be cast?  I live in a very progressive city/area, so I know that I have opportunity regardless, but is there still that stigma around tattoos in acting? Lastly headshots, and resume.  I need a new headshot, which won't be so bad, I know a lot of professional photogs, but my resume is pretty much worthless now I feel like.  What do I add to say what I've been doing for this time?

Any help, advice, and encouragement is very welcome."

I've been trying to figure out how to get an internship but none of the seminars I've been to have offered any direction as they're only offered for course credit and I don't meet the GPA requirements for it.

I've tried to get a job during previous vacation periods but I've either been turned down or responded to right before classes resumed when I couldn't accept. 

I've asked a few of my friends that graduated already and they've told me that they've waited till after they graduated to look for a job but that doesn't seem wise especially for someone in my position.

Is there anything I could do to set myself straight?"

I chose not major in that as an undergrad because of the decreased likelihood of getting a job without a graduate degree. ChemE with a biochem-eng concentration is a good lead-in that still offers jobs security in the event that grad school doesn't work out. My current plan still involves going to grad school, but I'm no longer certain that microbio is exactly what I want anymore.  I've been tossing around a few ideas, namely:

* Microbiology/virology/immunology
* Mechanical engineering (due to the fact that all of the MechE internships seem infinitely more interesting than those I've seen for ChemEs)
* Polymer science (I currently work as an undergraduate researcher in the PolSci department at my school; it was unexpected, and I enjoy it a lot more than I had originally expected).

Are there any pros/cons to any of these?  For example, are jobs involving viral research even a commonality in the ""real world""?  And does anybody have any alternative suggestions?  I just know that I don't want to go right into industry; ChemE isn't really my thing."

I just need any help and motivation that I can get. Any advice or help will be useful, but here are some points to get this discussion rolling.

* Where should I even be looking for jobs?
Right now the sites I know about are Indeed and Monster. I also check craigslist, but honestly most of those jobs seem too shady. I used to check more sites but I've stopped and forgotten some because, y'know, depression and whatnot.

* What should I be doing at home, outside of searching, to make me a more enticing candidate?
Like I've said, I can't afford to volunteer or intern so most of my time is spent at the location of my idiomatic heart. Despite this I have been doing more than just watching myself grow old, I've dedicated my time doing a lot of my time to reading good books, learning how to play the guitar (of which I'm making good progress), and brushing up on my german skills. I'm certain there's something I could be adding to my daily routine to make me a better prospect.

* I've been out of work for a year, how do I explain this?
I've been advised by a few to get imaginative.

* If I do take a job outside of my industry, how do I get back on track?

What now?",[deleted],GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/1b68cf/i_have_a_degree_but_very_little_job_experience/,"I'm really at a complete loss of what to do at this point. Looking for a job now just instantly gives me the worst form of depression (even writing this is hard for me) because I've become so discouraged. 

I'd like to find a job in my industry (something related marketing in the fields of the arts and entertainment), but in my current position I can't afford to be choosy. However, I have tried to apply for some low level retail jobs and got turned down for those too.

I just need any help and motivation that I can get. Any advice or help will be useful, but here are some points to get this discussion rolling.

* Where should I even be looking for jobs?
Right now the sites I know about are Indeed and Monster. I also check craigslist, but honestly most of those jobs seem too shady. I used to check more sites but I've stopped and forgotten some because, y'know, depression and whatnot. I guess it's also worth mentioning here that I'm from NYC.

* What should I be doing at home, outside of searching, to make me a more enticing candidate?
Like I've said, I can't afford to volunteer or intern so most of my time is spent at the location of my idiomatic heart. Despite this I have been doing more than just watching myself grow old, I've dedicated my time doing a lot of my time to reading good books, learning how to play the guitar (of which I'm making good progress), and brushing up on my german skills. I'm certain there's something I could be adding to my daily routine to make me a better prospect.

* I've been out of work for a year, how do I explain this?
I've been advised by a few to get imaginative.

* If I do take a job outside of my industry, how do I get back on track?
This a huge concern for me, as I don't want to be stuck in something I loathe. Volunteering weekends is one nugget of advice I've been given. Anything else?

Main reason was I wanted to work in different area of company. Had really positive reviews on exit interview

So I reached phone interview stage, and just got rejection email. I definitely didn't do amazingly well - but thought I'd done enough to get through considering I'd worked there, with good reviews, and I have a very strong résumé overall

Now after my phone interview I went out and got REALLY drunk that night.

Can't remember anything from about 12 onwards... At 3.01 am I had a 15 second phone call to interview number and then two more that were canceled at 3.56 am...

What could I have said at 3.01 call? Honestly have no idea and I had convinced myself it was a ""bum dial"" because straight after I bum dialled mom and left her a voice message where she could hear me talking to people... But feel uneasy that I may have been in state of mind to call and let interviewer know she did crap job interviewing...

I have opening to call for feedback, should I do it or just bury my head in sand? Would 3 random calls at 3 am be enough to say no, if I didn't say anything. And how do I approach the convo? Act like I didn't know I called them, I a thought it was just a bum dial, or take the tact that I was just upset with myself for not performing in phone interview which was why I did that?

Know the main HR girl as well (disappointed she didn't call me) and the fact that she didn't call to let me know makes me think it will be awkward convo about what I said. I definitely should have at least made it to face-to-face interview if they didn't reject me straight away I feel"

I actually ended up calling him back because otherwise I would have been late to class. My interview time is at 4:30pm next Thursday, which is completely strange to me as I know that is the time most companies close. 

After my classes today, my professor told me he would cancel his two classes next Wednesday. Since this frees up my schedule, Wednesday would actually be the more beneficial day to interview since I wouldn't have to miss anything (class or my internship). Would it be alright to call the company back and reschedule for Wednesday or am I stuck with a late interview time?

We don't mind sharing a single bedroom, but it's got to be near a T stop since I'll be without a car, and preferably near a grocery store. Also, easily accessible laundry / dry cleaners would be fantastic. And we don't have pets. 

The price is negotiable, but I've seen posts in the $800 - 1200 range, so I'm hoping we can land in there somewhere. Also, if it's furnished that would be SUPER awesome.

I can move in as early as May 7th, and the sublet can start a bit earlier, if need be. But, my internship is only about 8 weeks, so I don't need a place through August.

Can I get some perspective or advice?",dreamsaremadeof,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1b5ph5/i_22f_am_finding_it_impossible_to_come_to_terms/,"background -- I have been dating him for a little over 7 months, and we'd been friends for about 5 months prior to that. We are both in college in our third year, and this is our first serious relationship. I know I don't have experience, but I feel like we really click: we are similar in our attitude towards finances, religion, humor, friendships, and family relationships and values. Many of our friends are also couples and we have a lot of fun going out together to bowling, karaoke, bars, dining, and exploring. All in all, I have been so happy these past few months, and so lucky. 

Problem -- I will be graduating on time in one year, so spring of 2014. He will be graduating early one semester, so fall of 2013. The catch? Although we are the same heritage/ethnicity, I grew up in the States, while he is an international student and will be returning home to Hong Kong, where his parents currently live, after graduation. 

I like to think we are both realistic people. For international students on visas, it is nearly impossible to find a good job out of undergrad in business (which is what we are both studying), and he already has an internship back home for this summer that he will hopefully be able to turn into a full-time job after he graduates. I, on the other hand, will be interning in New York this summer (we had a similar arrangement last summer where he interned in Asia and I in the States, so nothing odd about this, and we both handled being faaar away from each other for months pretty well). I have always wanted to work abroad in Hong Kong-fell in love with the city when I visited it once in high school-but at this point this is just a dream and I have yet to make progress towards it, and cannot realistically put my hopes in it. I know anything can happen, but the more I think about it, the more I realize that after he leaves, I really don't see how or when we would be able to see each other again. 
I'm not sure how he feels about it since we haven't talked about it in depth (this is a conversation that I am dreading because I'm afraid I'll just burst into tears and turn in a useless pile of blubbering mess...any advice?), but I know that he also must dread the inevitable. This has been weighing on me a lot recently, even though I try to avoid thinking about it (I know, bad), to the point where, on the nights when we are not spending the night together (usually 3-5 nights of the week), I let myself get sad to the point of crying myself to sleep (I have literally never done this in my whole life, for anything). This whole thing is so bizarre to me because I have always been the solid one, the strong one, but I just feel like it's tearing me apart and I don't know how to deal with it. Has anyone ever been in this situation before, and do you have any advice for me? 

**tl;dr Bf is graduating one semester early this winter and going back to his home country to work (which is completely understandable and I support that 100%). I have no way of ensuring that my own dreams of working abroad in said country will come true, and cannot otherwise see how this relationship can continue no matter how much I want to. I am depressed, sad, frustrated, helpless.**"

**5,193** Fondation Agents for **3 years!**

**Item #:** SCP-1608-J

**Object Class:** Euclid

**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to difficulties inherent in containing the subject, it has been placed under a Level-4 HIPS protocol. Subject is to be kept at Site 31, confined in a minimum of four (4) magnetic-based storage devices. To facilitate access in periods of heightened study, copy of subject is allowed on faster, transient storage can be allowed by Level 3 Personnel currently assigned to containement duty. ~~Access to the subject is restricted to personnel with level 2 clearance or greater.~~ Although the subject should ideally be inaccessible to the general population, the memetic properties of Subject when reviewed by untrained personnel has been deemed to be research-worthy. Under order of O5-█, Subject should thus be available for public viewing. However, no one under Level 2 clearance must be made aware of the subject's properties. Disclosure to unauthorized personnel by Foundation members will be corrected with use of a Class A Amnesiac to the former and termination of the latter.

Description: Subject is a digital representation of reality. It describes various phenomenons using diverse forms of media, including - but not limited to - text, visual aids (both static and dynamic) and sound. After viewing Subject, Agents have reported symptoms ranging from slight apathy and distraction to heavy addiction. Experiment 1608-5 showed that personnel exposed to Subject for an amount of time as low as fifteen (15) minutes felt compelled to contribute to its storage of historical data. Caution must be exercised in such cases, as some subjects will attempt to submit accounts that are factually incorrect, either knowingly or due to faulty memory recall. Such subjects should be warned that their conduct is unacceptable, but should *never* be made aware of real reason for this rejection. That is, to comply with containement procedures, they must not realize that currently accepted data has been integrated in Subject because of its accuracy. Instead, the following boilerplate answers are to be used:

- The account's narrative style does not fit with accepted norms;  
- The account contradicts previously known data;  
- The account has already been submitted and refuted, or;  
- The account regards the termination of [SCP-682](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-682), which leads to [DATA EXPUNGED].

**Addendum 1608-J-1:** To anyone trying to make more people aware of Subject ""since the public is allowed to view it, and besides, it's so cool that it deserves the exposure""... Please don't. The risk of memetic contamination isn't worth it. And besides, our stock of Class A amnesiacs isn't infinite, and it would *really* be a *shame* to need to upgrade to Class C just because some [REDACTED] Class D decided to tell all of his friends about this.  
~ Dr. G██

**Interview 1608-J-A:**

**Interviewed:** ElXGaspeth (AKA Dr. Kens) and Nivek12, /r/SCP mods  
**Interviewer:** Dr. G██  
**Date:** ██-██-████  
**Location:** [DATA EXPUNGED]  

**&lt;Begin Log&gt;**

&gt;##1. How did you discover the SCP Foundation?
&gt;&gt; **Nivek12** I discovered the SCP Community after looking through several Unity game examples. Then I found the SCP-087 game which lead to the wiki and finally to this subreddit.  
&gt;&gt; **ElXGaspeth** I found it roughly four years ago in a link on Reddit, I believe. I checked it out, joined the chat, and applied the next day. Got in, and have been a part ever since.

&gt;##2. What is your favorite SCP?
&gt;&gt; **ElXGaspeth** Can I say most of them? I kid, but in all seriousness I love [SCP-1959](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1959). There's something spooky and sad about it, about being unable to control your own fate as you orbit your home, never to be able to return.

&gt;##3. I take it you've written/contributed to at least a couple... Which one of those are you the proudest of?
&gt;&gt; **ElXGaspeth** I only wrote one - [SCP-922](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-922), but I do have two other tales floating around. My most popular one is the [Audio Logs](http://www.scp-wiki.net/last-man-standing) of Dr. Kensington. I wrote that a few years ago.

&gt;##4. What is your biggest pet peeve when people write SCPs?
&gt;&gt; **Nivek12** That people believe all SCP articles need a sterile/clinical tone or must have every single detail explained. I find myself liking Foundation Tales more because they build a world in the reader's mind by using imaginative descriptions that wouldn't fit in a formal document. The visual imagery in Foundation Tales can convey and trigger such a wide variety of thoughts. There exists a sweet spot between a blunt story and a vague jumble of words, but when a writer hits it, readers can feel the ""what ifs"" creep into their minds.  
&gt;&gt; **ElXGaspeth** My biggest pet peeve is the same as Nivek's, but also the reverse case where writers will leave out too much and leave the reader confused about what was happening. It's a fine line to walk between telling and showing, but it's an important line to toe. Another peeve of mine is where people think ""Oh, and SCP article must be a scary/creepy/terrifying."" They don't have to be in order to be a good read.
Oh, and just because I'm senior staff doesn't mean I should be revered or whatever. I'm just another member like you, just with a few other duties. I'm usually in chat or in the forums if you need help.

&gt;##5. Any other words for aspiring writers?
&gt;&gt; **Nivek12** I believe that writing an SCP article shouldn't only be about how mysterious or creepy of an idea the author can come up with (though those certainly are characteristics of the majority of good SCPs). The author should also consider the impact on the reader. I'd say a good SCP is one that instills a strong urge/desire in a reader such that they would be willing to join a large community of strangers and devote hours to interacting with others who have nothing in common except for the author's article. What good is an idea if no one shares it?  
&gt;&gt; **ElXGaspeth** Don't be afraid to ask for help. The community is there to offer support and advice. Sometimes ridicule, but take it in jest, not offense.
And for God's sake, learn there/their/they're, your/you're, and basic grammar. And don't use those black boxes everywhere. Like a good perfume, they should be used sparingly, not bathed in.

**&lt;End Log&gt;**

**Addendum 1608-J-2:** Ah, great. Now everyone knows. Well... If any of you really want to start writing, do us all a favor and read the [rather](http://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/y2w95/so_what_exactly_is_scp/) large [amount](http://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/150ufk/links_resources_and_suggestions_for_writing_new/) of [documentation](http://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/18zof4/mod_post_we_need_to_have_a_talk_regarding_682_and/). Cleaning up after new researchers can be so tiring, so please read standard procedure - *and follow it*. We've lost too many [REDACTED] to [DATA EXPUNGED] ever since Dr. ████████ and SCP-███ came along.

I was hit hard by the recession. I thought my college degree from one of the top public universities in the US (with internship experience) would at least get me a boring 35-40K job, but no, it doesn't.

I'm trying to be a RN, but I don't really want to be a nurse. It's a compromise. Additionally, I heard the RN market is shit and I'm going to have to hustle super hard for a job that I don't really want. I would choose something else, but I don't have a lot of faith in that many industries out there.

I wanted to be more than I am. I'm ambitious and I'm smart. I wanted 23-25 to be a time where I was making OK money while trying to figure out what my long term strategy was for my dreams. Now, I'm just fighting to have any semblance of an OK life.

I never wanted my life to be about money. I always hoped I earned in the high 5 to low 6 figures, but I'm not too materialistic and don't really yearn for a ton of physical comforts (i.e. nice cars, clothes, etc.) I just really wanted to make a real world difference and be a positive force for society and be really proud of what I did for a living. I wanted to be part of something truly interesting, not some guy working a job. I wanted to test the limits of my abilities, not make compromises.

Now I'm thinking about Roth IRAs and hoping I'll have enough money when I'm 70 so I won't have to worry about being poor and old.  My life is simply about not being poor and I thought I already precluded that possibility. On top of that, I get the privilege of seeing my older brother and sister doing relatively well simply, in large measure, because they were born in a better time than I was.

I just feel like when your dreams are gone, what are you supposed to look forward to?"

I read [this article](http://babesonbaystreet.com/2013/03/25/unpaid-internships-are-a-gender-issue/) that claimed that unpaid internships were a gendered issue.  The sole justification was that three-quarters of unpaid interns were female.

Clearly this doesn't make much sense.  Online poker is over 75% male, but no one would call banning online poker a ""gendered issue.""

So - what do you think qualifies something as a gendered issue?

To me it would involve something that is expressly targeted towards a specific gender, say abortion access, or the fight to maintain the legality of male circumcision."

So every one of my internship applications (up to this point) fell through. Just a lot of black hole job submissions and failed phone interviews. I got as close as an the on-site interview round for Bloomberg, but I must have botched the final HR interview. I passed the first round interview for this other company and they haven't replied yet, but I'm setting my expectations to zero so I don't get disappointed.

I live in NYC. At this point, I could 1) focus my attention on Google Summer of Code, or 2) focus my attention on building my web development skills (I know the tech, just need to build apps and get my name out there). At any rate, I'll be working at home, attending as many meetups as possible, and building up my skills for real job applications next semester. What do you guys think I should do? Should I invest a bit more time in finding local NYC companies?"

I have had suicidal thoughts a lot though.

I'm currently a sophomore in college.


Before I came into college, I was in Korea for the summer. My grandfather passed away due to cancer then, and since I was in Korea, I couldn't go to his funeral. Missing his funeral is still one of the biggest regrets of my life.

Currently, my grandmother is sick, and I barely see her.

I feel like these two things are the main sources of ""depression.""

I attend a top University, and I'm an Electrical Engineering student, so I feel like those two add on stress.

I haven't been doing too well, and at the beginning of the semester, I've considered killing myself, a lot.

Obviously, I never went through with it. There were a couple times where I just wasn't too happy (btw I use marijuana and alcohol if that matters) and had hydrocodone lying around, and went into a ""fuck it"" mood and took hydrocodone (just like.. 20-30mg.. nothing lethal) and then just broke down crying.

Another night, I broke down crying and almost made a farewell suicidal video for my parents. I tried to explain in the video why I wanted to kill myself, but I stopped and went to bed.

The only reason I am alive is because of my parents. I love them way too much and I don't want them to be in burden for the rest of their lives.

It's fucked up, but I wish they didn't exist so I could die, I never want them to be harmed or anything.

I used to frequently ask myself: ""Why do I live if I'm going to die.""

Recently, I feel like I found an answer for that, but this week, having three exams from wed-fri completely crushed my spirit.

Maybe part of my problem is because I don't have a girlfriend, who knows.

Maybe I need more love to be happy.

But currently, no.

Life does not seem worth-while.

I only live for my parents. 

Maybe it's all the stress that's making me say this, but I went out of the way to find this subreddit just so I could vent. 

I don't know what I'm doing with my life either.
I fucking hate electrical engineering, it's hard and it doesn't interest me.

I have to graduate college in four years, or I'm going to look like a fool to a lot of Asian parents, so I can't really change my major since I'd have to to stay for over four years to try to graduate. Unless I kept taking summer classes (which i don't want, I want an internship..)

I don't even know what to do anymore.

I doubt this post makes sense."

I'm currently a ""junior"" in college. I'm pretty scared, as I wanted to go for medical school, but once I transferred to a university from my community college, I was in for a big shock. Everything changed, I no longer wanted to do biology. I was afraid of failing and being stuck with a biology degree and looking at mice poop under the microscope all day instead of being in medical school.
Anyways I'm currently taking a career exploration class and one assignment is to ask anyone that is currently living the life of one of these engineers about just life.

If you wouldn't mind answering... maybe some proof would be awesome :) Ha, it doesn't really matter. I just hope the teacher would believe us. Anyways, here we go!

Why did you decide on you career?

What was the most challenging part of getting to where you are?

What do you enjoy doing in your work?

Is the future bright for this career? Job security?

What do you dislike about this job?

What is a usual day like?

Would internships help me?

What kind of grades should I expect to achieve?

Is the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (I live in Nebraska) be a good choice? (Guess you don't really have to bother with this one)

Personal qualities needed for this work type?

Who should I network with?

How much math was involved?

How important is it to know the ""right"" people?

Do you live a comfortable life with a family?

What are your free time like and your hobbies? Cars? Motorcycles? :P

I want to hopefully finish a chemical engineering degree at UNL in 3 years, as I have 2 years of general studies done. I really want to go into petroleum engineering, but I would rather stay in Nebraska for the tuition rates. So chemical engineering is the next best thing. I've always enjoyed chemistry in high school. Plus Breaking Bad is an awesome show.

Computer science is also something I kind of want to look at! If you know anyone with computer science background, tell them to answer this too!

I really appreciate all your help. This will really help with my future and this class.

I'm trying to decide what I should do after graduating this May and need some opinions/advice. First, some background info on me.

I'm about to graduate with a BA in Geography and minors in GIS and Planning from a college in New Jersey. I'd really like to find a job related to one or both of my minors. But one of my problems is that, despite my degree, I'm not very confident in my GIS skills. On class projects I still find myself sometimes referring to the ArcGIS guide or asking for help on the simplest of roadblocks, have barely any programming experience, and am just not overall a great student even in my non-GIS classes. Obviously, I'm not going to get a job right out of college and I'll be lucky to land an internship that would give me the required experience to get a job anyway. It's tough finding work in general, but in my case I have to start looking at other post-undergrad options.

I don't know if getting a Masters is right for me, as I said before I'm not a great student and probably wouldn't get in with my GPA anyway. But one of the options I'm looking at is to take more classes for non-degree, strictly experience-gaining purposes at another local college. This way I could advance my knowledge in programming and take some of the classes I was able to get by without. Another option is to consider secondary education, since most of my non-minor classes were based on human geography and I did well on the Praxis II for social studies (although this would not be nearly as rewarding financially as GIS).

Could I please get some opinions on those options and some ideas for more options? It would really be helpful. Thank you so much!

TL;DR - I probably can't get a GIS job with my current credentials, so I'm looking for other post-undergrad options until I can. Any ideas that will help me reach my goal?"

I'm working on a architectural model for an internship and I been tasked with figuring out how to secure these pvc sheets to a plywood structural framework. What essentially is happening is I have a pvc box with plywood ribbing on the inside. Exterior finish is an issue so screwing and nailing are off the table unless necessary. I'm thinking I'm going to be cutting channels into the pvc where the plywood can notch themselves into and then I would glue the panels together and clamp.

www.thistothat.com is telling me that household goop should work but my boss disagrees saying that pvc works differently from regular plastics and wants me to find an alternative for the kind of butt and lap joints I'm planning on making. There is a 3m fastbond 30nf contact adhesive that interests me but I'm having trouble finding a place that stocks it.

(Psych major) (x-post from /r/gradadmissions,ConfusedPsychMajor,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1b9ttk/would_really_appreciate_some_advice_for_my/,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible.
I am currently in my junior year of undergrad pursuing a psych major and criminal justice minor. For the first two years of my college career, all my advisors and people I talked to told me to not even think about grad school yet, don't worry about choosing a major, etc. Now all of a sudden, I feel like I am not on track at all for grad school. High school didn't prepare me for college AT ALL. Before college, we were told everything we had to do and when to do it, and now in college we are expected to figure everything out by ourselves with little to no guidance from the school. I guess I didn't get that memo and now I feel like I've wasted the past 3 years of my life just trying to get good grades :(
On top of that, I am currently a Canadian in the US under an H4 visa, which basically means I am a dependent of my parents and cannot work at all, not even on campus or do paid internships. I am also limited in opportunities because i have no transportation (i know that sounds like a really lame excuse, but it is a legitimate problem for me...) to do internships or opportunities somewhere else such as our university's main campus.
But does working even really matter for getting into a grad school? I've heard so much recently about how they look at the research you've done. But what does doing ""research"" even mean?? I am attending a smaller branch campus of a good non-ivy league university, and I have no idea if they even do research here. I've also looked into doing some independent studies such as ""directed readings"" with a faculty advisor and a senior thesis, but do those count as research experience?
Basically, I am wondering how important is research experience when applying to grad programs, and how much do they usually expect you to have done? What kind of stuff SHOULD I be doing right now at this point in my academic career? I feel so behind compared to all these other redditors in the same year of university as myself :/
Also, since the only ""job"" experience I can sort of do is volunteer work, do volunteer jobs that are not related to my degree (working at a hospital, helping the homeless, volunteering at an animal shelter) even matter at all to grad programs or should I not even waste my time doing that stuff?
Okay, I probably sound like an unambitious wreck right now, but I would really appreciate any advice or information you guys can give me. thank you so much in advance!"

She is on disability for ""depression"" and has even admitted to me that she is not disabled but likes the free money for sitting on her ass every month. So this brings me to the really irksome part about her, since she has had nothing but time on her hands for the last 10 years almost, she gets it in her head that she suddenly wants to travel to foreign countries, despite being morbidly obese and living on 500/month. She comes up with the scheme to go to community college and then transfer to an overseas american college and live off of student loans, because she suddenly decides this is what she wants to do. Lets just say she went to school in an anonymous Asian country, where she knows not how to speak their language. In any event depsite the fact that she went from wanting to be an actress, model, asian soap opera star and the like, she suddenly decides (with no prior experience whatsoever) that shes go to write for television, and that getting a job in writing will be as easy as her getting the easily attainable internship, then working for a tv studio(don't ask me how she plans to get the job) and then working her way up to head writer or some nonsense. I just am beginning to dislike her so much that I don't even like talking to her. She's done nothing but gain weight and annoy everyone for almost a decade and now she leeching off the government for food stamps and SSI while she 's somehow not even living in the country. She does nothing but whine and complain how everyone needs to go to school and get internships because she's finally discovered thats college exists, and then she expects everyone to send he money because she decided to study abroad at almost 30 without having two nickles to rub together. It also annoys me that she lies all the time about stupid shit, so when she told me all her classes were registered an paid for, for next fall- in mid fucking February, i wanted to take my phone an throw it against the wall. She thinks Im stupid and dont know how things work. She also expects to not need any money to live in this country for the next 3 years (since she plans on graduating there and she's only a freshman) and not borrow as much and it really pisses me off. Im beginning to just not want to talk to her because I work my ass of to go to school and have my own shit, and she just sits on the government dole and talks to me about how she going to have all these things with virtually no work or anything. Now I don't really believe that any of that writing nonsense will happen for her but just the fact that she thinks its that easy just makes me want to shoot myself

I am not sure if there are actual planners on this subreddit or people that have this degree but I would appreciate some insight. Also, I know the reddit community won't hold back.

Im planning on doing a Economic Development specialization. Each one of these school has an appeal to me and I would love to get some feedback on which school is best suited.

University of Illinois at Chicago:

I am currently living in Chicago, doing a year of volunteer work at a local food pantry. Chicago is amazing. I fell in love with the city as soon as I arrived. UIC had the program that initially got me interested in Urban Planning. I feel like the program at UIC would open up internship opportunities I could not get in many other places. The only downside is that money would be an issue. I don't think I quite qualify for the instate so the living/academic expense would be taxing. I am planning on going to the accepted students day to see if they can sell me but we will see.

SUNY University at Buffalo:

Buffalo is my hometown and living there is DIRT CHEAP. I would undoubtedly get instate tuition and I have heard mixed opinions on the MUPP program. Buffalo seems to be an ""Urban Planner's"" playground but I don't want to end up there. Many of my siblings have even moved away swearing Buffalo to be a ""dead end."" Although I don't exactly agree, Buffalo has a disappointing quality about it. UB seems to be more of a research based school with good facilities. Their economic program is linked to their International program, which is attractive to me. One thread that helped me: http://www.cyburbia.org/forums/showthread.php?t=28944 buts its a little dated.

CUNY Hunter:

I don't really know that much about this school other than it having a good reputation. I would love to end up in an urban environment and going to school/having internships in nyc couldn't hurt. I think I would be getting an in-state tuition, which would cover many of the costs. I have been to nyc before and I think I could gain a lot from the city. I haven't heard back from Hunter yet but I am hopeful on their acceptance.


As you can tell, I am a bit conflicted. Any insights or opinions would be greatly appreciated. I need to make a decision by April 15th and as of right now I am leaning towards SUNY Buffalo. Mainly for $Money$ and to be reunited with some friends.

I am also interested on people opinion on the location of your school affecting where you end up or what internship you can pursue. (For example: could I go to UB and apply for a summer internship in Chicago)

1b9kdw,3,2013-03-29,Would really appreciate some advice for my specific situation... (Psych major),ConfusedPsychMajor,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/1b9kdw/would_really_appreciate_some_advice_for_my/,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible. 

I am currently in my junior year of undergrad pursuing a psych major and criminal justice minor. For the first two years of my college career, all my advisors and people I talked to told me to not even think about grad school yet, don't worry about choosing a major, etc. Now all of a sudden, I feel like I am not on track at all for grad school. High school didn't prepare me for college AT ALL. Before college, we were told everything we had to do and when to do it, and now in college we are expected to figure everything out by ourselves with little to no guidance from the school. I guess I didn't get that memo and now I feel like I've wasted the past 3 years of my life just trying to get good grades :(

On top of that, I am currently a Canadian in the US under an H4 visa, which basically means I am a dependent of my parents and cannot work at all, not even on campus or do paid internships. I am also limited in opportunities because i have no transportation (i know that sounds like a really lame excuse, but it is a legitimate problem for me...) to do internships or opportunities somewhere else such as our university's main campus.

But does working even really matter for getting into a grad school? I've heard so much recently about how they look at the research you've done. But what does doing ""research"" even mean?? I am attending a smaller branch campus of a good non-ivy league university, and I have no idea if they even do research here. I've also looked into doing some independent studies such as ""directed readings"" with a faculty advisor and a senior thesis, but do those count as research experience?

Basically, I am wondering how important is research experience when applying to grad programs, and how much do they usually expect you to have done? What kind of stuff SHOULD I be doing right now at this point in my academic career? I feel so behind compared to all these other redditors in the same year of university as myself :/

Also, since the only ""job"" experience I can sort of do is volunteer work, do volunteer jobs that are not related to my degree (working at a hospital, helping the homeless, volunteering at an animal shelter) even matter at all to grad programs or should I not even waste my time doing that stuff?

Okay, I probably sound like an unambitious wreck right now, but I would really appreciate any advice or information you guys can give me. thank you so much in advance!"

They're counting on us to fatigue or forget so they can ram this down our throats, and once it's in, it's in forever.**

It's been a month since our last major campaign (Operation Double Down).

In that time, President Obama has redoubled his effort, [giving speeches that attempt to shame the senate into adopting gun control](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/28/obama-moves-to-hame-congress-into-approving-gun-control-package/).

Throughout, it remains abundantly clear that [the people who believe that guns are inherently unsafe know nothing about how to use them safely](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/mar/25/miller-mayor-bloombergs-irresponsible-gun-attack-a/?page=1).

**Now, more than ever, is the time to push and push hard.**

**It's time for Operation [Roadblock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadblock_%28G.I._Joe%29)**

**I.  Call your senators and urge them to join Senators Paul, Cruz, Lee, Rubio and Inhofe in their plan to [filibuster any new gun control legislation](http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2013/03/29/Rubio-Inhofe-vow-to-filibuster-gun-bill/UPI-39761364542200/).** 

The call should be brief and to the point.  You're talking to an intern who is just writing down your position.  ""Please encourage Senator X to oppose any new gun control measures and to join Senator Paul's filibuster of any new gun control legislation.""

[Find your Senators here.](http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm)

You can also use the GOA tool to send them an e-mail about this, but *please* call as well.  They need to hear our voices.  [E-mail link.](http://capwiz.com/gunowners/home/)

If your Senator *is* in on the filibuster, call 'em up and give 'em an ""'attaboy!""  They need our support, as they'll be under a lot of pressure from the White House and elsewhere.

**II.  Get your friends and loved ones involved.**  If they're like minded, get them to call like you did.  Get your husbands, wives, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters calling.  Let them know how important this is to you.  If they're not like minded yet, take them shooting.  Educate everyone you can.  The senators need to hear from as many *different* voices as possible.  

**III.  Call senators who are on the fence about gun control and let them know where the people *really* stand.**

**IV.  Join the NRA, and get your loved ones to join as well.**   [Here's the link.](http://membership.nrahq.org/)   Yes, I know a lot of you don't like the NRA.  The problem is, we're up against [the Obama election campaign](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/01/obamas-campaign-turns-to-gun-control/), the billion dollar machine that marshaled over 50% of the popular vote in 2012, alongside the nationwide advertising effort being pushed by mayor Bloomberg and Mayors Against Illegal Guns.  Their explicitly stated purpose is to convince the senate that the majority of us support gun control.

By comparison, the NRA, the biggest pro-gun group, has an operating budget for one year of about $212 million (1/5th the Obama election budget), and they have about 4.5 million members.  Make no mistake, we are officially the underdogs, and we are absolutely outgunned.  The last thing we need to do is divide ourselves or fragment over ancient internal disputes, so my advice is to bite the bullet, deal with the junk mail, and join the NRA (and sign up anyone who will join) so that they can claim larger and larger membership.  I'm less worried about money than I am about headcount.  America (and particularly the political class) needs to see that there are still a lot of people who support and value the second amendment.  Senators care about power, and votes are the currency of power.  If they don't understand your phone calls, they *will* understand a group of 5, 6, or 7 million unified and motivated voting citizens.

I need to record from Skype and from a mixer at the same time.,Teebz64,audio,https://www.reddit.com/r/audio/comments/1b9bet/podcast_problem_i_need_to_record_from_skype_and/,"I really hope you can help me with this because I'm just an intern and I've already spent some of my bosses money on hardware. We're trying to set up a podcast where we can have guests call in.

Here's the set up:

The Laptop is connected via USB to an Alesis MultiMix 4. I'm recording in audacity with the playback and input set to the USB mixer. Our headphones are running out of the mixer through a splitter (3 headsets). I'm assuming the problem lies in how my playback hardware settings are set up in Skype. I can't get it to record audio from skype at all, let alone at the same time with the audio from the microphones.

2 possible solutions have crossed my mind:

1) get a new sound card (with ASIO) and set the output from the mixer into the line in on the sound card and then set up Skype to play through to the new external soundcard. If this sounds good can someone recommend me a good soundcard that can connect to a laptop and doesn't have any latency problems when listening in real time? If there is a slight delay in the playback we're monitoring we start to talk slowly and awkwardly.

2) Get a cable to run from the Laptop headphone output into the mixer. I have tried this but the signal is too low to be mixed in with our talking. Can I buy a signal booster to do this? Is that even reasonable or will there be too much hissing?

If someone can help me with this I'd really appreciate it! I can send pictures and more information if it is required. I am an illustrator and if you can solve this for me I will draw you a picture of you and your beautiful family.

THANKS!"

I have no real experience.  I really just want to learn about engineering in general.  

I realize that I do not make the best candidate.  That is why I think it might be more valuable to just forget the money and do an internship at home by finding a small company through google. 


Nuclear and mechanical are very similar up until senior classes.  I have taken fluids, heat transfer, deformable bodies, thermo, , etc..

My initial weight was 175, and I am 5'5''. I play rugby so I'm pretty active but due to an ankle injury I have been unable to maintain the fitness level that I was previously at and wound up gaining weight.

So the first thing I really did was download the LoseIt app. It gave me a daily caloric budget of about 1300 a day. I have done my best so far to keep under it, and I've done pretty well. I make it to practice a couple of days a week (I'm pretty busy with school, work, an internship, and research) and try to go to the gym and at least bike for half an hour other days. I turned on the nutrient preferences also and while I don't keep to a strict low-carb diet, I have been monitoring my carb intake and have been trying to decrease the amount of carbs I eat daily.

We basically made out and felt each other up.  And i'm pretty sure the girl i was with was interacting sexually with the other girl, because i heard both of them moaning at one point. I think I remember having my head on this other girl (A)'s ass at one point, I don't know why.

She was introducing herself and asking if I had ever been at [organization] before. I almost laughed, because I had spent a good part of the night hooking up in her tent, and at least some time with my head on her ass.

Now, I knew she was too drunk and had no intention to have any sexual activity with her.  But I have obsessive tendencies and now I'm guilt tripping over the incident, thinking that I might have had sex and blacked out.

1b8e1j,0,2013-03-29,How big of a consideration was your college GPA in your recruitment/hiring at your first job?,[deleted],AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1b8e1j/how_big_of_a_consideration_was_your_college_gpa/,I am a student at a top 10 engineering school in the United States. I was wondering how important it was to companies how well you did in classes. Are there any of you who had relatively low GPA's but had a lot of internship or co-op experience which lead a company to hire you?
1b8dlg,4,2013-03-29,"Been out of school for awhile, but looking into grad school",burritosan,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1b8dlg/been_out_of_school_for_awhile_but_looking_into/,"I'm 28 years old, and I've been out of school for 5 years.  Since then, I've done work as a commercial real estate appraiser (current job, going on three years), as a computer programmer, and I have also passed a couple of actuarial exams (with the highest scores).

I got my degree in math, but thanks to a couple of bad semesters in my junior year (life issues -- death of family members, failing relationships, that sort of thing), I graduated with approx 2.5 GPA.  This was also from the University of Arizona, which is by no means a top school.

However, since then I've come a long way, and while getting into actuarial science on my own time I've come to *really* love statistics.  However, the entry level market for actuaries is extremely rough, especially since I don't have any experience as an actuary (an internship would have been nice, for sure).  So in the meantime, I was thinking it would be great to broaden my horizons, and maybe open up the possibility of using statistics in areas beyond just insurance.  Unfortunately, I would *probably* need at least an M.S. in Statistics (or the like) in order to do anything of this sort.

So my question is, is getting into a mediocre statistics program (e.g., the UofA's) a viable option?  As it stands I have a fair amount of connections outside of academia, but I would bet none of my professors from college even remember me.  Also, the requirements say you need a 3.0, but does that mean they automatically dismiss everything below 3.0?  I can't imagine that this program gets a whole hell of a lot of applicants, but I could be wrong.  I also expect to do quite well on the GRE's, but I haven't yet taken them (could this make up for a low GPA?).

Basically, I'm just a working dude looking to get into a field where I can apply statistics.  Any advice would be much appreciated.

Thanks in advance."

I'm in such a great place in my life. I've done really well this semester in college (This is after switching my major to something I never thought I was intelligent enough for.). I've made some of my best friends this year. I have a very promising relationship to look forward to. I got accepted into my study abroad program. I'm officially spending 8 weeks in Paris. Along with that, I may be lucky enough to spend a week in Dubai afterwards. I got offered an awesome internship in the fall when I start the semester. Everything has been falling into place lately, and I feel like this is going to be one of the best years of my life.

I feel like this is something that I needed to get off of my chest. This isn't an attempt to brag; I'm just so relieved to finally be in a good place for once, I had to let someone know. "
1b8bz4,9,2013-03-29,I think I'm going to quit my job. I would love some advice. ,canonae1,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1b8bz4/i_think_im_going_to_quit_my_job_i_would_love_some/,"I'm not the normal case for this question. 

Here's my situation in a nutshell:

* Computer Science major in College
* I have a regular source of income from scholarships
* I will graduate in December
* I have an internship for the summer making $20 an hour in the Computer Science field at a company I love. 

Here's the situation with my work:

* I work at the college newspaper
* I got great access to sporting events court/field side. 
* Got employment experience
* Picked up a few new skills along the way
* Make $20 per story, which can take anywhere from 2-5 hours. 


That's the basics. I've been thinking about quitting for around a month now, but it just got harder today. I half-assed an application to get a better job at the paper (one with more responsibility) and I got it. I had hoped I would be excited to get the job, or quit if I didn't. It turns out, I'm not excited about the new job (which would start in August) and now I have even more riding on me, which is just making this decision much harder. 

I would really like to use the extra time to focus on more programming projects and maybe even have some free time to decompress. Right now, I'm pretty much non-stop with projects, homework and work. 

I have no desire to do journalism beyond as a hobby later in life. 

Any advice would be great. Honestly, reading over this, I'm looking for people to kind of back me up on this. I doubt I'll change my mind. "

So I'm a recent art school grad/illustration major who's looking to beef up my lettering and design skills. When I was working at a startup I had a coworker who did some brewing, and since I was the intern (i.e. only person in the art department with some extra time) he had me come up with a label for his seasonal pumpkin ale. I had so much fun with the project that I'd love the opportunity to do it again! I'm not looking for payment (outside of the occasional be-labeled beer, if anyone felt like braving the post office) - this is mainly for building my portfolio (which you can take a peek at here: http://www.caitlyncrites.com/)
If you have an idea or theme in mind I'd be happy to hear it. I can do hand lettering, type, illustration, or any combo thereof! 
Thanks for reading and fire away! 

EDIT: Just some additional info I didn't think of initially - I'm aiming to finish each label in about a week and a half/two weeks max. I hope to get faster as I go but I also have a work schedule that gets sort of unpredictably nuts every few weeks. I'm still trying to figure out an easy way to facilitate feedback on sketches/WIP, if anyone would like that - will update when I think of one."

I'm a **sophomore physics major** at a very good US university.  When I came in, I was entirely planning to do academic research in physics (probably astrophysics).
I did astrophysics research last summer, and had a great time.  I really enjoy the subject matter and the work I was doing (a lot of hardware stuff) was very fun.

I've taken quite a bit of the coursework, and I'm doing fine in it so far: a mix of B+s and As.  Some of it I've really enjoyed, and other parts have been more frustrating than interesting.  My school offers a BS in Physics and an Intensive BS in Physics.  I'm currently on the Intensive track, but it's easy to switch down, and the BS still includes a senior thesis project, and quite a few advanced physics classes.

However, this year I've started to think that **academia really isn't where I want to end up**.  I'm concerned about the lifestyle aspects: that I'll have 6-8 years of grad school, then another 6 of postdocs, and then a desperate search for anything that could lead to tenure track, and then several more stressful years until I (hopefully) get tenure.  It feels like I'm not going to have a real job until I'm at least 35.  I want kids and a family though, and especially as a woman, that adds a whole additional layer of complexity.

Additionally, it seems like my professors spend most of their time applying for grants.  While I realize that it's necessary, and that they do make research decisions and have great, inspired ideas too, I really don't think I want to spend so much time doing that.

**Instead, I've become quite interested in programming, and also applied physics/engineering.**  Through physics, other research, and personal interest, I've had some programming experience.  This semester, I'm taking Introduction to Programming, though it turns out I've significantly underplaced myself.  I had never used Java before, so I'm obviously learning a lot of syntax, but I really don't think I've learned a single new *concept* this semester, and my grade is currently over 100%.  Essentially, what I'm trying to say is that I don't have much experience, but I'm not quite as much of a beginner as being in Introduction to Programming would imply.

**I really enjoy the programming.**  I've been making a lot of projects up for myself, and I'm doing Udacity and other online classes, and I feel like I'm making progress personally, if not in the class. **It's sparked an interest in doing this long term, which looks like a really compelling alternative to academia.  My other academia alternative would be physics research in industry, which I don't have much exposure to, but I believe that I'd probably find it interesting and engaging** (depending on exactly what the work was).

In figuring out my course schedule for the next two years, I've been focussing on including CS classes.  **With the Intensive Phys major, I can get get 6 of them in, which is about half of the degree.  However, if I were to switch to the BS in Physics, I can get 10 classes and the BA in CS.** My school doesn't offer minors or certificates or any other more halfway solutions.


**My question: with an uncertain career path (tech startups, physics industry, software development, engineering grad school, and possibly academic physics are all under consideration), is it better to have a Intensive BS in Physics with a handful of computer science classes, or a BS in Physics and BA in Computer Science?**


TL;DR: see the bolded stuff.

P.S. If anyone has still-available summer internship suggestions in applied physics or programming for a kid with a bit of experience and a lot of enthusiasm, let me know!"

I am a 20 y/o, 3rd year undergraduate living in MA. I started a 6 month, full-time internship in January and I've been trying to figure out what to do with my earnings.

When I found out that the company offered 401(k) plans for interns, I opted to open one with 6% contributions. I did not know at the time if the company offered matching contributions. I read around and came to the conclusion that 6% would be a safe bet to contribute to get a match if the company did offer matching. However, it turns out the company does not offer matching. Currently I have about ~$312 contributed.

I then saved up about 3k and opened a Vanguard Roth IRA Target Retirement Fund. So...seeing as how I can still contribute about 2k to max out the Roth IRA contribution limit for 2012, should I roll over my 401(k)? Should I stop contributing to my 401(k) and focus on the Roth IRA? WHAT DO?

I have a very strong musical background, in composing and in performing. I have a very rare ability, which is instantaneous perfect pitch, which stems from my ability to see colors when I hear music. I am also logical, good at math, and have some experience with graphic design and computer programming. I would love to have some sort of opportunity this summer in Los Angeles to gain experience in the industry.

A has offered me an internship that involves mostly support, but they've promised me that I can look_around and based on my performance I could be offered a full time position as a developer. A is pretty established in its field of interest. Is offering me a 26 $ an hour package, which is low, but pretty considerable relocation.
B on the other hand has offered me an internship that is fairly related to my work and involves considerable amount of development. And also chances of transition into a full time position.

I am not a drinker, smoker, and I don't own any pets. I cook for myself if I have access to a stove. I am not noisy, although I need to use the computer a lot, so internet would be nice. I will most likely be working a second job, if my current internship turns out to be a dead end.

I am totally fine with crashing in a living room or something. It would be currently equal to the situation I am currently in (I'm living on a couch and then heading back to my parent's place for the summer) The reason that I am not living with my parents in this time is because I'm trying to live on my own.

Any help or just suggestions would be appreciated. I'm not looking for monetary assistance, but getting a possible paid internship possible in either the Computer industry or Finance or legal field would appreciated.

TL; DR
College student on gap year, looking for room/couch to rent for 5 months from September to December in NYC. 

Thanks everyone!

I was working in SQL very heavily, and it was standard for them to issue work laptops to every employee - including interns. My desk setup was the standard 2 monitors, laptop dock, and office phone. (This part is important later) The office phone is powered and receives data through an Ethernet cable, and also forwards the data to the computer through another Ethernet cable. 

So...

Fast forward a couple months, and I've gotten used to bringing my laptop home with me after work to do some work at home. One of my home PC's, for some reason, has chronic wireless issues (no matter how many adapters I try), so I set up a bridge on my work computer to allow my desktop to receive internet via ethernet cable connected to my work laptop. This works great! I fix the problem, and go to work the next day. As soon as I plug my computer into the dock, the phone DIES on the spot, and I have no network connectivity. I get Systems to come up to help, and they are just as confused as I am. They even bring 2 new phones up to my desk, just to have both of them die on the spot as soon as they were plugged in.

Then I remembered my bridge. I disabled it, and with a perfect poker face I resumed my work."

While I understand that I don't know much as a sophomore at this moment I wanted to see if I could get something anyway, it never hurts to try. I want to focus on internships that have a minimum qualification like:

&gt;Minimum Qualifications:

&gt;Currently pursuing a Bachelors or Masters degree in Computer Science or related technical field and returning to the program after the completion of the internship

Something that doesn't require much experience or knowledge as I obviously don't have as much.

Now, my question is, my resume is obviously going to lack relevant experience, I have had jobs before (I've been working and going to college for the past 3 years but not relevant to CS) which I plan on putting in to show that I have general work experience at least, but I really have no CS related experience. And I've taken only the basic intro classes  to C++ etc.

So what should I do in terms of my resume when trying to build it for CS related internships? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

EDIT: Also, do internships like these that don't require much CS knowledge have technical interviews? "

Currently i am studying a international relations degree in the U.K. However i was wondering how i can spread publicity for this organisation, via journalistic means. 
I am inclined to work for an agency like reporters without borders in the future so this can give me a bit of a test to see what work as a journalist may entail. 

I have a rough plan but i need some extra advice on how to join the dots together. 

1) What would be the best means to report and record down the events i see in Palestine and the work this organisation is doing, Blog ? Video Blog ? I have a contact in Reporters without Borders, could that be a way to further publicise ? 

2) Any other tips in terms of content, what is unique and different i can offer if anything ?? 

3) Is there any general advice for me, from those who have had experience in the field. 

4) Overall i want to serve this organisation as i have a lot of respect for the man who runs it and aim, but also for personal reasons i believe this can give me vital work experience.

Keep in mind the bulk of the post is a question related to ""how do I go from where I am to where I want to be"".

I graduated from college in May 2012 with two degrees, one of which was an education degree. That pushed my down time between school and work another 6 months for student teaching which I just finished in December. Now I'm in a temp teaching position which fit perfectly with my timing (finishing everything in the middle of a school year leaves finding a 'job' pretty difficult... USUALLY).

I'm 2 months away from completing this position, and am starting to have to plan out what's next. So why is this post here?

I've been dabbling on my own with programming languages and such for a while, dating back to a year ago on and off, and picking it up again recently (last 4-6 months). I don't get as much time on the subject as I'd like, but I try to eek out a few things here and there. 

My ideal next step is something in the CS department. I'm stuck in the position of having a vague (because I'm not incredibly knowledgeable on the different areas of the field) idea of what I want, and not knowing at all how to get it so the question remains as follows:

What would be the logical next step?

If I try to shoot for a Master's degree, I have to hope that a school would take me without prior experience or knowledge except what I could attain on my own (which I understand is considerable). If I go with this option, I have to wait until a spring start up as fall start up application deadlines have already passed.

Alternatively, I've been looking at internships, but my hopes there are dying as the requirement for every. single. one. is someone who is still studying.

I'm just at a bit of a loss because it feels like I want to immerse myself in this field and dedicate to it and start building a future, but I can't really find a method to do that in the current time frame.

I'm not really looking for ""bro you don't need a degree"" type of answers, moreso what YOU would do as someone who is either on the other side (working in this field, etc.) or someone who has faced similar crossroads and found something that worked for you.

My apologies if this is incoherent! Forming words for what I'm feeling right now has been somewhat difficult.

Considering I know I can get employed at 50k upon graduation, does it still make any sense to continue on with school? In particular, getting a BA in CSC and then maybe a Master's degree?

For most of this time, she's been more religious than me. That's not the problem here.

We always said we'd never be like judgemental Christians who give all other Christians a bad name. You know, the ones who criticize everyone else behind their back for doing anything ~~they~~ the Bible disagree with, eg, having sex, being gay, swearing, everything really. Or the Christians who just tell you to ""pray about it"" whenever you go to them for help instead of properly listening. We always said that we'd never be like that.

The problem is, at the start of this year, she started an internship at her church. Now she seems to be turning into one of them. I've been going through a bit of a tough time lately (family stuff) but a few weeks ago I was talking about my guy problems and she told me that I ""need to put boys out of my mind and focus on God."" and that I ""just don't seem to be getting it"". Never mind that she likes some guy from her church and talks about him all the time.

A friend of ours gave up Nutella for Lent. She went vegan for Lent. She complains about how what he did was easy to give up, while *she* rearranged her whole diet.

Then last night we were talking about stuff and she goes on this massive rant about people who claim to be Christians and yet go and have pre-marital sex (and she was talking about a couple who's been together for nearly 2 years. Yes by Christian standards it's wrong, but it's not like they've been sleeping around) and how they need more integrity and are giving the wrong impression about what Christianity is supposed to be about.

Then she goes on this massive rant about how oral sex is degrading and how she's surprised other girls don't think girls who do it are tramps.

I don't know this person any more. I've tried to tell her that she's acting like the type of person she's always despised, but she won't listen. I want the girl back who I used to laugh with for hours, have intelligent conversations and talk about guys. I want the girl back who was accepting of everyone despite their past or what they do in the bedroom. I miss you. The old you.

We live together in an apartment and I can't sleep, so I'm typing this out.

She was acting cold/quiet around me for the past month. While she was at work yesterday, I checked her Facebook to find a conversation she has been having with a guy she met 'networking' in her media program. She has been preparing to break up with me for the past month while talking with this guy, saying all sorts of shit to him; mild flirting, talking about her past boyfriends before me, his past long term girlfriend, talking about all the stuff they have in common. The real clincher was after she met this guy at a bar recently, she said that she 'wanted to kiss him' (I was aware of the meeting, and was a little suspicious, but I didn't want to get all jealous/protective when I didn't think we were breaking up).

I was devastated after finding this out. I called friends to talk about everything with them, to reassure myself everything was going to be okay, and discussed methods of how to handle the breakup. I kept reading the conversation, seeing things like ""I feel so bad chatting with you with my boyfriend asleep"", driving myself crazy with the dates of the conversations; thinking of how she would kiss me goodnight, then her stay up late, having an emotional affair with this guy, me none-the-wiser. 

We talked once she got home from work. She was crying, and I tried to keep my composure, but I just couldn't. I bawled and hyperventilated, trying to express myself. It was a fairly amicable breakup, however the emotional affair is what was the extra stab. I don't hate her, and she says there is nothing wrong with me, but she fell out of love with me physically a long time ago. I agreed that I noticed the decline of our sexual encounters, but that I was under the guise that it was due to her self-image issues, and other factors.

Here's the kicker: She is currently in grad school for her media program, and is working less than she usually does. Her student loans have almost dried up, and can't afford rent and groceries. She is saying she wants me to stay because it's easier for me to get to work than from my parents place, and that she wants to stay friends. I tentatively agreed to stay, but I cannot sleep beside her. I tried for the life of me, as I am extremely exhausted, but I cannot turn my brain off.

I feel as though her pleas for me to stay are partially related to her true feelings for me, as she is having a hard time dealing with *my* coldness towards her. She thinks she can just continue to be ""friends"" with me, hang out with me like old times. It doesn't work that way. I don't want to be an ""emotional tampon"" as I have read on here. I have to get out of this toxic environment, and move in with my parents temporarily until I get my shit together. I don't want to be a dick, but I can't live with her here, and continue to be abused with her selfish behavior. I can't sleep. She has work tomorrow morning? An internship to start on Monday? Maybe if you had the fucking balls to dump me 6 months ago, you wouldn't be in this shitty situation.

Sorry about the rant; this is my brain cycling through the emotions."

1bal8e,11,2013-03-30,Should I consider taking substantial loans to attend a top university?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1bal8e/should_i_consider_taking_substantial_loans_to/,"I am a high school senior choosing between the University of Texas at Austin and the College of Engineering at Cornell University.

The University of Texas gives me scholarship money, and its tuition is famously inexpensive, so my attendance there would not be much of a financial burden to my family. Also, I have been accepted to some extremely well-regarded honor programs there, one of which has a purpose statement of ""providing a computer science education second to none."" I absolutely love this university already—I've visited it monthly while it continues to grow on me—but it would be silly to not consider my other option seriously. After all, I've always wanted to get out of Texas.

Despite being way far away from Texas, Cornell is probably similar to the state school in academic opportunity. However, it has a reputation of rigorous classes and workloads, and that is something that excites and attracts me strongly. If money were not an issue, I would go for Cornell. However, tuition there is four times the amount at the University of Texas, and, since my parents are divorced, the financial aid office will certainly *add up* the incomes of both families, probably resulting in a calculation of very little financial aid.

I do not want my mother to pay a dime. Her family has to pay for my siblings there. My father can afford up to 30k annually, which is about half the cost of attendance. Perhaps, over the summer, I can earn money through internships, which might take away another 10,000. Would it be wise to try to resolve the rest of the yearly 30k (an amount that will probably inflate annually) through scholarships and, more importantly, through student loans?

Furthermore, are there any additional advantages to attending Cornell that might make the extra costs worth it?

Thank you for your help."
1baj79,5,2013-03-30,Room 16,littletoasterwhocan,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1baj79/room_16/,"Every room was 16.

That was the dream she woke up to on her last night at home. Every single room was 16. She had absolutely no idea what that meant, but it had still scared the hell out of her. 

Layla left the next day for New York. She was going to be an actor. She had an internship and everything. It payed nothing and she would have to work another job and live in some shit-hole motel, but that was fine with her. What was important was that she was going.

The drive from Normal, IL to New York was not a pleasant one. She had driven 7 consecutive hours, and after an hour rest, her sister drove another seven hours. Layla was dropped off at the cheapest motel in the least dangerous neighborhood they could find.

I never heard the conversation, but I'm sure it went something like this: 

Sister – ""Are you sure you'll be ok?""

Layla – ""Stop worrying! I'll call home every day!""

Sister – ""Mom will be worried sick.""

Layla – ""I'm 18. She can't control me anymore.""

Sister – ""Just be careful, okay?

I'm sure this was followed by a tearful goodbye as Layla's sister drove off into the night. I'm sure Layla doubted herself as she walked to the rundown motel. I am most definitely sure she was caught off guard by the kindly old man behind the counter of the motel. 

This conversation, I remember word for word.

""Looking for a place to spend the night?"" the cheery old man said, his blue eyes alight.

""A little more than a night, thank you,"" she replied, relieved to find such a slender old man in place of a fat, greedy crook. 

""Here's your key. Don't go in room 16,"" the old man said in a matter-of-fact way.

Layla was caught off guard. Her dream echoed in her mind, but her longing for sleep made her resist the urge to ask why. It was probably just a coincidence. Someone probably just wanted privacy, or the room was under repair, or that's where this psycho keeps the bodies.

She erased the last thought from her brain and went to her room, 19, and collapsed on the bed. She had no dreams of room 16.

The next days she spent looking for a part-time-job to pay for her palace. Her sister, I assume, was paying for the first few days.

She could not afford an apartment, but her laptop was a necessity. I cannot say that I don't sympathize.

She only left the motel for fast food. It was all she could afford. Her conversation with the old man was the same every time she walked back in the motel.

Old man – ""Nice day?""

Layla – ""Could be better.""

Old man – ""Well, have a good one.
                   
              Don't go in room 16.""

By the third day of only leaving her room for fast food, Layla found a job as a waitress. How stereotypical. The actress-waitress combo. She left for her first day and returned exhausted. Her conversations with the old man went as usual. 

Her internship started the next day and her exhaustion must have doubled or tripled. I'd like to imagine she began to give up hope, but knowing Layla, she probably thought it would all work out in the end. Always so hopeful and optimistic.

I'll take a guess and say that's when the dreams started. Every night was the same. It was the motel she was staying in. Every room was 16. Cold sweat and panic became her morning routine. 

She began to keep a diary to, in her words, "" to calm [her]self down."" I have absolutely no idea how reliving a chaotic and exhausting day calms someone down, but to each their own.

The conversations with the old man were the same now, and she had grown too accustomed to them by now to question about the infamous room 16. There were other occupants in the motel, and they all got the same treatment. She, however, was the only regular. No one, that she saw, ever entered or left room 16. 

That she saw.

She could hear the old man's voice in the dreams now. Don't go in room 16. Don't go in room 16. Don't go in room 16. Over and over again until it drove her from fear to anger, in her dream-state. 

In her dream, she finally put her hand on the knob. It melted to her skin. It sucked her in, absorbing her body in agonizing increments as the old man's voice mockingly repeated, ""Don't go in room 16. Don't go in room 16."" 

She snapped.

""What's in there anyway?"" Layla questioned the kindly old man.

""Well..I–"" The old man's stutter indicated he clearly was not going to answer. 

She ran past him, straight to room 16. She was about to try the knob, but must have recalled something that resembled her manners and pounded loudly on the door. 

There was no answer.

""Get away from there!"" The old man was in a panic. He was not angry. I don't think he's capable of anger. 

Layla remembered herself. ""Sorry. I...I was just curious.""

""It's–It's all right,"" he said. ""Just take my word on it. There is nothing in there for you.""

Nothing. Nothing at all.

That night, she crept through the silent hallway of rooms to the number 16. The old man was asleep, at least she thought, and no one was there to stop her from opening that door. Her hand turned around 16 and she triumphantly discovered it was unlocked. The doorknob was cold. Cold and grey. It was the kind of unforgiving cold that only a winter day without snow could possess. It was a deep grey like the sky on those unforgivable winter days and no reflection of her face shown off it, as it did with the doorknob to her own room. It creaked impossibly loud as she turned it. She opened the door. She was speechless. What was held inside room 16 was not possible. It was unbelievable. She saw–

She saw–

Well, I don't know that yet. That last paragraph, that's just how I imagine it happening. My name is– Well, I don't think you need to know that. I'm just a story to you. But I'm real. I type this because I am excited to find out what I will become. The kind of excited where you cannot keep your glee in and must share it. The kind that makes you giddy with anticipation. 

But I am patient. Paying the old man to tell no one of my existence in room 16 was easy. He added the ""[d]on't go in room 16"" thing himself. I thought it was stupid at first, but it's grown on me. I like the old man. He's kind, compliant, and most importantly, he doesn't ask questions. 

It didn't have to be the actor/waitress three doors down. It could have been anyone. But she was the only regular in the shit-hole. I've never laid eyes on her, but I'm sure she's beautiful. Her diary was a great read. 

She'll decide what I become, within reason, I've decided. If she writes that I'm a serial killer, I'm a serial killer. If she says I'm a kindly young man with a handsome face and a tragic past, I'll be that. If I'm empty, I'll pack up and leave. The gamble is such fun. Her stories of what I am get more fantastic and horrible with each new entry into the little black diary of hers. I will not disappoint her.

I am insane. I know that. But sanity is not only relative, but also overrated. And I am more than just insane.

I am room 16. 

She will open me soon."

1ba96c,1,2013-03-29,Depressed need to get feelings off my chest,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ba96c/depressed_need_to_get_feelings_off_my_chest/,"I’m a college senior who has been drifting emptily through my life. I had given up on life for a long time and was just going through the motions. It dawned on me these last 2 years that the end of “the best years of my life” was coming to an end. And all I am is a broken empty friendless unlovable loser who pathetically bruises and cuts themself.

So I had decided I would make a deal with myself, that I would pour all of myself into what I've read on getting better and literally find happiness or die trying. So I took on a job, an internship, several leadership roles, a hard set of classes, several large personal projects, along with adopting a whole host of self-help tips (exercise, mediation, reading, journaling, constant positive affirmations (oh god the stupid affirmations I say)). 

I would work nonstop and not sleep for days; if I did sleep it would be for 3 hours or less. My chest constantly hurt and it was rather scary, but I went on, while quietly hoping my heart would just stop beating. I put so much effort into talking with people. I memorized everything they told me or seemed interested in. I made lists of things to talk about for the people I met and made sure to talk with them using what I've read on socializing. I made lists of jokes and people seemed to like them. I listened and was supportive of people. I went far out of my way to help them. No matter how uncomfortable it was. But I still have no one I would consider even close to a friend. They all leave me out of events and don’t respond when I try to get them to hang out and avoid talking to me in general. I even tried to see if anyone would care about my stupid suicidal quest but no one did.

In the end I've succeeded in everything I took on and even did more. And all I feel is empty and alone. Now I feel even worse because I can’t shake the feeling that no matter how hard I work or how much I get out of my comfort zone I will never be happy.

People even say they are envious of me. HOW? How could you possibly want to be me? I hate myself so much. I wouldn't want anyone to be someone as worthless as me. Whenever I look at myself all I think is “why hasn't this worthless piece of shit killed itself already?” And it takes all my strength not start hitting myself right there in public. No amount of forceful positive thought makes it stops, it still just creeps into my mind and ruins everything.

I've read a lot on how to get better, but I just can’t seem to think I am worth it. I hate myself for feeling like this. I am sure these feelings are the thing holding me back. I know I can be more, but part of me knows I can’t. I feel like I’m split apart and don’t want to continue the ceaseless and pointless day-to-day struggle. I just keep asking why continue? All I feel is anger and pain and emptiness now. The odds that I'm going to get into a job I hate like most everyone and spend decades alone and miserable like I am now is so high. I just can't face that many years of this.

I just want to give up so badly. Most every day is a constant strain on me. I can't shake the thought that ""If I can just give in and stop fighting. Let myself go even farther down than I have ever been. Then let go of the small hopes of happiness. I could finally go through with ending it all."" I don't want to die but it just feels so tempting.

There isn't much point in writing this giant wall of text I guess. I’m just tired and tired of being alone. Posting this is the stupidest and most pathetic thing I have ever done, but I just need to get it out and maybe get advice. I'm probably not thinking all that straight. 

Thank you for your time."

edit 1: Everyone on reddit is a hard worker, and I can promise you I understand that, working at a dining hall while I watch my friends laugh or spend money when I'm just putting my money in the bank. You guys are right that everybody works hard, and it may have been rude to ask for people to help, but I certainly didn't mean like 100 dollars or anything like that, I meant just a few dollars to help me out. If you don't want to, that's fine, but please don't think that I have ""no morals,"" or ""don't respect that other people are in the same situation,"" because I am asking people to help me because I'm in the same situation. Feel free to downvote me, or anything like that but I'm just looking for a little help. I hope that when I'm an adult, I will help people too, but I honestly can't even say that I'm that generous, so if you don't want to help me out, I one-hundred percent understand. Good luck to everyone, I hope all of you find ways to pay for your tuition and for your families.

1ba4ce,1,2013-03-29,Should I Do It?,[deleted],law,https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/1ba4ce/should_i_do_it/,"I'm sure you guys have heard the question a lot (and, perhaps, 'should I *have* done it?'). 'It' being, of course, the law profession in general. 

[If this is the wrong subforum, feel free to slap me on the ass and point me in the right direction!]

I currently have some offers from a few top-25 law schools for about 60 to 100 in scholarship (with some at the top end, right around the 15 mark, decreasing to zero in scholarship help). 

My expectations are that I want to make a comfortable, middle-class lifestyle for me and myself. Perhaps a wife. Maybe a kid. Let's just stick to 'me and myself' for right now. I've seen both my parents work 6-day, 10-hour weeks for their whole life. I want to do the same but, in comparison to my father, avoid the backbreaking labor as a general contractor. It's not because I like to argue, or I want to be Jack McCoy... Or any of the cute truisms that Tucker is so fond of. Frankly, I just see it as better than being a mechanic or a trench-digger. Importantly, I do have a mild deviancy. I get a mild boner from tediously written documents of all sorts. I spent a good portion of my summers working in financial services as an intern, and I enjoyed my time looking for that one document that could be used for improving the life of the client. I provided a specific service that improved someone's life, if to a distinctly #firstworldproblem.

Yet I still hear how it's horrible, and how even if I do well I'll end up not finding any work at all. It's, understandably, a little disconcerting. Be real with me, reddit, how much is the 'soft' job market due to your own failings and how much has to do with the job market in toto (not to sound too harsh)? To put a sharper point on it, the 'bad news' coming out of law seems to come in two flavors yet in large part it's hard to distinguish the difference because some of it simply flies over my head. 

1.) Entitled whining. Legitimately, the idea of working 6-day weeks looking over legal documents seems like... Nothing difficult. Digging trenches and loosing brain cells to the glue that keeps PVC pipe together is a lot worse. Or trying to convince the CA state government that cinder block from Arizona is actually as environmentally safe as cinderblock from California. Yet there is also the possibility that...

2.) Legitimate complaints. That is, absolute and complete unemployment with crushing debt... So the sniffing of glue and laying of concrete but with the staggering debt load. 

I suppose, in a roundabout way, I'm asking for a little introspection from you all. Not ""oh, boo-hoo I've been graduated for a year and am not making 100k"" (alternatively, ""I work in my father's law firm so... my super-specific life-story is absolutely useless"") but legitimate pro's and con's that someone can utilize in planning out their future career. 

Fire away!"

I feel guilty for feeling this way and it’s been so long that I've felt this way. I’ve been praying to not wake up when I fall asleep since I was in the 5th grade. All my friends at one point has either stabbed me in the back or thrown me away for someone bigger and better. I made the mistake once telling a friend my parents were worried I was depressed and he joked about how I should just kill myself and get it over with. I could never kill myself because that is too selfish of me and its not fair for a healthy body to just be given up even though the past years that’s all I’ve been is just a nothing. I haven’t just been sitting in bed all these years, I played sports and had friends but no matter what, since 5th grade everything has been done with a fake smile on my face. At night no matter where I would be laying down I would always be hoping either I have a heart attack in my sleep and I don’t wake up or that tomorrow I’m in some horrible accident that kills me. I’ve always prayed that it only happens to me, meaning that I pray for a car accident but that the car is fine and the other people are fine but I don’t want to survive. Since I have been 16 and been able to drive I’ve always wanted to have the balls to just drive off a bridge or the brakes go out and I run into a wall and fly out, that is why I never wear a seatbelt. I don’t want to talk to anyone because nothing is going to change my mind on this I just want to be dead and I know that everyone I know will be over my death within a couple days. I’ve tried to give myself a better life, I have had interviews with nice paying jobs at cool company’s. My soccer didn’t work out because they said I wasn’t big enough so I didn’t even follow through with the tryouts I got for different college scholarships so I just went to the university everyone goes to where I'm from. I’ve had three internships and the last one I worked 65-70 hours a week and they screwed me on my last paycheck by taking my contracts and giving them to someone else. I stayed in my college town for my ex, we broke up with all the fighting about my depression. She wanted the brake up when I told her that my trust issues and my sex drive didn’t have anything to do against her but me since I’ve never ever trusted anyone to tell them how I’ve actually felt. But still I fought and convinced her not to end it but finally I had nothing left in me to fight for. Why fight to be with me when I wouldn’t even want to be with me, I don’t even want to be alive so why would I want her to be with me. I still do love her and that’s why I don’t want her with me because she deserves better than someone who prays for death everyday and night. To think even typing this id be crying or upset but I’ve got nothing I just don’t care I just keeping hoping I have a heart attack. Thanks for reading if you did I just need to get this kinda off my chest to someone somewhere."

I will be completing my MSEE in a few weeks. I don't have a job ready and I am not sure what kinds of jobs I should be applying to. My concentration was communications (EE). I feel that a lot of it was more theoretical than practical. A lot of jobs I am finding require a Ph.D. to work on comm systems related jobs but I think I'll be done after this degree.


I had internships in test engineering and I found the work to be a little boring and not too challenging. I was only an intern but I saw the work  that other engineers were doing and it was very repetitive and nobody looked excited to be there. 


I would like to know more about the various job titles. How do you like them? Which is the best in your opinion? 


I have interned at large companies where everybody seemed to have one particular skill-set and that is all they ever get to work on. I would like to be more involved in various stages of a project. 

Thanks.


Does anybody feel this way? I am having trouble finding a job so I can't be picky. I will probably end up doing some kind of test engineering job for the rest of my life and I am worried that I will never be happy. A lot of my coworkers told me to go for design jobs but those jobs require several years of experience.

I am a student who contributed $2500 to a Roth IRA in 2012. However, my only income is through a government internship that paid with a 1099-G under Taxable Grant (~$5k). According to HR Block Online, I have to file that under other income, thus the max I am allowed to contribute is $0 to my Roth IRA and I am supposed to take the money back out.

I suppose my question is if that is actually true since the grant is supposed to be taxable? It would suck to take money back out of my Roth IRA.."

Each has different implications. And yeah, I know, first world problem.

First off, I'm an undergrad student of computational chemistry in the UK. I feel like my course is a bit light on the computational part in some respects as I eventually want to go into software development for chemistry applications. To further that goal, I have an internship lined up for June/July doing just that, but it doesn't include implementing new code, developing algorithms, learning CUDA programming or working in a functional language (all of which I want to improve upon and can't as part of my regular degree). 

**US**  
I'd be attempting some professional networking in California, possibly going to Burning Man or alternatively just taking the train up the West Coast. I've never been west of Pensacola, so it's a totally new thing travel-wise, but the career benefits are very very uncertain.

**Asia**  
I'd be going to Pakistan to visit some temples and interesting remote areas and see some friends again, then go to Bangladesh to meet the parts of my husband's family who live there. My professional network in both countries is close to perfect, however neither is the ideal place to do what I want to do. I'd also be able to stock up on tobacco in Dubai and save some money through that, which would be kinda nice.

**Europe**
I found [this course](http://www.utrechtsummerschool.nl/index.php?type=courses&amp;code=H9) in the Netherlands which would cover a lot of what I really want to learn, but it'd mean that I'm not leaving Europe this year at all and I fear that it'll be harder to do that after undergrad. I will e-mail the person running the course to get more details soon unless it's really not a good idea to begin with. Plus, the guy's name is Dijkstra. Heh.

***
Edit: I've also found a relevant course at Oxford that wouldn't clash with this one so this might actually be a better option than either of the others professionally.
***

So yeah, this is the first time I'm forced to make a choice between three options that are all really amazing with no one to steer me in one direction enough to make the choice for me in sight. I'd love some input. I also wanted to write this down in a somewhat structured way, I guess.

Everything from picking a language, to feeling out the fundamentals of programming, to answering my dumb questions about object oriented design, why my code isn't running, etc. Everyone has been super helpful and understanding of myself and many other newbies who want to learn the art of programming.

A year ago, I knew the basics of HTML and nothing else. I was pretty decent with computers, but never pursued it further than learning how to do basic OS tweaks and playing video games. I was a Finance major, and I hated what I was doing. I really dreaded getting a full time job in Finance, and didn't get along with other people in my major. I just wasn't into it, but I didn't know where else to turn. It wasn't until I found r/learnprogramming that I realized working with computers could be a viable career, and programming was actually something I could someday be decent at.

Now, I'm finally getting decent with Java, I've dabbled in C (with the CS50 class), and I've explored some other languages. I've made a few simple websites, and I'm in the process of developing an app for Android. I changed my major officially to Computer Science BS last semester, and I have an internship next summer as a Software Engineer at a Fortune 500 company.

And finally, with exception of class projects and small practice exercises I've done, I'm happy to say that I've shipped my first piece of software. It's a Chrome extension called Simple Blocker:

http://simpleblocker.com/

As the name suggests, it is a simple website blocker that lets you block any number of sites to help you concentrate. It has a sleep timer, as well as additional ""enhanced blocking"" features which make it difficult to turn on, if you have trouble with self control. The app is free, but in the future I may provide a Bitcoin address or something for donations ;) But I really just wanted to create it to learn JavaScript and mess around with the Chrome API rather than make money.

I don't want to rant on for too long, I really just wanted to say THANK YOU! And also wanted to get some quality feedback on my new app!

So I'm currently a sophomore Mechanical Engineer and computer science minor here at GT. I'm cooping for my first rotation right now, after which I'll be studying abroad this summer and then co-oping again this fall.

When I finally come back to Georgia tech next spring, I'd like to find some way of making some money. I swim a lot, so I thought lifeguarding at the CRC may be a good idea. However the pay is a lot less than what I make as a coop, and it doesn't look like I'd be able to start working until mid-March (when the CRC actually starts hiring new life guards)

Another idea I had was to look around for a local internship that I could work part time while taking classes. I'd prefer something close to campus (within reasonable distance) because I don't have a car with me on campus. It'd be awesome if i could even find something that let me work over the internet.

My final idea was to look for paid research positions, or even at GTRI, but I wasn't sure how feasible it would be for me to find a position without any prior research experience.

 Does anyone have any suggestions or ideas? Thanks in advance!"

I've been prowling around here for a week or so, and figured I'd post to see what you guys think my chances are. It ended up being quite long, but I hope some of you can help.

**Backstory:**

I graduated with my BSEE from a small reputable school in 2011. Since junior year, I realized I really liked signal processing, and I landed an internship my junior year summer at a large defense contractor doing signal processing. After school, I went to go work for a (different) defense contractor also doing signal processing, very R&amp;D focused group with tons of PhD's. I left jobs after a year and a half (got an offer that was very tough to refuse) and now also still do signal processing at a different smaller company (also R&amp;D oriented). I am currently doing my MSEE part-time at a well-ranked university through their distance education program part time. I've been on the fence about PhD for awhile (about six months), but about a month ago something inside me pushed me over the edge and I really want to apply for programs for next fall. I plan to finish my MSEE (non-thesis, courses only) before then.

**Education Statistics**:

Undergrad GPA: 3.2 (school was tough, major GPA is slightly higher)
Masters GPA: currently 3.5 (hoping to push it up to 3.7ish by application time)

I took a lot of advanced courses in signal processing in my undergraduate studies as well, which I'm hoping will show my passion and dedication to the subject.

GRE Scores:

Math: 780
Verbal: 630
Writing: 4.5

**Publications**:

My notable publication was from an R&amp;D program that I was working on at the company I joined after undergraduate studies. I was able to get it published at a peer-reviewed conference in the intelligence community, and also gave a conference presentation. I worked on it with two other people, but I am first author.

I did some pretty significant undergraduate research in signal processing related applications as well, although I only entered some IEEE student competitions and did fairly well (no real publication in a peer-reviewed journal).

**Recommendations**:

When I left my first company after undergraduate (where I was able to publish), I left on very good terms. I'm planning on getting one recommendation from a guy who ran the entire group I worked in (boss's boss) who helped me publish and knows my skill-set and my contributions very well. He is also a PhD in signal processing from MIT, which is my #1 school. 

I'm planning on getting a second recommendation from a professor who I am on extremely good terms with from undergrad (we still talk often online) who supervised my undergraduate research. I think he can speak well of my abilities from an academic perspective, and I'm going to tell him to heavily emphasize the research I did (although it was not officially published).

I'm unsure who to get as my third recommender. Since I am doing a distance education masters, I really don't have that much face-to-face interaction with any of the professors, and I'm not doing research or extra projects for them. Should I get another recommendation from my undergraduate school, or should I try to get another one from work?

**Schools I want to apply to**:

Mostly all the top-ranked schools: MIT (#1 choice), Stanford, Berkeley, USC, UCLA, Princeton, Columbia (maybe a few others as I decide later on)

I feel like my entire schooling and career so far has been leading up to this moment. I haven't wanted something this bad in a long time. I feel like having been in an R&amp;D oriented industry has really opened my eyes to research and my future career prospects. I really do like my job a lot, which is why I feel like I either want to go to a top-ranked school or not pursue a PhD at all. My question to you guys is: am I being delusional? Do I actually have a shot at getting in to some of these schools, or are my credentials not good enough?

I am also working every angle, utilizing every network, and doing preliminary research into different professors so I can send them some e-mails over the summer and see if they would be interested in working with me. I am also applying to the NSF fellowship and the NDSEG fellowship.

Thanks for reading.

I met my girlfriend freshman year of college and we’ve been dating for over four years. She comes from a rough background and since the beginning I have been financially supporting her.  I believe this is the root of the issue.





The financial support started small but by sophomore year I paid for all her books and daily needs (food, gas, etc…).  I wasn’t too thrilled, but I loved her and she really needed my help. I kept telling myself that it would pay off once we graduated; we would both get good paying jobs and she would be more financially independent. Periodically there would be conflict, I felt since I was paying for everything, I should have the final say in decisions.






 Starting junior year I was getting really tired of being the only one supporting her. Her family basically wrote her off on me and expected me to take care of anything she needed for school. She “technically” commuted but lived with me every semester on campus. At the same time she started acting entitled like all my support was expected. She had a part time internship that paid but would blow her money on luxury items that I felt she did not need (lots of shoes she only worse once or twice, a new $500 phone she did not need), while I was still stuck paying for all her basic needs. We started fighting a lot, and the arguments boiled down to her telling me not to tell her what to do and me comparing her to a spoiled child that I was forced to take care of. 






Now after almost a year since graduating, she still has not found a job and her self esteem is wrecked. For the first 5 months she was trying really hard but after being rejected so many times she kind of gave up and applies periodically to positions she finds online. What really bothers me is that she could have gotten a part time job all this time to make some money like I’ve been telling her but she never did.






 Unfortunately I have not made the situation any better and my frustration from having to support her all this time is really coming out. She waited until the night before her school loan and phone bill payments were due to call me and ask to pay them, I blew up. I starting yelling, calling her an ungrateful bitch that just used me for money and did nothing for herself. I told her that this relationship was bullshit, I deserved better, and I deserved an equal partner, not a spoiled daughter. I said some other really harsh things but what really hit me and made me decide to write this was her response… lightly sobbing on the phone she responded, “you are right” and started hysterically crying.







I am really torn, I feel terrible about how I’ve been treating her and making her feel but at the same time I feel that some if it is warranted. I feel like she is so use to me taking care of everything for her that she doesn’t really care if she gets a job or not. When we first started dating she was so adamant about wanting her own career, now she says she is happy doing whatever as long as she can be/live with me. I’m moving to another state for work and she keeps saying that once she moves with me there, then she will find a job. I’m not looking for a stay at home wife that I have to fully support and that’s not what she said she wanted when we started dating but I fear that’s what our relationship is turning into. 


Am I being too harsh on her? should I think about ending it?


tl;dr: After financially supporting my gf for over 4 years I'm getting tired of it. I feel that she is not pulling her own weight and just expects me to take care of her. Am I overreacting?

I've assumed a few open source projects, and I'm the  leader of the programming group on my school's FIRST Robotics team. I've also gotten a 5 on the College Board's AP Computer Science Exam. CS is definitely the path for me.

I'm just not sure how I should spend my time and where to go... Those areas have always been very much a blur.

I definitely want to pursue college; one part for the education, and the other to expose myself to likeminded individuals. I plan on pursuing an internship at a local BAE Systems this summer as well. Up until I graduate I'm trying to learn more languages and principles to sort of round me out, as well as pursue new projects.

My grades in school aren't that spectacular, but I'm trying to boost them up as well as do good on my SATs.

What are some things that I should do to better pave my path towards a CS career? A lot of people have told me to go out and apply myself which I've been doing to a relatively good extent, but it's hard given the fact that few of my peers share any interest towards this, and I'm really lucky to get any exposure at all at my age.

I'm sure I'll figure something out, most people tend to, but really if you've been in my shoes or have any advice as to how I should best utilize the remaining 1.5 years of high school that I have left, I would greatly appreciate it. 

Really just anything to give me a nice sense of perspective would be nice :)

Thanks.

I'm looking at Universities to attend, and I have a couple questions.

-Which candidate (assuming they are equal in every way, and I know that's impossible) would get the coveted SpaceX internship: a 3.9 from a well-respected state school engineering program, or a 3.6 from Cornell?

- Exactly how competitive are these internships? I'm going into Aero. It seems like NASA might be a bit easier to reach, as they have many centers and many positions. SpaceX seems like the hardest of the two, as they don't have many positions.

-A follow up to the previous question, if I get (near) perfect grades, do extracurriculars, clubs, etc, is it at all guaranteed that I'll even get a coop/internship that I want? Or is it a case like ""My self and 20 other perfect 4.0's have applied ten times, and I know no one that's gotten a SpaceX internship.""

From August 2010 until May 2012 I worked as a security intern at a local hospital. I was only 16 when I began and I thought it was the coolest job ever. And it was a very interesting job. Being security I had access to every room in the hospital. I typically worked second and third shifts, which were 3p-11p and 11p-7a. During the shift we would have to do Detex, which were basically security checks of the entire hospital. Being the low man on the totem pole, I usually got stuck with this job. But I didn't mind it because it was usually just an hour of walking and I got to snoop around. When I worked days I never had any problems. I would hum to myself and talk to staff. However, third shift was another story. I would hear and see things especially in the cancer center. It would also feel like I was being watched. 

Possibly the scariest experience I had happened in summer 2011. I was working third shift and I had been dispatching all night, so about 3 I got a break. I'd go smoke and then just walk for a little bit to wake myself up. So after I finished my cigarette I decided to walk around the cancer center because they had a fridge with soda that we could take. I walked in to the main hallway and past the chemo section. As soon as I passed the beds an alarm started going off. There are no patients held over night and all beds get unplugged by staff, so there was no reason that the alarm should have gone off. I booked my ass out of there immediately. And I swore I heard a female laugh as the door shut behind me.

I know this is something that you guys see a lot, since this seems to be the GOTO (lulz) place for those looking to get into a more computer-science based field, but I have a couple questions, and perhaps you can advise me based on my personal situation.


So, first off a little about myself, and what skills and resources I have at my disposal. I am a graduate of a mechanical engineering program with a math minor, and interest in art (couple fun classes added in, and do it as a side hobby). However, when I was in school, my junior year I took a class on programming in C++.

IT.

WAS. 

AWESOME.

Obviously, I loved it, but I felt committed to sticking to a 4-year degree and actually graduating on time and just enjoying the fun class. So I did very little extra programming during my senior year beyond a database class that was ok.


Still, as I'm wrapping up a year-long Co-op (extended, paid engineering internship) in industry, I am fairly certain that I want to transition to something that is more computer science-based.


tl;dr? Engineering Degree, Math minor, art hobby, novice C++ Experience

And with that, what are my options? I have thought about looking for companies with tuition assistance and finding a master's program that I could use to specialize into a more computational/simulation type of engineering. My family is recently moved to the west coast, which as far as I can tell is a good thing if I want to follow them out there. However, as far as looking for stuff locally/getting my face in front of people, I am located in TN.


Also, are there graduate programs that cater to those who are not comp-sci majors and gives them the tools to apply programming to their respective fields?"

Afterwards I am planning on moving in with my german boyfriend and I would need to either pursue a Master's to be be approved for a resident student visa, or (more preferably) I would need to find a job or internship suitable for my novice level of the german language to validate my stay. 

I am Desperate and how no idea where and how to start looking. From what my boyfriend and my other german friends tell me, the system for internships and job finding is a lot different in Germany than in America. In Germany, what you study and where you work is extremely connected, whereas here in the U.S. having a degree in history or anything really can get you a job managing a retail store, etcetera.
Also in germany, companies work closely with their student interns because internships and work experience is required for a university degree and here not so much. Hence, I would be entering the workforce a bit behind in the internship area.

So if anyone can help aid me in my search for a job or internship, or any information of how to go about my search, I would be forever grateful :)"

As a computer games programming student in UK, I landed a internship that isn't quite related to games. The industry out there is tough and it's 10 times tougher if you are a student looking for a placement. 

Some of my colleagues that also landed placements in software development roles think that they might fall in love with it and basically switch to that, instead of games. Is this the maturation process people in their 20's go through when they realize they want to do something 'serious' in life, and not games? I for one can't imagine myself doing something else **other** than games, even if I will probably enjoy my placement anyway. 


My question is, how do placements that are somewhat different from what you want to do in life change and help you? I for one know that my internship will push my programming skills to the limit and also drag me through all the algorithms and methods I usually hate. It helps that the lemons I'm speaking of represent Microsoft, but I can't help but feel jealous of those that get a placement in a game company.

I REALLY appreciate the advice on r/personalfinance - it's a particular type of knowledge that is hard to come by.

Background: I made about $37k in 2012 - I only worked until July and have been a student since August/Sept. I have to file in 3 states.
For 2013, I'll make a total of around $22k from a summer internship. By 2014, I will be married and personally expect to make somewhere between $90k and $120k.

1) I'm borrowing (or will borrow) quite a bit of money - $120k but I've been fortunate enough to borrow on a family member's equity line so I'm locked in around 2%. So it's not exactly a student loan... do I get any tax benefit for this?  e.g., American Opportunity Tax Credit or Student Loan Interest Deduction?

2) any other tips to maximize returns given my lower relative income and student status in 2012 and 2013? 
 - for example, i think it may be smart to convert my $10k or so from a traditional ira (rest is roth) into a roth given my lower income.

My apologies if i didn't provide enough personal info. Also I hope this is a resource for others in a somewhat similar position so please feel free to respond even if it doesn't particularly apply to me. Thanks!

1bd361,220,2013-03-31,"Is the common ""engineers are in demand"" advice a scam?",Joscelin2,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1bd361/is_the_common_engineers_are_in_demand_advice_a/,"I'm just wondering if anyone else is having the same experience as me. I got a degree in 2010 in Chemical Engineering with a 3.7 GPA and research experience, but I can't seem to find any work beyond temporary low paying lab-tech jobs. I have a spreadsheet of jobs I've applied to and I've applied to over 2000, and I've gotten a whopping 10 phone interviews and 3 in-person interviews. Most of the phone interviews I find to be very rude. For example, last week I had an interview that went like this:

INTERVIEWER: Have you worked with Aspen [EXTREMELY SPECIFIC VERSION]

ME: No, but I've worked with Version X and it's very similar. I'm sure I could easily learn your company's version. 

INTERVIEWER: A yes or a no is all I need.

My advisor told me companies do this because they're legally required to disqualify a certain number of U.S. candidates before they can apply for h1b visas. There's an article in my local newspaper right now talking about a local company who claims they can't find enough engineers. I can't help but think they're full of shit. I've noticed that none of these kinds of articles are supported by actual data (i.e. we have 10 openings but only 8 qualified engineers applied). They just talk vaguely about how we need more engineering graduates. I think it's really code for ""we want to pay our engineers less.""

I've had my resume reviewed by quite a few people, and no one can find anything wrong with it. In fact my school's career counselor told me it's one of the best resumes she's seen. I'm aware that I'm not a spectacular candidate since I didn't do an internship, but surely there should be jobs for average people too? 

Most of my friends from college are in a similar position. Those that found real engineering jobs had a **close** friend or family member who pulled strings for them. I'm a first generation college graduate, so my family can't really help as far as networking, and my close friends are in the same position as me. I know I'm going to be told to ""network more"" but making close friends in hiring positions is a long and exhausting process. 

I feel kind of like I fell for a scam. Engineers aren't really in demand, and I wasted 4 years of my life working towards entering a field that I'll never be able to. 

Anyone else in a similar position right now? Can anyone in a hiring position comment on if there's really a ""shortage"" or candidates?

EDIT:

Wow! I didn't expect the overwhelming number of responses. I haven't had time to read or reply to them all yet, but I've skimmed most of them. I didn't make this thread with the intention of getting career advice. I only intended to discuss the current demand for entry level engineers. But most of you have offered it and I am thankful for that. To those of you who think I've been sitting at home doing nothing for the past 3 years: that's not true. I've been working as a temporary lab-tech for very low pay ($9/hr) so I'm technically gainfully employed. The company I'm working for keeps extending my contract, but it's pretty much impossible to get a full time position with them without a PhD. I've also found odd jobs for weekends on craigslist to help make ends meet. 

A few people have called me ""elitist"" for not wanting to be a lab tech. I would be perfectly content to be a lab tech for the rest of my life, if only it paid a living wage. Right now I'm blessed with a very healthy 1 year old, and I lose sleep at night when I think of what might happen if she ever needs medical care beyond a standard check up. Not to mention raising a child in a studio apartment on $9/hr and food stamps in one of the most expensive areas in the country kind of sucks. Sure I could relocate, and I'd be happy if a company would be willing to pay the expenses.  But doing it on my own would mean risking money and moving away from family. Go ahead and call me entitled. I feel that people should be entitled to a living wage if they're willing to work. 

To the people who called me ""lazy"": I take offense to that. You're probably the very same people who make it nearly impossible for the unemployed to find work. I will not address that any further.

What I want you to start thinking about right now is the *utility* of Political Science.  
  
Too often students decide to study political science because they like the courses, which are interesting, but without thinking too critically about what political science means for them.  But if you are a year away from graduation, you have time to make some critical choices that will have an ASTRONOMICAL impact on your ability to get a job.  
  
1) **Decide now if you are going to graduate school.**  If you decide now you will be able to plan for some really important details, there are programs that you can only apply for in your junior year that are designed to get you into a graduate program.  At every school there is a person who's job is to look for people to apply for those programs, get a bug in their ear with your name on it and increase your chances of selection.  Some of these programs require that you be nominated for them by your university which is easier if you know the person doing the nominating.  
  
2)  **Partner with a professor to round out your skills.**  Most political science programs don't have a lot of room for diversification.  You'll take the same types of research classes as everyone else and you'll use the same programs as everyone else.  Unfortunately for you, some of these programs may not be the industry standard, or even be very marketable right now.  If you ask a professor, who likes you, you can usually find out what programs you need to know.  A lot of schools use SPSS for statistics analysis, but I've never met a research professional who likes it.  STATA is pretty much industry standard, but the point is that YOU don't know that.  You need to find out.  Almost every school offers an independent research project that can take the place of a class.  If you are really cool, you can stretch that project out for a whole year into an honors project (doesn't matter if you aren't an honors student).  During this project you can learn how to use these other programs which you can put down on a resume, or gain practical skills like data analysis which you might not get from your degree program, especially at Bachelor level.  
  
3) **Good god, I cannot stress this enough.  GET A FUCKING INTERNSHIP**.  You want to know how political science professionals look at recent graduates with no practical experience?  [I've loved this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_VPGilSNKw) ever since I first saw it because it really hits the nail on the head.  You *need* practical experience.  Get it now.  No one cares how idealistic you are or what ideas you have if you don't have practical experiences that shape your understanding of those facts.  An independent research project is great, but an internship or job that is actually in the field of political science is the holy grail of how to get work as a poli sci major.  Interships don't just get you into the field, they develop networking relationships that can get you actual jobs when you graduate, but you have to foster those relationships.  The people you work with as an intern are usually more than happy to reach out into their organization to try and find a place for you, but you have to ask, and you have to get in the door first.  If internships are in short supply volunteer at a campaign.  You'd be surprised how many of my colleagues got their start working for a political campaign as a canvasser and then stayed after hours to help out at the office and sit in on strategy meetings just to learn.  Nearly all of them, including me.  
  
**And, as always, I'm happy to answer questions that people have.**
  
TLDR: This is why you have no internship prospects, you don't read."

Hey guys. If you remember me from last time (about half a year ago..who would remember?), I made a shitty web portfolio. I got around 100 views from you all. Thanks for all the feedback :) 

I'm currently working as a UI/UX intern so I learned a lot of new tricks and changed a lot of bad habits. 

Some (coding) differences from last time: 

• using spans instead of css3 columns

• using section dividers

• more css3 stuff (gradients, rounded corners)

That's cool and all but I'm not sure how to move on design wise. :( I'm planning on adding a parallax effect but I dunno, is that way overused? 

Let me know! And if I know you, hey there! This is my design related reddit account! Hahah.

I'm trying to figure out how I'm supposed to manage my taxes since I've never used a 1099.
In January I started an internship and the contract states that Im a 1099 contractor for the company, so I'm getting untaxed wages and I've been putting away 20% of each paycheck for taxes.
I've gathered that Im supposed to pay my taxes four times a year and one of these times is around April 15th, so it's pretty soon.

Should I file this payment myself or contact someone more knowledgeable? I got the 1040-ES form and there's a few things I'm unclear about, such as there difference between 1a (Expected income and profits subject to self-employment tax) and 6 (Enter your expected wages (if subject to social security tax...)) on the Tax Deduction worksheet portion.

Then in the actual 2013 Estimated tax worksheet, point 1- Adjusted gross income you expect in 2013 - how can I figure out this number? My internship will probably end rather soon and I'll probably take up another one or get an entry level position, so am I supposed to make an educated guess at this?

I know all the information is ""out there"" but I'm having a hard time piecing everything together and taxes are one of the few things I really don't want to mess up.

Should I hit up my college for tax help? Is there some software I can use? Or should I just go to a tax professional?"
1bcs0j,14,2013-03-31,Doing this for my sister.,Chasing_Noses,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1bcs0j/doing_this_for_my_sister/,"Hey Reddit,

My sister has anxiety disorder, but since English isn't our native language and she feels a bit embarrassed, I'm writing her story down and I'm hoping you can tell her things she can relate to or something that motivates her.

Since she started her study for nursing, she's been asking way too much of herself. When she had to write a paper that had to be at least 45 pages, she wrote 90. Things like that. Also, she met her boyfriend in Turkey and after a few years he moved to our country, and all the things they had to do gave her a lot of stress and made her paranoid.

Now, after years of stress, she broke down. She's in her final year of nursing and she had to do an internship in the hospital and she was too scared to go. She cried the entire time, couldn't sleep and at first we thought she was just nervous, but now we realize that this is serious and it's gonna take months, maybe years to heal. She dropped out of school and she hopes she can start again in september, but so far it doesn't seem like she will. She is seeing a therapist once a month, but it doesn't really seem to help.

It kills me to see her suffering like that. Sitting on the couch, tired, bags under her eyes. She's knitting the whole day to distract herself from the fears she has. Right now she feels alone, like nobody understands what she's going through. Going out for a walk is such a huge step for her, she wants to go out but her body tells her to stay in bed all day.

So Reddit, please make her feel like she isn't alone. Share your story in here, give her some tips or motivation! 

EDIT: Thanks Reddit! I translated all your comments, printed them out and gave it to her. She related a lot. While she was reading, she was nodding the entire time. She's gonna read your comments when she feels bad, so you really helped her out!

I'm very much a gamer, a music lover as well as a chef, though food will always come first. At the moment I'm doing my unpaid internship with A few of the people I met in Culinary school before they graduated. I'll finally be finished in a little over 6 weeks. It's been a long, at times hard, and almost always a challenging experience.

I've been cooking since I was 12, catering parties up to 20 since I was 16, but about three years ago I decided to drop my graphics design job and persue this. Food has always been my passion, and as I look back I realize it's possibly the best decision I've ever made.

As for gaming, I've been pretty deep in to Bioshock Infinite, Planetside 2 and Borderlands 2 when I have time off. Bioshock Infinite is definitely the one I'm playing the most at the moment. I picked it up on Friday and I have spent my entire weekend off playing it to get it done before work Monday.

As for music, I am definitely one who likes almost every genre, before I moved I had over 3500 vinyl and 2500+ CD's. They are now in storage, but I kept them in a digital format which is up to something like 45k songs. Music I would definitely say is the only thing in my life that equals to my passion of cooking. I can sing fairly well, I was even in a band for 6 months.. then school ended and I never really tried to make it work past that.

Here's some of the things I've made in the past:

**The rules:** Remove all personal identification from your cover letters and resumes. No full names, addresses, phone numbers, etc. This includes yours and any information regarding people who work where you intend to apply. Institution name is fine where appropriate.

Feel free to suggest options for how people can post their resumes. One option is to put it on Google Drive and share the link here. Make sure it is publicly viewable to people who have the link, but not editable. Enabling comments would probably help. 

Please edit at least one resume if you are going to post yours! Even the greenest college student intern can catch grammar errors or suggest better phrasing, so don't be shy.

Again, please disconnect your personal information from your resume. Be wary if anyone contacts you requesting your information. Always keep in mind what information the institution you work for would be okay with you sharing."

This was partly due to the difficulty of maintaing my lifestyle where I was, and partly due to my wanting to try the traditional dishes. 

Anyway, I returned home in August, and have kept eating meat and other animal products since. I have managed to transition myself to 100% vegan groceries when I'm at home, but when I eat out I have continued eating animal products.

He also said he loves me and does not want to break up. So I’m confused as to what he really wants.

28f, 29m. We met in college and stayed in a long distance relationship after we graduated and went to graduate school/ law school in different states. We got married in the second summer of graduate school and have been in a long distance marriage since then. 

We have had ups and downs, but stayed together. During his three years of law school, he bad grades and often missed classes. This became a problem in the last year because he couldn't find a job after graduation (he didn't look for one because of bad grades). He drank a lot and put on a lot of weight in that year. Around graduation we had a fight because he was going to move home and stay with his parents, making our distance longer. He said he wanted to move home because I was the reason he couldn't have any friends. He said he felt I would get upset if he went out with his friends. I could kind of see what he meant; I caught him cheating several times throughout our relationship and maybe as a result I tend to question his whereabouts. I thought the basic “where are you/what are you doing” is not extreme for a LDR. He questioned my whereabouts too, and never told me I was smothering him. I have been able to develop new friendships, although I did spend most of my nights talking to him on the phone. I thought it was something he enjoyed doing. He never mentioned it was a problem and called/texted me constantly. It was also initially his idea to get married, and I did nothing to force him into marriage at all. It all seemed natural and something he really wanted. We only spent summers and winters together. I visited him about once a month. I don't think this is too much time we spend together given we are married.

We were on good terms for a while after he moved home after graduation. He has been doing an unpaid internship and hopes to find a job this year. He has been loving and told me earlier this year how I am the most important thing in his life how much he wanted to be with me etc etc. He also expressed regrets for cheating etc etc. Recently it went down hill again. After a fight he stopped talking to me for two weeks (this isn’t new as he sometimes gives me prolonged silent treatment when we fight). When we started talking again last week he seemed a bit distant. Although he was still telling me he loves me but he was calling and texting me significantly less. I thought I would ask to see if something is bothering him. This was when he said again he felt like he didn't have any friends anymore, because I would be upset if he went out with his friends. Most importantly, he said he felt “confined”. I asked if he wanted to end the relationship he said no and he loved me.

I felt like a horrible person for making him feel that way, but meanwhile, I am kind of confused as to why he feels “confined”. Last time I saw him was Christmas. Then we just talked like once a day on the phone, is that smothering? If so, why wasn’t this brought up earlier? I feel like I always had to pretend everything is ok between us; if I bring up any concerns I have I ended up being the one apologizing. I’m starting to think that he actually doesn’t want to be with me, but cannot end the relationship somehow. Reddit, what do you think?

Finally got around to making an account and writing this. I've told myself I'd do it for months now.

My family is one of those that's just filled to the brim with fuck-ups. Two uncles and a father dead from drugs. Another aunt, uncle, and cousin still living with my grandparents. My brother went to community college for a semster, ""took a break"" and now works at McDonalds scraping by. My mom has the shittiest judgement I've ever known. Two years ago she quit a promising/well-paying job at the local Juvi so she could date an ex-con. That fell through quick and the last two years have been a downward spiral into my current situation. As of June of 2012 we've been homeless. At first it was the living in motels scheme. My little siblings thought it was fun. It sickened me. Now we managed to get this little trailer (I need to hunch if I stand in it) and we stay in a dirt lot next to a fucking bar. A bar. I've had nights were I listen to guys pummeling their girlfriends, shootings, and all kinds of fucked up no more than twenty yards away. We have to stay quiet so the house next to the lot doesn't complain. I think of Anne Frank a lot, and that doesn't help anything at all. I really don't know why I haven't called Child Protective Services on my mother, guilt, pride, shame, hope, who the fuck knows. I wouldn't be so bitter if it weren't for her attitude about it. Whenever I ask how the house search is going she shuts down on me, and I nearly ran away the day she said she was happy with the trailer and *preferred* it over an apartment. I appreciate shit is worse for people, what makes me livid is how okay with our situation she is. It's gone on like this in the trailer for almost a year now. And I can say with confidence I loathe her... hate her. 

During this year though, I've also made more progress then ever. I've coped with this shit by overloading myself with work. My grades have turned into college-material and I got an internship at this non-profit art studio. They let me stay after hours and work. It's where I am now and spend most of my time avoiding that place my mom likes to call home. I refuse to call it a home. I've coped well so far and with the work I made for myself I can feel a life I never dreamed of opening up for me. I nearly cried when I got my two best compliments. They were so brief, but did so much. On two separate occasions these guys (part time mentors at the studio) just sort of walked up, watched me work for a little bit, and said I'm going to go so far. These two are accomplished like no fucking tomorrow, one worked with Matt Stone and Trey Parker on Team America. It's put my professional ego up enough to keep going... But I've still felt like absolute shit. Everyone keeps telling me how great my work is, how nice I am, and how wonderful it must be to do what I do. But I wake up and fall asleep angry every single day. The studio is chok-full of these privileged people who get to go home to electricity, hot showers, food in a fridge, and seemingly half-way decent folks. I loathe these people's complaints, and I beat myself up for doing it too. It's never been outward either, that's what's weird. I'm stuck practicing being a nice person and I almost perpetually have these fucked up and angry thoughts towards people who don't deserve it. It's spring break right now. Breaks are so much worse, I have nowhere to be in the mornings and just sit around and stagnate with my fucked up thoughts. School is where I get most of my food too. Breaks are the times I hate the most. Over the last week or two I've also noticed something *really* different. My eye twitches, A LOT. At least seven or eight times each hour. I think I've gotten my first stress induced tic. Three days ago I cried for about 4 hours in the middle of the night while my mom, her boyfriend (not the ex-con), and my half-brother went and lived it up at another hotel. I never go with them. I don't like the faux relaxation.

It's been college application time and all I want is to move away. Far far away. But I hate myself for doing this too, my younger siblings don't deserve this shit. You know what the most artistic city in the country is? Sante Fe... at least 20 hours away by car. Their art college is practically recruiting too.

I've turned into this emotionally inept person who almost constantly has to put on this air of happiness and confidence. The last time I said ""I love you"" to anyone was my grandma; and that was the not-so-weighty see ya' later type of I love you. That little thing made my stomach wrench. My closest friend who I've known for seven or eight years now hasn't heard a word of this simply because we never had that kind of openness. I think I've begun to resent him too. Just a little bit. He got really sick two years ago and his grades, mentality, and life suffered for it. I try to be sensitive to the fact I don't know shit about what he's thinking, but it's been two fucking years and all he does is mule around his house and hang out with friends. He keeps saying ""When I get a job I'll do this-and-that,"" but he hasn't done shit besides download fucktons of videogames and shows to waste his time. I feel like him and I have become polar opposites of each other. He seems to be living the life and so often he says things ""don't matter"" or that he doesn't care. In fact, I don't know what he DOES care about. Besides him, my closest friends are one guy at the studio who has been through shit worse than I have and my teachers.

I think that's it. Also, if you're reading this and think it's Justin... It is. I hope someone I know reads this. If for some astronomical reason any of you read this... Brian, Jose, Mr.Green, Mr.Russell, Meg, Marcia, Andrew, Jim... Don't confront me about it, just hint at it. When I'm ready I'll come to you guys... For now I have to bitch around complaining to the internet.

Thanks for reading this shit.... It's been a lot."

I guess the crux of my dilemma is I somehow feel that web media is inferior to many startup ideas I see-- blogging isn't game-changing and my business model is by no means disruptive-- I'm simply better at monetizing than 95% of bloggers.

As a side note I do value my quality of life and make a terrible weekend entrepreneur. During my startup internship I spent half my time thinking, ""I could be doing this for my own business and making more."""

I'm an accounting/finance sophomore at a top 50 undergrad b school, but all consultants that I've spoken with from my school went on to get their MBA top graduate program and then go on to a top consulting firm. So I guess my question is what is the stereotypical route if you want to get into consulting after graduating? What kinds of internships did you have before you graduated? I have immediate family in Boston, ~20 minutes from NYC, ~an hour from Charlotte, and ~an hour from Miami so location doesn't matter how would you recommend I make contacts in an area my school is not in? Are there firms where realistically the consultants were the upper-mid students from non-target schools? What major/degrees did you graduate with before you went into consulting? I'm a hard worker,self-driven and definitely not afraid to make some cold calls."

1bc2h9,0,2013-03-30,Need help with ECs,[deleted],premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1bc2h9/need_help_with_ecs/,"Hey Premeddit,

I'm planning on applying in the 2014 cycle, so I still have about a year to really improve my application. I always feel as if my ECs aren't as spectacular as they could be. Would you please critique them?

One thing I'm concerned about is long-term commitment to my ECs. I ended up transferring schools 2 years into my college experience, and so on paper, I can't really say I've been doing an EC for 2+ years continuously. 

Another thing that I am lacking is clinical volunteering. I know that most people usually volunteer at a hospital. However, I'm not really interested in doing paperwork/answering phone calls all day since that won't really give me much patient exposure. Unfortunately, the only positions at the hospitals near me offer work along those lines instead of positions that are more patient-focused. Is there something else I could possibly do besides a generic hospital volunteering to fill in that gap on my application?

I'll be studying for my MCAT this summer (Taking in August), and I would like to spend 3-4 hours a week doing some EC to relax. Any ideas? 


**Shadowing**

* Oncologist: 90 hours over one summer
* Urologist: 40 hours over one week (also got to see surgeries; was a super cool experience!)
* Internal Medicine (Primary Care): 20 hours over one week

**Research**

* Nanoparticle Research: 2 years full time, various presentations but no publications
* Summer Research Internship at UCLA: 2 months, 35 hours/week

**Volunteering**

* 125 Hours over two years through a school-wide Service Organization. Focus was on aiding the physically/mentally disabled.
* Currently volunteering through another service organization, will continue until graduation. Estimated 100+ hours by the time I apply

**Leadership**

* Organic Chemistry tutor for 1 year
* Employed as an RA starting this August. I am also planning on creating an organization through my employer that focuses on having freshman perform community service
* Freshman Mentor starting this August
* Anatomy TA starting this August

**Other**

* Tennis: 6 years now; Vice-President of Tennis Club for 1 year
* Planning on doing another research internship at either NIH or my local medical school the summer of my application cycle. Also considering finding another research lab either this upcoming fall or next spring (more likely in the spring though due to other commitments)
* Planning on a study abroad or internship the semester before I graduate (right before medical school)

I previously only had some skirts and a cheap blazer that didn't match, so I spent a LOT of money at Express today on a grey blazer with matching skirt and pants and a dress (my boss recommended express for nice business clothes). 

I tried putting some outfits together and I would really like some feedback. No matter what I try it always makes me feel awkward/frumpy. I think part of the problem is that I'm very short and curvy, and the blazer look kind of conceals my curves and makes me look like I'm way bigger than I actually am. Or maybe I'm just being too self-conscious. 

Here's the album of my attempted outfits: http://imgur.com/a/0SVjm

Sorry about the phone mirror pics, but it's really the best I could do since I have no camera and my laptop webcam takes really poor quality.

Some info: I'm 19, 5'2'', about 130 pounds. Bust 38'', underbust 28.5''. According to the calculator I have an hourglass shape. Budget right now is close to nothing. I used up almost all of my extra money at Express today so I'm basically looking for how to do the most with what I have, or if I should return/exchange something. I'm probably willing to shell out another $100 at most do get an acceptable work outfit. I live in the United States.

I also have a few specific questions about the outfits

* Is the blue dress to short to wear in a business environment?
* Should I have gone with black instead of grey? The store assistant convinced me to go with gray but now I'm worried I can't pull it off.
* As you can see in the last picture, the skirt has the slit on the side instead of the back. Is this correct? Am I wearing it wrong or something?
* Where can I get some dressy business blouses to wear with the suit?
* What colors will look good with the grey?

I really appreciate your help :)"

I've [25M] currently just moved abroad for an internship project, while my girlfriend [23F] of 3 years stays back home to study. I've taken to keeping a daily diary describing my experiences. It's a doc file which I update, save, and send to my GF, father, and mother. Thing is, when I spoke to my GF via Skype and told her I was thinking of maybe adding images to it, she told me that ""you don't have to spend so much time on it"", which bothered me unexpectedly badly. 

It felt to me like she assumes I'm writing the diary for her alone, while I'm actually doing it mainly for myself. Even though I appreciate her concern and she probably meant to say this to make clear she doesn't expect me to keep her updated on every little thing, her saying this very much affects my motivation to keep the diary, and I'm now struggling to write. Earlier, I had no problems writing, and paragraphs flowed from my fingertips.

It's a similar feeling to the one you get when your parents tell you to do something which you were going to do anyway, thereby completely removing your desire to continue doing that thing, and stop.

I guess I'm just looking for some reflection on this. Did she sort of claim my writing as 'for her'? Am I too possessive about this? Is it just better to keep the diary entirely to myself? Or write it for myself, and send it to the relevant people for their reading pleasure? Looking forward to your views."

He agrees that it we would have a lot of uses for them we came up with a project but the thing is that I am the only computer engineer at the place where I intern at. While that is not that big of a problem for me as I think I can handle what we came up with, one thing that I am having a lot of trouble with is selecting a microcontroller for it. I have starting coming up with a basic design but keep stumbling when it comes to picking a microcontroller. There are so many out there and I am having trouble discerning what the right one for our project is. The gist of the project is that it will monitor a few sensors and open and close air valves based on the readings and maybe send info via ethernet. Rather then tell you guys more in detail what I am implementing and have you tell me what to buy, I was hoping if some people could give advice on how they go about picking a new microcontroller from the thousands out there when they start a new project.

Folks on scooters usually seem to be wearing street clothes, and I was wondering if I was effectively going to be using a bike for the same purposes (low speed commuting), why is ATGATT necessary? 
I am not trying to find an ""out"" or an ""excuse"" to be unsafe - just a general question about the rider philosophy from someone who has not joined the community yet. My apologies if there is an ATGATT set amongst scooter riders that I was unaware of. "
