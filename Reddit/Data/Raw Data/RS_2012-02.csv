p6vza,13,2012-02-01,Roadmap to medical career?,[deleted],medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/p6vza/roadmap_to_medical_career/,"Apologies in advance for the long read (or atleast it looks long in the preview window)

 **tl;dr** what is the typical order of schooling to get into medicine (i.e. high school then college then med school)?

Alrighty, howdy-do folks. I am a current US high school student (actually dual enrolled at a local college) looking to end up in this career of fixing broken people, so I figured the people already in medical school could help with this. I'm wondering what the typical order of schooling is, what kinds of tests I have to take and when i.e. I've heard of the MCAT but I know nothing about it or when I would take it, I know not very soon though.

So far what I've got as of yet is:

1. High school

2. 4 Year University most likely for a BA? pre med if that is how this works?

3. Medical school: how long is this? 4 yrs? Is the MCAT taken to get into a med school similar to SAT/ACT for universities?

4. ?????

5. Profit.

What the hell happens at 4? Is that the endgame in regards to instituted education? In a hospital doing medical stuff as an intern at this point?

Also, prices of typical medical schools? I know loans are pretty much necessary, I'm fine with it. Don't include the price of a 4 year university in this though thanks to Florida pre-paid college. We got it many a year ago when tuition wasn't as high.

And I think lastly, I read in [/r/premed](/r/premed) about people doing post-BA or undergrad research. Can someone explain what that means? Is it necessary prior to medical schooling?

Many thanks."

It seemed like a good opportunity to learn. I was right. After 2 weeks I decided that this is where I wanted to work and moved to the other side of the GTA.

So recently I bought a barracuda mail archiver and set exchange up to auto delete emails older than 6 months. (side not people still have mail box sizes of 3-4GB). Now i have a ton of free space in the exchange databases. I need to run eseutil /d but it requires 110% times the space on the server as the database.  Once I do one of the databases i will be find for the rest. 

So here is my question is how do i do the first one.

My idea: I have Exchange Management Console/Shell on another server. This server has tons of free space. Therefore can I dismount the database, copy it to the other server, run eseutil /D on it then copy the database back the exchange server, and reattach it to exchange?  (Note: M$ does not recommend using the eseutil /t and putting the db on a network share).

I am a recent graduate with a bach. in Software dev. At the moment I have an internship going (unpaid :(   ) so I figured a good way to get some money on the side (afternoons/weekend jobs) would be to start up a simple little home pc shop.

I have done small to medium repairs on my own and family computers for free over the years, but I do not know if I want to include any kind of larger repair service (do not have the $ to afford startup gear if its a hardware issue). What I did plan on including though is the following:

* Home network setup
* Virus/maleware removal
* Custom builds
* Data Transfer
* Software installation (eh...we have a large group of elderly people here)
* Recommend with what budget you have what desktop/laptop to buy

After I get some initial funds from doing a few jobs, maybe it would be a good idea to then invest in tools for repair jobs (PS testers etc). I have a usb-sata-ide already that I borrow from a friend, and I already have a generic toolkit of screwdrivers and zipties/cutters. 

I figured a flat rate for most jobs would work good, and with the custom builds I would get a budget, and then collect a percentage     (enough to cover the parts if I have no budget to work with) ahead of time, and then the rest after completion. If I did get into repair, Id probably charge 30-40 an hour to undercut the local (hugely overpriced) store that has 2-3 employees working there. I applied back there when I was 19 looking for a summer job, back then it was....nasty to say the least. 

Flyers will be put in the 2-3 grocery stores within the 2-3 towns around here. Will be ordering business cards and setting up with Google Voice. Anything else you guys can think of that I am missing that I could include/need to do? Hopefully this is in the correct subreddit. Thanks for your time!

So the STOCK act. First of all, I'm not sure how this isn't already illegal.   I guess it's a good thing that they're making it illegal, but really, this just adds another reason to question current policies towards corporate America, and really the character of our representatives in general. Isn't the premise of existing insider trading laws something to the effect of ""if your work exposes you to certain privied info, then you can't use that to make trades?"" Another reason for people to distrust Washington, private industry and capitalism as a whole.(more on that later).


The Pauls. Oh the Pauls.  I have a lot of respect for Ron Paul. I'm not a libertarian, but the man has principals.  Why doesn't he just run as an independent or even as a libertarian? I know his chances of winning would be slim, but at least he would represent a viable third party candidate. Rand, well, he wants to extend the STOCK act to the executive (which I agree with). Bit something about it just makes the whole thing seem very childish. ""you started it"". ""you did it too."" just another reason to distrust Washington, the private sector and capitalism(more on that now).


Last night I was listening to some conservative radio host on 1210 AM (Philly station). He was talking about some pew poll that found that 60% of young people aged 18-29 viewed capitalism negatively while 60% now viewed socialism positively. He wasn't having it. Went on some silly rant that was rather inrelated and then had some 23 year old (I think his intern) give his opinion (young people are lazy, feel entitled etc). 

I guess the point is this.  Why would we trust Washington, the private sector or capitalism? For many of us, our developmental lives took place during two wars that were started under, let's say, questionable terms.  We've watched our economy collapse because of corrupt and backwards policies towards the private industry, all the while the gap between the rich and poor continues to grow.  

I'm not one who says that the system needs torn down and built a new. I think it's our responsibilty though, to work to change it. Any way, I have to go. Thanks for listening."

Several years of busting my ass (relatively) at a mediocre public high school, plus tons of luck, got me into my long-time dream college where I joined a baller engineering program.

I had arrived at my version of paradise. I got complacent; I partied, made friends, and expanded my horizons. I also relapsed into a habit of chafing against classes with teaching methods and material that I found irrelevant, and I often did the minimum amount of work to keep my GPA where I wanted it. I grazed over countless topics in my spare time and mastered none, unless you count clicking the Stumbleupon button or writing bad poetry.

Then, last winter quarter (a third of the way into my sophomore year), I took on a time-sucking leadership position in a rowdy extracurricular club and began to let substance habits get the better of me. That spring quarter I underachieved like there was no tomorrow. It was all okay though, because I had a job lined up, didn't I? I was quite the budding (pseudo)intellectual, wasn't I?

Hedonism was the theme of that summer. I turned down a research internship I felt woefully unprepared for and took on a higher-paying job with an education startup that I was woefully not cut out for. I told myself I was going to be a part of the changing education landscape, that I was going to spend my spare time learning web dev and studying the brain and whatnot. Instead I had barrels of fun but continued to let my mind, along with many interpersonal connections, fall into disrepair.

Fall was the very worst. I avoided probation by the skin of my teeth and knew of no professors I could ask for future recommendations. I grew depressed, socially anxious, and increasingly apathetic about my hygiene and health. I had everything I wanted and needed in front of me and still felt miserable, which made me feel even more worthless. 

I resolved to sack up for 2012, and I did. Upon finishing up my leadership post and renouncing substances about a month ago, my schedule opened up, and I started to get back on the horse. I was going to buckle down and get straight A's again, just to prove to myself I could do it.

And here we are.

I sit here, tearing my hair out, staring at three blank problem sets. I feel utterly fucked, as before. To my horror, I haven't been able wrap my head around the material in my classes at nearly the required pace, and it's only going to get plenty harder. The drop deadline has passed. My depression has not.

It's too late for me to change my major without going into serious debt to pay for extra quarters. I can take a year off but I would have to withdraw from my current courses, accept academic probation, and face the ridicule and contempt of my family and peers.

I have let everyone in my life down. I feel extreme shame and don't know where to turn. Reddit, do you have any similar stories with at least a bittersweet ending?

Thank you.

**TL;DR** - Kicked ass in high school, fucked up in college, currently convinced I don't have what it takes to make it the rest of the way through. Has anyone you know made it through something like this?"

Many tears have been shed the last few weeks because of the stress...

p5s9r,1,2012-02-01,Jia you chao ren!,driven2rhythm,WritersGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersGroup/comments/p5s9r/jia_you_chao_ren/,"I'm an engineering student and I haven't had a writing class in three years. I moved to China eight months ago for an internship and I figured since I wouldn't be using a lot of spoken English I would need another way to keep up my English. My decision was to started a blog about my experiences in China. I'm trying to improve my writing and possibly start writing a longer story or fiction sometime in the near future.

Within weeks of my arrival in Shanghai, I was informed that there would be a half marathon occurring in early December and it would be nice if I attended. Feeling that I could totally run 13.2 miles to complete a half marathon, I began training. I managed to run two to three times a week averaging about two to three miles for each run. 

About two months into training, I went out for my usual nightly run. When I‚Äôm running, I do so rather absentmindedly, making each turn without thought. As I rounded corner after corner, I noticed that a man on a bike seemed to be keeping pace with me. To double check, I sped up and so did he, I slowed down and he again followed suit. A plan formed in my head to beat him. Obviously this was not an achievable goal but I decided to push myself to the limit anyway. I finished a mile run in the six to seven minute range which I‚Äôd never been close to achieving before. 

The next day I decided to time myself to see just exactly what my limit was. Off I went on my run. It was just a typical night with a little weaving between people and cars due to my increased speed. I kept watch on the time and was very pleased with my rate. As I came up to the last corner I pushed it into overdrive, determined to impress myself. I reached the corner, hit a rough patch of dirt, twisted my ankle, and fell into a pile on the ground. I got back up, limped home, and proceeded to be overly dramatic about my injury and ran once in the next four months. 

With the lack of exercise looming over my head, the registration date for the half marathon decided it was a good time to make itself known. With still a month and a half left for me to train, I decided to register. And so I ran a few times and then got on a plane for a three week vacation to America. Take a guess what I didn‚Äôt do a whole lot of in America. 

While at home one night my sister decided a run was in order for her half marathon in a few months. Against my lazier judgment, I decided to join her. What started as an easy two mile run turned into me pushing my limit again and running seven and a half miles. My longest run at that point in time was about three and a half miles. This made me confident that maybe I could in fact complete a half marathon. 

In a matter of moments I was on the plane again to China. I sent a text to my friend announcing my return and he inquired back if I was ready for the marathon this Sunday. This Sunday‚Ä¶ ha ha ha. I‚Äôd managed to run about four times in the last three months and the marathon was this Sunday. I mustered up the willpower to run two more times to ‚Äúprepare‚Äù for the half marathon. 

At first I decided to exclude this next portion but of course, there‚Äôs never a dull moment in China and this is without exception. Friday night was check-in and gear pickup. The rest of the people I came with had registered in person so it was off by myself to find online registration. I got my number and went to pick up my stuff. As I walked and looked at the numbers I came to the realization that I was registered for a full marathon. I clearly remember scoffing at the idea of me running a full marathon when registering so clearly this was a mistake, an easily fixable mistake. Wrong. With the general flexibility of China, I assumed a quick switch was in order. That day, for whatever reason, insurance said ‚Äúno, this is not possible‚Äù and therefore no switch is allowed. After ten minutes of tense discussion in Chinese and walking from booth to booth, it was decided, not officially of course, that I would run as the guy in our group who had paid his fee but could not run. No complaining if I fall and break my leg or something along those lines. Whelp. 

If it wasn‚Äôt already shameful enough that I‚Äôd probably get about half way through and fall over from exhaustion, it was requested that I wear a costume. I mulled the idea over in my head, not quite excited at the prospect of looking like a complete and utter mess. Against my better judgment, and since my friend was going as Spiderman, I ventured out Saturday afternoon to a costume shop and found myself presented with a pretty limited selection. In the end I decided with Superman, cape and all. As a note, bargain always. I didn‚Äôt realize until later on like a stupid laowai(foreigner), that I got suckered into paying about $30 for something that a Chinese person would pay $5 for. 

Saturday night consisted of a rather uneventful pasta dinner along with booking my ticket to Cambodia for vacation (maybe I lied). Thanks to jetlag still hanging around, I was asleep by 9:30. This also made getting up at 5:30 that much easier. I got dressed, walked out into the living room and laughed that I was the first one awake. Then I checked the time, smacked my head, and went back to bed for another hour. 

After an hour nap, I returned to the living room to find the others getting ready. Spiderman would be concealing his identity until the start of the race, then donning a mask and staying anonymous for the duration of the race. This was somewhat frustrating as Superman just has a stupid hair curl that somehow hides his identity. I possessed no such curl and therefore was going to be known no matter what. Deciding that a good confidence boost was in order, I wore the costume with false pride from the apartment door to the end of the race. 

Typically as a foreign white person in China, I tend to stick out and get a few inquisitive stares on the regular. I‚Äôve gotten comfortable with this and tend not to notice unless I‚Äôm actively trying to catch people staring, which I sometimes do when I‚Äôm bored. Today though, I felt the eyes of everyone on the subway. Upon arrival at our subway stop, we remained at the exit as this was easier to locate our friends instead of trying to walk through the massive crowd of runners. This involved watching group after group pass by as they were released from the train. It was almost like a safari where groups would pass by, stare at the wild creature, take a picture, and continue on. 

Maybe you think of my example as an exaggeration. You‚Äôre wrong. People did in fact take pictures. Some were secretive and I would catch them out of the corner of my eye. Others would try and catch me without looking and then run away once eye contact was made. This bothered me somewhat but I tried to be a good sport about it since it‚Äôs not everyday Superman stops to run a half marathon. 

We remained stationary for about fifteen or so minutes. During this time I started counting the amount of pictures being taken of me. At this point, the count was already up to ten. About this time, the first person asked to take a picture with me. This picture brought a genuine smile to my face and managed to destroy a large chunk of insecurity present within my head. Finally, our group had assembled and we emerged from the subway. 

I was greeted by 25,000 runners, their fans, security, event organizers, and anyone else who ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time. One cannot quite comprehend what such a large number of people looks like until you see it. With this large number came an equally large number of cameras and I gave up attempting to count the pictures being taken of me. 

Finally, Peter Parker decided to transform and Spiderman and Superman got to hang out together. We walked along to drop our bags off, stopping about every minute to pose for a photograph. As we made our way through the crowd, I realized I‚Äôd been tricked, or maybe I just didn‚Äôt know marathons very well. Nobody else was wearing any resemblance of a costume. However, contained within one opening of the crowd stood two Johnny Depp Characters, one from Pirates of the Caribbean and the other from Alice in Wonderland. Of course a picture was in order. 


As we stood counting down the minutes to the start of the race, it dawned on me just how stupid running a half marathon was with no training. However, I had invested about $60 in this race and I was already here, might as well suck it up and go for as long as I can. The race got underway with a walk for the first several minutes followed by a light jog as each runner got a chance to stretch out. I must say that I‚Äôm disappointed that I didn‚Äôt bring my camera, but that was probably for the better in the end. The first turn of the race saw the road corkscrew up one level and then straightening out into a massive bridge. The corkscrew itself was rather wide and you could see almost all the way around it and the entirety of it was covered in people. What an awesome sight to see. 

The next seven miles was filled with packets of people dressed in decorative outfits, shouting ‚Äújia you,‚Äù words of encouragement to keep running. Every so often I would hear a shout of ‚ÄúSuperman!‚Äù and I‚Äôd throw up the peace sign, as is typical of China, at least I think that‚Äôs the proper response anyway. Some runners would run ahead of me, stop and take a picture, shout a quick thank you and continue on. Others would inquire as to why I was running to the finish line and not simply flying. This kept my spirits up and I chugged along.

ME(30M) HER(21F)

Ok I'll start from lastnight.

I've been doing Standup comedy for a while now(about 10months) and have been seeing this girl (21) around one particular spot that I perform at.

Well we talk for a bit as I know one of her mates as he compares a night there, I gave  her my number over Facebook and  told to give me a call or TxT sometime .
So a day and half after that she sends me a txt,end up txting each other about 3 or 4 times a day for about 2 weeks and had 2 two hour phonecalls that felt like they by in minutes ,til last night .

We met up for a coffee and talked for about an hour then headed to the spot where I perform ( we both know people there). Anyway I get talking to her and honestly I think she is amazing, she works at a expensive pub in central London,she goes to Uni (and is in the top 5 students in her subjects) and also she interns at a prestigious law firm.
she's extremely well read and funny and clever. Her family are liberal caring and funny (she is also very pretty ,I think most of her guy friends have a crush on her) ,so her upbringing is pretty different from mine.
Well as you can see now I'm totally smitten with her but she really busy only gets one night to herself, I asked her when I would get to see her again and she said probably in two weeks. Now let me tell you about my self

 When I was 5 I witnessed my father kicking the shit out of my mum ,it's pretty much affected my attude to violence, my father was a scary drink an could turn at the drop of a hat (not on his kids but adults)(also taught me how to handle drunk people). 

When my parents got divorced I would stay with my dad and his gf(who also happened to be my mums sister).between the ages of 6-10 I was sexually abuse by my dad(him touching me when he was drunk) and by an older cousin ( who I had to share a bed with,he would touch me too). I've never had a girlfriend and never had sex ( the closest I've come to sex was making out).I have suffered from depression for most of my life but most people never get to see that,they  me see laughing and cracking jokes all the time.

I think that we are different people who could compliment each other but I'm worried that with all my shit I would fuck everything up.
I'm not sure she even likes me like that, could be just be being nice.
Also could I ever be normal ? 
I mean have a caring loving relationship with someone who I can tell everything too,someone who would love me?
I want to believe that the answer is yes I can be loved and normal but when I get depressed I know that I will never be normal and never find someone who loves.
I often think about suicide but won't do it till my mum dies, and I'm smart enough to make it look like an accident.

So reddit this is the question,
Does this girl like me?
Can I find love and happiness?
How do you get over witnessing domestic abuse and child abuse?
Is life worth living?


Here's a little story
When I was 5 I started school,after the first week I was moved to a different class,I was given a letter to give to my parents explaining why I had to move class (I had trouble with my abc).
So now I'm constantly told by my dad ( who could be very intimidating),that I'm dumb and need to learn my abcs.
So at the weekend my mum drops my dad to work,as he's getting out he tells her ""make sure jestersidiot learns his abc"".

Now in the car my brother and I convince my mum to take us to the park,end up playing football then go home and watch some tv.
My dad gets in after work VIA the pub and see me in the living room watching tv and calls me over to the kitchen.dad is sitting at the kitchen table with my abc book while my mother is doing the washing up. 
Dad starts by making  me read it but due to me being intimidate by him and him being a pretty terrible teacher I start guessing what I'm supposed to be reading rather then actual reading.

So now he gets in to an argument with my mum about her taking me to the park instead of making sure I studying ,mum says to him that jestersidiot is a kid should have some fun.well the argument escalates to yelling and then he gets up out of his chair and starts beating her .
punches to the face ,grabbing her by the throat and throwing her to the ground ,still punching and kicking her.then he gets down on her and starts punching her in the face like she's a man.while standing there my older brother(7 at the time) walks over to see whats happening with my baby sister(who was 3 at the time)
stand at the door of the kitchen watching all this shit happen. While he's hitting her ,my mother is screaming for her mother till the day I die I'll never forgot that sound.he stops hitting her and moves me and my siblings to the living room where we watch tv,I make an excuses to go to the kitchen(to check on my mum) but she's not there ,instead I find her in the garden staring at the canal that runs past our house,that image still haunts me .


ABOUT ME
I am the darkest one in my family,so growing up I got all the dark/black jokes about my skin tone.I was constantly bullied by people(some times white or black but mainly southeast asians).

It didn't stop when I got home because that's when my brother would bully me.I pretty much wished I was dead everyday when I was a kid.funny thing is if people were to describe me back then they would probably say I was a class clown.
I recently told my mum,brother and sister about the abuse (just about my dad not my cousin). 

I've had to be there for a friend who has been diagnosed with liver damage so I've had to be there for him,telling him to be positive and what he can do(keep getting doctors opinions till he is satisfied,speaking to liver disease groups and ARM himself info about what going on with his liver). Also arranged for a party for him so people could see him.
I'm still fighting depression and so times its hard to get out of bed.
I drink too much and smoke ,eat the wrong shit.
I've been unemployed for a longtime and my CV looks like shit.
But sometimes I have hope.
The thing with this girl I spent so much time alone that, i cant believe that someone could even like me that.
 
Well I guess it doesn't matter now,I txted her but she never got back to me.
I think I came on too strong Nevermind plenty more fish that don't want my bait. Or maybe she's busy ,or more likely she saw right through me.

Here's the thing It's not even about the girl It's about the fact in the firsttime in years someone like me and got to know me ,and now wants nothing too do with me because I'm a loser. I lose at life. Death would be better then knowing you on your own till your last breath never knowing love from a women."

I'm a young semi-self supporting adult who is looking to financially support themselves while simulataneously being enrolled at a tough university as a full time student. I get federal student loans/grants, there's always a bit of a refund but it only goes so far. I've been staying with my parents because they live within range of my college and I do not get enough in loans to cover on campus housing. I do work during the summer and work for family on occassion. I do not feel as though I can balance full time college work and a full time job. What's worse is the type of jobs I can get only pay a little above minimum wage. At least until I get into the upper level courses and get a paid internship that hopefuly has a desirable wage. I've tried living on minimum wage before and I just felt everyday I went into work I was slapped in the face, raped in the asshole and shat in my mouth and that was on good days. I can't imagine what it would be like to work near minimum wage and have full time college work at the same time but I know it wouldn't go well. 

So I come to you reddit. How do you manage? Are you a trustfund kid? Do you stay with your parents? Do you have thousands of dollars in student loans because your mommy cosigned a private loan for you? (mine can't, credit issues) Or maybe you're a full time hard working student and employee? maybe you strip or suck dick on the side or like taking it up the ass from your boss?

It hasn't been a great day.

I'm a grad student, newlywed, and recent defector from Mormonism. My wife is also a student, and luckily sees eye-to-eye with me on the whole religious front. However, we're at a time in our lives when we're barely making ends meet (the house is always cold, we barely have enough food, we hardly know anyone in the area, our families are far away, we have to go to the free clinic for medicine, etc.). I'm delivering pizzas almost full-time, but I had to take the car into the shop for what I thought was a minor problem but has wound up costing more than I make in a month. Aside from costing me by missing work, it's incredibly disheartening to get beat back down whenever we start to reach a four-digit bank balance. Add to the fact that I'm a good student, fast learner, and analytical thinker but can't even seem to land an UNPAID internship in my field at this point, and I'm starting to feel like a failure.

I try to talk myself out of it, but my automatic mental reaction is that god is punishing me for my unfaithfulness/sins (just the kind of dick move he would make, eh?). It doesn't even make sense anymore, since I don't believe it, but it's so deeply ingrained that I'm not sure how to get rid of it. Our (uber-religious) families would likely think/say the same thing, so I can't appeal to them for any sympathy. Any tips or advice for undoing my conditioning?

**tl;dr: I feel like the god I no longer believe in is punishing me. How can I stop this? And/or, say nice things to me so I feel better.**

I'm a girl still enrolled university, currently in my senior year, working towards a Bachelor's of Fine Arts (don't ask, it's my passion lol).  I have wanted to pursue an MBA after my undergraduate degree, but with my low GPA, I have my doubts.


Few things to know:

- Already staying next fall for my (supposed) last semester.

- I currently have a 2.7.

- I have some internships; Also, for the last two years, I have had part-time jobs during school and during the summer/winter away from school.



Also, should I stay an extra semester to raise it?


Any thoughts or advice? Thank you &lt;3

The scene opens at a Pentax board meeting a few months ago -


CEO - After our last debacle with the Q system we need to come back strong with a killer product. 

*pin drop silence*

CEO - Did we fire the idiot who thought it would be a good idea to call our optics 'toy lenses'?

*silence continues*

CEO - Well, I've just about had it with you suits. You are all out of touch with what the market needs. We need some fresh inspired thinking! Someone who can think digital. Where's that intern we hired from that Hippie School of Design?

*intern is led into the board room bewildered and weary*

CEO - Turn around and show me the label on your jeans. 

*examines label*

CEO - ""Seven for all mankind"", never heard of it. You'll do. What do you think you designer jeans wearing types would want in a camera?

Intern - Ummmm... uh... dunno. 

CEO - For god's sake man, think! Apply yourself!

Intern - Well... it'd be cool if Lady Gaga designed it. I'd buy it. No wait! Marc Newson. He's a cool chap, you should totally get him to design a camera. 

CEO - Who's Marc Newson? 

Intern (gushing) - He's like the most awesome designer ever, man! He like, makes these cool furniture and bicycles and shit. 

CEO - Has he ever designed a camera before?

Intern - Man, he can design anything! He's done aircrafts and shit man. He even has his stuff in MOMA dude. 

CEO - What's a moma?

Intern - Museum of Moh-dun art dude! Like totally rad. 

CEO (suitably impressed) - Go call Marc Newson... and stop calling me dude. 

Intern (perking up) - Awesome dude... I mean, man, sir.. right away. 



*Three months later at Marc's first presentation, the suits are not happy. The camera looks like a colourful bar of soap with buttons and strange protrusions.* 


Marc - I have this vision of the world, where everything is 'designified' by adding primary colours to boxes. 

CEO (glancing at intern to make sure the jeans crowd is suitably impressed) - Right, right.

Marc - One button needs to be red, and the other green... hmmm... we need yellow to complete the set and make it look like a traffic signal... Hey, I know what! Let's make the camera body yellow! 

CEO - For God's sake Marc! Don't be ridiculous we can't have a serious photographic tool that looks like a something an African bee will try mating with when shooting outdoors! 

Marc - Ok ok. Maybe you're right, hmm... lets just have ONE variant in yellow then, and all the people who agree with my world view will buy that. Just you wait and see. It'll outsell the other variants.

CEO - Marc, how about adding a viewfinder? 

Marc - Never use it. 

CEO - But ummm... people do you know. 

Marc - Pah! It ruins the fluid lines of ridge. No viewfinder. 

CEO - It's also kind of umm... big. 

Marc - This is precisely why we need to develop the right shade of yellow for the camera body! Distract the users from figuring out that its the same size as the K5. 

CEO (still stealing sideways glances at the ecstatic intern standing at the back of the room) - You might be right. We'll highlight the yellow camera in all our press shots. 


*Meeting ends with congratulations all around. Everyone leaves the board room but for the CEO and his Chief Engineer Yamamoto.*


Eng. Yamamoto (coughs discreetly) - CEO-san, I have humble idea as backup plan. 

CEO - What is it?

Eng. Yamamoto - CEO-san We should make sure this new camera can house all our Pentax K series lenses without an adapter. Just in case the yellow is not as big a distraction as we think it'll be. 

CEO - Hmmm... 


*camera launches*


In the meanwhile, the intern has already quit Pentax in anticipation of his next job as a core team member at Apple's ideation team, now that he has a beefed up resume and has proved his chops by recommending Marc to Pentax he's sure he's snagged it. 


Unfortunately for him, Apple has seen what the camera looks like."

Anyway I wanted to walk through a tutorial on microsoft's ASP.NET site so I downloaded Visual Studio 2010 Express and all the shit that comes with it. Installed and set to work. I went to build the template program in the MVC as the tut instructed but it didn't build at all. It gave a page not found error in the browser after directing to a really high port on localhost. 

I messed with it for awhile but couldn't figure anything out. I uninstalled all the stuff installed by MS when I installed Visual Studio. Personally I wouldn't even use Visual Studio if it were up to me, give me some NP++ and a browser, ill figure out the rest. As it is the company said i needed to learn how to develop with VS, so i am going to.

LONG AND RAMBLING POST
ME(30M) HER(21F)
Ok I'll start from lastnight.
I've been doing Standup comedy for a while now(about 10months) and have been seeing this girl (21) around one particular spot that I perform at.
Well we talk for a bit as I know one of her mates as he compares a night there, I gave  her my number over Facebook and  told to give me a call or TxT sometime .
So a day and half after that she sends me a txt,end up txting each other about 3 or 4 times a day for about 2 weeks and had 2 two hour phonecalls that felt like they by in minutes ,til last night .

We met up for a coffee and talked for about an hour then headed to the spot where I perform ( we both know people there). Anyway I get talking to her and honestly I think she is amazing, she works at a expensive pub in central London,she goes to Uni (and is in the top 5 students in her subjects) and also she interns at a prestigious law firm.

she's extremely well read and funny and clever. Her family are liberal caring and funny (she is also very pretty ,I think most of her guy friends have a crush on her) ,so her upbringing is pretty different from mine.

Well as you can see now I'm totally smitten with her but she really busy only gets one night to herself, I asked her when I would get to see her again and she said probably in two weeks. 

Now let me tell you about my self
When I was 5 I witnessed my father kicking the shit out of my mum ,it's pretty much affected my attude to violence, my father was a scary drink an could turn at the drop of a hat (not on his kids but adults)(also taught me how to handle drunk people). 
When my parents got divorced I would stay with my dad and his gf(who also happened to be my mums sister).between the ages of 6-10 I was sexually abuse by my dad(him touching me when he was drunk) and by an older cousin ( who I had to share a bed with,he would touch me too). I've never had a girlfriend and never had sex ( the closest I've come to sex was making out).I have suffered from depression for most of my life but most people never get to see that,they  me see laughing and cracking jokes all the time.


I think that we are different people who could compliment each other but I'm worried that with all my shit I would fuck everything up.
I'm not sure she even likes me like that, could be just be being nice.

Also could I ever be normal ? 

I mean have a caring loving relationship with someone who I can tell everything too,someone who would love me?

I want to believe that the answer is yes I can be loved and normal but when I get depressed I know that I will never be normal and never find someone who loves.
I often think about suicide but won't do it till my mum dies, and I'm smart 
enough to make it look like an accident.


So reddit this is the question,
Does this girl like me?
Can I find love and happiness?
How do you get over witnessing domestic abuse and child abuse?
Is life worth living?
Here's a little story

When I was 5 I started school,after the first week I was moved to a different class,I was given a letter to give to my parents explaining why I had to move class (I had trouble with my abc).
So now I'm constantly told by my dad ( who could be very intimidating),that I'm dumb and need to learn my abcs.
So at the weekend my mum drops my dad to work,as he's getting out he tells her ""make sure jestersidiot learns his abc"".
Now in the car my brother and I convince my mum to take us to the park,end up playing football then go home and watch some tv.

My dad gets in after work VIA the pub and see me in the living room watching tv and calls me over to the kitchen.dad is sitting at the kitchen table with my abc book while my mother is doing the washing up. 
Dad starts by making  me read it but due to me being intimidate by him and him being a pretty terrible teacher I start guessing what I'm supposed to be reading rather then actual reading.

So now he gets in to an argument with my mum about her taking me to the park instead of making sure I studying ,mum says to him that jestersidiot is a kid should have some fun.well the argument escalates to yelling and then he gets up out of his chair and starts beating her .
punches to the face ,grabbing her by the throat and throwing her to the ground ,still punching and kicking her.then he gets down on her and starts punching her in the face like she's a man.while standing there my older brother(7 at the time) walks over to see whats happening with my baby sister(who was 3 at the time)
stand at the door of the kitchen watching all this shit happen. While he's hitting her ,my mother is screaming for her mother till the day I die I'll never forgot that sound.
he stops hitting her and moves me and my siblings to the living room where we watch tv,I make an excuses to go to the kitchen(to check on my mum) but she's not there ,instead I find her in the garden staring at the canal that runs past our house,that image still haunts me .

ABOUT ME
I am the darkest one in my family,so growing up I got all the dark/black jokes about my skin tone.
I was constantly bullied by people(some times white or black but mainly southeast asians).

It didn't stop when I got home because that's when my brother would bully me.I pretty much wished I was dead everyday when I was a kid.funny thing is if people were to describe me back then they would probably say I was a class clown.
I recently told my mum,brother and sister about the abuse (just about my dad not my cousin). 

I've had to be there for a friend who has been diagnosed with liver damage so I've had to be there for him,telling him to be positive and what he can do(keep getting doctors opinions till he is satisfied,speaking to liver disease groups and ARM himself info about what going on with his liver). Also arranged for a party for him so people could see him.

I'm still fighting depression and so times its hard to get out of bed.
I drink too much and smoke ,eat the wrong shit.
I've been unemployed for a longtime and my CV looks like shit.
But sometimes I have hope.

The thing with this girl I spent so much time alone that, i cant believe that someone could even like me that.
Well I guess it doesn't matter now,I txted her but she never got back to me.
I think I came on too strong Nevermind plenty more fish that don't want my bait. Or maybe she's busy ,or more likely she saw right through me.
Here's the thing It's not even about the girl It's about the fact in the firsttime in years someone like me and got to know me ,and now wants nothing too do with me because I'm a loser. I lose at life. Death would be better then knowing you on your own till your last breath never knowing love from a woman.

*As you can see I was feeling pretty shitty but I sent this to my closest friend and he convinced me to get help*"

Like the title says, I'm interested in advice about how to become a grant writer. I will soon be graduating with a double major from a major university. My minor related to non-profit studies. I consider myself a good writer. 

I  have been involved during my college career in a lot of non-profit work, including being on the inside of a project that involved securing a large grant (I did not write the proposal, but was involved in proofreading/making suggestions, as well as implementing the project once we received funding). 

Other than that, I have zero experience in grant writing. 

I realize that most likely, the first thing to do is to secure a volunteer internship in grant writing. However, I'm wondering, how can I know that a particular ""grant writing internship"" is going to give me the skills I'll need to eventually secure a paid job doing it?

Also, can you recommend any books, online resources, or classes to take?

Thanks in advance for your help."

I messed up early in my college career and ended up with a 0.9 GPA, which fortunately over the last 4 semesters I've brought up to 2.9, with a 3.2 in major GPA. Maybe this is a good thing, showing I've improved it quickly? I don't know but I hope so. 

I've hardly got any projects under my belt either. I've done the ACM Programming Competition for the mid Atlantic region, only got an honorable mention, though. My team placed in around the top 40-60. I've got some undergrad research in mathematics, specifically in cryptography, which I'm hoping to publish along with my professor. We're writing up the paper right now, so I don't know if I can even mention this. I did both programming and some math in this research so that's something I guess. Other than this I have a few really simple game clone projects I've done in my spare time.

Basically I just feel like I've got not a lot going for me while I'm searching for internships. The city I live in has absolutely no tech industry what so ever, so I've pretty much been forced to cast a wider net, and I'm struggling to even find placing that are hiring interns, and even if they are, I just don't feel adequate. I've not been doing poorly in classes but sometimes I feel like I'm missing things that other people that I'm competing with for internships must have.

Any tips for getting over this?"

p7bt8,8,2012-02-02,Common 0L Questions,orangejulius,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/p7bt8/common_0l_questions/,"**COMMON 0L QUESTIONS**

**1) Should I go to law school?**

 No, but that's not going to stop you is it? Didn't think so. Nobody ever listens to the warnings about a Yeti until it's ripping their arms off, either.

2) What are job prospects like after graduation?

**3) I'm an undergrad, what should I study if I want to go to law school?**

Anything. You're going to find everyone from any background can and will go to law school. Here's my tip...study something you enjoy and can make a living doing, just in case you don't end up going to law school.

**4) What do the law school tiers mean?**


The tiers refer to the law school rankings that USNWR publishes yearly. The ranking system is a composite of many factors, including peer and professional ratings, student/teacher ratio, etc. Each year, schools report their data and the rankings come from that data. Thus, schools move around in the rankings year to year. Generally, however, schools don't rise or fall more than a few spots every year (especially in the Top-14). 

There are 4 tiers:

* Tier 1 (1-50)

* Tier 2 (51-100)

* Tier 3 (101 - ~150)

* Tier 4 (~151 on down)

Schools are always ranked in the top 2 Tiers. USNWR generally also ranks Tier 3, but the rankings matter less and less as you get into Tier 3 and 4 territory. The general *trend* is that the further down you go in the rankings, the lower the admission standards are, and the lower your employment prospects are. 

While rankings shouldn't be your only determining factor when choosing a law school, the ranking of a school should play a role. Employers (and to some extent the general public) pay attention to these rankings. 

**[5) What does it mean if I choose a lower tiered school?](http://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/p8r4v/what_does_it_mean_if_i_choose_a_lower_tiered/)**



**6) What is the LSAT and how do I study for it?**

**The Test**

The LSAT is the law school admissions test. It is administered 4 times a year under conditions very similar to the SAT or the ACT. Along with GPA, it is really the determining factor for law school admission. A low LSAT can destroy your chances even with a high GPA, and a high LSAT can make up for a lackluster academic record. 

There are 4 graded sections as part of the LSAT and 1 ungraded ""experimental"" section. On test day, you will not know which section is experimental. Each section is strictly timed and you are given 35 minutes to complete each section. You will be given between 24 and 28 questions or each sectionThe 4 sections are:

* Logical Reasoning (2 sections) - Somewhat like SAT questions. These questions will often ask you to find weaknesses in arguments, identify valid premises and conclusions, etc.

* Analytical Reasoning - Logic Games. This is by far the hardest section for unprepared test takers. This section tests your analytical skills by having you solve complex ""games"" involving multiple factors and rules for how those factors interact. These kind of games can be learned, and practice and preparation goes a long way here.

* Reading Comprehension - Again, somewhat similar to the SAT. You will be asked to read typically 3-4 passages consisting of between 2-6 paragraphs and answer questions about those passages.

The experimental section will be made up of questions from one of the aforementioned categories. This section is unscored.

Finally, there is an ungraded writing section where you are asked to argue for one of two equally desirable options. Law school administrators don't seem to ever use this section for anything, so don't worry about it. However, it is advisable that you write something and make sure to sound at least mildly intelligent. No admissions officer wants to see that you just doodled for 35 minutes.


**Studying**

There is no substitute for taking practice tests (old LSATs) under test conditions, and as many as possible. These are available relatively cheaply from a variety of sources, including LSAC.

If you find yourself struggling in one particular area, the PowerScore bibles are an invaluable resource. There are individual bibles for each section of the test, and they contain detailed walk-throughs and guides on how to approach each type of question, along with ample practice problems. 

Finally, there are intense courses (e.g., Kaplan, Princeton Review), but they are not cheap and their effectiveness when compared to self-study has not been shown to make them worth the huge cost.



**7) How important is undergraduate GPA compared to my LSAT score?**

Law School admission staff almost entirely base their decision on your LSAT and GPA (URM status being the big exception). The question here is how important your GPA really is, my quick reply is that your GPA is less important than your LSAT score but still hugely important.

[Lawschoolnumbers.com](http://lawschoolnumbers.com/) (LSN) is a self-reporting admissions site. Basically you create a profile, put your GPA/LSAT in and any other details you find important (while be relatively anonymous).

[Lawschoolpredictor.com](http://www.lawschoolpredictor.com/wp-content/uploads/Law-School-Predictor-Full-Time-Programs.htm) (LSP) is a site with a calculator that determines your chances at any school based on calculations of prior classes. Most of their information comes from lawschoolnumbers.com

Looking at schools bottom 25%, median, and top 75% GPA/LSAT and then comparing it to students who were admitted and denied, it is revealed that your LSAT is more important. Schools have more of a hard cutoff for lower LSAT scores than GPA. A low LSAT causes more denials than a low GPA, and a high LSAT with a low GPA puts you back in the running while not the other way around. LSP calculates GPA being about 20% to 30% of what the LSAT is worth (They do it school by school); this percentage range is consistent with [allegedly leaked school formulas.](http://www.uiowa.edu/~030116/prelaw/lawschools09.htm)

Keep in mind, while the LSAT is more important, your GPA is second- by a lot. Despite what admissions staff may tell you, your LSAT and GPA almost entirely will decide whether you get admitted or not. This is allegedly because of rankings like USNews weighing LSAT and GPA so much.

I would also like to take this moment to point out that your GPA and your LSDAS GPA (the one law schools see) may be very different. If you ever failed a class but then retook it to replace the grade, I‚Äôm sorry to say that both grades will count. [Here is a calculator for LSDAS GPA.](http://www.lawschoolpredictor.com/wp-content/uploads/Law-School-Predictor-LSDAS-GPA-Calculator.htm)



**8) What Does It Mean If I Pick A Top 14 School?**

I'm at a Northwestern, so my answer will be tainted with the understanding that 95% of my classmates have pre-law school full-time work experience, so pretty much everyone has the work experience employment ""bump.""

For the top 10%, almost everyone gets jobs at prestigious Vault 10 law firms. Some people will say that Northwestern cannot place into certain firms, but I will tell you that at least one person in my class got an offer at each of Vault 10, including Wachtell and Debevoise. (To clarify, I don't mean one person swept; some combination of people covered all of them though). Almost all the big, prestigious firms come to campus during the summer before 2L to interview people. However, it is true that they would rather take only top students. For people who are below the median (read: that's half of everyone), you will be looking outside of OCI, almost certainly, but for people in the top 1/3, not getting a big firm job is almost difficult.

What happens to people at the bottom of the class? Many people still get jobs. This depends on your ability to pitch yourself to large law firms with less prestige (for example, firms that pay $120k instead of $160) and firms in non-major cities (like Milwaukee, San Diego, New Jersey, Texas, etc). This is a lot easier for, say, Texans, than for a native Chicagoan. Still, T14s have national reach. Despite having bottom 1/3 grades, I will be summering at a firm that pays close to $160k in a non-major city. Some firms would rather have anyone from a T14 than someone at the top of their class from a worse school, as I learned through my recruiting process.

Still, for one reason or another, some people don't get firm jobs. I know two people in my circle of friends who tried and came up empty-handed, both below median. So it's true that it doesn't ""guarantee"" anything, though the odds are definitely in your favor if you're flexible, open-minded and ready to hustle, because at the end of the day, many firms want to hire you on the strength of your school name alone.

There are also lots of other opportunities: the doors fly open for judicial externships, internships with Federal agencies, etc. I get tons of access to attorneys: they want to recruit at school, so all year there are firm-sponsored events where you can go pick an attorney's brain. Just today I called someone I met at an event like that and chatted with them for an hour about what term-time externship made the most sense for my long-term career goals. I only knew this person because their big prestigious firm thought it was worthwhile to have them spend several hours a year meeting with students and talking with them throughout 1L.

**Transferring**

Do not pick a school with the intention of transferring. There is a 90-95% chance you will never get the opportunity to transfer, and even if you do get the opportunity, there is a small chance that transferring is actually worth it (T2-&gt;T14 is generally considered worth it, but if it's just 10-20 spots, it probably is not). I highly recommend checking out TLS for transfer advice."

I got an internship.  And then I got another one. One internship I got is with a music website in which I'll be writing news and reviews for them. I even have a chance at interviews if the occasion calls for it. 

My second internship I will be writing and updating the information about the various groups within my church. I'll be interviewing what each group is there for, and what they've been doing in recent years.  From there I will be updating the information on the website, which is very out of date.

1. while many offices respond to all mail and calls, some offices throw out all non-constituent mail and don't log the information from non-constituent phone calls. your best bet is to send the letters and calls to your representatives and senators.
2. letters are generally scanned into a computer program where some data is picked up and some data has to be manually entered. in the letters i've seen come in, the easiest and quickest to sort are the ones with your name and contact information at the top of the letter, and your support/opposition of the bill and its number in the first line of the letter. the program picks up more of the data on its own, so it takes less time to get through more letters.
3. lastly, but perhaps most importantly, realize the people answering the phones and sorting your letters are often interns. yelling at them will do nothing. the most effective thing you can do is just say you support or oppose x bill with maybe a 1-2 sentence reason. giving interns a ten-minute rant on your personal life stories will not change what will eventually be passed on to the legislative correspondent to respond to you.

keep writing and calling though! :)"

She‚Äôs lived at home with her parents for her entire life (with about a 4 month internship over in Quebec.)

Additionally, I‚Äôd like to do some long-term travelling before sinking a few thousand grand on a down payment. My girlfriend on the other hand just graduated this past spring and is dedicated to the idea of buying something right away, and finds renting a place kinda stupid. This is where we‚Äôve had some conflict. A few weeks ago we managed to negotiate a middle ground where she would be willing to rent a place with me for a year before buying a place. I mean, who knows? We may leave this city for further education or a job in a better location. Renting a place has more flexibility. 

Last month she met and befriended a local guy while playing a game online. Whatever, she can make friends with whomever she wants. However, despite the fact that we finally came to a conclusion about living together, and the fact that the dude he met knew we were going to live together, the guy told her he was interested in buying a condo and asked her to be his roommate. She‚Äôs now looking for a place with him. 

This is inconsiderate, right? They met once offline and now they‚Äôre potentially buying a place together. By no means does that mean she wants to pursue ‚Äúsomething‚Äù with this almost perfect stranger, according to her. But am I wrong in feeling upset with her choosing to live with this guy over me?

Advice reddit?",[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/p9prh/gf_of_6_years_wants_a_break_advice_reddit/,"Hey guys, I'm looking for some advice on my current situation, and would greatly appreciate anything that the hive-mind here on reddit has to say.

My GF and I (I'm 27 shes 25) have been dating for the last 6 years. Honestly I was planning moving in with her as soon as she graduated and settled into her job and possibly proposing to her soon after. She just got a job as a middle school Spanish teacher.

We both still live at home for different reasons... I am currently working an internship that is part time and doesn't pay too great. 

Anyways...

She called me up out of the blue last week and told me - in so many words - that shes not sure if she wants to be with me forever. Now that shes done with her job search, her personal life is the next thing she needs to focus on, and it scares her to think about settling down (she is a very fickle girl, it takes her forever just to figure out what to eat for dinner).

She is very conflicted about this whole thing, and is going to talk to a therapist as to why she feels like this. But in the meantime, she wants both of us to see other people and figure out if this is what we both really want. I'm not sure how long she means, my interpretation was a few months, but she could mean years for all I know. 

Reddit, I really love this girl and I want to grow old with her. Should I wait around and hold out hope that she will come around? Or should I move on with my life and worry about myself? 

TL;DR - GF wants a break after 6 years because shes unsure if she wants to spend the rest of her life with me.

p9g6k,3,2012-02-03,Early career move....,jamesaccount1213,Career,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/p9g6k/early_career_move/,"Howdy Folks.

I am in oil and gas (Geoscience).  I was a intern for a company last summer, and was hired on full time in September.  I had wrapped my master research up and finished school.

I started working for a large independent company, and work a project not many new graduates would get to work on at other companies.

I have the chance to leave, and go work a less interesting job in the short term. But with a major company. 

It would be like be a Honours physics major at a decent state school, versus a General Science student at MIT.

But more salary, more consistent bonus with the other company. My company now has huge 'golden handcuffs' in stock awards that arent real money for 5 -8 years, and may be worthless. 

So financially- with 401k, salary, bonus possibilities, and other financial benefits... they are almost a toss up.  

I am trying to decide if I want to be a big fish in a little pond, or in the sea of Tuna.  The difference is in the sea of Tuna, I could be working in random global locations in two years which is awesome, and if I stay I would be living in Houston, pretty much being a specialist.

My main concern with leaving is I am in a fairly small community. Everyone knows someone at any other company.  I dont want to burn any bridges. And my current company knew when they hired me the biggest risk/downside was I would be likely to move on to 'bigger' oppurtunities easily...

Anyone have any insight? "
p9fe7,2,2012-02-03,Help! What can I do about fraud from a Chicago based business?,[deleted],chicago,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/p9fe7/help_what_can_i_do_about_fraud_from_a_chicago/,"Chicago Redditors,

Early in January groupon had a deal with FreshGo (http://www.freshgonow.com/). It was 20 dollars for 40 dollars worth of groceries (they are like peapod). I placed an order with freshgo for 55 dollars. They charged me 15 dollars after the groupon was credited. Fastforward 2 weeks, the groupon is cancelled and they refund me 20 dollars for the voucher I can no longer use. I contacted FreshGo who assured me last Friday they are processing the refund that day. I  realize it takes time for a refund to be credited to my account, most places 3-7 days. I checked my online bank account today to see if the refund was processed. It wasn't. But I did see they charged me 98.34 this morning.

Now, I have not placed another order with them, I have not authorized this charge. I immediately called them, all times I was directed to voicemail inspite of the fact they say they are available for live help during their business hours. I left messages, no response. I emailed their customer service with a screenshot of my online bank statement showing the charge of 98.34 and requesting the charge be reversed immediately. Have not received a response. 

I contacted my bank to try to reject the charges but cannot yet file a dispute for fraud or reject the charges since the charges are still pending. I cannot file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau because they aren't in the BBB database and there is no address published for them online (you need an address to file a complaint.) The business doesn't have a yelp page, apparently they have a twitter and a facebook but both are hidden or deactivated at the present moment (I tried to register the business name on twitter).

This is a big deal for me because I'm a full time college student and work part time at an internship. I get paid 300 dollars or so every 2 weeks, I'm on a tight budget and I need the money to cover utilities and groceries. This 98.34$ charge leaves me with 50 dollars in my account and yesterday I authorized an online payment to people's gas in the amount of 57.30. It takes 24 hours for them to process the payment and when it hits my account, I'll be overdrafted by 7 dollars. Additionally, fifth third has absurd overdraft fees. They charge you up to 37 dollars per overdraft and 8 dollars a day everyday you're overdrafted.  Fifth third assured me that if I overdraft, I can dispute the 98 dollar charge and have the charges reversed but it concerns me because how long will it take me to recover the money from the overdraft and the 98$?

Does anyone have any ideas on what I can do to correct this situation? All ideas and input are helpful! Thank you and possibly a word to the wise: avoid this business."

I am a third year student studying Computer Engineering.  I am currently doing a software co-op (paid internship) at a manufacturing company.  Since they are a manufacturing company and don't know much about software, they pretty much came up with some projects for me pretty much based on the fact that they have to do with computers.

Cutting to the chase, they want me to write a mobile version of their website (which was created by an outside web developer company).  What we're looking to create is something simple and tabular based.  For example, we like the layout of sites like [The Owl House](http://www.owlhouserochester.com) and [Rock Ventures](http://rockventures.net) (obviously you'll need to be on a mobile device to see the website layouts I am talking about).  

What I'm basically looking for is how to get started.  I have no problem teaching myself by Googling everything, but I've been trying to do that for a while with not much luck, and I feel that it might be because I'm not searching for the right terms.  Anyways, can you guys help me out with a couple quick questions?

* What search terms can I look up to learn how to write a tab-based mobile site like the ones above?
* What languages should I be looking to write this code in?
* When finished, how do I make it so that the mobile site is viewed when accessed from a mobile device (not the regular website)?

Brief intro: I am fluent in Java and C++ and have been teaching myself HTML and CSS lately in hopes that it would help with this project.  Any help is appreciated, and again, if this is the wrong spot for this post kindly redirect me to where I may get some help.  Thanks a lot!"

The other day I was offered an internship at my first choice company, which is an international studio (Im in the US), and is unpaid.  They give you a free meal a day and pay for bus/rail etc costs, but no day rate/stipend etc, even after I asked if it was possible to negotiate.

It would be very expensive to travel there to live for a month or two, but I'm considering it because of how much I love the company.

My question is not whether or not I should accept, but I'd just like general advice.

First off, Any advice to students seeking internships, esp. unpaid?

Second, if I do accept this internship, how do I approach an unpaid job?  I imagine they will want me to show the type of work/work ethic I'd have with a paid job, but it would be difficult to justify extra long days with no pay.  I don't want to become jaded by feeling I'm being used.  I've never had an unpaid internship before so I don't know what to expect.

Any advice would be much appreciated."

I personally hate these people. I work hard too and I do not cheat! I am a full time student who works, is an active  leader in our school's dance company, participate in internships and shadows professionals  all in the hopes of being successful. What gives one individual person the right to cheat? Might I note that he has no mental or physical ailments and has blatantly broken school code on numerous occasions.

Patrick is rocking solo in the studio today, taking your calls and taking care of business. He talks about his current situation, shirt orders, Overdose, interns, donations and more. But don‚Äôt think that means there isn‚Äôt any funny. Patrick talks about getting a case of juice sent to him by a listener, and he single-handedly redesigns the NFL and professional football as we know it, including new team names and random team assignment. It‚Äôs going to be amazing. There‚Äôs also a rant on women and a story about a weirdo teacher in Los Angeles. The last part of the show is pretty much Patrick calling out delusional people, like the guys who does that Independent Podcast Awards shit.

In the beginning of my senior year I had some emotional health ""difficulties"" that I coped with very poorly. I stopped going to classes altogether by mid semester and ended up failing all my classes. I was put on academic suspension by my university. Two years later I am now getting ready to return and finish my last semester(s). This has got me thinking again about how I procede towards grad school with such a big mark against me so close to the end of my academic career. I was always a B+ish student (my GPA is now 3.169). I've done two summers in the NIH summer internship program and done some research at my school. I'm set on schools in the same tier as UCSF, UCSD, UCLA, and U of Michigan so I won't settle for some podunk little program with a half dozen PI's like the University of Idaho. I have some ideas already and would like your opinions or ideas.
What do you think about these plans?
* Go for a postbac at the NIH (or if I can't get one of those just any job to keep me fed and sheltered) and take some of the graduate courses offered at the FAES (NIH education program).
* Try to find a lab at a university I'd like to go to and get a lab tech position there (or volunteering if I go for a Bay Area school where I can move back into my folks place to survive on very little)
* or is there something else I could do like go for a MSc?"

I am taking 22 credits this semester and will be taking another 12 during our summer semester. I have been told I am ineligible to take any more loans to pay for tuition. I work part time and have an internship for academic credit. I applied for a student loan through Sallie Mae and was denied, added my parents as a cosigner, and they were also denied. Anyone have any idea of what I can do to come up with the money to pay for school?

p8swy,0,2012-02-02,Reddit I have been having various issues with a manager at work that seem to be getting worse and worse. Do I complain? Sit back and take it? HELP PLEASE!!,zomgitsagirl,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/p8swy/reddit_i_have_been_having_various_issues_with_a/,"First off, sorry this is so long, and kind of thrown together. I tend to rage write so it may not be the most organized train of thought.

So I currently work retail at a clothing store, and it's the only income I have. I just got an internship with another company so it's unpaid, but I'm still going to be keeping this job for weekends simply because, well, I need an income. Over the past 5 months, I've been noticing that one of the managers (the hiring/scheduling manager) has been doing a LOT of shady things.

The first instance was when this manager hired about 30 new employees, and then dramatically cut everyone's hours (including mine). This was only slightly irritating, until they started requesting us to stay late, until 12AM, for closing and cleaning the store. I understand closing is a part of every retail store, but we close at 6, and cleaning the walls and floors were most definitely NOT part of the job description. By the way my job title is cashier/sales, and my coworkers are all either the same as me, just sales, or backstock (the job descriptions are what you would expect from these titles.)
So to make matters worse, the manager went ahead and had a few of my coworkers repaint the entire store, which first of all seems fairly illegal, as I'm pretty sure there's a law about big businesses hiring from the painters Union and not exploiting your employees. The manager had them working from 12PM (a normal in-store shift) to 12AM, and did not pay them overtime or any extra for their work. Shitty, right?

Since this didn't directly involve me it was only upsetting in passing, but then the manager decided to paint in the morning, during store hours, and not have any fans running. They had the front door open (it is a LARGE open store with lots of little alcoves and corner rooms), but that hardly did anything. Co-workers and customers were all complaining about the smell, and for those of us who worked the whole day there, we began to get headaches and feel light headed. One of my co-workers has asthma, and had to excuse herself to go outside and breathe fresh air every 10 minutes or so because it was affecting her so much. There was NO sympathy from the manager that orchestrated this because since their office was in the back, they chose to ignore the death zone of fumes that was our entire store.

My final straw is that due to slow business my hours were cut to 3 days a week instead of the usual 5. Kinda sucky, but it also gave me more time to find a career based job and what not. So I requested 2 days off because I am going out of town on those days. I wrote that in my explanation of why I needed those days off, and sent it in timely. I figured it was easy enough to work around considering I was only working 3 days, but NOPE. I get my schedule for this week and it says I am only working only 2 days this week, not the usual 3. Those days are the VERY 2 days I requested off. Seems pretty intentional to me. 

The other part to this that makes me even more angry is that we recently had to sign this attendance policy, and it states in the first paragraph of the policy that the next weeks schedule MUST be available to each employee by noon on Thursdays... I received my schedule at 10PM tonight (Thursday February 2), which is earlier then I had been receiving it before this. Last week and the week before my schedule was made available to me Friday morning. This wouldn't be an issue if their work weeks didn't begin on Sunday, meaning you can't actually plan your weekend until it IS the weekend. 


Now, I've been looking around at other retail jobs around town because this has turned into a nightmare fast, but no one else seems to be hiring so I'm starting to feel like I'm stuck here. My question is, what do I do? I'm a pretty damn good employee, I'm top 3 in opening the most company credit cards, I always come in when they call and need me last minute, when they have me working shipment I always bring in coffee for everyone, and I do my job pretty damn well. But I've been sucking it up for 5 months now, watching all of these things happen, and now I'm starting to feel like I'm going to flip a table over in anger because it's clearly getting worse, and this manager NEEDS to be fired. Everything that has gone wrong has been at her hand. Do I complain? Or wait for someone else to complain ? AUGH help please !! &gt;.&lt;"

I can read and write, and understand some spoken kannada, but my vocabulary is bad and i don't really grasp the grammar.  I never really learned how to conjugate verbs outside of imperative and perfect tense.  I think it is because i tended to rely way too much on english there; instead of saying ""‡≤ï‡≤ø‡≤ü‡≤ï‡≤ø ‡≤Æ‡≥Å‡≤ö‡≤ø"" i would say ""window close - ‡≤Æ‡≤æ‡≤°‡≤ø.""

The job description was very vague, listing only the program used and the pay rate which is barely over what i made at my internship at a similar company.

I don't like the idea of sitting at a desk again as last time i gained a considerable amount of weight and my eye sight went down hill from constantly staring at a computer screen.  
I'm also in process of being hired on at an assembly plant locally that will actually help me wind up bringing home more bacon due to available overtime and consistent raises. I took a tour of the facility and everyone there had a genuine smile on their face and seemed to really enjoy what they were doing. 
I would work long hours at the assembly job, but would stay active, be out at a reasonable time, have weekends off, raises every couple months, positive environment, and opportunity to advance within the company.  However, I have had family and friends try to sway me into the design position due to my education and experience.

I have a couple years experience as a graphic design intern, mostly doing flyers and promotional stuff.  I created a website in iWeb, which turned out pretty good, but it was mostly drag and drop, coding optional for improvement (which I did little bit of).  My new boss dropped a bomb on me this evening by telling me that I'm going to be in charge of our website (our company is approximately 2,500 employees, and we're kind of a big deal).  We've got a vendor doing it right now, but they're failing miserably.  I know I can wade my way through it, and pick things up as I go, but it's a bit of a daunting task to replace an outsourced vending team whose job is strictly to create and moderate websites, and take the whole task on myself.

A couple of weeks ago, [someone inquired](http://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/om0l1/can_anyone_recommend_a_place_to_get_a_massage/) as to where a good place to get a massage in Houston would be. Also, any of you who read [this article](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2012/02/03/massage-doesnt-just-feel-good-it-changes-gene-expression-and-reduces-inflammation/) posted in r/science from Discover magazine, who may be feeling inspired to get a massage, this is my recommendation.

If you haven't heard of it before, [Avalon School of Massage](http://www.avalonmassageschool.com/) is a fantastic, affordable place to get a massage. They used to charge $35/hr for their intern massage, but bumped [their price](http://avalonmassageschool.com/Intern.html) up to $40 recently. Still, it's a great deal considering that they don't accept tips, nor is there any applicable tax; it's $40 for an hour out the door.

They offer both masseuses (female) and masseurs (male) per your preference. I've had a massage done at other, far more expensive places and I can tell you that I haven't been able to tell a difference between the ""quality"" of high end salons versus interns at this school (who are qualified to perform massage therapy).

I've only been to their Richmond location, but from what I understand they have another one across the street from the Galleria on the north side of Westheimer.

It is my dearest wish and most sincere hope that what the research conducted in the study reported in Discover magazine is accurate and some of you Houston loyalists get your gene expressions changed with the aid of (relatively) inexpensive massage. Happy holidays.

Im an intern at my local city hospital and a full time student and single mom. I also have a roomate with 2 kids of her own. My phone was shut off on wednsday, which means I cant go to work, because I have to have a phone and also, my ex refuses to bring my kids home because of the no phone...I wont have the $$ to get my phone on till my tax check comes. Unless I drop out of school...which may happen on Monday so that I can go get another job. My life is in shambles at the moment and Im sorry to ask for help...Im with Sprint. the bill is hefty 271.41...originally they had to told me that I can pay 130 to have it back on...but that offer is no longer on the table. If anyone would be willing to help, you can pm the mod backpackwayne who is a mod in r/assistance...Ive given him all the info needed to call sprint and help pay the bill...he also has my verification.

Thank you 
Oakland County, MI

Edit: I will pay any interest that anyone who helps me wants...they said I should recieve my refund in 10-14 days

Edit2: I can also provide any verification needed...however...no phone means no internet...I can check my reddit at the library today and may possibly be able to use my neighbors internet this evening..."

* Do people really have sex in the on call room all the time?
* Do interns really get treated like crap just for the fun of it?
* Do doctors 'work around the system' to help people with no medical insurance.
* Does everybody sleep with everybody else because of the long hours spent day after day and not having a chance to meet new people?

A lot of people requested I give an update on this, so here it goes.

First of all **thank you** to everyone who gave advice. Especially to people who are themselves disabled or work with people with disabilities. I learned a lot I never knew about what everyday life is like for people in situations I could hardly imagine. I wish this stuff was common knowledge so everyone would understand more about the challenges people have to face.

Now for the update: It's been just over a month and it's going great! We set him up with self-paced learning materials about programming, and he's blowing through them at record pace. He's a very bright and motivated kid. It's been a pleasure having him around the office, and so far, it's not been very different from how I'd imagine any other 16 year old intern would be. While he's still a shy guy, he's coming out of his shell a bit more. I've checked in with him a few times to see how he's finding it, and he said he's really enjoying working with us. I've seen him smile a lot. We've managed to arrange it so he always has some people around if he needs help, but everyone involved has still been able to focus on their own work, so it's working out for our employees as well. I have high hopes that after a while longer we'll be able to have him start doing some paid work using the skills he's learning now. 

Thanks again to everyone who gave constructive comments last time. And to all the naysayers that said it would never work out and we shouldn't give him this chance, take that! :p "

pa2yz,5,2012-02-03,Why shouldn't I do it?,smibly,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pa2yz/why_shouldnt_i_do_it/,"24 year old guy here with one pathetic story to tell and wondering why a worthless, pathetic loser like me shouldn't just kill myself.

As far back as I can remember my life has been nothing but constant, neverending misery.  I've never enjoyed doing anything and actually hated doing everything except zoning out and numbing out.  I've taken up numerous hobbies only to give them up after the misery of forcing myself to do them over and over again got to be too much.**TL;DR** I don't enjoy anything in life

I'm also prone to alcoholism and drug addiction.  I used to use it as a way to escape and numb myself but stopped after it stopped working.  I actually don't know anyone who could get me anything harder than weed.  I usually could only get weed because I would let the person who hooked me up take a nug for themselves.  I can't even do that anymore because I don't have the money for it anymore**TL;DR** Used to escape my misery with drugs and drinking until it stopped working

I have no friends and no one likes me because my misery is like a contagious disease that spreads to everyone else like ebola.  I've also never had a girlfriend (though I'm not a virgin nothing ever came out of any of it) for the same reason.  I am the definition of a forever alone.  When I try to talk to people they just want to get away from me.  My calls and texts aren't responded to and I always get the ""I'll get back to you later"" treatment.  No one ever really gets back to me. **TL;DR** no social life

Actually I used to think I did have friends I hung out with.  It turns out that I was just the runt (lowest rung) of the group and they just put up with me when it was convenient.  They never did invite me to anything and always kept me out of the loop. **TL;DR** people who I thought were friends sucked.

Getting back to never having had a girlfriend.  Everything falls apart very fast when I try to get one.  Some can show some interest in me until I open my mouth and start talking to them.  The loneliness and confidence shattering rejection has turned me into a complete creep.  I'm the guy who will repeatedly, over months, stare at a girl from a distance with the desperate, intense, empty and miserable look of a stalker; then pretend like I'm not doing it by trying to look away when she notices.  I can't talk to them because I'm pretty sure they won't like me.  I've done this so many times with so many girls and they quite frankly think I'm a creep.  I realized that I am a creep when I felt the temptation to sometimes stalk and rape girls out of desperation; though I've never followed through on it for fear of having a restraining order put on me or being sent to prison.  **TL;DR** never had a girlfriend, desperation turns me into a creep

On another note I remember when I was 13 one of my 'friends' who lived in my neighborhood at the time got frustrated at me for being dense and not being able to pick up on subtle, implied cues when talking to other people, especially girls.  He said that he put up with it for years but it was getting really frustrating, especially with girls.  He's now really smooth with girls and also has a much better life than me overall.  Also, just to get an idea of how much of a social runt I am I'll say this. I'm a year older than him and at the time I was considerably bigger, stronger and more physically developed. He still had the leadership role over me and I couldn't get an edge on him when I tried to; he would always put me in my loser place. TL;DR friends ditch me for being worthless

I went to college and studied engineering at a top 10 school because I thought it would be something where even someone who sucks as much as me would be able to get a job and be independent.  I thought so much about changing but had no idea what to change to and knew that my prospects would be worse just about anywhere else except computer science.  Well, I graduated without ever being able to get an internship and can't get a job .  I also can't go to grad school because my grades weren't good enough.  That was because the material made me so miserable that I couldn't put a solid effort into it.  Now my grades aren't good enough and my professors thought I was just lazy (typified by one yelling at me and calling me lazy after I asked him a question in office hours). **TL;DR** Did bad in college

After High School things were supposed to get better.  They might have for others but they sure didn't for me.  Obviously I never had anything close to the experience show in in movies like Animal House or Old School.  I also hated school as far back as I can remember, even elementary school. **TL;DR** I hated my time in college and it was miserable

I still live with my parents and can't get a job and couldn't get an  internship in school because, during the job interview, they could always sense that something was wrong with me no matter how much I try to put on a positive face.  I can't just be myself because that obviously won't work.  btw. this also holds true for jobs like stocking shelves at walmart.  They want someone, just not me.  This was also true before all of the crashes back when the economy was good.  I've been unemployed and living with my parents for over a year now. **TL;DR** I can't get a job and live with parents

I've tried doing other things too.  Extracurriculars, volunteering, the occupy protests, etc.  The people there didn't want me around either.  I could tell because they always acted differently(awkward) when I joined a conversation and left me out of things.  They would keep me out of the loop and not invite me to anything either.  The thing that was the worst was when they gave me recommendations of other places to go, basically they were trying to make me someone else's problem. **TL;DR** more people didn't want me around

I even said I was going to do it once.  I posted a message on facebook asking if anyone had any last things to say to me that were important.  All I got was a bunch of crap saying 'don't do it' without a good reason not to before a bunch of cops stormed in and took my shotgun away.  These were the same people who treated me as I said above.  The same people who hurt me and let me be miserable and then they all the sudden pretended to give a shit.  No one contacted me after to even ask if I was ok.  I've also thought about doing it since I was 15, quite frankly I don't see any reason why I'm better off now not having done it then.  It's like when people treat their grandparents like shit, put them in a home and never visit them; then act all sad when they die. **TL;DR** thought about it for a long time, tried it, no one was genuine.

I've been to a slew of shrinks and have been on just about every antidepressant on the market.  None of that helps and the shrinks can't do anything for me.  It's bad because people have told me to get professional help even though they can't do anything for me.**TL;DR** Tried therapy multiple times, it didn't work

So I ask.  As a miserable bastard who hates everything he does, trapped in lethargy, has no friends, nothing but failure after failure, intense, crushing lonliness, just not being able to honestly feel like a man, and more.  Why shouldn't I just kill myself and end it all like a pathetic loser?

At this point the thread has [spiraled out of control](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/p9a1v/im_woody_harrelson_ama/) with Harrelson's comments being downvoted to oblivion. You can see the answers he DID give [here](http://www.reddit.com/user/iamwoodyharrelson) (and hit context to get the question).

There is also a circlejerk-type [request thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/p9u8t/ama_request_the_intern_who_suggested_woody_should/) looking for the intern who came up with the idea in the first place.

This has obviously not helped the movie at all. Many people are commenting that they will boycott the movie and Harrelson in general. My question is whether or not this will curb the influx of celebrity AMAs, for better or worst.

To be fair, these AMAs were giving a lot of attention to Reddit from other sites who linked to them. I would be very curious to see the traffic stats to these celebrity AMAs from outside links.

I personally think the celebrity AMAs are hit or miss, depending on whether or not the celebrity ""understands"" Reddit and the internet in general. Harrelson obviously did not. It is given that most celebrities that come to Reddit are promoting a movie or show. Does this mean that a celebrity cannot make an AMAAM (ask me anything about movie) without getting into possibly offensive questions? I ask this because the first question that Harrelson answers, and what possibly started the downturn, was a Redditor accusing him of taking a [friend's virginity without calling afterward.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/p9a1v/im_woody_harrelson_ama/c3nlalf?context=3). 

Anyways, very interesting stuff.

Edit: More stuff I came across.

Just saw that the virginity story has become a [meme in itself](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/p9reb/woody_meet_reddit/) being on the front page of /r/funny. 

In that thread there is a counter argument going against the circle-jerk mentality and [defending Woody](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/p9reb/woody_meet_reddit/c3noi5e). It has been upvoted to 630.

AIESEC is the largest student-run organization in the world, with over 60,000 members in over 110 countries around the globe. We provide cultural exchange in the form of internships; varying from technology, business, volunteering, and teaching. These internships range anywhere from 6 weeks to 78 weeks, and there are practically infinite opportunities for exchange. In the case of volunteering and teaching internships, interning with AIESEC is a great alternative to studying abroad for students who do not have the time in their schedule to accommodate taking a semester off, as it is very easy to find summer internships in these categories. For technology and management, it is recommended that the applicant is willing to spend at least 20 weeks abroad (usually with a semester off or post-graduation), however, this is not always the case. We will be hosting information sessions on the U of I campus in Wohler's Hall, room 226, on February 21st-23rd from 7-8 pm for the opportunity to go abroad through AIESEC. It is not necessary to be a member of AIESEC to go abroad with us. 

If you could please share this information with your fellow classmates, we would greatly appreciate it!

Specifically, I'm a team leader in sending students into technological internships, so if any engineering or computer science students are interested, feel free to contact me here or in my inbox!

Thanks!

Because after trying on a few yesterday, I think they look pretty good, especially with shirts I haven't had a chance to get taken in yet.  I don't think I'll wear one every day, because variety is a good thing.  I also think that, to help myself stand out a little bit, I should find a style that looks good, but is also sort of original and unique.  Sort of important when interns are mostly seen and not heard.  That said, I don't want to stand out *too* much.

pbwus,10,2012-02-05,Go-To guide to breaking into the industry. ,DLDude,Themepark,https://www.reddit.com/r/Themepark/comments/pbwus/goto_guide_to_breaking_into_the_industry/,"Hey all! I realize some of you might be interested in working in the industry as you go to and work through college. The industry is a very small, but very tight knit group of people and it's surprising how quickly you can get to know some very important people. I wanted to share my experience in how I and my friends got in. 

In 2007 a good friend and I started a group called the Theme Park Engineering Group at Ohio State (http://themeparkeng.org.ohio-state.edu/). There had never been a group like this before. That November, 3 of us went down to IAAPA (the amusement park convention in Orlando) and gave out business cards. Not for ourselves, but for the group. I think it really turned heads that we were a group dedicated to theme park engineering. We began to work on our own design projects. We designed and built a working 10ft steel version of an S&amp;S power tower. The more we did, the more people seemed to notice. 

Our first big break was when CoasterDynamix (a toy roller coaster company) came to us to work on a new product they didn't have time to develop themselves. Of course, one of the owners of CoasterDynamix also is a partner in The Gravity Group. It wasn't long before we knew most of the people at the Gravity Group. Those guys also know most of the guys at Great Coasters International. Within 2 years we were on a first-name basis with all of them. 

Throughout all of this, we kept going to IAAPA. We made special Theme Park Engineering Group Polos so that we looked together and professional. We met many people in the industry. Roller Coaster engineers, themed attraction engineers, etc etc. We talked to everyone we could. 

The thing about the amusement industry is that a lot of 'geeks', or 'foamers' try to get jobs at the major companies. Companies don't want to hire someone who idolizes the people they would be working with. They want to hire people that are passionate, yet highly professional. Having the Theme Park Engineering Group name behind us gave us that legitimacy. Due to this, we've had quite a bit of success getting into the industry. 

Here is our track record (so far)

I work full time for CoasterDynamix now as a design engineer

The other founder now works full time at Universal Creative

One had an internship last summer with Universal Creative

We've had 2 people intern at Great Coasters International

One guy works full time at The Gravity Group

One guy just got a job at Disney Engineering

Another worked for a whole year (an internship of sorts, but NOT the college program) with Disney Engineering

A girl worked had a 2-year part-time internship with Roto Studio (they do themed designs)

The point is, if you have a level of professionalism, desire, and talent, the industry really isn't as hard to break into as you may think. Sure, you won't be designing coasters your first year out of school, but you can still land REALLY fun jobs. 

There have been a couple colleges that have created Theme Park Engineering Groups that mirror ours at Ohio State. I know Penn State has a fairly developed group. My suggestion if you are in college or are about to go, find one of these groups or start your own. You can contact the Ohio State group if you have any questions while setting it up. 

Just an FYI: If I had to say what the MOST important things to do if you want to get into the industry are, i would say:
#1. Go to IAAPA and be PROFESSIONAL. Have business cards, get business cards. I don't suggest bringing a resume. Contact them later to talk about job opportunities. 
#2. Join or start a theme-park related group. It puts you ahead of many of the people who just randomly send resumes to companies. 

If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask. I've got lots of fun stories over the past 5 years. "

I'm currently in my junior year in college and have accepted an offer with a big 4 firm to participate in their 8 week summer intern program this coming June. At first, I was ecstatic knowing that it's a pretty safe bet that I'll have a full time offer coming out of college and I get to go to freakin Folrida and get paid for it! As I started asking staff what the job was like, I got pretty standard responses ""It's great, I learn something new every day!"". The responses are totally different than what I have read on some accounting forums which sound more like they're being tortured every day. What really concerned me was when I talked to my friend's cousin, who is currently very successful in industry, and she had said that she was cussed out by her manager on the first day as full time staff and every day was a struggle. She left after 2 years.

So my question is, what is it really like working for the big 4? Am I going to be miserable for the rest of my public accounting career? (I'm going assurance in the bay area if this is relevant)

Also it would be great if I could get someone with a lot of experience with big 4 to PM me for an AMA.

I cannot be without her, having panic attacks that we grow apart, the fear is taking a big part of me. We can trust eachother, because we are no cheaters, but that‚Äôs not the point.

More and more I communicate in a way that is repulsive, pushing her away, while I don‚Äôt want that. I cry alot lately, because I miss her. The times that we are together, how rare even, are wonderful.

We have plans to live together, but it has tremendous financial consequences for the both of us. In this country, Belgium, they take away alot from you when you move in with eachother. Taxes go way up, childsupport (she has children) goes alot down and since I am at school, the state will cut down on my income too.

I started drinking again (but I quit already) up to a point where signs of depression came about. That was the moment I decided to quit. When I drink, I also get nasty in my words. I do not want that.

I wish I could overcome all that crap, move in with her an grow old with her. She is my true woman, never had any better, believe me. When I don‚Äôt see, hold, smell, hear and so her, it feels just the same as being lovesick. Like when it is just broken up.

I have a feeling many ""forever alones"" feel this way, though I have no data to back this up.

I never had a date in my life until last year, about exactly a year ago. I felt lifeless during the dates and it let me to questioning whether getting a girlfriend isn't all that, but being trans is the issue causing my decade long depression.

Now, things have changed ever since I decided to transition. I've been talking to a lot of girls and one girl I do homework with a lot and hang around with wants me to go to a concert with her and she wants me to do some research internship with her over the summer. So i'm pretty sure she is interested in me. My ""game"" is remarkably better than it was just 6 months ago, let alone 3 years ago. I feel if I wanted to(I would if I wasn't trans sigh), I could easily go on some dates right now with her, I might even be able to just make her my girlfriend.

So now it comes down to this. Could I choose the potential path of possibly getting a girlfriend, or ignore it and keep transitioning? I lean heavily towards transitioning, but this is still eating at me, a lot. ugh"
pbl1m,0,2012-02-05,Is it true that I am indeed surrounded by idiots?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pbl1m/is_it_true_that_i_am_indeed_surrounded_by_idiots/,"We've all heard this quote before, ""before you diagnose yourself with depression or low self esteem, first make sure that you are not, in fact, surrounded by assholes/idiots,"" but the more I think about it the more I believe it is true and is the explanation to my current self being more distant from my peers. 

I'm currently a college student. I wouldn't call myself a 3rd wheel but I have a very small group of friends. I am not into the party scene, I don't think it is anything special and fail to see the appeal. 

I've always been pushed hard by my parents. I've had a flawless childhood, never got into trouble, because my father would not tolerate it. I've been working since 14 and have been at internships where I've held very important positions.

I've been told by people much older than me that I carry myself well. I've even shocked some people when they ask me what grade I'm in, most assuming I'm a senior. (I'm a Sophomore) 

I sometimes feel like I'm wasting time in college. Although I don't have the knowledge right now for a serious job I have the work experience, attitude, etc to hold a serious job. I'm a very ""go out and get it done type."" I've handled a lot of tough situations on my own, often commanding respect from adults older than me (when they won't take me seriously).

I'm obviously a foreveralone although it only bothers me from time to time. I can't really find someone I like that is my age. I find myself more attracted to slightly older woman (1-2 years) as they are usually immensely more mature than most my age. And most advances with them don't get taken seriously, ""girls don't date down."" 

Although there are plenty of good reasons for growing up fast I feel that I am immensely more mature than my current generation and as such has left me very depressed and I feel like a social outcast in college.

Toughts? Am I too mature for my own good?

I recently finished my BA degree in Computer Information Systems, but instead of feeling excited and giddy of my accomplishment (first in the family to even go beyond HS) I'm so discouraged and somewhat down.

Granted that my school wasn't so primarily focused on the tech side of the CIS program (more business) but it has a good reputation.  With an AAS and BBA under my belt, the past couple of weeks have been miserable.  

I'm currently an intern in a consulting company; granted my duties are not so tech focused but I'll help around when the SA is busy with *real* work (how I hate when my co-workers feel that he doesn't do shit).  I'll help senior management if let's say the printer ""broke"" or have issues with our CRM system, basically putting out the fires.  My previous position in my school was the same thing but more hectic and more users (300 computer lab). 

My issue right now I have been unable to land a simple help desk job and has been pretty frigging discouraging.  I don't have the experience that most employers are looking for (Active Directory, Exchange Server, Networking) but always received a compliment on what a great personality I have and always have a bright attitude when an end user gets uptight.  

Right now I'm just reading as much as I can from certification guides on Active Directory 2008 R2; Group Policy; CCNA (although very interested learning from the CCNA books I picked up than Microsoft) A+ even though it seems so basic. I've been fiddling around with Microsoft Server 2008 R2 with Virtual Box but seems like everyone is talking about Virtualization that I should switch over to VMware to get used to its features.

So this is the part when I ask this specific crowd with any tips, suggestions in your experience when you first started and when was the moment you achieved to kickstart your career.  I've been reading the SysAdmin thread for about 3 weeks now and it provided so much information that it gets me giddy to learn new topics I never came across with.  Maybe my enthusiasm will triumph my cruddy luck in landing a new position.  Thank you in advance if you managed to read this far.

I will be graduating this may (with honors) with a mechanical engineering degree from an accredited private school in the Midwest. It has always been a dream of mine to live in Charleston. I have no relatives within 10 hours of the area, but have been to the city numerous times with my family as we head to Kiawah Island. There is something about the culture of lowcountry that resonates in me that I do not get in the midwest. 

I was wondering if anyone could name off some engineering firms so I could start researching? I have already used google to search some firms, but I also know there will always be small firms that do not show up that those in the area know about.

I have worked primarily in the past as an intern for small (&lt;50 employees) facility engineering firms (MEP ... those who do the HVAC / plumbing in very large buildings in many sectors) but would have no problem moving into manufacturing or design.

I figured since this is probably the last time I have no strings in my life attached nor do I have any debts ... might as well look into it now! How is the city for a young graduate to work and play in?

It would definitely add some time to my college career, but I've had a scholarship so far, and honestly don't mind being in school a little longer (even if I have to take on some debt). Finance is alright, and the job prospects are probably decent, but I'd rather do something I really like the rest of my life than something that's.. well... meh. This would be a big change in my life, that I've arrived at after a long heart to heart with my parents and girlfriend. So I figured I'd come to Reddit to get some practical advice. BA vs BS, job prospects, whether I'm full of shit, difficulty, different career paths, etc. Feel free to drop a bomb on me and hit me with any practical advice about a CS major. Thanks in advance :)"

So I'm really not looking for anything other than a new friendship. I'm here from the UK on a Photography Internship and haven't really had the opportunity to make any friends. I only really requested females because I tend to get on with females much, much more than men (I guess you could say I have a feminine personality. That's a little strange to say!)

Anyway, I'm a photographer and a huge, huge fucking fan of music and swearing. So throw me a message if you want to see my work or go for some intelligentsia :)

I am a long time lurker here on r/atheism, and thought you guys might find my story interesting. Its a personal account that supports my views on how the church preys on the young, poor, and less intelligent people in our society in order to increase their numbers, and thus, their wallets. As I re-read this vastly cut down story, I realized how much it relates to the definition of the word ""cult"" instead of the word ""christianity."" Before you read this, know that I still love every member of my family dearly despite their role in what happened to my brother. The Christian faith is what they believe in, and theres nothing I can say that will change their faith. 

I grew up with 2 younger brothers, and 2 very loving parents. We were brought up going to church every day, however, we all did what most kids did during church and drew stick figure battles on the bulletins the whole time. We'll call my 2 brothers Bobby and Danny. Bobby is 2 years younger, and Danny is 7 years younger. We had the greatest childhood any kid could ask for. Our father spoiled us with all the coolest nerf guns, our bedtime was much later than any other kid in the neighborhoods, and when N64 came out, we were the first on the block to have it. My father was a successful business owner, and my mother was the stay-at-home mom who gave all of his money to the church. As I got older, I realized what was happening and approached my dad about it, however, she had the ball and chain so tightly wound there was almost nothing I could say to fix the problem. 

I had been in college for 2 years at this point, and was having the time of my life. My mother (the religious fanatic) was upset with me for choosing a public university, however, I told her again and again I chose the school because it had one of the top 5 business schools in America. I was getting straight A's, got a fantastic internship in NYC, and things couldn't have gone any better. Bobby was looking into going to the same school as me, however, once the time to choose schools rolled around he was extremely nervous about getting in. 

Bobby was never the smartest kid in school, however, had the biggest heart in the world. He was the most free spirit of anyone I ever knew. His grades in high school limited his options for college, and my mother decided to practically force him to go to a Christian school in Florida. She used the state of Florida to lure him into schussing a Christian University, since he loved warm weather, the beach, golfing, and everything that state has to offer. He was there for a year, and called me every month to tell me how much he hated it. He told me the people were too religious, and tried to force him into doing things he didn't want to. I called my parents and told them to get him out of there, and that he wasn't happy. My father agreed with me, however, the influence my mother had on him made him useless in helping my aid my little brother. She thought that it wasn't Christianity that was the problem (obviously) but it was his attitude and that the Satan was trying to influence his life. Anytime any of us had a problem, my mother always said to pray about it and read the Bible to us. I told her repeatedly how ineffective this was, and after a number of years finally quit asking my mother for any help regarding emotional issues. Bobby told me he was going to tough it out the rest of the year, then look into transferring without the help of my mother. I encouraged him to do this, however, one day everything changed out of the blue.

It was now my senior year in college, and I had already been offered a position at a top financial firm in NYC. I was so concerned with my own life that I neglected to check up on Bobby a few times a day, but we still talked weekly, and he told me he liked it now at his school and wanted to stay. I asked him if he was sure about this and he assured me he was happy. I assumed that he found some friends that weren't crazy bible pushers, but couldn't have been more wrong. This is where it all gets weird‚Ä¶

I went home for Christmas break and Bobby was not the same person at all. Instead of playing Halo with me and Danny downstairs, he was upstairs reading the Bible. We tried to get him to hang with us, but all he wanted to do was to pray and read the Bible. He no longer was wild and funny like he used to be, all his friends noticed and thought he was brainwashed, and it seemed all his former goals of playing professional soccer and majoring in physical therapy went out the window. I went to my parents and said there was something wrong with Bobby, and he needed to leave that school immediately. My mother, infuriated with me, told me that I was the problem and Bobby was happy. She told me I was the one who had a problem and that it was because I didn't commit my life to God like Bobby has. 

I tried to talk to Bobby numerous times following Christmas break and convince him he was being brainwashed, and that he needed to leave that university immediately. I tried to show him how different he was, and prove to him that the church took advantage of him during a hard time in his life when he was unhappy. I told him that what he was feeling was a misguided euphoria brought on my mass influence, and that if he hadn't have been around so many religious people at once during that time in his life, he never would have gave in like he did. He didn't listen, and my mother did everything in her power to prove to Bobby how unhappy ""I"" was, and that ""I"" was the one who had all the issues. 

Bobby even tried to tell me how I needed to to give my life to God and that I was the one with the problems. I asked him about the youth group he was in down in Florida and how he originally joined it, and the details made me so angry I wanted to kill someone. The way he was recruited reminded me of hell week when I was pledging my college fraternity. He said he was practically abducted from his room, driven somewhere 15 minutes away, and basically told he needed to give his life to God in order for the fear to go away (Gods grace and mercy or something?). I told him that what he went through was similar to cult activity, and that what they were doing was not the same type of Christianity we grew up with. I made him give me the name of his youth group leader, and called him the next day. I threatened him, and told him to leave my little brother alone. He said he would, but apparently Bobby was still going to the church group, and lied to me and told me he wasn't. 

Fast forward to today (2 years later, since there are so many details and I don't want this thread to be much longer). I am currently working in NYC as an Actuary and love every detail of my life. I am happy, make good money, and have a wonderful girlfriend all against the will of my controlling mother. If you knew how awesome my relationship with Bobby was before he became brainwashed‚Ä¶.erghhmm‚Ä¶. a Christian, you might tear up seeing how bad it is now. The only conversations we now have are him trying to convert me to his faith. He is constantly asking me and my parents for money to go on ""mission trips"" to exotic countries to tell people about Jesus. He gave up his dream of playing professional soccer, and now is working towards seminary school. He proposed to a girl he has only known a few months, and for whatever reason she said yes. His personality is dull and completely uncharacteristic of his former self, he refuses to do anything ""ungodly"", and he is the biggest financial leech I have ever seen, constantly giving the money my father sends him for food, books, etc. to his church. I can tell he's not happy, but I feel the grasp these people down in Florida have on him is so strong. It almost seems like a forced happiness, and I feel powerless to help being so many states away and him being so far gone. If I had the means to cut him off financially, I would, but sadly I am not in that position. I begged my father to stop paying for his college and to get him out of there, but my mother won't let it happen. I feel like we have nothing in common anymore, and hanging out with him now is like hanging out with a stranger.

Danny and I still play xbox live every Sunday night to stay in touch, and we have remained best friends throughout the whole ordeal (I refer to both my brothers as being my best friend). I still love every member of my family, but hate how my mother has encouraged Bobby's mind to be so badly manipulated. She knew he wasn't the smartest kid to begin with, and I think inadvertently used that to set one of her sons down the path she would be proud of as a Jesus freak. Everything that made Bobby my brother is gone. I understand that people change as they grow up, but this is different.  

Christianity stole my little brother, and my best friend.

[details inside],[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pdtok/is_this_hosting_company_ripping_me_off_details/,"So I am doing an internship in a field unrelated to coding/website design and I have not formally studied either, however I am  proficient with c++ and familiar with css, html, java and google.

Its a rather small company (the one I am working for) and they had a pretty badly designed website so I offered to design them a new one from scratch and I'd work on it from time to time (and its coming along pretty nice..with the help of Google of course)

So the ""hosting"" company is charging $400/year (Canadian). The website is a fucking mess, horribly designed and there is clearly very little maintenance and most likely none done to it (I had to call them because EVERY single page aside from the index was being hosted on THEIR domain.... and they still have not fixed that..so....www.hostingcompany.com/~ourpages)

Anyways I sent him an email asking why my company was paying $400/year and telling him that Godaddy would pretty much offered the same thing for $120ish/year and his response was  [this](http://i.imgur.com/XuBaV.jpg)

The only thing my company has with them is email and the website...also seeing how I will redesigned the website...they won't help me set up CMS integration in order to facilitate content being added to the website in a very friendly manner. They want us to pay for the redesign (even though I have a final copy which looks great)...and at the end of the day, I can't imagine CMS integration being that hard...if not I could use wordpress?

Questions: 

* is there any ways I could confirm that thing about hosting that he claimed on his email? 
* A friend who is very smart and is currently studying CS told me to steer away from Godaddy. So I am going to trust him...he told me about some good hosting stuff..but if you guys have any other ideas..that would be great.

Thanks

pdsli,5,2012-02-06,hair drug test: shaving my ENTire body,throwawaydt444333444,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/pdsli/hair_drug_test_shaving_my_entire_body/,"hey everyone! I wanted to get r/trees input on my hair test strategy, and maybe clear up some of the facts about hair tests and how to beat these damn things. For some background, I've failed a hair test before. I tried using two bottles of the ""miracle shampoo"" from the local head shop, one the night before and one right before the test. When I complained the guy at the head shop said it was my fault because I used it twice and was only supposed to use it once. Whatever. Anyways, I don't smoke much anymore, but did do quite a bit during vacation the week before new years and again during a week in the middle of January. I was also in a room with a lot of smokers this last weekend and felt a bit of a contact high.

I'm beginning the process of applying for jobs, I will graduate with a masters degree in July and my current internship is set to end in June. I've begun sending out applications and already have one company flying me out of state for an interview next week. Question about the process:

*can I safely assume I won't have to submit to a hair test until I accept an offer? like the company that is flying me out next week, they understand I wouldn't be starting until July at the latest, so they wouldn't take me into a lab and test me right after an interview, would they? could they? And I would have every right to stall and say I'm still evaluating other offers, right?

Here is my strategy right now:

*Today, I shaved all of my body hair. I will do this again about a month from today.

*I shave my head on a weekly basis anyway, and will continue doing this until I have a test date set, when I might let it grow out the required 1.5 inches or whatever.

*I'm pretty skinny but have noticed a fair amount of 'winter weight' on my belly. I was going to try to break a sweat running or biking at least 3 times a week beginning now.....I know this is where the THC is stored, so i figured it would help me pass a test and, you know, get healthy and shit.

What do you guys think? The consensus seems to be that these things go back 3 months, but I've heard longer. I'm over the shampoo...any other ideas that would help me feel more confident?"
pds5c,23,2012-02-06,Am I the only one who is beginning to feel like college is a scam?,WreckweeM,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pds5c/am_i_the_only_one_who_is_beginning_to_feel_like/,"I'm a junior at a well-ranked state school currently majoring in economics, and after five semesters of education, I feel like the only thing I have learned is that I'm wasting my time and my parent's money. I spent a large part of my childhood listening to people tell me that I am never going to use anything I learn in college in real life, and every time I heard this statement I would ask myself: ""why go, then?"". I always chalked it up to the adult either lying, or not understanding the importance of a college education. And yet, now that I am here, I cannot find the importance that I once was so sure existed.

I suppose the scenario is different for education majors (who need to learn how to properly teach) or for nursing/med majors (who need to learn how to properly save lives), or for law students, or basically any major that is designed for people who are absolutely going into that profession, but for someone like me, who is still completely unsure of which career I want to pursue, I'm not seeing the benefit of the degree.

I'm aware a degree is necessary to get a well-paying job once I'm out of school, but I find that idea laughable. I can honestly say that there is not a single job out there that I am currently more qualified for than I was graduating high school, and I am having severe difficulty in naming a single job that I will be more qualified for once I graduate than I am now. 

With learning being set to such a vigorous pace, how can anyone expect me to retain everything I have learned? I, like most college students I'm sure, have a tendency to forget everything I learned in a class before at the start of a new semester in order to focus entirely on all the new work that will need to get done.

Say I have a job offer lined up immediately following graduation: what would make me more qualified for that job? A college degree? Or four-years experience at said job, or any other job in the same career-market? 

Let's talk about the money. Oh yes, the money. Again, I'm sure I don't need to explain the reality that graduates are getting their degrees, have been completely unable to find any jobs at all, and yet this does not mitigate the insane mass of debt they have. Someone who worked their ass off for four years has more experience, and zero debt. This debt is even greater if they went to grad school. And let's not forget about those who didn't get it right on the first try: students who decided to change their majors. Extra classes, extra semesters, even more money, and if you didn't realize until after your sophomore year that you're in the wrong major, you're FUCKED. Your choices are now: Enjoy being a super, super, super senior with an insane amount of debt, or enjoy a degree that is now literally useless to you.

Then we have textbooks: books so overpriced that these publishers must have profit margins so massive they look like insurance companies. I was forced to pay one hundred and fifty dollars last year for a textbook that was A STACK OF FUCKING LOOSE-LEAF PAPERS. Of course they had no binding, so you can't sell it back. You have to go online, where no one is going to pay you even a fraction of that for something that you can literally obtain with a copy of the papers and a copy machine (you could even use the automatic feeder since there's no binding).

The only thing I actually feel like I am paying for is the professor's time, and even at that most professors follow the textbook. So why can't I just buy the textbook and forget about the professor (most will make you read it anyway). The only, and I mean only, time I feel like my money has not been wasted is when I have a good professor who can actually make me feel like I learned more with his guidance than I could on my own (this has been a very rare experience).

To be honest, I'm not really sure what the point I'm trying to make it. All I know is that I can't shake this feeling that everything I'm going through is just so, so wrong. I feel like I'm paying insane amounts of money just for a piece of paper that gives me the privilege of working a higher-paying job that someone with the same level of intelligence and no education could work just as well. 

Colleges do provide internship opportunities, I suppose, but this drops me right back to the point that you're paying money only for the privilege of working a higher-paying job. By selecting interns from a college pool, you are eliminating that opportunity from other non-college students, even if that person is more intelligent and more qualified for the job.

I suppose that having a degree proves that you are a hard worker, but so does working hard. A powerful job experience list is just as handy on a resume as a college degree is. 

My final question essentially is: Asides from everything that I named already, why is a college degree even worth getting? Right now it seems that in the choice between go to work and go to college, I made the wrong choice.

TL;DR - If you didn't read what I had say, why should I give a fuck about what you have to say?

EDIT - Spelling, Grammar....I'm no poet.

I've actually failed a hair test before and was hoping my situation could help get some of the facts straight and get a solid plan heading into a test. I currently intern at a pretty big/ well known company and graduate with a masters degree in July. I'm not a big smoker anymore, but I smoked a fair amount during the week before new years and again during a week in the middle of January. I was also in a room this last weekend with a lot of people smoking and honestly felt a little bit of a contact high. I'm beginning the process of applying for jobs after I graduate, and already have one interview next week- 

*Granted that my current internship ends in June and my graduation won't occur until July, I'm wondering if I can safely assume I wouldn't be asked to take a test before June? 
*Also, since I'm applying for a few different jobs and will hopefully be able to evaluate several different offers, can I assume that I wouldn't be asked to take a test before I actually accepted an offer?

I had a bad experience with the 'miracle shampoo' stuff when I failed before.....I went crazy and bought two bottles, used one the night before and one the day of the test and still failed. When I complained to the head shop that I still failed the test, they said it was my fault because you're only supposed to use one of the bottles before the test (whatever). So my strategy now is this:

*shaved all of my body hair today and will do the same thing a month from today (not much arm/leg hair to begin with so doesn't look conspicuous)
*since I'm a guy and already shave my head once a week anyway, I will continue this, maybe until I get an actual test date then let it grow out a little. 

I've also noticed myself putting on some ""winter-weight"" (I've always been pretty skinny) around the belly and understand these fatty areas are where your body stores thc. I was also going to try to break a solid sweat at least 3 times a week on the stationary bike just to trim down on the fat (and...you know....be healthy and shit).

So what do you think? Consensus seems to be 3 months and your good but I've heard longer....any other tips going into this summer (besides not smoking) that would make me more confident against the evil testing labs?

Now, here comes my issue : The PM says, on the final day, that with all the work I‚Äôve been doing, she‚Äôs going to get me paid for that day. 

I fill out my timesheet, and am super chuffed to find out that 18 hours = double pay on my first paycheque. Finally, the long work pays off.
I just got my time sheet and paycheque today, and, well, my times have been scribbled out and rewritten, to a convenient 17.5 hours worked and a PM flatrate as payment so after taxes I have less than half the money I was told I‚Äôd be getting.

-Aren‚Äôt I still supposed to get time and a half or something like that, even if its just short of 18 hours.

-How to I handle this? I‚Äôm going with ‚ÄúKeep my head down and feel lucky I‚Äôm getting paid at all cause I‚Äôm just the intern so complaining will just get me in everyone‚Äôs bad books and I‚Äôll never find work again‚Äù, but at the same time I have bills to pay, and it just seems like a bit of a kick in the dick to be stingy with all the work I‚Äôve been doing.

Like I said, I mean, I'm lucky I'm getting anything at all being an intern, but at the same time I also feel kind of screwed, and since this is my first cheque I don't know if this is something that happens and I'm supposed to suck it up and keep going or if this is a legitimate issue I should be making a fuss about."

So here‚Äôs the deal. My gf (22) and I (25) met in college. We‚Äôve been together for a almost 2.5 years. We‚Äôve had our ups and downs like any other couple.  A little background history: When we were about a little over a year into our relationships my gf moved away for an internship (for 8 months). We tried to break up and but instead opted for a LDR. Sadly we both cheated on each other and broke up. We did the whole on again off again thing. After taking some time apart we decided to try again. And the past year has been great for both of us. We‚Äôre very much in love and have even imagined our lives together for the long haul. Sadly things are about to change. She‚Äôs about to leave again once she graduates. I‚Äôve got a great job that will keep me in the current city. 

Now here lies the problem: I have this lingering fear that if she moves away we‚Äôre going to eventually break up because the LDR thing will be too much. This fear is like a bothersome fly that won‚Äôt go away. She says she wants to be with me and that we‚Äôll try to make the LDR work but im just not 100% convinced. So what should I do reddit? How do I make this feeling go away? Should I end it now so that I wont have to deal with the misery of breaking up after wards? I‚Äôve told her how I feel and she says she cant give me an answer for what might happen in the future but I know she wants to be with me.

TL;DR: GF is going to be moving away. LDR didn‚Äôt work in the past and im worried it wont work again. Advise please

pdm7c,8,2012-02-06,"If I start studying now, should I take the P Exam in May or July?  Is it worth it for an Econ Major with no Actuarial education or work experience?",[deleted],actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/pdm7c/if_i_start_studying_now_should_i_take_the_p_exam/,"Okay so, a little backstory on me- After 3.5 years, I just graduated in December from University of Wisconsin-Madison with a degree in ""Economics with a Mathematical Emphasis""  (it's a confusing name for a degree, but all the math emphasis means is I took calc 1,2,3, linear algebra, econometrics, game theory, and economic statistics in order to add those four extra words to my Econ Degree).  I have a 2.8 Overall GPA (I fucked around way too much freshman year) , and a 3.2 Major GPA, with some internship experience as an analyst intern for a big Market Research company in Chicago- so I'm not a complete idiot, but don't have a superstar resume.  As a result, I've been getting a large amount of phone interviews and some in-person interviews, but no offers yet.

So- where actuary related things come in-  as I've been interviewing, I've been bored out of my mind and need something academically challenging to do.  I haven't been applying for actuarial jobs since it does not match my background, but do have an interest in it and would love to someday maybe switch over to actuary work(I wish I knew this freshman year so I could have majored in Actuarial Science).  I figure I'm smart enough to pass the P exam if I study hard, and since I have some free time and are still in that academic mentality I know I could do it.  My question to you, dear r/actuary, is it worth it? Should I dedicate this much time to a exam for a job field I have no experience in and very well could never work in?  Am I an idiot for wanting to take this exam simply because I'm upset that I'm out of school and not being academically challenged?  Would having this exam on my resume be look good to careers outside of actuarial work?  And if I do decide to go through with it, should I take the exam in May or July?  And Let's say I work hard and pass more exams in the future, could I even be an actuary with my poor GPA and Econ Major?

Thank you for reading my wall of text, r/actuary.  Any tidbits of advice are welcome. And if you think that me taking the P exam is a terrible idea given my background, tell me.  Be honest, ha."

They were also compelled by the Christian framework that situates what the place calls its ‚Äúbio-psycho-socio-spiritual model‚Äù of psychological intervention, since they believe that only the healing power of Christ can cure my sister of her penchant for making bad decisions. These decisions include her mistreatment of, or plain disregard for, the insulin therapy she needs to survive; her tendency to get involved in romantic relationships with deadbeat dickheads who treat her poorly and take advantage of her, financially, physically, and emotionally; and the numerous occasions on which she has stolen money from my parents, always in rather clumsy ways, that is, in ways that ensure she will be caught. The original plan, as I understand it, was for my sister to spend the estimated 120-180 days in treatment at this camp in rural Arkansas (at an truly outrageous cost), and then to enroll in a certificate program at a design institute.

About nine months ago she finally ‚Äúgraduated‚Äù from the seven-step program, but moved on to a low-paying internship at the very same place (and under strict supervision and extremely restricted freedoms) which she held until a few weeks ago. At this point, she was discovered to have been once again skipping her insulin injections, and also she bought some CDs instead of paying for her car insurance, or something, and the psychiatrist in charge of the whole place, and a few other places like it, ordered that she be run through the whole program again, for a second time, complete with regular checks from my parents to the tune of about $6,000 per month. The details of the whole situation are really quite vague. This is the biggest problem. Even when she was on the payroll, she was only allowed to speak on the phone once a week, and even then only to my parents. She could receive letters from approved immediate family (like myself) until this new turn of events, so I am completely cut off from all communication with her. She wrote recently, just before her letter-writing privileges were suspended, and asked if she could come live with me for a while; the answer, of course, was yes, but she will not receive my reply. Technically, there is nothing ‚Äúkeeping‚Äù her at this place ‚Äì in the strictly legal sense of unlawful detention ‚Äì and supposedly she could sign herself out and walk away at any time. ‚ÄúWalking away‚Äù here means literally walking about 10 miles to the closest pay phone, but also walking away from my parents and their money, and from three years of religious indoctrination.

Now, I could enumerate the hundreds of reasons why I think this whole therapeutic model is terrible and violent and offensive, but the main reason is that it attempts to ‚Äútreat‚Äù troubled people by teaching them how to internalize a repressive, odious religious narrative, all while exploiting gullible dogmatists like my parents who they know will raise no objections because to do so would be to compromise their faith in Jesus.

I'm having a rough time career-wise. I'm an intern architect, and have been working in architectural offices since I graduated with my Bachelors in 2006. In my brief career I've learned that what you learn about in school, and what I essentially fell in love with as a designer, could not be more different than what you actually do in the field. You learn about designing spaces, having an impact on culture, creating unique experiences and forms. What you get in the industry (at least all the work I can find) is ""designing"" boring-ass projects according to your client's expectations, and drawing trivial shit like jamb details and window elevations more than anything. I'm sure it's fun as hell for the Frank Gehrys of the world, but in my experience that's not what 90% of the industry is really like.

In school I got really into 3D Modeling, and I'm a passionate gamer. I have this fantasy of working for a game studio doing environmental art, but the rational side of me (the one with no balls) tells me that's just a pipe dream and there isn't much money in that kind of work. My questions to the reddit community are: at what point is it too late to jump ship in your career, and has anyone out there taken a similar path?

I have a girlfriend who is extremely supportive, and would go with whatever I wanted to do, but I'm 28 now and we want to start having kids in the next few years, so I'm terrified of piling on more debt to pay for another education and putting us another step back financially all for the sake of chasing a fantasy. My relationship and future family take top priority, but I hate the feeling that I'll never be totally happy with my professional career at the expense of my personal life. I want to think I can enjoy both.

pdal2,0,2012-02-06,Advice Needed!,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/pdal2/advice_needed/,"Hi r/engineering,
I am a 20yo college student in Seattle majoring in engineering who is having trouble with school and I need advice from ppl who know what they are talking about. I want to become a mechanical engineer and I have all the skills and knowledge to do it. My problem is that as a 3rd year college student, I am so bored with school. Not that the stuff isnt interesting, I just find myself thinking of real world applications and getting lost in making stuff work in my head. 
I remember my teacher was talking about having to make a water pump while in Africa without any electricity, and I came up with a better system in 2 second of thinking about it in my head than 3 mechanical engineers did in their two weeks in Africa. 

I am extremely smart and I know I can figure out anything. I get 100 percents on all my tests in math, science, and engineering courses, but I dont get good grades since I forget about the homework or just find it so stupid and excessively long that I dont do it. 

EDIT: I have extensive knowledge in most engineering related topics. I have all the needed math skills, physics skills, I am extremely good with circuits and electronics, and I spend all of my free time with computers, taking them apart, putting them back together, writing programs to do anything from optimize the order of my grocery list to semi-decent animation. 

My counselors are telling me to change majors since I will never make it as an engineer. I am just having a difficult time in school since it is so pointless and putting myself and my parents in excessive debt from loans and all. 

I really need some educated advice on if there are any options for people to succeed in the engineering world without an engineering degree? Are there internships (but no one really gives engineering internships to students with a 3.0 gpa) I can get in order to get a job anywhere?

Sorry about this drag of a post. If you made it this far thank you so much for reading. "

About nine months ago she finally ‚Äúgraduated‚Äù from the seven-step program, but moved on to a low-paying internship at the very same place (and under strict supervision and extremely restricted freedoms) which she held until a few weeks ago.  At this point, she was discovered to have been once again skipping her insulin injections, and also she bought some CDs instead of paying for her car insurance, or something, and the psychiatrist in charge of the whole place, and a few other places like it, ordered that she be run through the whole program again, for a second time, complete with regular checks from my parents to the tune of about $6,000 per month.  The details of the whole situation are really quite vague.  This is the biggest problem.  Even when she was on the payroll, she was only allowed to speak on the phone once a week, and even then only to my parents.  She could receive letters from approved immediate family (like myself) until this new turn of events, so I am completely cut off from all communication with her.  She wrote recently, just before her letter-writing privileges were suspended, and asked if she could come live with me for a while; the answer, of course, was yes, but she will not receive my reply.  Technically, there is nothing ‚Äúkeeping‚Äù her at this place ‚Äì in the strictly legal sense of unlawful detention ‚Äì and supposedly she could sign herself out and walk away at any time.  ‚ÄúWalking away‚Äù here means literally walking about 10 miles to the closest pay phone, but also walking away from my parents and their money, and from three years of religious indoctrination.  My impulse is to drive to Arkansas and go pick her up, but there are major practical constraints here: most importantly, health care (which she will need to survive), and the fact that she has been on some serious head medications like Ziprazidone (an anti-psychotic, also used to treat bipolar disorder) that really need to be gradually suspended. 
 
Now, I could enumerate the hundreds of reasons why I think this whole therapeutic model is terrible and violent and offensive, but the main reason is that it attempts to ‚Äútreat‚Äù troubled people by teaching them how to internalize a repressive, odious religious narrative, all while exploiting gullible dogmatists like my parents who they know will raise no objections because to do so would be to compromise their faith in Jesus.  Worst of all, I am fairly certain that, like my parents, these people truly believe that they mean well, and that they are doing a necessary good.  So what do I do?  What can I do?"

I've always been a good student, I've got lots of AP credit, and got a 800 on the math part of the SAT. But honestly, I majored in business because I didn't know what to do, and it seemed like a somewhat easier major. I'm not sure if I'm too enthused about the job options in the field and the types of people I'd be working with.

Well I've always loved computers, and I'm thinking about switching majors to CS. It would definitely add some time to my college career, but I've had a scholarship so far, and honestly don't mind being in school a little longer (even if I have to take on some debt). Finance is alright, and the job prospects are probably decent, but I'd rather do something I really like the rest of my life than something that's.. well... meh. This would be a big change in my life, that I've arrived at after a long heart to heart with my parents and girlfriend. So I figured I'd come to Reddit to get some practical advice.

If you implicitly count the people who run the farm she's interning with, you could estimate her support network consists of 2 people and a cat. 

My friend is a very well educated, theologically professed, astoundingly amiable, young, attractive female.  1 day at church brought her network from 2 people just a phone call away, to 4 people (just a call away).  She opened a dialog with the pastor, so that gives her access guidance of sorts.  She made an impression on 8 people whom she can easily gain access to on short notice, and most importantly, she's put in face time with a close-knit community -- a town now knows she exists. 

With 4 years in college and a lifetime in my hometown, I only have claim to about ten times what she's established in a day, and that's including family.  Needless to say I'm plenty jealous, but I tried to take a step back and consider the greater implications.  She is not only more equipped to bug out than I am, but she's more well equipped to make a difference in a small community -- a community small enough that her difference could turn the tides of local issue.  

Now admittedly, I can assume some pretty low things of the individuals she's connected with and probably be in the ball park.  The chance of these people being life-long friends is probably not so good.  But, to put this into cold terms, she has more assets who are statistically likely to be compelled to provide for her than I am even capable of making in the same amount of time (5 days).  

TL;DR: My friend gave me some first account insight into the power of church networks and provided it's more the rule than the exception, the value is undeniable.  I thought /r/atheism might be interested, especially in the wake of negativity towards De Botton. 

Much Love,

I am a sophomore student in the Game and Graphic Design Program at Northeastern University in Boston. Next year, I hopefully will be participating in the university's co-op internship program at some sort of game development or design company.

So I ask you:

*How can I get in contact with specific companies? Which specific companies have been known to do internships and what types of companies generally offer internships? It may not be realistic, but it would be awesome to work with Irrational or Sucker Punch because I love both of their games.

*What would you suggest for a first time professional experience?

*Anything particular that should be included in my portfolio or resume?

*Any sort of program knowledge or programming knowledge should I have?

*Is there anybody I should talk to about getting these types of jobs?

Thanks!

**EDIT:**

What I can/want to do:

*I'm really interested in doing anything I can with developers.

*I could do writing for the story or create characters

*I have some programming experience so I could also be of use there perhaps or at least be better communicating with a programming team

*I have some web development skills and know my way around the major Adobe Programs such as Illustrator, Photoshop, inDesign and DreamWeaver.

*I'm a graphic designer and have some sense of good visual design

*And any sort of conceptual game design I think I would do well at, just thinking about how things should work, systems and mechanics, etc.

This is my fourth year (of a total five) and I currently work for a federal agency doing dock permitting and land use regulation, so making the jump to environmental law is not too far out there. 

I'm scared shitless of the debt that comes with a legal education. I've been looking at schools, multiplying the tuition by three and trying to decide if I could sleep at night knowing the indentured servitude waiting for me upon graduation. I won't be able to contribute any significant amount to my education while I'm in school. What if I get a shitty job right out of school making $50K and can't afford my loan payments? Please, give me some stories--success or otherwise.

I've been looking at Lewis and Clark because it's the only program I saw that has an evening program, which would allow me to work more. Tuition is low compared to other schools I've looked at and the cost of living in Portland is much, much lower than a lot of other cities I've looked at. I've also looked at U of Oregon, U of Florida, and Florida State. I currently live in Alabama, and while the in-state tuition is enticing, you could not pay me enough to touch U of Alabama with a ten-foot pole. I moved here for school and I want to GTFO as soon as possible.

Where else should I be looking? I'll have a 3.2 GPA when I graduate. Not as high as I'd like it to be, but I've been interning for this agency for two years and have had all the responsibilities of a full-time employee. This was no ""go get my coffee and dry cleaning"" internship. I've been LSAT practice testing around 172-175.

The smallest college is about 4,000 students, the next is about 15,000, with most being around 20,000-30,000 students. Tuition for decent private colleges is typically at least $25,000 a year. OOS tuition at CUNY colleges is about $14,000 a year, and my parents have agreed to pay $15,000 wherever I go. I'd have tuition covered, but I know the cost of living in NYC is pretty crazy.

I was looking into College of Staten Island. I feel like being a small town southerner I might be able to get used to living in Staten Island easier than I would in the actual city, the college is the perfect size for me, and they offer a lot of research and internship opportunities for my major which NC colleges don't.

So what's your opinion? Do you think it would be worth it, cost wise and stress wise, to try to make the move?

It seemed as if they were saying that if John Smith and I send our resumes to this employer, according to them, if neither of us include our citizenship, my resume would be skipped over, and John's would get looked over.

The guy wasn't a real professor, just a Teacher's Assistant.  I was doing great, but he failed me because I forgot to put a quote in my paper in quotations; without the """" signs it came across as blatant plagarism.  I begged him to reconsider my honest mistake but nothing came of it.  I was on academic probation already (i had a rare dyslexic condition which doesn't allow me to learn the same way most people do, but i wasn't diagnosed back then..hence the bad grades), and failing this class was the last straw.  The TA never admitted to any wrong doing, while knowing my situation.  I'll never forget the smirk on his face when the dean made his decision (he took his TA's side) and the university booted me out, stripped me of financial aid for a year.

I was holding down two jobs and an unpaid internship at the time, while taking care of my sick father and younger brother.  He passed away soon after I got kicked out and my world went spiralling down.  I became a recluse, alone and felt like a failure for a whole year before I got my act back together.  I went to a local community college.  Got my jobs back, and also started putting my little brother through college.

I am now a distinguished film maker, and had I been weaker in the mind, would have comitted suicide instead.  So I email this guy with the most vile things imaginable ever two months to remind him that his smallest action, due to his ego, could have had a major negative impact on the lives of my baby brother and other family.

Moral, don't be ego centric.  Don't take life too strictly.  If someone makes a small mistake by accident, don't go too hard on them.  But don't let anyone abuse you.  And if they do, make sure you TELL them that.

I have to leave some details vague, so I apologize in advance.

I am a student at a large university in the northeast, and my program requires that I must get ""professional experience"" in my field. I was offered what I thought would be an unpaid internship at a local publication, which would fulfill the ""professional experience"" requirement. I didn't find out until after I accepted the internship that since the publication is a private business and not a non-profit, I couldn't intern there without getting paid OR receiving class credit due to federal labor laws. So I had to register this internship as an independent study for class credit, amounting to an extra ~$1200 on my tuition. 

I know I could have backed out of this, but my professor had helped me get this internship (he was unaware of the details about it being paid/unpaid/having to register it) and I felt cornered into doing it.

Anyway, for the internship, I have to produce content for this publication that they will distribute in their weekly magazine and online site. Part of me feels like this violates item #4 of the [Dept. of Labor's Test for Unpaid Interns](http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs71.pdf), which reads:

and on occasion its operations may actually be impeded;       

To throw salt on the wound, when I was at the office the other day, I was digging around and found that the publication DOES have a paid internship program, that I was not made aware of. 

I'm really frustrated that these details were not made clear to me when I agreed to do it and I'm frustrated that this private company will in essence be making money off of content *I paid to give them*. What can I do? I feel like an idiot already, so please be kind. 

**TL;DR: I accepted an internship at a private company, and was not told that I would have to register it for course credit, which amounts to $1200 on my tuition. The company is profiting off of my work that I am paying to give them.**"

I'm an computer science undergrad and to be completely honest, I have NO IDEA what to expect after graduation ( a little more over a year left). I was wondering for all those professionals in relevant careers, could you shed some light on titles, and descriptions of what I could possibly be doing? And what are the things expected from a C.S graduate from a company's stand point? are knowing algorithms important? Should I expect agile, waterfall? Understand Prim's? What should I know?

And as professionals, what do you like best about your environment? And if you could, what would you change?

I'm hoping to receive information that would help me have a better understanding and ultimately better leverage in attaining a career.

I would love have an internship or even be someone's 'apprentice'. That'd be nice in San Diego."

The latter has a nasty habit of undermining my authority (that I am now putting in over-time to recover) in the classroom, chews me out whenever I'm wrong (and even more so when I'm not but she THINKS I am) and failing to communicate important things regarding my lessons or units.

Most RECENT example: We are in week 5 of the semester and I'm in week 3 of teaching (but I've been here since August as part of an internship). Apparently, we are supposed to spend usually 3 but no more than 4 weeks on the first unit in a writing class and I'm heading into the 5th week. There are 20 extra days this semester so I figured I needed to stretch my units to make up for that time. Good, right? Students get more time to work.

I showed her my plan for this unit OVER A MONTH AGO and she said it was great. She never once said or implied that I was taking too long with it. Not. Once. This afternoon while we were working in the classroom together she mentioned that I was wasting time working on the current project. 

WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THIS A MONTH AGO WHEN YOU SAW HOW LONG MY UNIT WAS GOING TO BE?!?!?! I think it makes her feel better about herself to point out what she considers serious mistakes on the behalf of others.

I'm tired of being at fault for ignorance and poor communication.

What do I do? I'm biting the bullet currently. Weather the storm. But I'm scared to ask for her help because her superiority complex is very off-putting and so far she hasn't been of help. 

The situation is made even more difficult with the fact that this person is a very old friend of my mom. She's known me since I was born. My parents know and understand. They advised me not to tell anyone ""Just because it's the right thing to do doesn't mean you should do it,"" they said. It can get me into hot water, I understand. 

But I feel like an abused kid.

I've e-mailed the university coordinator for English ed. She hasn't replied. 

4 of the 8 hours each day I am in Hell.

The first type of interview starts out with questions about me and why I chose that particular company to apply to, followed by one or two logic puzzles to understand how I problem solve and then more general questions about how I would implement a program for scenario A, B etc. This type of interview I like and understand.  However more often I get into this type of interview: I hand over my resume and my GPA get circled, followed by questions like ""What is the difference between a concrete and abstract class?"" or ""What is polymorphism?"" or ""What is an object?"" You get the idea.  Questions that have text book definitions that I've memorized over the years but have little to do with my abilities as a programmer, my intelligence, or my work ethic as an employee. So my question is this, why do you ask these sorts of questions *as the only questions of the interview*?  I feel that if I miss a few out of maybe two dozen of these questions, you've learned nothing about me.  You've learned that I have canned answers that are shot off when asked."

I‚Äôm mostly doing this because at the moment, I feel like I dont have any other people to talk to. My girlfriend broke up with me over the weekend and I‚Äôm still having a hard time with it (obviously). Prior to all of this everything was going pretty normal for our relationship. Granted we were doing the long distance thing but we‚Äôve been together in a serious relationship for 3+ years. We basically lived together for a year till I moved back home to pursue audio engineering. We seen each other almost at least once a month since I‚Äôve done that whether it be the weekend or over a week long visit. This girl was the girl that I really thought I would marry and spend the rest of my life with.

The week leading up to the Friday that this happened was very different than usual. I knew she had a busy schedule coming up so every time she would blow me off by saying she was ‚Äútoo busy‚Äù I didn‚Äôt think a lot of it. But it got to the point where I decided to tell her that we would just talk on Friday since it was the end of the week and we both weren‚Äôt busy then. Deep down I could feel we were going to have an argument about something.

Friday came along and we finally got to talking and right away I could hear it in her voice, something that was really going to tear me up was about to happen. When the words came out of her mouth of her telling me she wanted to break up and be single for a while, I don‚Äôt even know, it was one of the worst feelings I‚Äôve ever felt. 

To turn the next 7 hours that we talked about it short. She basically is doing this because she feels we are going down separate paths. She has always been in honors classes through high school and is currently going to ASU doing a double major in Psychology and English and is doing a LGBT research study. Me on the other hand, I made mistakes in high school and ended up having to finish it in an independent studies program. I went to the Conservatory of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, an audio engineering specific school in Arizona. Lived out there for a year and moved back to California to pursue and internship at a studio. Being 21, I‚Äôve never had a ‚Äúreal‚Äù job which is something I regret, but plan on changing that in the coming weeks. Anyway, because of that, she explained that she had been thinking a lot these past few weeks that she has felt unsatisfied with this relationship in that, we're not on the same page with compatibility on motivation and working and goals in our life. She wants to be single for a while and do things independently and wants me to figure things out and do things for myself. She says she doesn't want to be with anyone else and doesn't plan on anything and that she still loves me and doesnt want to lose me. We've spent way too long building this relationship, to just throw it away over something that I honestly believe can be figured out. She doesn't want it figured out together. I've explained many times that we can do this independently and together at the same time. 

She‚Äôs tried to convince me that in addition to doing this for herself, she‚Äôs doing this BECAUSE of how much she cares about me. As of right now, I told her to take the rest of the month to let things sink in for the both of us and we‚Äôll talk some time around then. She has non refundable tickets to fly out here in March, I really want her to come out here then to see if we can talk things out in person because all of this happened over the phone.
I have to at least try a little bit to save something I feel very confident would still work. I understand a lot of the concerns she has but I think she‚Äôs being overly logical about them and not feeling what overall makes her happy. She has been my closest friend for 5 years. I can‚Äôt just let go. "

I'm a very passionate student and love absolutely every part of my CS schooling so far. I hope to one day either start my own company or work with someone in starting their own. My school is research-oriented and don't promote starting your own company so experience with a startup would be a great asset to me and to solidify my intended career path. My top goal for a job next summer would be to work at a startup in the Bay Area but this goal brings some problems:

1. It's expensive to get to the Bay Area and apartment prices are ridiculous (compared to our average here). I'm not the wealthiest student in the world. I would love take a net loss for the summer just for the experience but I can't afford it.

2. Being in the upper midwest offers very little for CS-type internships other than the few ""throw you in a cubicle and make documentation"" positions.

What would be nice, for me, is a remote internship (or to have enough relocation assistance or pay to help disperse the cost of moving for the summer). The problem there is not many people advertise these kinds of jobs. I've inquired with a few companies but many are looking for in-house interns and don't offer any relocation assistance.

Does anyone here know of any good leads for a remote internship for the summer?

**edit**: I am still applying for internships that offer relocation. I'm just having a hard time finding them in the field/skill set that I am compatible with."

I'm a Scottish student, who has been offered an internship in Florida for 8 weeks in June and July, once that is finished I'll have 2 weeks at the end to travel around Florida.

(firstly, we have decided to just stick to Florida so we can take our time, rather than linking internal flights to other cities)

We are planning to rent a kind of minivan thing that we can sleep in, in a campsite where we can, or in carparks etc - is that an ok way to do it? We are looking at about $500 a week for the rental (including insurance).

Since I'm going to be in America for 10 weeks, I'd quite like to get a pay as you go SIM, but would like to have data. Is this possible? What about tethering, I heard US phone companies hate it...?

Finally, is there anywhere in Florida you would recommend I see? I'm going to post in r/Florida as well, so I'll get some tips there.

Any other tips for a newbie (to America) traveler?

We are both up for roughing it, and I've been reading plenty of blogs about saving money when you are traveling, so we should be fine there :)

Thanks guys!

pegfk,12,2012-02-07,Girlfriend being told all guys in long-distance relationships cheat,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/pegfk/girlfriend_being_told_all_guys_in_longdistance/,"I've (male, 25) been with my girlfriend for a year (female, 22) after meeting at our University. After four months together I moved to her hometown for a summer internship while she completed her final classes and graduated. We visited eachother bi-weekly throughout, made more convenient by family living close to either end of the trip for both parties. I've returned to the University to complete my final year and she has moved back home. I've been hired full-time and will be moving back to her home-town when I graduate. In the meantime she has entered the police academy. We intend to move back in together once I start my full-time job which coincides to her completion of the academy. 

So, enter my dilemma. We're both aware that she's essentially fresh-meat in a class of very few females and very many men. Today one of the men from her class dropped the idea that all guys in long-distance relationships cheat. There have been no real bumps in the road in the relationship so far, however the idea planted enough doubt that my girlfriend asked whether I had cheated. 

After reassuring her, my response was that there are many guys with no self-control when it comes to things. Alcohol, drugs, women, gambling, etc. The long-distance cheating claim can be a pretty common assumption to those lacking self-control in that department. I also pointed out that she's beautiful and amazing and sexy and if I were in a class with her I would try to put some doubt in her long-term relationship and get her single too. It's always good to look at what someone might have to gain when they try to offer unsolicited advice or commentary. I reiterated we both knew she'd get hit on, a lot, when she entered the academy and should keep that in mind. Told her that I'm a lucky man and the time until we're living in the same city again is flying by. 

I feel good about today, but I have no clue what the next thing she'll be told might be. She's pretty good about deflecting when she gets hit on, but the manipulative approach has me a bit uneasy. 

Anyone have any advice on better solidifying my position? I feel I may need to preemptively undermine ideas he might drop into her ear in the future.

Thanks!

**TL;DR**: My long-distance girlfriend asked if I've ever cheated on her. Apparently a guy from her class expressed to her how all guys in long-distance relationships cheat (with the implication that she might want to be open to the idea). Looking for advice on the situation."

What should I do?,Triggermike86,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/pe74g/hey_raccounting_i_have_been_laid_off_since/,"So, I have been laid off since November. I was working at an insurance company as a staff accountant for about a year. We hired an intern and shortly after training him, I was let go. I knew layoffs were possible since they were losing money, but I did not expect to go. I'm currently looking for a job, and I have had no luck. I am currently with two temp agencies and in contact with my University's career center. 

I have about a year of experience as an accounting intern for a gas company. I have a year of experience at a small CPA firm doing taxes. A year as a royalty accountant at a clothing company, and now I have 9 months worth of experience as a staff accountant for an insurance company. Does anyone have any advice on what I should do from here?"
pe3ru,15,2012-02-06,"The Love of Ownership: Chapter 9, Work",notjustathowaway,BDSMerotica,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMerotica/comments/pe3ru/the_love_of_ownership_chapter_9_work/,"I woke up horny, not surprising as the toy in my pussy gave the feeling of there being something inside me, which I loved, but it wasn't stimulating, which was making me frustrated. The longer I wore it, the more I regretted complaining like that. I knew my punishment was deserved, but I hated it anyway. After getting ready I knelt next to the door, waiting for Master to finish the breakfast I had made for Him. He ate quickly and took my leash off the table, clipping it on me, then walking out the front door. He then turned to the left, forcing me to conceal a sigh of relief. Master usually took the bus to work, which was down the street to the right, but his truck was just to the left. I was happy that he had the decency to not parade me around on the bus. Most people didn't care, and some who rode the bus with master often knew about our relationship, but I didn't want to publicly share the fact that I was being paraded around on a leash while in a low cut blouse and pencil skirt.

Master drove quickly to work and pulled into His reserved spot at the company. He was the founder and CEO of His small software company, which allowed Him certain privileges, such as a reserved spot and twenty four hour access to the building. He used His access privileges to open the building and usher me in. The security guard at the desk smiled at Master and called out across the lobby. ""Hey, Boss, I didn't know it was bring your pet to work day, I would have brought mine!"" I recognized his voice immediately. It was Lee, a nice guy a little older than Master, whom We had met at one of the BDSM events we go to on occasion. His pet, Alex and I had hit it off, and we started hanging out in casual setting. When the electronics store that Lee worked at went under, Master had offered him a security desk job working for Master's company. Master had given him identical hours with better pay and benefits, so Lee was very grateful, and always acted professional when others were around, but when it was just the two of them, with or without me, they were much more relaxed.

""Nah, Lee, pet here got in trouble last night, so she's getting desk duty today."" 

""Alright, Boss, I'll give you the early light if someone comes in for you.""

""Thanks, Lee.""

""My pleasure, Sir."" I winced at Lee calling Master 'Sir,' That was my title for Him. I knew my jealousy was unfounded, as anyone could be called 'Sir' but when it was my Master, I wanted to be the only one to use it.

With Lee also being in the community, it allowed Master a little bit of extra piece of mind, as Lee would alert Master long before His secretary would, allowing Him to conceal me and refocus on business. There were only three people who worked for master that knew His secret, and all of them were salary, and I'm sure could get away with murder as long as Master was in charge.

We were in the elevator when Master spoke again. ""I just got a message from the man I had a Eleven o'clock with, apparently he's picked up a bug, and won't be able to make it today, which means that you will belong to me all day.""

I knew that meant he would be spending the day at his desk. Master normally worked in the trenches with the rest of his team, but on occasion would take a day to work on the more corporate side of his company, so him spending all day hidden in the office wouldn't arouse suspicion.

We walked in and he unlocked his office, leading me inside. His preference for modern style wasn't shown in this room, as he had decided to go with a steam punk theme. He ushered me under the strong oak desk, and attached my collar to a short chain hanging under the desk, he wound up my leash and stashed it in the hidden compartment under the desk. Master had a fondness for concealment, so it didn't surprise me that when he opened the drawer under his desk and fiddled with some unseen controls, I heard the hissing of steam and the hum of motors. I knew the steam was entirely for effect, but the hums came from the three monitors and a computer that were expertly hidden inside this desk. It had taken Master almost a year to complete the desk, but once completed, it was quite the work of art.

He then unzipped his pants and let his shaft flop out before beginning to work on his computer.

I knew what my job was, and out of fear of reprimand, I began to play with his pulsing meat. With my hands bound behind me I could only use my mouth, trying to slowly tease Master's shaft to hardness. The stiffer He got, the easier it was for me to slowly fellate Him. I could hear Him surfing the net above me, going through His daily websites, watching His Tuesday videos, then with a sigh I heard Him click over to actual work. Now He was typing away on some spreadsheet, probably a financial document. Either way, I could tell He was close, so I readied myself, brought my soft pallet up and took His full length into my throat. Swallowing softly I could feel Him grunt as I sucked the orgasm directly from His rod.

He came hard in my throat, His hot sperm coating my insides as it dripped into my stomach. I had to resist the gag reflex that appeared as His cock pulsed in my mouth. I slowly brought my head up, His tip now sitting on my tongue. I lapped at any cum that hadn't poured down my throat, and slowly cleaned my spittle and His cum off of His softening cock.

At this point, I wanted so badly to cum, my legs futilely rubbing together, hoping that somehow I could steal some pleasure from the evil device inside me.

He sighed with His orgasm, not seeming to take His attention off of the computer. I unintentionally whimpered lightly. I didn't like to be ignored, and hated even more when my hard work wasn't recognized. Seeming to hear me, even over the music He had been playing, He finished a line of text and reached under the table, stroking my cheek lightly before going back to work on His computer. I hummed happily, nuzzling into the side of His knee.

The rest of the day continued in such a fashion, Master occasionally pushing His meat against my cheek, me pleasuring him to orgasm, cleaning Him off and then laying back against His knee.

Suddenly I heard a knock on Master's office door. He called the person in. ""Here you go sir, an order of the general, a side order of fried rice, and two sides of pot stickers, plus a large mountain dew and a large sprite.""

It was one of the interns, he didn't seem to be questioning why Master got two drinks. They had been trained well to follow orders and only ask questions if it would make them smarter or more efficient.

He left quickly, probably to deliver food to the other employees. Master set the take out box full of pot stickers in front of me. He knew that the ten pot stickers would be more than enough for me, and he set one of the sodas next to it, leaving the straw in easy reach of my mouth.

This brought me to the assumption that I wasn't going to be eating with my hands so I thanked him quietly and picked up one of the pot stickers, finding it surprising easy to eat without my hands.

The rest of the day was uneventful until we headed home. Master used the back elevator this time, which meant no one saw us slip out, Master leading me out on the leash."

pdzhw,7,2012-02-06,Dressing like Barney Stinson? And a really dumb suit question...,Blackbalisong42,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/pdzhw/dressing_like_barney_stinson_and_a_really_dumb/,"Hey guys, I'm 19 and have never really worn suits or anything more fancy then polos and such (I know, I know) but now that I'm going to be looking for internships and will be having interviews and such, I'm looking to acquire some good clothes. Again, I've never really worn suits before so I'm confused as to what I should be looking at, and of course I'm going to research and delve into the FAQs before asking a general question, I just have a thought, regarding weather there are different 'kinds.' 

In the show How I Met Your Mother, the character of Barney always wears a suit, as is customary, but to me it seems like his are always more...natural? Or comfortable? When I think of 'a suit' and see a lot of business people on the streets, they seem really stiff and heavy feeling and serious. Barney is always wearing a suit but they seem more natural and light and easily to live in. I guess what I'm saying is his seem to be more fitting for everyday life in a setting where you can be really business like, but they don't seem as 'official,' if this makes any sense. 

I'm sorry this is such a dumb thing to ask, but I'm wondering if there are differences between what he wears and what a 'regular suit' is, or if its just different styles? I notice a lot of his ties are the thin kind, so that probably helps the look, but just in general, are there differences? Thank you and again sorry for the ignorance.

And btw I'd like to go more for the Barney look when I get to that point, so thats the direction I'm going."

pdwa8,5,2012-02-06,My girlfriend has multiple voices/personalities that can randomly take control of her. How can the poor get treatment?,MultiPersonalityHelp,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pdwa8/my_girlfriend_has_multiple_voicespersonalities/,"   When we first started dating, she mentioned that as a child, she heard voices. At first, the voices were nice, but still scared the hell out of her. She told her mother, and was essentially ignored. This led to a deep resentment to her mother. According to her mother, this was just a phase and it would go away. It really only got worse. Eventually, they told her to do things like kill her sister and kill herself (she didn't, but this really bothered her). After some time apparently they went away, and she doesn't really remember how it happened.


   As we were dating, I noticed she had odd memory problems. She was often so forgetful with basic things. Like forgetting to throw out paper plates, even after she walks by them on her way to the trash. Or forgetting to think about the consequences of her actions. When I asked her why she drank orange juice, even though we both know it upsets her stomach, she replies she didn't think about it, or she forgot. And yet she does this on a weekly basis.


   What really started to concern me was these bizarre episodes she had when she feel asleep. One night, I was in bed with her while playing xbox. She drifted off after a few minutes, and then woke up. While awake I could tell something was very different. She kept asking questions about things that had happened months ago. ""Why aren't you playing mass effect 2 anymore? Where is our old blanket?"" I hadn't played mass effect in 2 months, at this point I sold it. It was at this point I realized she was in some sort of state of mind from two months back. She also acted... ""funny"". Almost as if she was high. She laughed about everything like it was a joke. Finally I convinced her to go back asleep. After sleeping for no longer than a minute, she woke up and had no idea what happened. She looked at me as if I was crazy when I asked her what she did.


   Fast forward a few months later she had another episode. This time I got a call in the middle of the night, with her frantically crying saying she had no idea where she was at. I had just got off the phone with her an hour earlier. She was at home laying in her bed, we talked for a while, and then she went to sleep. So I calmed her down and told her to turn on her laptop. She asked how I knew that she had laptop in front of her. About a month prior to this, she bought a laptop, and switched rooms with her mother. I mentioned this and she said she had no idea what I was talking about. She told me the last thing she remembers was falling asleep while I was playing mass effect (Yeah just like that last episode, and later I find out this mass effect night was one of the most memorable and peaceful nights she had).


   About a year later, I start to see more episodes in a semi frequent pattern. The difference this time is they were... a bit disturbing. All of these ""disturbing"" episodes seemed to be her response to extreme stress. For example, we were talking about her stomach pains, and how we really need to get this checked out (we suspect ulcers, but we don't know. I am poor and in college, and she works for minimum wage with no health insurance). Talking about this REALLY bothered her and caused her to start crying hysterically, cover her ears, and then just pass out. When she woke up she asked me why her face was all wet and why there was snot all over her nose.


   The next episode was the most bothersome. Again it started with her getting stressed out about something, she passed out, but then something different happened. Instead of the normal passing out, it was a BLANK stare. And I mean like she was dead. I tried to get her attention, hugging her, told her I was here for her. I begged for an answer. When she ""awoke"" into her odd episodic state, she began crying like... well I could only image someone crying like this if they were getting raped or beaten. Then she passed out for about 5 seconds, did the blood curdling crying again, and then stopped. I tried telling her I was here for her. And she repeated this, ""no you will beat me up, you  are gonna hurt me."" Just to clarify, I have never hit or hurt her before And as far as I know, no one has every physically hit or hurt her. So I tried asking her who was going to hurt her, and I was here to help. She passed out again, and then woke up. After all of this was over, again she had no memory of the incident.


   From here I suspected she had been raped, or hurt at some point. So when she had another passive episode, I began talking to her in her episodic state. I find out that a neighbor would rest his hand on her vagina as a child, which really bothered and confused her, but nothing that caused that bizarre screaming and crying before. I asked her if anyone hurt or hit her, and she said no one did. After she woke up, she said she hadn't remembered that for years. It was only after I talked to her in this state that she remembered it.


  I find out for the past few months that my girlfriend has been ""confused"". She wasn't sure if she loved me less, or how she felt about me (we had been dating for over 4 years at this point and were pretty committed with each other. In fact as far as I knew, things couldn't have been any better). She tells me her confusion began a few months earlier (coincidentally when these bizarre episodes started happening). I ask her what problems does she have with our relationship and she couldn't name any. She said she just felt less for me, but that she still loved me. And even then she couldn't really explain it. Her most common description was ""confused"". I take her out to eat, to the mall, and buy her a new shirt to try and show her I care. That night, we have a long discussion about our relationship. I tell her I love her just as much as I always have, but if she wants to leave, she can. And that she needs to do whatever makes her happy. She said she was still confused, but that she loved me and she wanted to stay. She says she thought that cheating on me would bring some spark back but dismissed it as a horrible idea (she even called talked this idea through with her friends, her sister, and me. Everyone told her this was a terrible idea). 


  The next day, she cheated on me. She didn't just cheat. She had been planning this for about a week. With a guy I suspected she liked. We even talked about how I was getting jealous, but she promised she would never do anything and nothing was going to happen. That week, she made sure to delete all her texts, change her facebook password, and delete all her facebook conversations. I talk to her about it and she said she didn't know what happened. Even the guy she cheated with said she shouldn't do this and she had too much to lose. She thought this would somehow help us. But that the more she talked about it, the more it was getting buried. She couldn't even recall some common details of what happened.


  I was very hurt, but something didn't add up. I told her I was giving her a second chance. I still love her. So I didn't want to throw everything away. It just seemed so drastically out of character. We have been best friends for 6 years before we started dating and now have been dating for over 4 years. We have literally talked about everything. We are both very open with our problems, we made it clear that we both love and respect each other too much to cheat. And overall seemed too in love to ever do that. While in bed that night, what she did was wearing on me, and the guilt hit her. She again had an episode. But one like I have never seen before. This time it wasn't her, my girlfriend now described herself as betty. 


*Betty - As happy as a human can be. Very playful and fun, almost like a 4 year old little girl. Will do the commands of John under pressure. Even ""evil"" things like holding a knife over someone.

*Tabitha - The sad one. In a constant depression. Does show signs of being happy if I try and make her laugh and tell her I love her. She is the creative one. Writes poetry, paints, sings. But overall comes out when sad, and depressed.

*Tracy - The pure sexual being. When tracy is out, she goes straight for genitals. No matter what the conversation or mood is, if tracy has control of my girlfriend, she tries to have sex. In public, private, anywhere and everywhere. We could be both be crying letting out our feelings. Tracy might randomly take control and grab my penis.

*John - Originally described as the evil one. The one who hates everything and everyone. He changed into a ""bro"". Constantly refers to me as bro. Id a man personality, unlike the other personalities. Likes video games, sports and women (even says he is attracted to my girlfriend's friends). Complains about the other personalities all being women and is bothered by living with them.

*Ally - The terrified one. She comes out rarely. She RUNS from me or anyone else. There is no speaking to her, no reasoning with her. She cries and runs. Only comes out to show my girlfriend's terror.

*My girlfriend - Each personality seems to just be a part of her, but taken to the extreme. When my girlfriend is in control it's just like any other person. Able to show all emotions. Although, I have noticed other personalities ""bleed"" into each other. For example, if we talk about her cheating on me, Tabitha comes out and is very depressed. Randomly John might come out and say, ""Sorry for doing that bro, these women see what they wanted and just went for it. No one spoke up and stopped it.""


  I learned that John was the one causing my girlfriends pain and trouble. He is the one who was ""beating her up"" and was the one making her cry in those episodes. He, apparently, is also the one her makes her do bad things to hurt herself (she was in a bad relationship before me, her ex called her fat, ugly, but according to betty, John made her stay. Also is the one her makes her drink orange juice to hurt her). After a half an hour of talking, betty mentions John has been planning a party to get all the other personalities back. John was ""buried"" away inside my girlfriend. But somehow escaped through a hole. But he never left like the others. He also forces betty to do things. Betty said john forced her to ""kill"" my girlfriends conscience, so it wouldn't stop John from doing bad things.


  After learning this, John starts yelling at betty and takes control of my girlfriend. He says he hates me, and my girlfriend doesn't need me. I say, ""She said that she wants to stay with me,"" he replies, ""you don't know what she wants, I do."" After this, it goes back and forth between betty and john, but as this happens I try to befriend john. After a few hours it works. He transforms from this evil controlling person. To a ""bro"". We start bonding by complaining about women, talking about adult swim and video games. From here on he stops being controlling, and well evil. Betty tells me my girlfriend has been sleeping the whole time.

  Finally my girlfriend wakes up and takes control, again, has NO IDEA what happened. I explain all of this, and she realizes her ""voices"" from her childhood are back. What is different this time, is they don't terrify her. They are more like... siblings? As the night goes her I meet all the other personalities (I guess the party happened?). And so far, we get along. The only other information I can give about them is they are all in her head speaking at anytime. They can all for the most part hear what I say no matter who has control. They do randomly take control of her, so I fear how this will affect her interactions with other people and work (she works in retail).

**tl;dr. My girlfriend has episodes where she doesn't remember anything. Had voices in her head as a child. All of a sudden these voices can now take control of her. I also suspect them having to do with her cheating on me.**


Most importantly, how can we seek treatment or help if we have no financial support from our families? She works getting minimum wage, and I am jobless seeking an internship while in college. I literally have no idea what to do. Nothing in life has prepared me for a situation like this.

Any help on what's going on with my girlfriend is greatly appreciated.

Any help on how to deal with this is greatly appreciated.

And I have just been cheated on by the love of my life, and my best friend. Although I have gladly taken her back, any help coping with what happened will help."

I consider myself a bright individual and can tackle on any challenging problem presented before me.

I am currently 23 and working as a staff accountant.  Previous jobs were cashier, accounting intern, bookkeeper.  I started gaining experience early and thus was able to land a stable job right now.  It has been 14 months now since I first started.

However, what can I look forward to in my career progression?  Will being a dropout have a profound effect on my future opportunities?  Do they HAVE to know I dropped out?  Or can I just leave it as a vague entry on my future resume (Attended so and so college during years 2007-2011).

I'd really like to become a controller one day to oversee a team of my own, perhaps I can stay in the property management field?  It pays pretty well on the management end.

Any tips/advice/personal experience will be greatly appreciated!

My BIGGEST issue, I have a chronic hereditary disease, ankylosing spondilitis. I affected me all throughout university, It probably wasn't smart going to school when dealing with immense pain 24/7. With the health care system in Canada I was diagnosed overseas at 20 years old (now 22), the damage to my body was done though, it started when I was 15-16. Anywho, should I mention this? If I should in what context/situation.

I would like to know some standard things that I should not do, besides not asking what compensation/benefits the job comes with and such. 

I've prepared some written professional references, and all contact info of job experience mentioned on my CV. Compiled 4-5 questions on a blank page to ask at the interview, when given the chance of course. 

I've brushed up on different experiences from working in a team throughout labs/project management courses/other class projects. My knowledge without looking back into course materials is a little fuzzy, but before the interview I will review some main concepts about circuit design/physics/programming (java, C#/C++).

Thank you for any help you could offer, if I get the internship i shall bake you cookies!"
ph0q5,14,2012-02-08,Questions about programmer resumes,Satros,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ph0q5/questions_about_programmer_resumes/,"I've read a lot of guides and tips on creating a good resume, including many specifically geared toward people in the programming/tech industry. Not matter what though, they all seem to fall short in a few areas because programmers usually have a large amount of technical skills to convey and may also have personal projects in addition to normal experience.

I was hoping someone with experience in this could answer some questions for me. **Note that this is for Entry level**


* How should I organize skills? As programmers we have lots of different technical skills. Some categories of types of things I would like to list include Languages, Frameworks/Libraries, Desktop Software/IDEs/Source Control Systems, Web Software/CMS, and Operating systems. Should I just break them up like I just listed?

* How familiar do you have to be with a technology to list it under skills? For example I have used Javascript for some basic things on websites I've created as well as for a few projects in school. I understand the basics of it although I would probably have to look up some specifics time to time. I haven't done any huge projects in Javascript though, and I'm not as familiar with it as I am with Java for instance. Another example is I took a class where we used Prolog and Haskell pretty much the entire semester. I understand how the languages work conceptually and could write code to do some very basic things if needed, but I would still consider myself a ""beginner"" to these languages although I have some experience working with them. Would it be a good idea or bad idea to list these?
* Should display any personal projects on my resume? Remember right now since it is entry level my experience is very limited, I do have some website work, a software development internship, and some experience working in IT already. But besides that, I also do some freelance webdesign work, but I have no idea how to display it. Also in my spare time I run a small team that develops some server plugins for the game Minecraft, we use git and some of our projects are pretty big in size/deal with things like security/etc, so there is a somewhat professional side to it, would it make sense to add this? I could make a category for Personal projects or something perhaps, any feedback is helpful.


Any feedback is appreciated!"

I sometimes take off skills that aren't relevant (e.g. the library software for a non-library job), and if the description is looking for recent graduates or seems like that's what they're looking for, I move my education to the top. I always send it as a .pdf unless otherwise requested. I also always include a cover letter custom-written to the job description expressing what I like about the company, qualities/experience I have that make me a good fit, and addressing any reason I may not quite be qualified.

I've been finding a lot of unpaid internships lately that I definitely feel more qualified for, but I'm not sure I want to go that route since I already did 3 while in school.

pgtov,5,2012-02-08,Choosing an MBA specialty for visa sponsorship,Crixs,japan,https://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/pgtov/choosing_an_mba_specialty_for_visa_sponsorship/,"Other than accounting, what MBA specialty, if any, do you think is recruited the most by companies (domestic or international) in Japan?

Reason being, like several other r/japan-posters, I'm in the process of organizing my life to find a job in Japan.  Studied abroad in 2007 with internships in translation and interpreting, graduated in 2009 from undergrad. with a degree in Japanese Studies. (I'm very aware of the uselessness of this degree in the business world.)  I'm around ÔºíÁ¥ö in level, and do sporadic work throughout the year as an interpreter. (I'm much more comfortable speaking with Japanese compared to sending endless e-mails.)

I've been working at a mortgage company in the states for almost two and a half years (2 years as a network engineer and now as an interactive project manager), and am now taking classes for my MBA, as I've read that visa sponsorship is easier when you have an ""industry-relevant education.""  

I have a background in IT from my two years as a network engineer, but work mostly with project management for web design and marketing now.

My MBA program has a track for international management, which I'm very interested in, but I'm worried about being able to market myself from this perspective.  Sure, I can pull the Project Management card, or even specialize in marketing, but are those skills going to be valuable to a Japanese company?

*I believe there is a high demand for accountants, but, as I am more of a creative type, the prospect of working as an accountant sounds as exciting as memorizing the stroke order of all the Joyo kanji backwards. 

**TL;DR** In your opinion, do you believe companies in Japan would hire an international management concentration MBA with a background in Project Management?

pgt3i,7,2012-02-08,What gives?,[deleted],MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/pgt3i/what_gives/,"The story (long but I hope you read it and give me some advice):

My parents got divorced in the sixth grade. The reason for the divorce after a long discussion about it just yesterday was one simple problem. One simple problem as to why my mother left my father. He would spend. He would spend more and more giving my brother and I everything we ever asked for. He made 130k a year relatively and forced him and my mom to work overtime. I knew no better at that age. After many attempts of my mom flat out saying that if he doesn't stop she would leave him... he didn't stop. He has a problem.. one that isn't separation worthy in my opinion. It needed professional help... one that my mother just announced to me that she didn't try to get. She said that she didn't try hard enough and gave up. Those were her words. Before I go further I will say this. Neither one of them is even close to a bad person: my mom worked 3 jobs to support herself and most of her family since she is the oldest.. my father is 57 and works 5 - 5 doing manual labor fixing boats, etc. for people.. with terrible arthritis etc. Both of them show nothing but love for those around them. They would quite literally take their clothes off their back to help someone.. they both are the image of hard work. They have given me everything. They leave nothing for themselves and give everything to others. Yet, they get looked down upon, treated harshly by friends who have turned their backs on them, and are just ridiculously unhappy. After all they do, do they not deserve some sort of happiness? This is the question I try to answer for them everyday.

When my parents divorced my Dad still loved my mother. He still loves her whether he admits it or not. Two times I have ever seen him cry was the day he told me that my house was being repossessed on my 17th birthday including the car that he had given me and when, at my cousin's (recent) wedding, he saw my mom show up. He walked outside, and I could see him through the window. My mother started seeing this guy after they divorced (too soon, way too soon). He is a wealthy man, respectable, while at the same time, emotional manipulative and disrespectful. He has a drinking problem. She has been off and on with him, I believe, 3 times? I moved her out of his house one night after I get a phone call from my mom saying that the cops just came by because he wanted her out of the house. So I came over, the cops weren't there. His daughter was consistently cussing at my mother throughout the process, calling her a cunt, etc. That word , to this day, doesn't come out of my mouth for this sole reason. As I was moving out, he was mumbling comments about my mom... you do not say shit in front of me degrading her in any way. It is despicable. I will beat somebodys ass if they give remarks like he did. When he did that, I will admit, made a mistake. I called him out in his own house which is, in fact, disrespectful. He said that he would kill me if I did it again blah blah blah... moved her out of the house. Dad helped her get moved in and everything... and then she just goes right back to him again... same situation... and again (currently). He seems to be better, but she is completely unhappy. She never wanted a cent and apart from vacations and a ring... she took NONE. Her life philosophy, which I get it from, is you work hard to get what you want. She got this from her mother when she said ""Never live outside of your means."" My mom tries to be completely independent as possible. She never tries to admit how unhappy she is. Same goes as my father. He will never talk to me about his problems which I wish he did. What I am getting to is that, she doesn't want to leave this man because everyone says she is about money. He is pretty wealthy, but he owns a family counseling business. This business is being tore up by the new policies with Obama in some sort of way I am not sure on. She doesn't want to leave him for two reasons : being completely alone and doesn't want people to think that she is leaving because of money. My mother is a beautiful woman. If she was getting money, you would know it. Her appearance is not at all what she wants, but she takes no money to go out and get her clothes that would make her feel good about herself.

My father fell apart when my mom left. He got overweight and then in a couple of years he became an alcoholic. He never ONCE, however, did anything that would harm me physically or personally say something he knew would upset me. He would help my mother whenever she needed it. She would come to him for help then go back to her boyfriend. She realizes this. She feels awful about this. They lived together with me my senior year in highschool so that they could save up for the money to get me there, help me get a computer, etc. Around a year or two before this, my dad got gastric bypass surgery. It made him lose 200 lbs, and he was able to function. He got his life back.

 My mother felt like my father was ""smothering"" her when we all lived together my senior year. He would always make sure he was home when she was, etc. This is just because he is batshit in love with the woman. Well, this just fueled his drinking even more then my mom started drinking. Seeing two wonderfully good people resort to those things is very upsetting. Despite all of this they still supported me, but I knew how they really felt. This started affecting me terribly.

Everyday seeing them sitting in the same room...I wanted nothing more for them than to get back together. I would give anything. Anything. My life if that is what it took. So I developed a serious depression. Went on prozac and was close to killing myself, but my parents took all of the sleeping pills, etc. out of the house when I was on the medication. Needless to say, we stopped that medication, but I still had the problem. I just thought to myself that once college came, which was only a couple months from then, that all of this would go away. It got worse. 

I graduated 4th in my class, 4.3 GPA, captain of my soccer team, National Honor Society President, BETA, etc., but yet I felt like that was not enough. I feel that nothing is never enough. I do not believe it is the case in what they believe in. But everyday I always tell myself that I can do better. I look and compare to how much better other people are doing.

I am currently enrolled at Virginia Tech. Freshman year was nothing but partying and getting used to the college life. I ended up with a 3.0 flat. My sophmore year came.. and this is where everything went downhill. I told my feelings to my doctor through email asking her what I should do one night. The next day, I had an 8 am which I went to. Without knowing, I went to the class with my phone turned on silent. The doctor had called me twice with no answer. She notified the police, and the police called me three times I think it was. I looked at my phone to see what time it is. I didn't recognize the number so I punched into Google. I see that it is the Blacksburg police department. Couple of minutes later, two cops show up and I walk out that back door so none of my friends would see me. Walked up to the officers and asked if they were looking for me. So I got in the cruiser (first time I have ever been handcuffed since it was protocol, they said that I could take the bus if I wanted) and I went to the station to talk to, I guess, a counselor. They put me in a week, basically, suicidal watch / help get out of depression clinic. The thing I came out with most of it is the mood stablizer I was put on lamictal. That has helped alot over the years. So I make it through my sophmore year and luckily I found a recruiter that through me a bone.

I am a Junior pursuing a degree in Computer Science w/ a 3.6 GPA. I just got back from a 7 month co-op with IBM that the recruiter gave me. I loved working there. While there, I had been seeing a psychiatrist (which was a clinic) mainly to get medicine and hopefully get some educational testing done. I got extended test times for my second semester Sophomore year, but I had to get testing in order to get it again as far as educational problems go. I have extremely bad anxiety which I feel I get from my mother. My psychiatrist at Tech thought that I may be experiencing all of this anxiety due to educational reasons. I feel terror and anguish when I take tests. This makes me feel inadequate since I can never finish on time which in turn makes me feel less intelligent. So, I ended up getting testing done, and I have been diagnosed with ADHD. I got prescribed adderall which has helped so much despite the critics that feel people abuse it. I am more focused, driven, and actually concentrate on something. This was all during my co-op. I enjoyed every minute of it. Yet I am still unhappy afterwards.

So now I go back to school. I am a Junior... taking 15 credits with a 9-5 MWF internship from home. I was so happy, but now that I have so much stuff to worry about... it still feels overwhelming. Yesterday, I got that feeling I had when things felt hopeless. All the good I have done to be ruined by worrying about tests, etc. Then speaking to my mother about all of this... I got into the discussion about Dad and what happened... and I am just down in the dumps. Had to take anxiety pills for the first time in a couple of months. I guess it is just when I asked her if she still loved my father she said she didn't know which got me all rattled. However, I know that she does. I know this by my cousins wedding I mentioned earlier... she drank a bit, but her and my father danced... she asked him to dance. There are no words to express how bad I want them to do that everyday if it were up to me. Afterwards, when I took her home that night, I asked her ""what did you think about you dancing with Dad""? She goes, ""To be honest, I haven't had that much fun in a long time. If he would have asked I probably would have went home with him.""Not one emotion could be stronger than what I had at that moment. I would like for them to get back together, but I do not want my mother to end up hurting my father again. 

What do I do? How do I overcome this anxiety of tests and homework that I consistently feel to the point where I feel like I want to throw everything I have worked for in life down the drain because I feel like it is not worth it? If I do something right I always think of how much better it could have been. Think of the Asian Dad meme ""A why not A+"" is my mentality.

Should I ask my father about he feels about my mother currently? Could I change their relationship? I know they are just right for each other. I would make sure Dads spending was alright.

Family is what I live for. It is the reason why I am here. I want to make my parents prouder than they are now. I need to get a job, and essentially, I need college to get a decent paying one. However, I do not know what I would do if I wasn't in college.

I have tried counseling, therapy, exercises, etc. I still come back to this feeling.

What do I do? Any advice? Make me feel better :("

I might have an opportunity at a company to get lots of RF practical experience, but it's in a location I wouldnt really want to live (being there for a summer is fine).  Any input on getting industry RF experience at a company I dont plan on going to after graduation vs working at a company I like more that doesnt have specific RF opportunities for me at this point (it would be more analog/digital design).  

Also, any advice on how to handle competing offers from companies?  How long can I ask one company to wait before responding to their off because I want to wait to hear back from another company as well.  What about negotiating pay?

I'm just looking for opinions on any of these questions, or anything that might be relevant.  I'm trying to find an internship that can help me learn a lot, and put me in a good position for jobs after graduation.  "

Firstly full disclosure, I work with Foodtree (well I am an intern here) and I am telling you about this because I'd like your help.

That said everything about this is free and should actually be of interest to the the food community!

We made an app that lets you tag pictures you take of food to the places you bought them or ate them (restaurant or store), as WELL as the places the food came from originally (if you know it) - the idea is to build a big map of where all the food we eat is coming from, and to be able to use some social networking to track down places to buy fresh seasonable and local things.

So all that said - I was hoping some of you guys would try it out for us? We are a super small company and literally every user is exciting to us! :D In particular we are trying a data experiment centered around Whole Foods Stores in North America... if you happen to live near by one, and could take the time to install our free app and go take some pictures of food - any food - there it would help us so much.

Here is the story to that and then I will ask the questions.

I started dating this girl last year while she was on an internship in D.C. I fell in love with her over the next three months. She was everything I wanted beautiful, smart, funny, and we had similar interests. Things got serious pretty fast and I went to her house for Thanksgiving and she came to my home for Christmas. We spent the Christmas break together but then her internship ended and she went back to her college the next semester. The next 4 months were a living hell. We broke up once but I convinced her to get back together with me and we continued our shaky relationship. In the summer, she decided to come live in D.C. and study for the LSAT. It was a great summer but in the Fall she had to return to school. I begged her we do not repeat what happened the previous semester. Sure enough we repeated the same kind of terrible relationship. I broke up with her in October but then we did this on again off again thing for about 3 months. We were fighting a lot in that time but there was one thing that really bothered me over our entire relationship. Her parents were the most demanding, over bearing parents I have ever met. I went to her house for Christmas and they treated her like she was 12. I had known her parents were 'helicopter' parents but I realized it was worse than I imagined. I wont get into too many specifics but there were many little things that she was not allowed to do. Her and I are both in our early 20's and they drive her to everything (like her LSAT test day). They will drive 6 hours just to take her to drive her a site one hour away. This meant that during our long distance relationship she could not drive to see me and I had to travel to her destination. It bothered me quite a bit and made me feel unneeded/wanted. We ultimately broke up and I know its for the best. 
Also as a side note:
I am having a hard time getting over this relationship.

How can I move on faster and come to terms with being single? 

Are all woman this dependent on their parents?

My father wants me to go to college to get an education, while I want to attend culinary school. I am still weighing my options though. Through a combination of FAFSA, grants, scholarships, loans, and parental suppport, money and tuition will not be a issue. 

So I've boiled it down to these possible choices. (In no particular order)
**1.**I attend culinary school right after graduation. Considering going into either the C.I.A., or the F.C.I. Both schools have reputable backgrounds. 
**2.**I attend college, and on the side, intern at a reputable local restaurant. Gaining a degree and experience by the time I finish college. (By choosing this route, I would forego culinary school, as I know time is of the essence in the culinary industry, and I would've learned almost everything I would need to know to work the line.)

**My question is: Which of the two choices puts me in a better standing to launch a culinary career? Which culinary school in more in-depth and give me more foundation in cooking? If I choose to go with the second choice, would only having worked in a kitchen and not having a formal culinary education hinder me in any way?**

She then goes off to an internship that she received at a theme park near Orlando. We continued talking, not as often because she is busier but nonetheless still talking.

I didn‚Äôt really take the news that well, I didn‚Äôt yell I just became very sad and we sort of talked it out to the point that I ‚Äúaccepted‚Äù it. Then we talked the next day, she says she still cares about me and that she loves me but she just wants to be friends.

Also before any of this happened I already bought tickets to go down for a week, I‚Äôm still planning on going down but what should I do? 

I guess my main question is, how should I go about keeping her in my life with a possibility of getting back together afterwards.  Should I try and go down next weekend?



**TL;DR**

GF went to internship for 8 months, month in she wants to go on break/breakup, sending very confusing signals. I still want to be with her, what should I do?

I'll try to answer questions the best I can, I do have class today, so I'll try my best. Thanks in advance."

pg3m3,2,2012-02-08,Aspiring digital designer advice?,CannibalCheesecake,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/pg3m3/aspiring_digital_designer_advice/,"I'm an undergraduate Computer Engineering major, which entails lots of computer science with some digital design and computer architecture thrown in. I've tried to keep my undergraduate curriculum as open as possible (courses listed below), but when I entered into an engineering internship, I was shocked at how little I was able to do. I was basically a technician, given a part and told to perform tests and verify functionality. I still have a year left of school (3 or 4 more quarters), but looking at the classes available to me, I'm afraid I'll be just as clueless when/if I go fulltime. My biggest complaint is that the professors periodically tell us 'this isn't exactly true, but it's been done this way for so long, and it works in this case'.

Some of my background, I've obviously been forced to take classes in chemistry, physics and calculus and linear algebra (managed to skip vector calculus, although I might take it later). In CS I've taken classes about OOP, Linux, pure mathematics, Data Structures and Algorithms in C++, Finite Automata, and GUI for Qt and Android. On the EE side, I've taken RLC circuit analysis, Signal Processing (Fourier/Laplace/Z Transforms, full of small 'lies'), elementary transistor analysis, and semiconductor physics (focused on Silicon, also full of small 'lies' and handwaving). Last but not least on the CE side, I've taken a class on combinatorial circuits, Verilog (sequential circuits), and am currently taking a class on Computer Architecture (with the design portion scheduled for next quarter). The architecture course is the most relevant course I've seen with discussion of good vs bad datapath design, but we're only focusing on MIPS, and we only cover fixed point arithmetic.

If my dream job is to eventually work in high speed VLSI digital design, what topics should I look to cover? Would graduate school be required? If so, should I attend graduate school immediately after my undergraduate and go into more debt, or wait to make some money and forget most of this material meanwhile? Thanks!"

I'm 23 year old student, majoring in civil engineering and im supposed to finish my BS this may. Slowly throughout the years i've been isolating myself from my friends and family for no reason in particular, i just had no motivation to interact with them. 

I've been on anti-depressants and sleeping pills for about 4 months now and i don't feel like they are having any effect on me. I've slept maybe 2 hours in the last 3 days and i dont feel sleepy, just exhausted... i just want to let go... It's 3:15am right now and i just feel nothing. just feel this primal void. Just emptiness.

Last Saturday i was pretty much forced to go to the ER because i've been having severe chest pains and my left arm regularly starts to feel numb or tingly... But the doctor couldn't come up with a diagnosis because a 23-year-old shouldnt be having these sort of symptoms. The only thing that showed up was that my blood pressure was a bit high... I also told him that i was diagnosed with clinical depression when he asked if i was diagnosed with anything. Probably thought that i was making shit up for the attention or something because after an IV to just lower my blood pressure, he just sent me on my way ant told me i was ok. He even said i shouldnt have to worry when i asked him if i should get checked out by a cardiologist or a specialist. While waiting for the doctor to give me this diagnosis, i was reflecting on all the things i would never get to do with my life. Have a career... Start a family... Fall in love... See the world... and oddly enough, i was ok with it... Right now i'm convinced that this is my body finally just letting go...

As i sat in the waiting room, i calmly jotted down on a paper pad that i had in my backpack my funeral arrangements. Decided to be cremated... half of the ashes spread in the ocean... the other half in the soil with a tree planted in it... Maybe i would finally make a mark on this world...

Ive been told thousands of times how smart i am, how much potential i have, how bright my future is... but i just dont care right now... the only thing that is keeping those pills out of my stomach is my mother... i wouldnt want her to go throught the pain of losing a child. and she lost her own mother almost 2 years ago... If it wasnt for her, i dont really think anyone would miss me. my friends' lives would go on, my family would continue to grow... i'm just here for the ride and i think im ready to get off the cart now.

And of course, no suicide story wouldnt be complete with the heartbreak story. I am really introverted with most people but when i finally trust someone, i am an open book. I wear my heart on my sleeve and so far its been trampled it's share. So far in the past 6 months ive been utterly rejected by 2 of the best people i could have ever met. I'll split them up into 2 stories to avoid confusion:

1. We've known each other for about 3 or 4 years but she had been in a long term relationship the whole time i knew her. I had found out that they had broken up just about a week before she was about to leave for an internship in Michigan for the summer, so i never really got to make any moves as soon as i found out. We met up when she came back in august and we really started hitting it off pretty great. hooked up, talked, all the good things. I told her upfront what i felt for her. little did i know, i was just another guy in a long line of rebound hook ups she was having because ""she had missed out on it so much"" in the last years. Flash forward to a couple of weeks ago. we where in an after party at her place and i was just chilling, trying to get over her so not showing much interest. halfway through the party she leans towards me and whispers ""you know that half of the people here think we're going to hook up tonight right?"" I was like ""Um...ok"". She replied with ""But youre not the one i want tonight"" Me, trying to be the nice guy told her ""if you want me to give you youre space, just say it"" And she just looked me dead in the eye and said ""...move"" This  made my heart hit the floor and i just went straight home without saying goodbye to anyone. i just wanted to be alone. Havent really spoken to her that much since.

2. This girl is a mutual friend that i met a couple of years ago but we kind of lost contact. We got back in touch i would say around September, pretty much after the girl #1 thing went down hill. The catch is that she lives about 1,800 miles away... and theres a huge body of water between us so the only way we could actually see each other was getting on a plane. either way, both knowing this, we kept talking. We talked every day at least an hour a day from mid-september until the end of december. We also skyped every chance we got. We also constantly texted. And by constantly texting im talking about 6,000 texts in this span of time. As you can see we got pretty close during that time. There was also a sort of magnetic attraction between us, but we never really acknowledged it. The thing is i started hinting that i might move a bit closer to her after i graduate, at least close enough where a real relationship could develop. This went on for most of january and she seemed pretty thrilled about it. This all sounds perfect so far, and i thought it was. Then she mentioned something about a guy friend of her's supposedly being jealous of me because we were always talking or texting and that i could always make her smile (her words, not mine)... i was like ""whatever, the guys in the friend zone, i got nothing to worry about"". Today, i had to find out through motherfucking facebook that they started a relationship ""as of today"" which means its probably been going on for a while... ive never felt so betrayed (and i have been cheated on before so it takes a lot for me to trust someone after that first time) we talked literally minutes before i found out and she didnt even mention it. not a word... it just felt like shit.

So thats whats been going on up until a couple of hours ago. I apologize if this seems a bit jumbled up or makes no sense whatsoever. Im a bit drunk and right now, those pills look more tempting than ever.... i know that if i took them, they would just lull me away to sleep and i would just not wake up again... and maybe then i can get rid of this loneliness... of this emptiness... of this nothingness... 

I'm really tempted to delete all of this to just not bother anyone but maybe it can be an outlet... i dont know... we'll see how today pans out... see if another day is really worth it...

UPDATE:Hello everyone, thank you so much for taking your time to read my wall of text and truly caring. It was a rough couple of days but thankfully made it through. Found out from doing some research that all my symptoms, including the increased depression, were severe side effects of my anti-depressants. I instantly stopped taking them as soon as i figured it out and i have an appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow and i'm going to demand a change in my treatment (i never want to go through that again). Thank you all for the support, you guys made a world of difference. Much love."

pfzry,3,2012-02-08,What do I do?,jonathanwtf,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/pfzry/what_do_i_do/,"Hey everybody,

So I am in a bit of a predicament. I just graduated in June and I had applied to a job back in November for an advertising agency, but didn't get it.  They sent me a warm email telling me that I was one of their front-runner favorites, but they ultimately decided to go with somebody who had a bit more experience.  I believe I really killed that interview and I believe I left a very good impression on them.

Fast forward to now, I am currently doubling up and working at a local start-up company as an unpaid intern 2 full days and 3 half days a week, and a French Bakery at night.

Now, the job that rejected me in November reached out to me and asked if I was interested in an opening for the position I had originally applied for. They called me for an interview which happened last week. The problem here is that I was interviewed this time by a recently hired HR Director that started this month.  This was a bit of a curveball because I truly expected to talk to the people that originally interviewed me and I was not prepared for this.  I did have a bunch of questions prepared and went through my most recent positions on the resume.  (I didn't even list the barista job on my resume.)

Interview didn't go as well as I had hoped, but I did get to talk to the Owner of the company who went to the same college as me.  We talked about dorms and the area a lot.  Interview was about 40 minutes total between the two different interviewers.

She told me that the Director of the department - one of the people I talked to the first time - was on vacation, but she definitely had a say in who she would like to hire.  There is an immediate opening, but they would like to pick the right candidate before jumping into anything.  She said she would let me know if a week or two and keep me updated.  I sent a thank you email to both interviewers the day after as proper interview etiquette, and now I wait.

I interviewed on Thursday, today is Tuesday so I know that I am getting a bit ahead of myself, but I am feeling a bit of anxiety about the situation.

**TL, DR VERSION** = Killed an interview 3 months ago, but rejected. Called back for new opening. Interviewed by different person, didn't go as well.

So here is what I am trying to figure out: **Should I email the Director who I interviewed with the first time?**

Of course, I don't want to seem too eager, but I would really like a future with this company.  I believe that I could kill a talk with the director, but I don't know if it is already too late.  I originally applied for this job on craigslist, but it isn't being advertised now.  It is, however, on their website.

What should I do /r/jobs?"

I'm currently a little over 5 weeks into what I originally thought would be an extended break. I'm seriously considering quitting for good, but I haven't decided for sure. I took a 3 month break last year in order to be able to pass drug tests while getting an internship. I hope to go for at least 6 months, then decide where to go from there.

The catalyst for this break was failing two classes and going on academic probation. I've generally been able to get by in school (my GPA is just over 3.0). I decided I needed a break to make sure I don't go on AP again and risk some really bad consequences. After a few weeks when my head got clear I did some thinking. I realized that I can't remember the last time I really put my full effort into my studies. I used to blame this completely on weed, but I realize now that I was just using that as an excuse. Although, it sure is easier to motivate myself to focus on classes when I'm not smoking. This quarter I actually turned an assignment in early. Where as last quarter I was failing to turn in assignments altogether.

Besides improvements in my classes, I've restarted my meditation practice, finally got around to brewing my first batch of beer, and I'm even trying out vegetarianism. 

I'm surprised at my will power, seeing as that I live with 6 pot smokers, of which two deal and one grows.  I know I can stay strong through the end of the quarter, but once its over I may struggle to continue with my break. Hopefully the positive changes I'm making in my life are enough to motivate me to quit once and for all.

Peace and Love."

(Transfer Student),[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pfqwg/what_to_put_for_gpa_when_applying_for_internship/,"How's it going everyone, I love this subreddit and the information I've gotten from it, and have just a quick question. I'm looking at getting my first internship this summer in Computer Science after spending 3.5 years at another out of state school. I was pursuing a BA in Economics, (less math and modeling than a BS), but changed my mind and wanted to pursue a CS degree. The thing is, I haven't been able to get my official transcripts from the original school, as I owe some money that I've been paying back slowly, and should be finished within a few months. Up until now, I've been putting my major GPA (4.0) on my resume, but this is not my cumulative. If I had to guess, I would say it's around a 3.2 cumulative, but my original school uses a +- system state wide, while the new state system doesn't. I also am not sure which credits are going to transfer, as I had ~104 towards my Econ BA, and now ~45 towards my CS BS.

Is it acceptable to use my major GPA, even if it could be construed as intentionally misleading in the future? Or should I use my best guess of my cumulative? Thanks y'all."
pfqno,1,2012-02-07,Giving-up this reddit crack pipe,[deleted],nosurf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/pfqno/givingup_this_reddit_crack_pipe/,"Is it fair to compare this to an alcoholic's addiction? I don't know the answer to that, but I can guess that one piece of the addiction puzzle has to do with ""the thing interferes with common, everyday tasks"" Check. ""Beyond standard consumption"" Check. ""Creates relationship problems when used in excess"" Check. 

I really do think I have an addiction. 

To evaluate this fairly, I decided to apply some numbers to it. You see, up until I joined reddit about 2 months ago, I was a mostly daily user of the site Fark. In fact, I became a Farker when I got my first internship position back in college back in '02. And can I tell ya? I burned a lot of time on Fark.  I estimate that on a good day, I would spend about 45 min. to an hour on Fark. On a not-so-good day, it would be more like 2 hours, and on a baaaaaad day I would spend closer to 5 or 6 hours. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong here‚ÄîI realize that this amount of leisure time spent in front of a screen ain‚Äôt tiddlywinks compared to others' amounts, especially hardcore gamers, but that's just what I figured my personal numbers to be.
 
Since I've joined reddit, my good, medium, and bad days have increased by at least 50%. So, if you do the math. . .

*Good days = 45 min. x 150% = Roughly 67 minutes

*Medium days = 2 hrs. x 150% = 3 hrs. (180 min.)

*Bad days = 5 hrs. x 150% = 7.5 hrs. (450 min.)

For clarity's sake, let‚Äôs assume out of a 7-day week that I had 2 good, 3 medium, and 2 bad. If weighted percentages get you wet, then. . .

*Good = 2/7 = 0.2857

*Medium = 3/7 = 0.4286

*Bad = 2/7 = 0.2857

*Total = 7/7 = roughly 1

Applying these weighted averages to corresponding minutes and a length of time (let‚Äôs say, Christmas‚Äî45 days ago), I've spent

(45 x 0.2857 x 67 min.) + (45 x 0.4286 x 180 min.) + (45 x 0.2857 x 450 min.) = 861.3855 + 3471.66 + 5785.43 = 10118.4705 minutes divided by 60 min. in every hour = 168.641175 hours on reddit. 

Yes, surf-derps, that‚Äôs an entire 7 days. 

After running my earlier Fark consumption numbers, I have spent over 1 year wasting time screwing around on the internet. If it had been an 8-hour/day job, it would have been 3 years of my life working. 
 
Yeah, I‚Äôm done. 

I will keep this site as my homepage for moral support and I‚Äôm not sure how to handle my gmail account yet, but I‚Äôll figure something out. 

So, to repeat a [well-known send-off](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTOKJTRHMdw&amp;feature=endscreen&amp;NR=1) to Fark, reddit, youtube, Wikipedia, and Facebook, respectively, I bid you good day, sir. 

**tl;dr: Over the past 10 years, I've wasted too much time farting around on the internet. For comparison, if it had been my 8-hour/day job, it would have been 3 years of my life. Not gonna surf, but will respond.**

I'm married and living in an apartment, so I need to bring some income home. I've been using sites like career builder and simply hired to find jobs, and as I try looking for jobs related to my degree, I find that I simply don't have the experience for an IT job right now. I've only made it to the basic math prerequisites of my degree, and while I've gotten a taste of several different programming languages and some toying with a few linux distros, I don't have the professional or personal experience with anything necessary to get a job having anything to do with computers-at least as far as I've found now.

So my question is: Are there entry level jobs that can help me build some kind of resume for after graduation? Could I learn a type of skill or language now and get a job with that? Everything I find seems to want a comp sci degree already or 4-5 years of experience in a given language or job type. I don't have the degree now and unless I got a job I won't have the experience when I graduate, either. I would apply for an internship somewhere, but my GPA is only 2.7-something, I think. The last one I looked at was looking for 3.2, and I suspect they're all looking for about that level or better. I can always raise my grades with time, but is there anywhere I could apply to now that could give me some of the skills and, more importantly, the resume I will need for when college is through?

pigep,1,2012-02-09,Genders in engineering rant,[deleted],rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/pigep/genders_in_engineering_rant/,"So this afternoon I was sitting in the engineering communications studio working dynamics problems with my normal study group‚Äîme, two girlfriends, and a guy friend.  The career expo at my school is tomorrow and we were talking about it.  I made the offhand comment that I don‚Äôt want to go because I‚Äôm never going to get an internship with my GPA as low as it is, regardless of my work experience.  That‚Äôs when the token male of the groups says that me and my other girlfriend will get internships because we‚Äôre female.

That‚Äôs it.  I have a vagina, thus they are going to throw internships at me apparently. Not because I work harder or am more intelligent.  Because I have two X chromosomes.

And I‚Äôm not exaggerating.  He is the type of guy that would not get and internship and I would get one and then he‚Äôd but all, ‚ÄúOh well, I didn‚Äôt try.‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou are female and that‚Äôs the only reason they picked you over me.‚Äù 

I WILL END YOU.

I  might have overreacted a bit and crossed the line in my response to him, but I don‚Äôt regret verbally bitch slapping him.  And I‚Äôm pretty sure the entire studio outside the conference room could hear me.  They stared as a stormed out, but fuck tha police, I give no fucks.

And I‚Äôm not saying companies don‚Äôt have to even out their ratios.  I get that.  I think it‚Äôs stupid, but I get it.  Fine.  Whatever.  But it seems every guy here has the mentality that gender is the only reason that a woman would get an engineering internship.  

Ad it isn‚Äôt just him.  Many of the guys I take classes with feel the same or stronger.  It‚Äôs all about insecurities, and frankly, they need to be bitch slapped.  It is possible for me to be a better candidate than you, so get over yourself and stop being so insecure and accept the fact that you are not god‚Äôs gift to engineering.  nHe is being nothing but condescending.  I need the help of being a woman to get an internship?  Hey fuck you.

THEN.  I texted my other male engineering friend telling him what happened.  He texted me first about skipping a reception tonight, and I said I probably was too because I‚Äôm so irritated.  Then I explained what happened.  And he said that though the comment was harsh, male number one had a point and that it‚Äôs a lot harder as a male.  Okay fine I can live with that.  Still see it as an excuse but whatever.  But alas, ladies and gentlemen, he wasn‚Äôt done.  I then get this:

‚ÄúPlus companies know that female engineers are team players and great at communication.‚Äù

Um.  Excuse me?  Is that supposed to help?  I‚Äôm hired because I‚Äôm motherly and warm hearted and some other bullshit only pisses me off. 

And mother fucking I just lost half my post so I don‚Äôt remember what I had.  Fuck.

But to continue, I don‚Äôt want special treatment.  I‚Äôm hate the whole WOMEN POWER bullshit.  Just treat me equal to everyone else, even if that means I don‚Äôt get the internship.  At least I know it was honest.

What sucks the most is that these are two of my best friends and they say that shit to me.  I‚Äôve never pulled the whole, ‚ÄúOh women have a harder time getting hired because it‚Äôs a men‚Äôs profession and they only want to hire other men and affirmative action must be taken‚Äù card because I truly don‚Äôt believe it.

Is it so wrong to think that the best candidate should be hired regardless of sex or race or appearance?  This goes to a deeper level.  Why do I have to pretend to be someone else in a job interview?  Why can‚Äôt I wear my normal jeans, top, converse, and what might be considered over the top jewelry?  I‚Äôm not a different person in trousers and heels and modest jewelry.  Honestly, I work better in my jeans because I‚Äôm more comfortable. 

So now I‚Äôm a mix of pissed off at the mentality of the males I go to school with, hurt that two of my best friends would act so condescendingly toward me, and frustrated with the job market in general.  Though pissed is the main emotion right now."

J.P. Morgan

Dear Sir or Madame:

I am an ambitious undergraduate at NYU triple majoring in Mathematics, Economics, and Computer Science. I am a punctual, personable, and shrewd individual, yet I have a quality which I pride myself on more than any of these.

I am unequivocally the most unflaggingly hard worker I know, and I love self-improvement. I have always felt that my time should be spent wisely, so I continuously challenge myself; I left Villanova because the work was too easy. Once I realized I could achieve a perfect GPA while holding a part-time job at NYU, I decided to redouble my effort by placing out of two classes, taking two honors classes, and holding two part-time jobs. That semester I achieved a 3.93, and in the same time I managed to bench double my bodyweight and do 35 pull-ups.

I say these things only because solid evidence is more convincing than unverifiable statements, and I want to demonstrate that I am a hard worker. J.P. Morgan is a firm with a reputation that precedes itself and employees who represent only the best and rightest in finance. I know that the employees in this firm will push me to excellence, especially within the Investment Banking division. In fact, one of the supporting reasons I chose Investment Banking over any other division was that I know it is difficult. I hope to augment my character by diligently working for the professionals at Morgan Stanley, and I feel I have much to offer in return.

I am proficient in several programming languages, and I can pick up a new one very quickly. For instance, I learned a years worth of Java from NYU in 27 days on my own; this is how I placed out of two including: Money and Banking, Analysis, Game Theory, Probability and Statistics. Even further, I am taking Machine Learning and Probabilistic Graphical Modeling currently, two programming courses offered by Stanford, so that I may truly offer the most if I am accepted. I am proficient with Bloomberg terminals, excellent with excel, and can perform basic office functions with terrifying efficiency. I have plenty of experience in the professional world through my internship at Merrill Lynch, and my research assistant position at NYU. In fact, my most recent employer has found me so useful that he promoted me to a Research Assistant and an official CTED intern. This role is usually reserved for Masters students, but my employer gave the title to me so that he could give me more work.

Please realize that I am not a braggart or conceited, I just want to outline my usefulness. Egos can be a huge liability, and I try not to have one.

Thank you so much for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best,

Mark"

",thehomie,ucla,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/pichc/protip_18_how_to_my_liberal_arts_humanities/,"*This was originally going to be a response to a different thread. Now it's here:



I graduated last June. I've got law school apps out and needed to find a job in the mean time. I was looking specifically to work at a law firm to bolster my apps and for that reason wasn't totally overwhelmed by that 'oh-shit... I-should-have-studied-science' existential moment. In 3 eternal weeks of searching, I managed to land 4 interviews and received job offers at the better 3 firms. I was ultimately even able to pseudoleverage one offer over another. I now work full-time for a top firm in a position with basic, but sometimes interesting responsibilities. I make a modest, but livable wage, and I get full benefits. This was accomplished with an unremarkable GPA (~3.5), generic softs, a degree in Philosophy (no double, no minor), a few months previous relevant part-time experience and - most importantly, I think - **the ability to interview well:**




- **DO YOUR RESEARCH** about the place to which you're applying: know as specifically as possible what they do and who does what.


- **SHOW UP EARLY..** my target is ~20 minutes..  If your interview is at 3:00pm and you show up at 2:50, you're late. 


- No, really.. **DO YOUR RESEARCH**.. Have questions lined up about specific people, what they've done / are currently doing, and express your interest. People love an audience, but be *cool*; don't brownnose. People want more than anything to be able to tolerate, ideally even enjoy the company of the people they're working with. In an interview, you're trying to get your interviewer(s) to 1) remember you, and 2) remember that they like you more than the other applicants. If you manage to break the wall, one candid conversation can go a very long way. Example: one of the managing partners of the firm I currently work for has a sports law blog. I came in with his last few entries fresh in my mind.. the two of us talked about the state of Bruin basketball for a full 15 minutes while the other two people in the room listened in and laughed... At my previous job, I googled one of the partners (who happened to interview me) and saw that he owns a bar in Hollywood offering a bunch of microbrews. I've worked in bars / restaurants and spent 4 years in college.. I casually brought up his bar.. We talked about beer and whiskey for 30 minutes of my 35 minute interview. I got the offer the next day. 


- Finding common ground with your interviewer is important, but don't force it. It's probably better to **BE ARTICULATE** in what you say (viz: only speak when you actually know what you're talking about) than to uncomfortably pick at the conversation, trying desperately to keep them talking. Still, as a general rule of thumb, try to get them to talk more about themselves and their business than you talk about yourself and your ""accomplishments"" (however counter-intuitive that may seem). You're 20-something.. Odds are you haven't done anything terribly remarkable, and that's perfectly understandable; even expected. In any event, they've already got your resume. They know what you're selling.. 


- **DRESS WELL** ... Really, this is so often overlooked, especially given what a powerful tool it can be. When it comes to being taken seriously, you wouldn't believe the general disparity between well and poorly-dressed people. In an interview, the way you're dressed accounts for one of the strongest, most lasting impressions you can make, and it's probably the only aspect of an interview that's totally under your control -- don't squander potentially free points. Dressing well means spending a little more on a pair of shoes / shirt / slacks / haircut than your normally would. And if you don't think you have good style (or if you know you don't...), find someone who does and get them to go shopping with you. It shouldn't be hard. Whether they'll admit it or not, the fashion-conscious love being asked to do fashion-related things. And just for the record, every man needs at least one *good* suit (stay away from polyester and H&amp;M). About women, I know less, but you should be aiming somewhere in between the church and the club. Also, when in doubt, overdress. That should never count against you. 


- Wait one day after the interview and then **FOLLOW UP**. Email or phone call. Up to you. Express your thanks, your continued interest and that the interview was a pleasure. That's it. You already put in the work during the interview. The follow up is just to remind them how cool you were. 


- Try not to be devastated by rejection(s). You go / went to UCL-motherfucking-A. We quite literally run this city (huge, established and heavily nostalgic alumni network). Keep at it and shit will work out. Remember: jobs are like women in college --&gt; a numbers game. Put yourself out there earnestly and often enough, and it's only a matter of time before one gives you the nod. That said, be selective if you can afford to be. Don't stop looking for the dime piece just because a ""6"" is willing to jerk you off in the bathroom for a while. Better jobs = better experience = better on your resume = a better next job / grad school app. 



Source: I've had a ton of interviews in my short time for a ton of different things - plenty of paid jobs in plenty of different fields.. schools, scholarships, clubs, internships, volunteer positions, etc. - and I've gotten offers after each of them; this most recent 3/4 being the only exception. The above is arbitrary advice based on what I think I did right and what I noticed I did differently from the often more-impressive-on-paper people I was competing with. I've also always asked (and have been told) what stuck out in my interviews. 


Good luck, Bruins!"
pibah,1,2012-02-09,Hi r/chicago! How do you stay fit?,[deleted],chicago,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/pibah/hi_rchicago_how_do_you_stay_fit/,"To preface, I've lived in the western burbs for all my life, and came out to norcal for grad school. I have to admit, I've been utterly spoiled--everyone jogs, bikes, swims, you name it, out here. As I write this, its 65 degrees outside. 

That said, I'm coming back to downtown Chicago for full time work. One thing I'm very worried about is staying fit. I remember my internships in the city where a good chunk of businessmen/women were overweight and fueled by coke and hot dogs.

Does everyone generally just run and bike on LSD? (For the cyclists, can you get any hard core training in or do people litter the bike lanes)

How about the winter? Those 20 degree nights (still relatively warm) sap any motivation out of me.

Thanks r/chicago! Lookin forward to come back!

I was kind of just planning on being a mud logger for a while (buddy in the field said he could get me a job). But now my advisor says I have a really good chance to be accepted for an internship at The Doe Run mining company which will pretty much ~~fully certify me as~~ set me on the path to becoming a mining geologist. 
I'm definitively going to apply for the program straight away, but I'm just curious about what is happening in that field these days. For instance, how many mining jobs are available in the U.S.A.? 
Also, I heard that they are desperate for mining geologists in Australia, and they were paying a lot of money for anyone with experience. Just wondering how true that was. Thanks in advance to any replies!

Edit: Not certified, trained. Wrong word usage."
piasx,12,2012-02-09,"Gentlefolk, I could use some advice.",Esuka,MLPLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/piasx/gentlefolk_i_could_use_some_advice/,"[](/takealetter) A little background first. I'm a 3rd year a california uni, studio arts major. I am a game designer, I have a title up on XBLA, another completed project, and a title we are hoping to get on Steam within the next few months. Unfortunately, my school (the school of the arts, not the uni) does not lend much... any support to my field, but I managed with the Video Game Development Club, of which I act as an officer. I spent a quarter studying abroad, and the overall experience was incredible. I came back from a month of traveling, having survived on my own, feeling pretty confident. 

[](/cheerilee) Still with me? Awesome. So here's the problem. In a nutshell, there isn't enough time. I can divide my time into 3 basic categories: Entertainment, schoolwork, and career/resume work. Again, because my classes have very little overlap with my field, I have to build my resume largely on my own. And yes, drawing ponies counts as entertainment. I love it, I love sharing them, and I'm not about to stop, but I can't really use it. 

[](/lunagasp) And in one month, GDC, one of the largest gatherings of game and software developers in the world, is being held at its annual location in San Fransisco. If you want to be a developer, it's urged that you go. If you are one, your company will sometimes cover you going. It's important. But I look at what I have for my resume, and I don't feel like anyone will buy it. Yes, I've completed projects, which is a step above a lot of people in my position, but it's not enough of a step to compensate for the lack of expertise I have in sheer technical skill. Even though going to GDC with the singular intention of getting a job is likely to fail, the contacts you make there will often be considering new interns and employees. 

[](/derpwizard) Sorry folks, almost done. Now, I can go, focus purely on making contacts, and bolster my resume and my portfolio as hard as I can for next year, but there's a final issue. GDC takes place during the end of my school term. Being an art student, most of my finals are in the last week of class rather than the dedicated finals week. And even though the number of classes I'm taking is lighter, all of them have more out of class work. If I go to GDC, I have little doubt that my grades will suffer for it. So here's the question folks:

**tl;dr**: Do I accept a slump in my grades in favor of strengthening my resume and my job prospects, or do I finish out college knowing I'll have a harder time finding a job?
And for the record, obviously my entertainment time will take a hit, but I can't give all of it up or I'll go nuts. Thanks for your time, folks.

*edit 1* So I consulted schedules a bit, and I have to revise my previous statement. My grades wouldn't suffer, they'd be shot. I have an exam worth 30% of my grade in one class, and it's the final week to work on a project for another. I can't get a makeup on the exam.

*edit 2 because it seems edit 2 didn't get saved* Thanks all for writing in. Seeing so many people say ""go to GDC"" makes it hard to admit that, despite my desires, I don't think I will be able to attend. Between the dip in cash and the poor class results I know I would receive, I just don't see a way I can manage it this year. Frankly, looking at this in a bigger perspective, I'm thinking GDC is only the tip of my problem iceberg. I'm going to have to reorganize how I approach my future, mostly on timetables and finances. 

This whole thing has left me in rather poor spirits, so I'll stop here. Thank you again for your time, and I'm sorry I wasn't able to reply to more of you in a timely manner. Class permitted me only a quick glance every hour or so. [Have a good night.](http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-hugs-for-everypony.gif)

pi62a,9,2012-02-09,I am in a school with a concentrated aerospace engineering degree. Should I transfer to a school that has an full aerospace engineering major?,nothing4me,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/pi62a/i_am_in_a_school_with_a_concentrated_aerospace/,"Outline of situation:
- Rutgers University (New Brunswick Campus).
- In-state student.
- Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in Aerospace.
- Sophomore.
- 3.6 GPA as of Fall 2011.
- Have done research in engineering department regarding high speed flows and energy deposition.
- Want to work in propulsion systems for NASA or a defense/aerospace company.
- I am thinking of U. of Maryland (College Park) and U. of Illinois (Urbana Champaign) for transfer.

Here's the thing, Rutgers University is right next to big pharma companies like Johnson and Johnson and big bank firms... so we get a lot of recruiters from there. I barely (if ever) see any aerospace recruiters around here. I think I've seen one but that's it.

I applied to NASA, Boeing, etc. internships for this summer and am waiting to hear replies, so I can't absolutely depend on that.

So, my question: Is it worth transferring to a higher ranked school that has a lot of recruiters from the aerospace companies coming in? Or should I just stick to Rutgers University?

I live off-campus, cook my own food. I paid $900 for this semester for my tuition and I pay $400 a month for rent (shared) and I work enough to pay off the rent. I think going to a higher ranked school is worth the debt I will have by the time I come out since I will be able to pay it off easily and have a better chance of fulfilling my professional goals.

But, I am a student and don't have much experience as you guys and girls, so I really need your insights because this is a very big decision for me.

Thank you."

I have been lurking for a little while. 

My context:

Studying IT at uni. Would have liked CS but not available where I live so this is the closest to what I can do while self-teaching myself as much as I can on the side. I need to start working and because of my schedule web development seems to be the right choice. I'm actually very attracted to web development and I may actually dedicate myself to this for the long run.

I developed a simple application in Ruby on Rails follow railstutorial.org and spent a couple weeks as an intern at an agency.

I didn't understand fully what I was doing with RoR and decided to start from the ground up -&gt; Lead me to Google from the ground up videos.

I believe I must learn the basics very well before getting into a framework, this being said I am currently learning CSS from Lynda.com and watched some videos from treehouse and tuts. 

I am also doing the Learn JQuery in 30 days course but I intend to learn the JavaScript essentials too, I know some programming already so getting into that won't be too hard (I know some C#, Java, and have skimmed through Ruby/C++/C/Python).

Basically these are my **goals**:

* Use HTML (semantic markup)
* Learn CSS 
* Learn JavaScript
* Learn JQuery
* Learn to setup and use a database
* Use a framework: Rails or Django probably
* Get familiar with CMS like Joomla/Wordpress or some other I dont know of yet, and get familiar with PHP (I've read it's the most used in the industry)

The feedback I'm looking for is if these are efficient steps to starting out and having a plan and any tips or tricks.

I got fed up with all the ridiculous gridlocks that would force me into overpaying by eight credits every semester had I continued because of failing to get the credit for the class by the narrowest of margins. (Seriously, .03% off of getting a c- in calculus II all because of one question on the final exam) Not succeeding with the course caused me to lose all of the courses that I could take in the spring semester unless I took that 4 credits alone.

And here I am, I transferred to the Management program because that sounded like the most direct way to get into project management. I also planned on slowly finishing up the EE degree at a later date after completing the management degree (part time schooling). Unfortunately after attending the past two career fairs, there just does not seem like there are any internship opportunities besides being a cheap commissioned retail whore (salesperson) for management majors. What I'm currently considering is taking on a minor to help hedge my future jobs until I can settle into a project management career. 

What I am asking is if you have any ideas of a good minor to take in addition to a management major in order to help ensure a job while I finish up the EE degree? Or even, should I just take a minor in Engineering instead?

I have been studying engineering and have not spent all of this time at the college itself -- there are mandatory internships as part of the program, several of which I've spent in a nearby major city, which also has one of the best universities in the area in it, and through these internships I've met several people who attend this urban university.

Despite good grades at my home college, I've become so dissatisfied with my student experience that I've left, with plans to go to said urban university instead (I've already been accepted) and try to ""salvage"" what remains of my college experience. The thing is this -- I wouldn't be studying engineering. I do get credit for the work I've done, but depending on what I study it wouldn't be directly applicable (it would only count as 2 years of general math and science credit).

I would be spending another 2 years at this new school (starting this summer), studying some combination of arts and sciences, partly for increasing the academic breadth of my education but also to try and have the feeling of being part of a community. I would be several years older than incoming freshmen, which is something I'm a bit concerned about in terms of feeling comfortable, but there are plenty of upper-year students and I think I could see past it.

Is this at all a good idea, or am I setting myself up for a bad situation? Is it ever rational to pursue something for the sense of community? I should clarify that I do not intend to be an engineer -- I actually hope to go to law school, so the subject of my undergrad isn't particularly important.

Insight is appreciated. My gut feeling is that there is some irrational thinking going on here, but I can't say that doing something like this is guaranteed to end poorly. My main concern is that the sense of community a lot of people feel usually builds more naturally over time, but I would be coming in a somewhat unnatural way. There isn't a particular program of study, for example, that I'm dying to do at this university, I just know that there are courses I would enjoy and could do well enough in. The social aspect is coming somewhat before the academic, which could blow up in my face if the social doesn't work out as I hope it will."

I've applied to a couple internships that involve GIS, but I haven't been able to get anything yet.

I also saw that it's possible to get a GIS certificate in a year.  I asked a geography professor that's doing work I'm interested in about that option, and he strongly suggested I do it.  He was saying, regardless of what I end up doing afterwards, it would be a really useful thing to have.  However, I'm wondering - would it make more sense to wait and just do the GIS courses as part of my Master's?  Would a Master's prgram be flexible enough to do as little or as much GIS as I want/need?  Could doing this give me a useful head start?  Or would doing the certificate separately just be a waste of money?

I was assigned a task to do maintenance on some lab PCs; profile clean up and the like.  This work required admin access to the PCs.  I asked for the domain admin password.

The tech I was with gave me an uneasy look and called our manager to see if he could give it to me.  He got the OK and he whispered me the password.  At first I didn't think I understood him, he had whispered ""password.""

I frankly want to tell them that that's how to fucking internet works. I know posting something like this here will garnish the occasional immature remarks but I still prefer it over not having it. 

What would you guys recommend the University do? 
1. New types of marketing techniques? What types? Where should the videos be posted? How should they be presented?
2. A ""subscribe"" campaign to get people revisiting the site for more videos down the line? How would that work?
3. New ways to suggest that the elite ""board"" members are just behind the times and need to get with it?

I came up with a list, but I'm interested to see what you guys would recommend. "

phirm,7,2012-02-09,Graduating Without Having Enough Experience,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/phirm/graduating_without_having_enough_experience/,"Hey everyone,
I wanted to ask a couple of questions about not having enough experience after graduating from undergrad. I want to emphasize that I am *not* concerned with how to go about building more experience, though.

Instead, I want to know about some of the questions I've listed below. It would be extremely helpful if anyone who has experience in any of these things could chime in.

**About entry-level/junior positions:**

* What does it take to get a position at the bigger and competitive/reputable places (Microsoft, Google etc.)? In other words, what are the influences involved in their hiring decisions? Do they only care about the extent of your portfolio and your ability to code? I understand that if you have a lower GPA, but an impressive portfolio that it makes you an attractive candidate... What about the other way around? If you have a great academic record, but at the expense of a portfolio, are you considered to be just as valuable as the former candidate?

* How much do the aforementioned workplaces (or any other good job) care about the school you attended? Is it possible to compete with those graduating from Stanford, MIT, etc. when you are coming from a much smaller school?

**About internships:**

* Is it possible to get an internship with any of these companies after graduating? (I know it's typically a summer thing for sophomores/juniors)

* Once again, how competitive are these internships? 

What I really want to know is, did anyone else find themselves having this similar kind of problem? If you did, were you still able to find success?
... Or is the only way to get jobs/internships at these kinds of places to just wait until I've built up enough experience on my own?


Any advice would be helpful. Thank you."

I keep finding post after post after post of firms devaluing our work.

First notable example: Excellent ad for an intern architect, duties include red line drawings and renderings for clients. I had all the skills required. On the bottom, in fine print, it said ""unpaid intern"". Besides the obvious (the janitor earns more than me, I need to make a living) this is technically ILLEGAL. The Dept of Labor specifically says that an unpaid intern cannot benefit the company in any way. Renderings for the clients sound like a benefit to me. I have seen a couple other unpaid internships since then. Yet firms will keep doing this because upper-class graduates can afford to work for 6 months without pay and are desperate for experience.

Second notable example: Intern architect for great firm, blah blah blah, ideal candidate will have 8-10 years experience. So they expect that someone who has been working in the industry for a decade to gracefully accept an interns salary because the economy is so bad. They should be lucky the firm is so kind to them, right? As above, I've also seen several examples of this.

It is so sickening. I feel that posts like these are giving a bad reputation to the industry and the people in it. What makes me even more sick is that there is nothing I can do except sit back and sift through these posts hoping that a legit opportunity will come up. Any thoughts? Have you been personally involved in firms that hire people like this? Words of encouragement?"

One week has passed and I got an offer from another company, which wants me to decide within one week (although I asked for more and they said they will let me know if they can extend it). I would like to write a message asking the ideal company if there is any way they can speed up the process.

I graduated from uni with a social science degree (Psyc), and it's got me exactly as far as everyone thinks it would.  I am now working full time at my previous summer job.  So I graduated in April, and just assumed that somehow life would work out, and I would get some career job in no time.  Fast forward 9 months of semi-emoness, and I realize I gotta take control of this situation.

I work full time, but I have plenty of spare time that I'm not really doing anything with.  I want to better myself.  I want to make myself an asset.  Sure the unemployment rate is high, and the economy is bad, blah blah blah, but there are still a butt-ton of people with great jobs out there, and I want to be one of them.  

I don't care if I have to start over, or change directions, I just need to start doing something.  I'm vaguely thinking about college.  Grad school crossed my mind, but in all honesty I pictured it being only a small step up from undergrad, and undergrad got me nowhere.  I applied to an internship with the Ontario government, but I haven't heard back from that.  I thought about volunteering somewhere and possibly getting some experience in my field.  I ended up volunteering at a special needs place, but felt I wasn't doing anything worthwhile, wasn't learning anything, etc..  Are there any other just straight up courses that I could take?  

Are there other people that have possibly been in the same boat as me, but are maybe a couple years into the future?  What paths did you take?

I feel kind of lost.  My parents can't seem to give me any advice on the matter (not that I blame them or anything), and I'm not sure who else to ask.  I don't want to be serving/waiting for another year :S.

phc3j,3,2012-02-08,What should I do the summer before I enter pharmacy school? ,lponced2002,pharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/phc3j/what_should_i_do_the_summer_before_i_enter/,"I am a senior about to graduate. I will begin my first year in pharmacy school this fall. I am in the process of deciding what I should do for my last ""free"" summer before pharmacy school. I apologize for the long post in advance: 

[B]Option 1: [/B]
I was just presented with an opportunity to intern with a company called 'Southwestern Advantage.' They sell educational supplies including textbook study aids and software. Essentially, my job would be to sell these products to families with children who are attending grade school to high school. The average college student intern makes above 8,000$ within these three months. I would be living with a host family, my manager, and 3 other student interns. 
     I've looked at the products, and they are definitely helpful to students. In addition, this company has been operating and taking in interns for over 100 years. They are successful, and this is not a scam. The catch is that it takes a lot of work to sell the supplies; I must visit 30 families 6 days a week. 
[U]Advantages: [/U]
- character building (leadership, communication, able to take rejection, exposure to working in new locations, improving work ethic and commitment) 
- college credit
- experience
- money
- possibly once in a lifetime opportunity 
In addition, I see this as a chance to build experience and character; 
[U]Disadvantages: [/U]
- working about 80 hours a week
- stress, time commitment
- accepting rejection
- pay based on my effort 


[B]Option 2: [/B]
At the same time, I realize that this may be my last ""free"" summer before I enter pharmacy school. My only reason to not follow through with the program is because I want to finally relax and feel the satisfaction of getting into pharmacy school. I know that it will not have a lot of free time once I am attending. 

My alternative plans for summer would be to work part-time, visit family in Puerto Rico, volunteer in Guatamala for 2 weeks, and to really do new things that I've never really had time to do as an undergrad.

So again, my two options are: 
1) Enjoy my last 'free' summer by traveling, working part-time, and relaxing
OR 
2) work my butt off through the entire summer with this internship that can most likely pay me above 8 grand? 

Do any of you have advice on what I should do? Is this really my last relaxing summer before pharmacy school? Would this program heighten my experience and personal character? If you have any other questions about the program or what I‚Äôd be doing over the summer in detail, I'd be glad to answer them

Any advice is much appreciated; Thank you all :)

(I'm a college sophomore)

Me in a nutshell:

Negatives:

- 2.8 GPA (average is 3.28 at my university

- no major extracurriculars (I'm in a singing group; that's about it)

- no experience in finance

- no contacts for recommendations


Positives: before my depression spiraled out of control and before I switched majors, I think I looked pretty good on paper?

- perfect high school GPA; then dean's list first semester in college

- great contacts: professor on the board for the national honors society (for my former major); professor who recommended me as a TA to another professor; professor who I TA'd for

- had some experience (for my former major): two summers at the same research lab, the last summer in which I created a program on my own to automate some processes faster

- extracurriculars: was a leader in many high school groups; was involved in many college groups prior depression time

- I am good at learning on my own; I can learn from books really well 

- I attend Johns Hopkins, if that helps

- personal projects: small open source CLI tools (only one is mildly popular)
- languages: Java, C++, Python, PHP (~1 yr working experience each)

I know I need to improve my GPA, but I've taken enough hours (120+) that it's not going to budge much at this point.

My interviewing / abstract problem solving is weak. I have a hard time coming up with elegant solutions during interviews.

My question going forward is what I should do to increase my hiring potential:

- BS over BA (delays graduation by 1-2 semesters)
- Study various online material (e.g Open Courseware) and write proof of concept programs (e.g. distributed file systems, computing, game engines, graphic engines)
- Personal projects: Android webview apps, Android game using existing libraries/frameworks, Add GUI to my CLI programs (PyGTK), specialized Reddit clone to learn RoR, Poker Bot (for this [competition](http://www.computerpokercompetition.org/)), a Bitcoin market bot that follows some rough trading strategies in C++

I'm in need of some advice. My girlfriend is absolutely in love with the thought of journalism and media as a career, but isn't sure what to do next. And since I know nothing about the field, I came to the experts.

She recently graduated with a BA in Communications and she had an internship with a neighborhood paper reporting local events. She thinks moving to NYC or Europe is the place to be to accomplish these goals.

Anyways, here are my questions in an easier to read format:

1. How far does having a BA in Comm and limited journalism experience take you in getting that first gig?

2. Is it true that NYC is the place to be for aspiring journalists with her level of experience?

3. Do smaller markets like Seattle, WA and Portland, OR offer anything of value to someone trying to pursue journalism?

4. Would it benefit her to go back to school and further her education? Such as journalism school, etc.?

5. Would freelancing (I'm not actually entirely sure what that is, sorry!) benefit her?

6. Are there alternative careers she might consider?

7. How big of a factor would her GPA be?

**Lexie** passive aggressively offers to babysit Zola on Valentine's Day (yet she couldn't babysit her for 20 minutes to let Mer &amp; Derek *have at it*).
Merek don't fall for her passive aggressive trap (and they probably don't have time to discuss Lexi's existential issues during breakfast). Although it's kinda cold to show absolutely no interest in her issues. She's conflicted because of Mark and has surely been giving out signals of distress for weeks.
Passive aggression continues with an uninvited lie towards Mark (who by the way should finally take a hint).

The woman who's boyfriend died and who complained that he didn't propose to her for 8 years was a hint to women to sometimes disregard tradition and initiate themselves. Yelling at your SO to propose to you is **r i d i c u l o u s**.    
Anyway, she was also the plot device to give Lexie courage to finally talk to Mark (the locket was the last drop).

She finally went over to Mark's but Avery is there. :D
Impossible situation for her but I think Mark finally got it and something should happen next episode (the writers have been yanking our chains for too long regarding Lexie+Mark).

Mer insensitively complains about her sexlife to **Christina** who's too proud to fight for her marriage. Kinda gives away how self absorbed she is.
Christina tries to get into a conversation with **Owen** by indirect topics (i.e. work); he doesn't want to deal with her as he's already given up on the relationship. (Rightfully so, as Christina has not shown any empathy towards him for a long time).   
Then Owen tackles Christina away from a car which would have hit her (*inside* the hospital; yeah, pretty contrived plot element). This is supposed to remind her of his selflessness (he was there for her after the hospital shooting and decided to put her not wanting to have kids over his desire for kids, so that they can continue the relationship.

Later on he tells her he's going to move out, at least temporarily, not even looking for her reaction (or maybe trying to hide his own).   
She's visibly shaken. I don't know what she expected from her approach (i.e. pretending not to care).

**Richard** plays the good guy again, watching out for the *little people*'s feelings (i.e. April and Lexie) yet showing disregard for Owen's crumbling marriage.

The ""stupid intern guy"" hilariously asked ""So anybody got any Valentine's plans?"" in an OR with Christina, Owen and **Teddy** xD

Owen asks Teddy to be his friend again since he really needs someone to talk to and she lashes out at him for putting the needs of the hospital above her own. Somewhat strange, considering that they both have been in the military and it's pretty clear that additional people would have died had he told her about her husband.
Stellar performance on Kim's part btw.

Teddy vented to **Christina** and that's when Christina started to feel empathy for Owen again. She realized that he even went to Teddy (of all people) in search for someone to talk to.
Maybe because he was there for her after the shootings and always made compromises and became the ChoR, she started seing him as this perfect godlike man who *has* to be perfect.   
Now he's back in his ventilation room and she remembers his fragility which is what brought them together in the first place.   
Mer's monologue in that scene: ""And sometimes all we need to do to ease the pain, is call a simple truce"".         
Now that Christina is feeling empathy for Owen again, they have a chance.   

You probably noticed this earlier but I have to write it down at least once:    
**Alex** is good with kids because his parents weren't present and he had two younger siblings.

**Miranda** performs another display of insecurity: she expected Ben would break up with her because she wasn't on time (what the hell?) and he was fantastic as always.

In case you're wondering where the review for S08E13 is: it was a filler episode.

I'm already paying more than I can afford for an education that wasn't nearly worth it. I'm sick, and I can't stop sneezing. My car was hit a few days ago and the front bumper got all scuffed up.

She has no regards of people's valuable time or making everyone look like a slacker. Common phrases brought up were beating a dead horse and that if she cut her conversation by 80% she might be OK.

pj4a3,7,2012-02-10,My life is just an illusion,soultransfer,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pj4a3/my_life_is_just_an_illusion/,"I'm not entirely sure how to go about this.. tears are welling up as I type this because I just never knew my life would come to this. Some back story I suppose is in order so I'll try my best.

If I had to describe my life in one word, it would have to be, illusory. The reason I say this is because I more or less cheated my way through life, habitually lying to others (and for the most part, believing them myself), hiding behind a veneer of happiness or earnestness, and often very cynical. I have gotten this far and have nothing to show for it - yet you may see me in public, may get to know me online, be a friend in real life, or even a family member and you will see otherwise. I think I've lied to the point where I don't know who I am anymore and this is now become me.

I'm 25, unemployed, and currently living with my parents. For me, before experiencing these feelings of self-doubt, depression, and overall bleak self-esteem, my life was on cruise control, at least that's how I think about it. I was smart, athletic, and just sped through my schooling years easily with no hassle. College was the inevitable next step and now that I think about it, probably the first instance where I felt inadequate. My mother is 100% of asian descent so her expectations for her only son to succeed and become a trophy to others was always something she showed on her sleeve. I did not get into an ivy league school, but I did get into a rather reputable private college pretty much on a whim. Even though I did not get into an ivy league, my parents, family, and friends were all happy for me. For the sake of brevity, I'll say my college experience was full of ups and downs (mostly downs) and even though I did end up graduating with honors, I left college with not much to show for it. In similar fashion to high school, I felt as though I got away without having to do much and not really taking the time to really learn anything. I'll be honest, I cheated often to get by, or let others do a lot of the work for things, not apply myself during internships so I guess I have no one to blame except myself.

Maybe this will shed more light about me and my situation as it's clear to me because it happened this week, 2 days ago actually. To appease everyone, I still attempt to get job interviews and was invited by a company for an on-site interview in another state and they fly me out. They send a taxi for me and I'm on my way to the hotel the set up me up in. Looking out the window, for some reason, extreme episode of depressive thoughts seeped into my mind. I began to think, ""Why are you even here?"", ""Just get out and go."", ""I don't want to live like this."", etc. The ONLY thing I wanted to do while in that cab was just stop and leave, forget the interview, go out and be alone without anyone knowing. More suicidal thoughts crept into me and although it's all been mental so far and never actually began to add the physicality of it all, I can feel myself slipping and it's becoming harder and harder to stay afloat. I get to the hotel and I've calmed down a bit and just sit my room. I begin to panic somewhat because it's a big interview and I feel somewhat unprepared, so I practice for that. However, I was tired from the trip and decided to just wake up earlier in the morning.

This is probably one of the worst nights I've ever had in my life. It didn't help the bed was by far the most uncomfortable thing I felt. But I woke up in sweat around 2-3 AM, neck cramped, and these vivid dreams just play in my head and I can't get it out. Just completely random things, but I can't shake them off and can't get back to bed and I just wanted it all to stop. I couldn't tell if it was from a half-waken lucid dream or hallucinations.

That's where I am now. I just got the e-mail saying I didn't get the job (I did think I did well though at the time). My parents don't know yet, they get excited every time they hear about me getting an interview, but I just play along. I'm scared to tell them that it's another failure and I just turned out to be a failure that they spent a fortune on to get me through school with. Not just my parents, friends (I don't have many anymore), other family members, all still think I'm the same ""smart kid who can do anything.""

That's me, that's what I've become. I feel wasted, mentally and physically. I just don't know anything anymore.

pj33b,4,2012-02-10,Help! I don't know what to do anymore.. :(,Honiahaka12,dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/pj33b/help_i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/,"Le sigh. I've been dealing with my dog for about 9 months now, which isn't a LONG time but it's long enough to get some kind of training down with a dog.

Here's the sitch. Back in 2012 Summer I adopted a coonhound from out vet school. She was one of the dogs that the vet students get to poke/prod/experiment on to get good enough to be a pro. They don't mistreat them or anything, but it is a sad life IMO. So I went to meet all the dogs and picked her out because something just ""clicked"". 

When I adopted her, she came with all shots and even the paperwork of what had been done to her. Apparently before she was their vet dog, she worked at a prison. She was being trained to hunt down prisoners and attack them, but she failed the test because she was gun shy (she curls up in a yelping heap at the sound of one being fired).

So I take her in and in the first few months she's learned tricks such as ""sit"", ""paw"", ""stay"" (kinda), ""high five"".. and other cute dog tricks. Everything was going good until she learned how to get out of our fenced backyard for the first time (about 2 months after I've had her). I was angry at the time and chased her all throughout the neighborhood. I would call her and she would stop, look at me and then run away again. It pissed me off to no end, but I never called her with an angry tone and I never raised my voice in an angry manner because I wanted her to come to me.

When she FINALLY came to me, on her terms and not mine.. I praised her through gritted teeth. Even though I wanted to beat the shit out of her (which I would never do.. but it's still tempting).. she would wag her tail and we would go on our merry way. I'd patch the hole and everything would be fine. Then she would get out again and do the same thing, and again I would be totally ""happy"" that she came back to me.

This is what's happened the last 9 months or so. It's always been a problem.. but what am I supposed to do?

It's a bigger problem now.

I currently have an internship at a horse breeding farm and my dog has to come with me. Otherwise she's left at home in a kennel for 12 hours and I would feel terrible for that. She's great on a leash and listens to me, when on a leash. There have been two times that she's gotten out of the office that we stay in. Once it was my fault for not making sure the door latched, but tonight it was solely her. She pushed the door opened with her nose and took off into the night.

This pisses me off to no end because I went out after her and called her name, she stopped and looked at me. I called her over and said, ""Hey Rollie! Come here!"" with a big smile and a chipper voice. She took one look at me, stepped towards me.. and then turned tail and ran the other way into one of the pastures. It infuriates me when she does this.

This wouldn't a big deal (just a headache), except we have coyotes/hogs/deer/wild dogs/bobcats and other predators that come after smaller prey.. like a domestic dog. Eventually she comes back to me, which is amazing.. but I can't have her running around like that.
She also has a terrible habit of getting into the horse pastures and barking at them, she won't chase them or hurt them.. just barks. Anyone that knows anything about horses would know that this can send some of them into a frenzy and into a fence really quick. The horses that are being bred here are racing horses. These horses, on average, range between 100,000-400,000 dollars. Especially the pregnant mares that they have.

My internship boss has already warned me that if a horse gets hurt at my dogs expense, then I'm the one to blame and I'll be in a lot of trouble. Which is what I expect really. I wouldn't want some animal chasing down my prized horses.

I know I can leave her at home, but it breaks my heart. My roommates also don't like that she howls while she's in her kennel.

So here I am, on Reddit. Does anyone have any tricks or something that I can use to help her learn to come when called and to stay by my side without a leash on her?

The ones that I've tried are being really ""happy"" when they come over, give them a treat and tell them what a good dog they are. Another is the shock collar.. but I don't know how she'll react and they are a bit pricey. I don't want to make a purchase and have her not respond the right way. Another thing about shock collars that worries me is that some people say it causes a distrust between the dog and owner? She already hides and whimpers when I give her a swat on the bottom for doing things like digging in the trash.

The thought crossed my mind tonight, just to give her to a no kill shelter and get a good dog. I don't want to do that.. but what else can I do?

Help please? My dog is broken and I don't know what to do to fix her. :("

**Edit** Thanks everyone for all the input! Not really set on MD but my state only has one DO school that I know of, so it complicates things a bit.

I've been working at a defense company as an software developer intern since 2008 (I'll graduate university with a MS in CS in 2014 after my BS in 2013). Getting good experience at said company, and they let me work on whatever project I want. Lots of interesting work to be had, though I've worked on most of their major products by now. They also got me a very good level of security clearance -- I won't go into that but it's definitely worth something. I am working there this summer.


Today I got a call from a Microsoft recruiter who I had previously talked to. I'm ""at the top of his list"" and he wants me to intern at MS next summer (2013). He warned me against staying in the defense industry, saying that I'll be stuck doing only defense jobs unless I branch out. While I don't totally believe him seeing as I've done work in biology and web hosting, he is right in that it seems nearly all the defense jobs are in the DC area (where I am from). Also, I don't really like DC and want to move after I graduate.


Some pros and cons of going to Microsoft for me below.

Pros:

-Get experience with different technologies and programming languages.

-Get to work at a larger company and see if I like it -- company I work for now has ~300 employees

-Get to leave DC and live in my dream city (Seattle)

-Pay increased by a metric shit-ton. I made $19/hr last summer (likely getting a raise to $21 or $25 this summer). MS paid my buddy $35/hr.



Cons:

-In all honesty, I really am not excited about any MS products that are out there right now. I enjoy the Kinect, but that's about it. Hell, I'm not even sure I'd like to do development for it.

-As I understand it, my security clearance (job security in my eyes, though please correct me if I'm wrong) will be wiped out. It will be near impossible to get the same clearance again if I end up not coming back to defense industry jobs.

-Will have to rent own apartment and have living expenses. At my current internship I can save money, live at home, get (free) home-cooked food, and drive 5 mins to get to work.

-Will not have any freedom as to which project I work on. MS will assign me wherever they think I'm useful and there's a good chance they might want me to be a developer in test (I detest being a tester...see what I did there? ;] )


One question I have: how often does defense work pop up outside of the Virginia/MD/DC area? I think its a great line of work, but I don't want to get stuck like the recruiter mentions. Thanks in advance reddit!

I am incapable of commenting on their performance without them getting insulted and taking it the wrong way. I am the senior member of the team and work closely with the coaches to analyze our rounds and fix the weak points, but I find that I am incapable of phrasing my feedback in a way that doesn't hurt feelings. 

I've never worked in a high-pressure workplace, this is probably the most difficult thing I've ever had to do. I have almost no interpersonal ability, and if I don't address this issue soon, we won't be able to get into the upper levels of post-season competition. I don't want to cost them or myself that success. Reddit, can you help me improve my interpersonal style and gain their trust?

pinwp,2,2012-02-09,"All the cliche questions you are probably tired of hearing, but asked much worse than normal [building a resume and why go to grad school]",ThrowawayAspirations,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/pinwp/all_the_cliche_questions_you_are_probably_tired/,"OK, I'm bored and anxious, so I'm going to throw out a broad, stupid array of questions, that I will probably look back on with embarrassment sooner than I normally do:

So I am 25, am a HS dropout, I just got my GED, and want to be an engineer. I know doing this at all is going to be really tough, and I'm sure a few semesters at community college will answer a lot of these questions, and change my ambitions, but if you guys could humor my ridiculousness, I would appreciate it.

First, I plan to go to a two-year school, and transfer in to high-ranked program, most likely for mechanical. I have never really worked before, and clearly look like a tremendous loser to employers. So:

1) With no real resume or connections, and at my age, will I find it impossible to find co-ops and internships? 

2) Would joining things like robotics teams and FSAE teams help me with that? 

3) And also, how hard would it be to join those sorts of clubs at most schools? Do they have some sort of merit-based acceptance system, where I would find joining difficult? Especially coming into a better school from a community college, would I be shut out of participating at a better school with a lot of promising engineering students?

3a) Same questions for research positions.

Next, let's say I don't wash out. I pull my shit together, keep my grades up, get a couple internships and do some research (I know nothing about ""research,"" I just read some other people mention it, and it sounds potentially important and interesting), and end up earning a a mechanical engineering degree with a great GPA (not even sure what is considered great tbh. &gt;3.5? Depend on the school?). My next fantasy is to get an MS in either mechanical or Aerospace from MIT. My questions here are: 

4) I know this is probably a hard question to guess at, but from your understanding, could I plausibly get in like that? How much would I have to stand out, other than just good grades?

5) If so, is there much chance I would not have to pay the $40K/year, which I would rather not go into debt for? I've heard a lot of grad students get TA-type jobs and pay little, but I would assume to get that sort of thing at a school like MIT, you have to be fairly special?

6) This is an absolutely absurd question to come in this order, I know, but why would I get an MS? I read that people who go into ""research and development"" tend to need an MS, and while that sounds cool to me, I don't even know what that means. Like, how would that differ from most mechanical or aerospace jobs? (Again, sorry, I know these are different fields and my post only gets stupider. I just don't know how better to ask. To shine more light on this, I want to get my BS in MechE because I think it's probably a better thing to major in, but then I would consider Aerospace for the MS, because once I have crossed over to fantasy land, I might as well start to dream the rocketeering dream.)

Sorry for the barrage of questions there; any bit of that you could offer an opinion on or anything would be cool. Thanks for reading this either way."

The flipside to that is that I could stay in the lab that I already work at and continue to research under a grad student like I have been doing since fall 2010 (I did research through last summer).

I've been a bit reticent to speak my mind about what's been ailing me, as it pales in comparison to what so many of you are going through, but in some capacity I feel that much worse for feeling so terrible about this situation...So, I guess I'm really just here to vent/seek impartial advice regarding coping strategies.  

Anyway, I'm a 26 y/o male who is studying out of the country for two years.   Prior to leaving for my first semester I met a girl (also 26) who was a co-worker.  She and I got along swimmingly.  Any time we were hanging out, it was always a blast, and it was fairly obvious that we both had crushes on each other. We finally hooked up before I left, but it was obviously a day late and a dollar short.  So, we continued to communicate every now and again via facebook messages, and it always brightened my day a little bit (I think it's important to note at this point that I think she was kind of seeing someone, although I'm not sure. I didn't really ask). Fast forward four months, I come home and we start hanging out much more frequently, and things really start to develop into something more meaningful.  

So, August rolls around and I had to leave for school again; at this point I'm unbearably sad. I was leaving my friends and family for four months again and I really felt that our relationship (not in the 'official' sense, as we weren't technically together) was simply not strong enough to survive four months of such separation.  But, lo and behold, we continued talking every day on the phone and online.  It sounds really lame, but this really impressed me.  Neither one of us necessarily had to do it, but we wanted to, and it seemed that things might actually work out. So, I spent all of this time becoming emotionally devoted/attached to the girl.

Then around mid-October or so she calls out of the blue and says ""I don't know what you expect when you get home...Things may get messy."" I respond ""well, I don't want to be so presumptuous as to say I EXPECT anything (lying like a rug) but I hope for the best for us, and that we'll be fine."" The next day she implored me to forget that whole thing ever happened.  

So, I come home in mid-December. The past two weeks she had been kind of strange. and I felt that she was trying to distance herself from me. She also had backed out of a trip to come pick me up (one of her friends canceled), and so I had been kind of having weird feelings toward her for it. I get home and I see a message ""are you home?!?"" ""Is there a number where I can reach you?""  So I didn't want to totally give up on the situation...Maybe she's just nervous? I don't know. I hadn't liked a girl this consistently for a long time, and I didn't want to give up that easy. Anyway, I talk to her a day or two later and she's just weird. So I did the manly thing and texted her 'I'm really ambivalent about hanging out because I don't know how you're feeling. what's been going on the past few weeks?'  ""I've been ambivalent too. I started dating someone, so I thought it might be awkward.  I should have told u (sic) sooner.""

I told her I was hurt and I felt like a big dumbass and that's about all I have to say.  She sent me a message back and I didn't even read it. Deleted from facebook, hit the gym, and literally lawyered up (as I had gotten in an accident while I was all screwed up about it that day). Two weeks later it's the day after my birthday and she texts ""happy belated birthday."" and I say ""hey, thanks buddy. I am kind of glad you texted because I kind of wanted to eat crow for being so pissy the other day. Hope your internship goes well."" And I felt so good in that moment. Then she seemed to be intentionally cold to me: ""well, I just wanted to say happy birthday."" I didn't respond. She then asked when I was leaving and if I wanted to hang out before then. I declined. I feel like I handled things as I should have, and I guess part of what I need is affirmation of that from someone impartial.

Anyway, this all happened like a month and a half/two months ago, and I just feel that my response has been disproportionate to the scenario.  I've dealt with a breakup from a (much more meaningful) 3.5 year relationship where the breakup literally lasted 4 years (talk about messy) so I thought this would be a walk in the park. However, it hasn't been. I wake up early in the morning/middle of the night, sometimes thinking of her and just thinking 'how could she do me like that?' She was someone I really trusted to not do me wrong. Sometimes I just spend all day feeling alone and miserable even when I'm hanging out with friends. I have many of the typical signs of depression. I have found that it gets better and worse, but I thought I would certainly be over it by now; it seems that it is worse than it was when I first left home.

I haven't actually seen the girl in like 6 months, and I have no idea how anyone can have such an effect on me. I think that a lot of it had to do with the feeling of loss of control over the situation; she made this decision unilaterally without talking to me, and there was nothing I could do but get her out of my life. I still have this awful idea that I want to talk to her or something. I also feel incredibly selfish for not accepting the fact that her relationship now is probably making her happier than being with someone so far away.

tl;dr: Guy leaves country for four months, comes back to find his love interest is not so interested in him anymore, but more interested in another dude.  Guy is still incommensurately upset about the whole ordeal and would like to stop being depressed about it."

It involves writing your best/most memorable date in San Diego after liking the page.

I'll be honest and confess I work as the FB/Twitter intern there. However, we have a very low amount of 'likes' and I'm very fond of this subreddit (and reddit in general) and I want to open up the chance of winning to people who might actually be interested in the prizes. Our current 'fan base' is not extremely active on the page and I want at least a couple of people to legitimately participate to make the contest fun and interesting.

We have a bunch of coupons and vouchers similar to the one we'll be giving out on Valentine's Day so liking and keeping up with the page won't be too detrimental for ya'll because we'll keep giving out stuff on a decently regular basis. If nobody is too upset, I'll also gladly let everyone know here when those things are happening in case the prize is worth the 'like.' 

The Balboa Passports are valued at $125.00 each. Winner gets two passports. Contest rules will be explained on the page and all you need to participate is 'like' the page and then share with us a fun, memorable date in San Diego.

If you have any questions, let me know.

Thank you!

This is for disabled veterans with a service connected disability and have a honorable discharge. This fee waiver covered my tuition up until Graduate school (I went private). Here are the common misconceptions I have worked with.

- Applicant has to be the Resident of CA not the Veteran. 
- All ratings of disability are eligible (even 0%)
- 27 is the supposed cutoff age of one plan. I've heard of people appealing this and getting this benefit at the age of 31.
- If this rating is 100% service-connected disability or 100% ""unemployable"" your are eligible for Chapter 35* and there is no age limit just an income limit.
- Apply if you get a rejection it doesn't hurt to appeal it.

Feel free to ask me questions. I've put this up because I have recently meet meet people who graduated from college and was eligible for this. I am pretty sure the CDVA or CVSO does not do repayments. Thank you all for your service to our country.

pkvxi,3,2012-02-11,Does anyone on Reddit know of any helpful engineering positions in Africa?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pkvxi/does_anyone_on_reddit_know_of_any_helpful/,"I am sorry if this is the wrong subreddit. I think my question makes most sense here though.

I have come to a crossroads in my life. I graduated in June 2010 with a Mechanical Engineering degree and have been working since June 2009 within that field in various capacities (intern, design engineer, project manager). I feel, that for someone my age, I have a ton of experience.

The problem is, I don't find it very satisfying anymore. The idea that the rest of my life is going to spent making money for myself and others isn't as fulfilling as it once was. I am convinced that I really need to use my skills, education, and experience to help other people for a while before I settle down. I am a very practical, hands on engineer and I feel that I would really be an asset to a developing country.

I have had many friends go to Africa on study abroad programs and they loved the experience. I myself have never been but it's been in the back of my mind for a long time now.

The questions is how do I get into engineering within the African continent? Does anyone have experience with what it is I'm trying to do? I have already looked at a few volunteer programs and job portals related to Africa but wanted to get Reddit's perspective on this. Even if it's not a straight engineering opportunity, as long as it's technical in nature I think I'll be of use. I have volunteered before and I always found it fulfilling. I want to leave the country for a year or two and live somewhere else. Although it would be nice, I don't need to be paid much. Just enough to live on while I'm there. 

If it helps, I'm 24, speak pretty good French (definitely room for improvement though, especially writing), am a citizen of USA and Switzerland, currently work in Southern California for a manufacturing company as a design engineer. I am ready to move on with my life as soon as May (I have a moral obligation to my current employer until end of April). I am currently working towards my EIT certificate. 

EDIT: The stuff about being paid."

I've been thinking about death, and how once you are dead, you are dead. There is no magical land of happiness, there is nobody waiting for you on the other side. Nothing but darkness. No more playing, no more loving, no more being you. It makes me worried. It makes me almost want to cry. In fact, as I'm typing this, I'm blinking back tears. I love life, things may be shitty sometimes, but I know there is always tomorrow. Then I realized, at one point there will be no tomorrow, there will be no more me. Just all the silly accomplishments that will soon disappear into history. 100 years after my death, nobody will remember me. It'll be as though I never existed. I wish I were ignorant sometimes. I wish I had belief so that I could reassure myself that my family will be with me when I pass, I'll have someone to hold me when I'm scared, someone to help me continue on when I need it most. As I type right now, I'm crying. I can't help but to. I'm tired of being depressed about something that won't happen for a long time. But I can't get it out of my head. This is helping a bit, letting out what I have to say. Though I know ultimately, this will go overlooked, and the 5 minutes I've spent typing this has been 5 minutes less I have doing something that actually matters. I have terrible grades, right now I have a 2.4, in my junior year, and have no idea what I want to do. I keep getting pressured to make a decision, and yelled at that what I'm doing is wrong. I feel like after high school, life is over. I have to actually figure out what I'm going to do, how to live, and how to function in society. I'm just not ready for that though, I feel like I have so much more exploring to do, so many things I still have to try before I'm stuck with adulthood where my mess ups change from: OOPS, OH WELL! to: You're homeless. I'm having trouble finding a direction in life, mostly because the things I'm good at, aren't what I want to do when I grow up. I'm good at computers, I'm a fast learner, but my grades right now prevent me from going to a college to get a degree so I can actually turn my skill into a job. I want to be a mechanical engineer, mostly because of all the fun I've had at an internship, and every time I tell my parents that I don't want to go to college, I get yelled at. At this point, I feel like a complete mess up, I'm ruining my life day by day. My depression makes it harder to focus in school, which makes it near impossible to get good grades. I'm currently looking for a psychologist so I can maybe get some medication for my severe depression, but it's taking a while finding the right fit for me. At this point, it's just been me rambling, and not asking a real question. I'm looking for an alternative to college, something that will help me pursue a career in computer science, or mechanical engineering. Do you guys know of anything in Oregon that is like that? Also, any recommendations for my depression? Right now I feel completely alone, and am in need of some light to guide me down the path to a happier life. Please, I'm desperately in need of help.....
TLDR; I'm a depressed whiner who can't make up his mind about what he can do with his shitty life."

[X-Post]",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pkezp/ive_made_great_strides_in_the_last_year_but_still/,"Pre TL;DR: Fucked up childhood spent entirely by myself, almost no free-time, no friends. What do/how fix?

I've personally made leaps and bounds over the last year or so with my social life and self-image. I've slimmed down and lost over 75 pounds, mostly cleared up my face with the help of r/wicked_edge, and started dressing nicer thanks to r/malefashionadvice. I also realized that being 6'6"" doesn't make me a freak, and that I can actually be attractive. I've started being a lot more outgoing, less shy, and generally don't avoid social settings any more. r/askseddit has been awesome for making me see that I was being a complete AFC/Nice Guy‚Ñ¢, and I've pretty much stopped being Mr. Friend Zone Magnet.

What I've had a considerably harder time with is actually getting out and doing things, due to a large combination of factors:

* Going to a small, technical school/community college with almost no common-areas/school events. Each major is essentially the same people moving in one group from class to class, never getting larger. All 5 of my classes take place in 3 rooms, with the same 10 people every day/class. Like Majors are grouped together in Gen-Eds, so instead of being an opportunity for meeting women, it's a giant clusterfuck of CS/Engineers. To make matters worse, the building all my classes are in is off by itself, and houses all the sciencey/technical classes.
* I work ~30 hours a week: 24 at a (paid) internship, and ~8 during the week as a CNA at a Nursing Home. The CNA hours are all evening hours, generally two days a week from 5:30pm-9:30pm. Every other weekend, I work from 2:45pm-10:45pm Saturday and Sunday, so that's pretty much two entire weekends a month wasted.
* I still live at home. Although I live in a smallish rural town, I'm just ~35 mins away from Sioux Falls, SD, the biggest city in South Dakota(not saying much, when compared to Minneapolis/St. Paul). College/Internship is there, and Nursing Home is a 5-minute walk from my house. The town is almost stereotypical in that it's full of all the people that couldn't escape/got pregnant in junior-high/barely scraped by on their GED and never gave a thought to anything beyond that.

All of the above has pretty much ground me into a routine of: classes -&gt; work -&gt; homework -&gt; shower -&gt; reading/Reddit -&gt; bed at midnight/1am -&gt; get back up at 6:45am and repeat. Only having 4 days a month completely work-free and to myself has pretty much ruined any chance I have of having a normal social-life.

I really don't regret the above, because it's enabled me to maintain a 3.8+GPA, and just yesterday I paid my last tuition payment off in it's entirety, and am currently ~$2K in the black. My internship is going extremely well, and in about 11 months they're quite likely to give me a job-offer that I'll probably accept, while taking night-classes for my Bachelors in Programming.

I might add that I was born in Japan, my father being a missionary/pastor, and pretty much spent my whole life up until 18 there. Due to complicated shit involving, but not limited to:

* Never really staying in one place for much more than 3-4 years while in Japan, and being almost completely isolated while there due to never really learning fluent Japanese
* Mild ADD/ADHD that I've managed to get/work beyond.
* A mis-diagnosis of Tourette's syndrome that lead to some pretty serious over-medication that left me a zombie for most of my middle-school and high-school years.
* The ""Tourettes"" resulted in me being sent to a school for the mentally-handicapped for 3 grades around middle-school.
* Being sent to a ""youth-home""/boot-camp in the armpit of Montana for all of my high-school years. Run by a stereotypical christian fundamentalist husband/wife. Imagine the type of people who talk about Obama being a Muslim, and not even having an American birth certificate. Every aspect of their lives and personalities was in some way linked to God/church/the Bible.

All of this led to me being a loner my entire life, never having friends for much more than 2 years at a time, with parents who never really trusted me.

With the above wall-o-text said, I have no friends outside of class, almost no free-time, and no idea what to do with myself when I do have some. I really don't want to spend this weekend reading/puttering around on personal projects. I'm planning on bouncing around town tomorrow, but really have no idea of how to fill a day or what to actually do with myself beyond crashing in Barnes &amp; Noble all day. I have no idea where the college bars are, and no one to tell me. Any suggestions?

The internship, with a small team of 8, is in charge of creating videos for the University's homepage. Currently, the running themes include: Meet the Student, meet the professor, meet some of the technologies being researched on campus.

The State University of 40,000+'s YouTube subscriber count is (no kidding) under 60. The average video views do not exceed 200. The quality of the videos is very high, but it isn't generating the type of viewers it could. Perhaps its a failure of marketing, video direction, or both.

The school did not know anything about YouTube's Annotations, or frankly - NEVER HEARD OF REDDIT. So I thought I could help modernise these guys and possibily (through hard work in creating additional videos) garnish a job there. 

What would you guys recommend the University do? 

1. New types of marketing techniques? What types? Where should the videos be posted? How should they be presented? 
2. A ""subscribe"" campaign to get people revisiting the site for more videos down the line? How would that work?

Only having 4 days a month completely work-free and to myself has pretty much ruined any chance I have of having a normal social-life.

I really don't regret the above, because it's enabled me to maintain a 3.8+GPA, and just yesterday I paid my last tuition payment off in it's entirety, and am currently ~$2K in the black. My internship is going extremely well, and in about 11 months they're quite likely to give me a job-offer that I'll probably accept, while taking night-classes for my Bachelors in Programming.

I might add that I was born in Japan, my father being a missionary/pastor, and pretty much spent my whole life up until 18 there. Due to complicated shit involving, but not limited to:

* Never really staying in one place for much more than 3-4 years while in Japan, and being almost completely isolated while there due to never really learning fluent Japanese
* Mild ADD/ADHD that I've managed to get/work beyond.
* A mis-diagnosis of Tourette's syndrome that lead to some pretty serious over-medication that left me a zombie for most of my middle-school and high-school years.
* The ""Tourettes"" resulted in me being sent to a school for the mentally-handicapped for 3 grades around middle-school.
* Being sent to a ""youth-home""/boot-camp in the armpit of Montana for all of my high-school years. Run by a stereotypical christian fundamentalist husband/wife. Imagine the type of people who talk about Obama being a Muslim, and not even having an American birth certificate. Every aspect of their lives and personalities was in some way linked to God/church/the Bible.

All of this led to me being a loner my entire life, never having friends for much more than 2 years at a time, with parents who never really trusted me.

With the above wall-o-text said, I have no friends outside of class, almost no free-time, and no idea what to do with myself when I do have some. I really don't want to spend this weekend reading/puttering around on personal projects. I'm planning on bouncing around town tomorrow, but really have no idea of how to fill a day or what to actually do with myself beyond crashing in Barnes &amp; Noble all day. I have no idea where the college bars are, and no one to tell me. Any suggestions?

TL;DR: Fucked up childhood spent entirely by myself, almost no free-time, no friends. What do/how fix?"
pkbmk,7,2012-02-10,Sexxit: Is Sex a legitimate reason to end a relationship?,[deleted],sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/pkbmk/sexxit_is_sex_a_legitimate_reason_to_end_a/,"I'll preface this by saying that sex isn't the only reason behind my doubts as to whether or not I want to continue dating my girlfriend, but it does weigh heavily.  We have a lot of disagreements over school and money and whatever else.  If fact we're currently staring down the barrel of a long distance relationship as I'm leaving for an internship over the summer and she's staying to do... whatever.  However, what I currently find most frustrating is our sex life, or lack thereof.

As a college student I feel surrounded by sex, so much so that I feel upset that I'm no longer having any.  My girlfriend and I used to have a very active sex life; everything seemed fine.  Then we both got very busy last semester and our sex life fell off a metaphorical cliff.  Every once and a while we'd make time for it, but while it seemed great to me apparently she just wasn't that into it.  I always felt a great deal more open to it than she.  It started to seem as if she was avoiding it.

I've brought it up many times that I'm frustrated about this.  I personally feel that it's an important part of an intimate relationship, and that once you've established that kind of relationship, it's unreasonable to renegotiate, so to speak.  Her typical response is to accuse me of being some sort of machismo pig, saying that I'm giving her an ultimatum to have sex or I'll leave her, an act that she says would basically be on par with rape.

I see do see her point.  I obviously don't want to have sex because that's what keeps us together.  And I was partly to blame for often having other things I needed to do rather than spend time with her.  But still, am I being unreasonable here?  What would you do if your partner didn't want a sexual relationship while you did?  

And sorry for the essay, I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read it."

She was invited by her representative that she interns for and used the opportunity to do a lot of networking. While she was there, she was cornered in her hotel and verbally assaulted by members of the Occupy movement.

While trying to leave her hotel going about her own business, Occupy members paid by a labor union surrounded her hotel, chanting and calling her a bigot, racist, and sexist. The group she was with tried to escape from the back of the hotel but that too was surrounded. The protesters began to invade in the hotel, swarming the lobby. Not only was she hurt by the horrible names she was called, my friend genuinely feared for her safety.

I am disgusted with any and all of you that were involved. Both my friend and I support the ideas of Occupy (me more than her), and we are both Libertarians with a conservative flair.

This is a 2nd account because my fiancee knows my main account info and I don't want him to see this and get hurt. 

To start off with, I have been with my fiancee for 2 years and 4 months now. We love each other very much. We have been through terrible and wonderful things. For the most part we have had a great relationship. 

BUT recently things have changed. He recently developed an anxiety disorder from all the stress in his life. It started in Nov. of 2010. He went to basic training and hurt his back pretty bad. He was medically discharged from the National Guard. The National Guard was his life and he planned everything. But when he was discharged everything changed. He came back home to live with his grandparents. His grandparents moved while he was at training and they could never go live back at the house my fiancee grew up in. He became depressed about that. He had no idea what to do with himself. Then in Jan of 2011 I had a huge fight with my parents and went to go live with my fiancee and his grandparents. 

For about 6 months we did nothing. No school. No job. Nothing. His grandparents were very nice to have us live and eat there rent free. Then his mother came to live with us too. That is where a lot of family drama stated. And his two aunts added to the mixture, constantly screwing other members of the family for their own benefit. 

In the summer I got a job and started to pay off my car again to my dad. Saved quite a bit of money. He still didn't have a job though. Then my job ended (it was only a 90 day internship) in August and he got a job around that time. So things were ok.

Until his grandfather was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer in the neck. It devastated my fiancee. And I think it really began to depress him. Then in early October my fiancee had to quit his job. He was getting panic attacks everyday at work. The best part was he didn't have any insurance then either. So we were then back to neither one of us having a job, both of us being depressed and not doing anything. The panic attacks kept getting a lot worse. His grandparents had some Xanex to help him through it all but it didnt work that great. 

Finally in December he was able to insurance again and able to see a doctor. Also in December we finally moved and signed up for school. Things were looking better. The doctor prescribed him Lorazepam and we just had to wait and see if it would help his panic attacks. 

Well we started going to school last month and moved in but the meds the doctor gave him didn't work. So the doctor upped the dosage. And ever since then he has changed. He is a very sweet person in nature but lately...he has anger flashes, says the meanest things and can't control what he does or says. His panic attacks are decreasing but He turns into a gigantic asshole. And I can't stand it anymore. I love him so much. And I want the best for him. I just don't know how to deal with it. I do so much for him. And he doesn't give much back because of the side effects of the meds. 

Please 2X, give me any advice you have. I really need it. I don't know what to do besides get mad at him then feel like a jerk because its a side effect of the meds he is taking. Please help. 

**TL;DR:**My fiancee and I have been together 2 yrs and 4 months. The past year got him really depressed and he developed anxiety disorder. He finally saw the doctor and they prescribed him Lorazepam. The medicine is making the horrible panic attacks go away but turning him into a gigantic ass because it's one of the side effects. I don't know how to deal with it. I get angry at him all the time because of the things he says. Please help."

Here's a quick recap of the last 5 years of my life:
2 Construction internships (Arizona, California). The California internship was over two summers and provided great experience, but it was in 2007 and 2008.

Graduated 2009, company I interned with wasn't offering positions due to the recession, couldn't find an entry level job and went into..

Manufacturing! Started a position making $38,500 a year in Chicago + overtime, however I didn't enjoy anything about the job and the company was bought out. Worked here for a year and a half, saved up money, layoffs started occurring and I ended up bicycle touring thirteen countries  across Europe.

Returned to Chicago, picked up a temp job at an advertising firm and now working a second job at a law firm.

My question: I'm currently trying to launch a career in some kind of project management. The construction industry is picking up but it seems that the companies only want people with years of experience (which is plentiful) or students straight out of college. Also, my last experience in the construction industry was four years ago.

Currently I am looking for an entry level job in project management (IE project coordinator, assistant PM, etc) and am considering getting a PMI certificate.

Should I stay in the construction industry or get a PMI certificate and just try to find any project management related job?

TLDR; Construction internships &gt; Graduated, no luck in entry level &gt; Manufacturing &gt; Bicycle Trip &gt; Temp Jobs &gt; Not sure if I should try to continue in the construction industry or aim for something else.

I'd be happy to provide more information if necessary."

pmd0i,15,2012-02-12,Technical Internship Interview Ideas/Tips,Psyko_Koolaid,Theatre,https://www.reddit.com/r/Theatre/comments/pmd0i/technical_internship_interview_ideastips/,"I want to begin by saying that I am in no way the ultimate authority on this, and it is very likely that I‚Äôm not the first person to come up with these ideas. These are just my observations after sitting in a conference room all day doing 10 minute interviews with students/recent grads that were primarily looking for internships. I‚Äôm the ATD of a medium sized, professional summer theatre company.  I‚Äôll be spending all of next Saturday interviewing people at another large audition/interview conference, and I wanted to post my current thoughts.

First things first, breathe. I understand you really want a job, and that there is a lot of stress that goes along with interviewing. The first thing I‚Äôm going to do when you come for an interview with me is shake your hand. Give me a nice firm handshake in return and calmly introduce yourself. I‚Äôm not going to bite, and I‚Äôm not going to brutally interrogate you.  I say this because I had many interactions this weekend where people were so nervous that their hands were shaking throughout the interview. I may not exactly look soft and cuddly, but I‚Äôm also not Santa Fe Opera. (Not that they are terrifying in any way either, just using a well known name to make a point.) The worst thing that could happen to you in the next 10 minutes is that you don‚Äôt impress me. While that isn‚Äôt desirable, it‚Äôs not a reason to torture yourself.


My next bit of advice may seem obvious but be aware of the time constraints. If this is an event where interviews are tightly scheduled do your best to stick to it. Be on time, and be aware of how long you‚Äôre spending on explanations/questions. If you bring your portfolio don‚Äôt expect to be able to cover it all in a 10 minute time slot. Ideally I‚Äôm going to want to look at and discuss your resume, and chat in general about your experience level and/or goals. In my mind I want to try and gauge how well you would fit a position in both personality and skill. I do want to see the portfolio, but I don‚Äôt want that to be the bulk of a first interview. Pick out a few key pages and explain the relevant parts until about 1 minute before your slot ends. I will always ask questions if I have them.


Do your research, and come with questions. Knowing a little something about the company you are interviewing for goes a long way. If I don‚Äôt have to take 1-2 minutes to explain the kind of work we produce that leaves us more time to talk about your skills and examine your work. Take 5 minutes of your own time to check out our season and look at some photos, and if you want more specific information ask me. One or two intelligent questions will make you stick out.
I saw a lot of freshman and sophomore students who had a resume full of any credit they could list. I understand the necessity of doing this in your first few years. I had to do it too. Several times when I asked these students what they specialized in or what they were looking for they would answer, ‚ÄúEverything,‚Äù or ‚ÄúAnything.‚Äù No. You can‚Äôt specialize in everything. I want you to have a well rounded knowledge of technical work, but I want you to have a passion for a more specific area within it. Pick an area that suits your strengths, or that you want to hone your skill in. *In my opinion* there is nothing wrong with saying something like, ‚ÄúI got my start as a carpenter, but I‚Äôve developed an interest in electrics so I‚Äôve also been taking as many electrician positions as I can in the past year.‚Äù


My last bit of advice is to be excited and engaged. I‚Äôm likely doing interviews all day. You‚Äôre likely to be doing the same thing. If you come to me with zero confidence or are so anxious that you can‚Äôt hold a conversation it doesn't give me much to go with in terms of approximating your abilities or personality. If you‚Äôre really tired, or really nervous, fake it. Sit up straight, look me in the eyes and smile. If I can‚Äôt get you engaged in the interview I‚Äôm likely to lump you in with the mob of people who I know I interviewed, but can‚Äôt remember a thing about. Don‚Äôt barrage me with fake pep, but be warm and honest. If my BS meter goes off that is the first thing I‚Äôm going to remember. I like to challenge people. If I‚Äôm asking a lot of questions it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm trying to get you to break out of the standard, ‚Äòsafe‚Äô responses. I want you to sell yourself as a whole person, not just as your resume.
Again, I‚Äôm not the final word on any of this. There are other people who have other priorities. These are the things that matter to me when I talk with people looking for internships. Everyone interviews differently, and some of this becomes less crucial in longer interviews or on a 2nd or 3rd interview. Still, I feel that the some of the general ideas are useful in any interview.


**tl;dr**

* 1. Be calm. It‚Äôs an interview not an interrogation.
* 2. If you only have 10 minutes, use them well.
* 3. Know who you‚Äôre talking to.
* 4. Be well rounded, but have specific skills/goals.
* 5. Be confident and honest. I want to hire a person, not a resume.

Well I did a few placements and interned at a couple of design agencies but I was offered an internship at a fantastic agency on the Southbank by London Bridge and after working there since the start of this year, being asked to stay on for a few extra weeks, spending ¬£100s a week on train tickets and 2 and a half hour journeys each way every day just to get to work and back as well as depriving myself of any gaming goodness this year so far, I was offered a full time permanent position on Friday and they want me to start tomorrow! :3

I don't mean to sound like I'm trying to boost my ego, I just thought anyone else who is in the same situation might want to know there is a silver lining. The job market is incredibly hostile at the moment, especially for graduates and most people I know are in the same cycle of rejection letters. However keep your chin up, work hard, prove you have the skills required, be prepared to keep learning and it's so important to be positive and keep smiling. I don't think its quite sunk in yet but I guess when I get a place to live sorted and move in...

In other news, when's the next London meet up going to be? I could do with some new friends down south :p

Much love to all :3 xxx"
plyro,36,2012-02-12,Highschool student with sysadmin aspirations. Where do I start?,aloha2436,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/plyro/highschool_student_with_sysadmin_aspirations/,"So the first thing I knew when I was younger was that when I grew up I wanted to do something with computers. They're just cool. I have a thing for systems and complexity, and have always enjoyed finding out how to do things myself and apply them to different problems.  
  
So my question is twofold:  
With how I've described myself, would I enjoy being a sysadmin?  
Secondly, what should I do if this is my aim?   
I'm currently doing an IT/Math/Management heavy courseload for my final years of high school, but my main concern is where to go after.  
Should I get a four year degree?  
Should I go straight for an internship?  
Should I focus on certs or similar things?  
As a side note, I run a home server with linux installed for fun, but I find that it's time consuming to self-learn it, and I haven't found anything particularly useful for learning linux. Is there anything you would reccomend?  
TL;DR What should an aspiring sysadmin in high school do? What did you do? Did it work well? Would you do anything different?

plvua,16,2012-02-12,Stories?,FearlessEyes,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/plvua/stories/,"I've read all the stories underneath the 'birth stories' category on the sidebar. I was just wondering if anyone had some stories that weren't shared there, or, if you have a specific way you'd like your labor to go? I'll start~!

My BEST FRIEND (and sister in law) just had her baby at 4:57pm, July 11th (She was over due. We always joked how she would be overdue and I would be early and we'd have the babies on the same day. Well...) and we had just gotten back home from a day of visiting her in the hospital and spending time with family. My fiance had just went to bed since he had a long day ahead of him for work. Me being 36 weeks pregnant.. I didn't exactly like to sleep when he slept (I wanted the WHOLE bed.) and I cleaned while he was sleeping a lot. well, I had just sat down after some rigorous cleaning and I had coughed and felt some fluid leak out. I thought 'DAMN IT I peed again.' so I got up, emptied my bladded. Opted to leave my pants OFF and continue cleaning. I knelt down to pick something up and suddenly.. more leaking on the floor! Except a lot more than what just a trickle of pee would be. My first instinct was to get down even lower and smell it. Did NOT smell like urine at all. I jump up. Excited as all high hell because I was 99% sure my water broke. At this time it was 12am. I run into the room, tell my fiance my water broke and his response was 'WHAT!? Okay.' and went back to sleep. I shook my head and decided to pack. Realizing I have NO bags to put stuff in (except for my old highschool backpack that I refuse to part with) I call my mom's house. my 15 year old sister answered the phone.
Me: ASHLEY. is mom there?
Ashey: ... -suspicion in voice- ..She's sleeping.. what.. why....?
Me: My water broke.
Proceed to hear phone fly across the house and her scream 'MOM! MOM MOM MOM MOM' as she races down the hallway. 
Go to wake up fiance again. 'STEPHEN. I'M IN LABOR' 
'OKAY. -back to sleep-'
My sister and her friend who happened to be sleeping over come over and help me pack. I tell them to beware of wetspots. all I get is an 'EWH THAT'S WHAT I STEPPED IN!?' 

After 5 more attempts of waking up fiance and one FINALLY being successful (after punching him in the crotch lightly [I play dirty.]) we begin our 30 minute drive to the city. at the outskirts of the city awaits my other good friend who decided to come and help with anything for the first 4 hours of my labor.

I was MISDIAGNOSED with MRSA. it's contagious. SO I WAS ON QUARANTINE. Doctors treated me like shit until I got into the actual delivery room. When I arrived in the delivery room my contractions were steady and I was at 4cm. Here's the kicker. I don't remember 75% of my labor. There are video recordings of me SCREAMING my head off. I only remember crying. LADIES. if you ask for an epidural MAKE SURE YOU REQUEST that it is only the attending/head anesthesiologist doing it. I'm not afraid of needles but the thought of a needle going into my SPINE and not being allowed to move while they were doing it TERRIFIED ME. I got an intern. HE STUCK ME THREE TIMES before he got the actual attending. I was vomiting and crying because I was terrified. My anesthesiologist was great though. He tried to make me feel better with little jokes. like 'Is this your first time? MINE TOO!' I called him an ass a few times. He said I'd be back in 9 months ;) After the epidural I was in HEAVEN. Until.. It stopped working on the right half of my body. the screaming started again apparently. my sister told me she had called my mother (who was in the room with us) and she said that all she heard was screaming. She was convinced I was dying. Next thing I know I'm telling the doctors it feels like I have to crap. Literally. They checked me and I was at 8-9 centimeters! Almost time to push! We quickly rushed visitors (My other BFF and her boyfriend came to visit and wait for baby to be born.) out of the room as the nurses began to talk me through things (BIRTHING CLASSES ARE A WASTE OF TIME. I FORGOT EVERYTHING/DISREGARDED ALL ADVICE) Suddenly I was at 10cm and it was time to push. it was a strange sensation. On one half of my body I was completely numb. The other half I could feel EVERYTHING. The doctors told me she would be out by 5:30pm (July 12th. It was 4:15 at this point) There were my words. ""FXCK THAT I WANT HER OUT BY FIVE."" and I began to push. Nothing on one half. burning on the other. NOW LADIES. when a doctor tells you to stop pushing and pant like a dog.. FOR HEAVENS SAKE. LISTEN. That means that the chord is wrapped around the babies neck and they have to remove it. After that little ordeal it was time to push again. After some more pushing Evelyn came out. at 4:52pm. July 12th. 23 hours and 55 minutes after my BFFS baby was born. All the pain was gone. All I could do was cry tears of happiness. And that is my story."

plqdm,12,2012-02-12,I feel like I will be unsuccessful...:(,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/plqdm/i_feel_like_i_will_be_unsuccessful/,"So i'm currently going for a CS degree at my university.  I have 1 more semester to go, and i just feel like i'm the worst programmer ever.  I understand the concepts, and can chug out code if i have to, but i don't necessarily enjoy doing it.  I got into CS because i generally like computers, tech, and gaming, so i felt CS was related to that, plus it was more financially stable compared to the music education degree i wanted to do before.

Anyways, I will have a potential internship lined up for the summer, but i feel that i'm just ill equipped to be in the CS field.  I have never programmed anything outside of school assignments (open source, etc) i only know the basics of java, C, and Python, nothing too advanced.  Don't necessarily like coding.  I have thought about possibly picking up some books on game coding, and trying to create stuff and try to get it on the xbox live indy game section. In hopes of getting some personal projects on my resume.  however i don't know if i even have the drive to do that.

I guess i'm posting this to try to get some direction.  Maybe the CS direction wasn't for me?  I only have 1 more semester though.  I keep thinking how things would be if i went back in time and went for a music degree instead.  I probably know more about music than i know about programing and CS with the 3 and a half years combined.

I have the feeling i will be an unsuccessful CS graduate.  It's tough to admit.  Thing is that at this point i've lost all desire to properly do something about it.  Guess i got burned out."

plq2z,12,2012-02-12,"No imagination, no goals, no motivation, almost nothing makes me happy",goalless_and_bored,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/plq2z/no_imagination_no_goals_no_motivation_almost/,"I just turned 25. I'm almost three years out of university and I have never had a real job. I was good at school. Once I graduated, I didn't know what to do. I spent eight (mostly-happy) months sitting around. I went back for graduate school. That lasted a year. It made me very unhappy.

Somehow in that year of graduate school, all my aspirations and motivation evaporated. I went in hoping to get a doctorate and to do research on the things I liked. I think that's what sort of made me realize that *I don't know what I like.*

I don't know what interests me. Sure, I have a vague idea -- ""programming"" -- but that's like saying I like hammering nails into wood, or that I like putting paint on paper. Programming is just a tool. I don't know what I want to do with it.

I spent a lot of my time around friends with big imaginations and big dreams and some of them made it happen. I realized that I don't have any of that. I've thought about what I want to do with my life for years and I've never come up with an answer. All I have are some skills; I have no imagination, no drive, no creativity. I don't know what I want out of life other than the basic necessities. People say ""do what makes you happy"" but I don't know what that is.

Grad school was the beginning of my spiral into depression. I was really low by the end of it (end of 2010). I gave up on my classes and didn't bother with assignments and exams. I didn't bother looking into the master's program after I dropped out. 2011 was me sitting around doing nothing at all, and so far 2012 has been more of the same.

It's getting to the point where I'm finding it difficult to motivate myself to do basic things, like washing the dishes or doing my laundry. Everything requires so much effort and nothing has any joy for me anymore. Things I used to do for fun are now just frustrating chores. I sit on my computer day after day looking at reddit.

I need a job but the situation seems hopeless and I haven't even tried to get one. The economy is in the tank; service jobs are useless as far as job security, income, and benefits go; I have no interest in most of the programming positions that are available and what's left invariably requires years of real-world experience that I just don't have. Who wants to hire a 25-year-old whose only work experience in the field was a shitty three-month internship in college?

The only thing that makes me happy is my boyfriend. We moved in together last summer and I've felt a bit of an uptick in my mood since then, but it's still not enough. We love each other and encourage each other, but encouragement only goes so far. 

I don't know where I'm going with this. I just need to vent."

I'm 18, and a freshman in college. I attend a very prestigious university where it's hard enough for most students to make it out with decent GPAs but I'm taking this on as a single mother (I gave birth about six weeks ago).

It's been extremely difficult since the new semester started because I don't have anyone to watch my daughter, so just making it to class is a blessing. My family lives about 5-6 hours away so they can't help me out. I do have friends, but they're so busy with their own schoolwork and kids that asking them for help would be unrealistic. Along with this, I'm extremely behind on my academic progress because I haven't been able to take a full course load (I am taking less classes than the normal student because I need time to tend to my newborn daughter). I'm already pretty much guaranteed to graduate a semester or even a year late.

My parents are trying to convince me to transfer to a school close to home so I can live with them and get help with the baby. I'm trying to get into med school so I need time to focus on my studies, internships, extracurricular activities, etc., time that my parents feel will be available to me if they help me with my daughter.

I'm hesitant about moving back in with them though. After having lived by myself, I realized how uncomfortable it is to have to live with others. I also definitely do not want to push my responsibilities as a parent to my own parents. I am my daughter's mother, and I want to play that role fully. I don't know how comfortable I would be with having my own mother ""mother"" her in a sense. I also have this feeling of crippling failure when I think of moving back in with them, as if I had to because I could not handle this on my own. I most certainly can handle this on my own, but moving in with my parents would, I admit, make things ten times easier and allow me to graduate sooner.

So what should I do? Should I just stick it out and try to do this on my own? Or should I let my parents help?"

pledd,14,2012-02-11,I'm losing the motivation to keep going. I'm not sure how far that goes. I have had thoughts of suicide in the past but lately I just find my day to day life upsettingly alone.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/pledd/im_losing_the_motivation_to_keep_going_im_not/,"I'm losing the motivation to keep going. I'm not sure how far that goes. I have had thoughts of suicide in the past but lately I just find my day to day life upsettingly alone.

I have always found it hard to fit in with other people. When I was 11 I was moved to the US because of my fathers job, my two older sisters already at uni. I was completely alone, 3500 miles from my family, and I was in a small American town where I was outcast by my peers and viciously bullied because of my location of birth. I would show up twice maybe three times a week in the principals office, covered in bruises, only to be suspended while my attackers parents were apologised to; my school administrators were bigots. But I am not here to cry about that. I just want you to know that at 11 I had to 'grow up' , alone, and since I have never fit in with other people.

I left my parents to move back to the UK 2 years ago to start uni. I have a good group of friends, mostly male but there are a couple of girls who we were living with last year. I hear a lot on Reddit about the friend-zone, I wouldn't say I have this problem because I don't feel that way about any of my friends. That's what they are, friends. But now that everyone is starting to settle down from our fresher-year antics they are all pairing up and finding people to go out with. 

And I am alone. On a computer science course with 4 girls and 80 odd guys. Everyone I know knows all the girls from their home towns, and from their courses, a couple of them are quite the 'players' for lack of a better term. I often wonder if that's why I gravitated to them as friends. Out of respect.. jealousy perhaps. Whereas I have no home town, and the three 'friends' I could claim from the US are guys, and too far away. Everyone here goes home for the weekends, to go to the pubs with their friends. And I sit here in my house. Alone.

I don't know anyone to ask out, let alone anyone I even want to get to know. I am English but I have been away from the UK for so long that outside this little group of people I don't know anyone. 

And lately I find myself pushing people away. I refuse to go out on group nights out because I drink too much, the stress of group events. I have (stupidly) confessed my depression to some people in the past, but it was pawned off as being the alcohol, and in the morning I have always been too embarrassed to bring it up. My friends just think I am an angry person because I expect a lot of the world. They don't know that I spend most of my time crying because I can't handle the responsibility of life, given the emptiness of my own.

The one 'relationship' I have had in my two years of uni, if you can even call it that, was with one of the girls on my course. A sweet girl, we started talking, it was clear there was something there. We kept trying to hook up but friends and house mates dramas always kept us on our feet. I had an intern-ship over the summer and we texted and talked constantly. She got me through the work day, she said good night. I lived alone over the summer by the way. All summer, with no friends in the city, they were all home with their friends from their home towns. I am not proud to admit it but I was dependent on those texts. And by the end of summer I thought we had such a shot together, and that love was twinkling in our eyes. Well... That didn't pan out. We tried, and I realised she wasn't the person I thought. Or at least it became clear we were 'too' different. And as sad as I was I wanted to be friends, but she took it as an insult; bridge well and truly burned.

I feel very self-conscious writing this. I don't want to give a 'life story' or to sound like I am whining. I just want someone to have heard this. Even just partially reading it. Because I don't know many people. And it would be nice to know that someone knows that this is how I feel. And that it's not alcohol talking, and it's not me being melodramatic.

Right now I have a goal for myself. And I hope it's not an unrealistic one. In the past it was to 'find a girlfriend', as if that would magically solve all my problems. No. My goal for the next month or so is to start consistently waking up without fresh tears on my face. I hope that if I can manage that that I can start to feel better about myself, and my life. Because I don't want to kill myself. From what I have seen there is so much to life. There is so much I haven't experienced, the joy, namely. And I want to. But I can't shake the feeling that for me it won't happen."
po5pk,5,2012-02-13,Cover Letter - lack of experience,lllthrowawaylll,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/po5pk/cover_letter_lack_of_experience/,"Hello, I want to ask you guys about what you include in your cover letters and how long should it be.
How much information should I include?

I understand that I don't know shit when it comes to a restaurant, hell, I'm only really finding it out truly by working my internship in a kitchen that is nothing but students. I've worked food gigs, but they've all be casual family restaurants. So, what would I have to say to you if you were giving me a job interview? What would be the thing for me to display that I acknowledge that I'm not some head in the clouds kid who just finished a degree that has a nice price tag to it? Because I've seen the attitude that a lot of people talk about around me. I've seen people who get higher grades than me but don't understand how to saute a chicken breast with skin on. I've seen them try to say they are mise'd for a dinner service of 100 with only a single ninth pan of rock shrimp in their ice'd sink and no back up pan in their lowboy or reach in. It aggravates the hell out of me. When they clean they just wipe off what they see, and only one or two of us actually attempt to climb up to wipe from top to bottom.

So earlier today I posted an article from the Daily Texan that talks about Test PAC. What that article didn‚Äôt mention, is that we are looking for campus coordinators of the UT Austin campus. Basically, you would be pretty involved in Test PACs planning &amp; execution to defeat Lamar Smith. Your responsibilities would be primarily:

* You would be an admin on the ‚ÄúVote Against SOPA Co-Sponsor Lamar Smith‚Äù Facebook page, and would be responsible for inviting people from UT Austin to that page.
* Weekly conference calls on Skype for 15-30 minutes
 *You would be responsible for helping us develop a ‚Äúplan of attack‚Äù to get UT students to vote against Smith in the GOP primary. 

Also, if you‚Äôd like to try and get internship credit for this, then we‚Äôd be more than happy to fill out an necessary paperwork to make that happen. 
 
Anyone interested should email me at testpacinfo@gmail.com.

Lastly, just a note to the mods of this subreddit. If you don‚Äôt want me posting Test PAC related stuff here, please just let me know. This stuff is relevant to UT Austin, but still I understand if it‚Äôs not kosher.

Best,

I am going to graduate this summer and I would like to get a job as an aerospace engineer. The problem is, I started applying online last fall and I got turned down by a lot of jobs.

I am very passionate about engineering because it seems like a good fit for a person like me. I've been involved in engineering since high school (took a vocational engineering program). I go to a well known school for aerospace engineering. I was a project lead for an experimental rocket propulsion club, dealing with solid rocket motors.

I had five internships (first one was at a machine shop when I was in high school, two summers at the AFRL after high school, and two summers as a co-op student).

My only drawback is that I have a very low GPA of 2.9 (as I'm not good at taking tests).

Any advice on how I can get a job in materials testing, structural testing, or propulsion testing? I have applied online but I don't think it's really lucrative.

Sorry for the long post! Just had a lot on my mind..."

pnbro,11,2012-02-13,"Bad mental health hospital experience. Not as abusive as others, I'm sure, but for me it became the symbol of my entire existence's dysfunction. (Pure venting, rambling, don't read it unless you really want to)",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/pnbro/bad_mental_health_hospital_experience_not_as/,"I have very bad memories from when I walked to a hospital (medical) and asked for help about being suicidal. I was left half naked, fishbowled in the ER for over 24 hours, no one to talk to, just forms to fill out vicariously. A social worker treated me like I was a criminal for wanting to kill myself. Strange disdain from doctors as well. I took up room that could have been used for injured people. I did not know they would put me in the ER.

I was transported by police to a mental hospital. I was treated with active contempt by a medical doctor there, who got me out of my room late at night for tests.

I finally fell asleep, exhausted from crying. So loudly I knew I was keeping someone up in the other rooms. No one complained.

I woke up to three people walking into the room. A man introduced himself and the other two, who were women. Doctor, doctor, medical student. I was sitting in bed, without pants. I was dazed from the past two days.

I did horribly, filling out this vicarious form. The doctor looked at his wrist as I spoke, as if there was a watch on it, then rolled his eyes to look up at the valid existence beyond me that I was keeping him from with my presence in his perception. The medical student audibly called me an asshole on the way out of the room, speaking to the woman doctor who I believe was an intern. One of the questions was, ""do you hear people saying negative things when you walk away from them?"". I couldn't remember any specific time that had happened. But it happened then. I really have no idea what caused them to behave like this. It seems very unusual.

They wanted me out that day. I wasn't really suicidal apparently. The female doctor came back in to speak to me after I tried to express this new dimension of hopelessness I did not know existed until after trying to get help with my already overwhelming hopelessness to the nurses through their forms. She reluctantly decided that I could stay an extra night. She acted like I was a whining child getting a treat. ""I couldn't talk to anyone. I felt I was either going to buy a tank of helium and kill myself that night, or try to get help. I thought that I would have plenty of time to change my mind in the long walk to the hospital on the other side of town. I didn't change my mind. I need help."" I said this to a chant of condescending ""fair enough""s. Oh, and also, a ""that's a *very* long walk, [fat boy]"" thrown in. (To be fair, my weight may not have played into it. Still very condescending.)

I was a big boy and ate my dinner. Thanks for checking nurse. (not horrible in itself. But I had waited so long for *someone* to *talk* to.)

Just fill in the gaps with violent weeping into a rag, waiting for the next thing to happen. The rag became too wet to be of any use, used a towel.

A young male nurse came in and gave me a note with a number on it. ""Your dad called, you have to call him and give him this code in order for us to let him talk to you."" This code was to protect my privacy. . . Somehow my father found out I was at the mental hospital. Not supposed to be legal, but apparently the social worker at the first hospital thought it was okay to call him and let him know that I *might* be at a specific mental hospital. He's a psychiatrist, so surely he would know how to make the situation better. Just like he did the 22 years I lived with him. (i'm a fucking cliche) Female nurse came in to ~~make sure I wasn't planning on suing the hospital for breach of privacy~~ console me.

The next morning I was up early, sitting crosslegged, humbly in the ""authority chair"" of the room. The one the lead doctor sat in the morning before. They walk in with two quick knocks. ""You're up. [can't believe it, you lazy sack of shit]"". I'm asked questions. I answer them more directly than before, having given up on being respected as a human being capable of having meaningful feelings. After being told I changed my mind about killing myself at the hospital, I denied it. And so I was reluctantly told that he thought I could receive treatment at that hospital.

I didn't want to stay. I wanted to talk to my therapist. I regretted so much not just talking to her. The female doctor had spoken with her over the phone, and apparently was caused to have new empathy for me, (once given an alternative to the authoritative ""lets hate this guy"" of the lead doctor), and even had a sympathetic tone when she said ""yes"", after I said that I wanted to speak with my therapist.

I didn't trust my therapist because I felt she didn't respect me enough and was a little condescending. I told her this the day I left the hospital. She stopped being condescending, and listened to me with less assumptions. Or at least she acts like she does very well, which is enough I guess. I know the alternative now.

I cut my arm for the first time, (22 years old). I did it during one of my regular fits of remembering the experience. It gave me a fucking complex or something. I think about it every day. It makes me feel more suicidal than any other thoughts do now. It's come to represent so much! I was mistreated as a young child, this affected my behavior, which caused me to be mistreated as an older child, which affected my behavior, which caused me to be mistreated as an adolescent, and so on until we reach the now, where I'm treated with disdain and contempt by the last people who would ever help a person.

I will fight lethally before I am ever dragged into a mental hospital again. I will never allow people to cause me to feel that extreme of societal rejection again--that which does not have a word that I know of, a kind of seperateness that occurs in the mind, not lonely, very different, complete existential invalidation. I will kill and kill myself before I allow it to happen again. My story is just what I have now. The dead surface skin I can shed off into the internet. It's not what happened. I am not a story. No one is a story. They held me to their story. Their simple story. Less than human.

Although my therapist said condescending things much less than before, she never showed real sympathy for the hospital experience, which had come to represent all of the unhealth of my life. You see, she is an expert, and has much experience working in a hospital like the one I was in. She knows very well that they are bad. My experience, she had a story for. Because she has so much experience about the subject, there is no event concerning it that she can't predict and understand completely, without needing to hear about it. She is fairly old, and has this mentality of experts are authority, mistakes are so rare. Mistakes are not rare. There is no such thing as authority, except in the very practical. The authority of the lead doctor's disdain for me is what allowed the medical student to say a disparaging thing about me in earshot while I was in the most vulnerable state of my adult life. Authority of his expertise is what allowed him to not question his decision that I wasn't really suicidal. I have unusual ways of expressing things. Apparently I'm a fucking anomaly. One so obscure it's not worth exploring.

Just needed to type this into somewhere."

pn1m9,24,2012-02-12,relationship of three years ended over facebook chat..not sure what to do.,fbbreakup,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/pn1m9/relationship_of_three_years_ended_over_facebook/,"Hey everyone, just first wanted to say thanks to anyone who reads and gives advice. so here is the deal.

Me and my girlfriend had an awesome relationship we had been talking about marriage for the past year and she had already picked out where we were going to get married, how the wedding was going to be and so on. The day before the breakup everything was great, we were looking at wedding rings for the upteenth time, talking about whether we should get diamonds or gemstones and having a really great time. literally the next day she texted me saying ""im not feeling the same""

 she had been acting funny but i just shook it off and said I'll come over after you get off class so we can talk about it. she got out of class 2 hours early and texts me to come over i said okay, before I'm able to leave my house she sees me on facebook chat and messages me. she then begins to say that she doesn't love me anymore, that she didn't want to try to work it out and she just wouldn't be happy. I asked her to explain and she couldn't she just kept saying i dont know i dont know. and she ended it right then over facebook chat. I didn't flip out I contained my anger and merely said that i hoped she had a nice life. and I have been very respectful towards her parents and such. but it killed me emotionally. i was lost, the entirely of these three years were devoted to her and she just ripped it apart seemingly overnight and over facebook chat. her parents actually were extremely shocked as well and had no idea why it happened. this happened about a week and a half ago and I have not spoken to her. she has texted me saying she needed a shirt she left in my room, so i went to her apt and left it in her car along with her spare keys and she texted me thank you the next day and I said nothing.

I don't really know what to do anymore. She was the entire reason I was on this side of the country, i moved out here for an internship and met her and ended up staying, we spent almost all of our free time together, I go to school out here and have a job but i dont have any family out here. i have 5-6 friends who are cool but they aren't really close friends.

she texted my father two days ago saying she feels bad and wishes she could talk to me and tell me her reasons but she doesn't think I would want to see her.

so my question is should i let her have that conversation with me? is getting closure worth the pain its probably going to put me through to see her again. after what she did to me I'm just not sure. I feel so much anger and resentment towards her, but id be lieing if i said i wasn't still crazy in love with her. I don't want her back, at least that's what I keep telling myself, I'm not sure I could forgive her. 

anyways thanks for reading and im sorry its a wall of text. any advice or personal experience you can give would be awesome."

More concerns for Apple. Here's how Foxconn, the Chinese government and various universities are conspiring to turn students into forced labourers. Want a degree?

&gt; The series&amp;#039; biggest impact may be discomfiting Apple fanatics who as they read the articles realize that the iPad they are holding is assembled from child labor, toxic shop floors, involuntary overtime, suicidal working conditions, and preventable accidents that kill and maim workers.

&gt; The details of the internship program paint a far more disturbing picture than the Times does of how Foxconn, &amp;quot;the Chinese hell factory,&amp;quot; treats its workers, relying on public humiliation, military discipline, forced labor and physical abuse as management tools to hold down costs and extract maximum profits for Apple.

&gt; Assembling our iPhones and Kindles for meager wages, they work under the same conditions, or worse, as other workers in the Foxconn sweatshops.

&gt; The high turnover - less than 5 percent of Shenzhen&amp;#039;s workforce has five years or more seniority - and consistent worker accounts of being misled about wages as recruits and shorted on earned overtime pay once in the factory point to how Foxconn squeezes workers for profit.

&gt; One executive who&amp;#039;s worked with Apple told the New York Times, &amp;quot;The only way you make money working for Apple is figuring out how to do things more efficiently or cheaper.

&gt; So don&amp;#039;t expect anything to change in Apple and Foxconn&amp;#039;s hell factories, unless workers in China rise up and make it change.

I've got about ten-twenty friends that I regularly talk to but only two are close to me.

I have a hard time approaching girls. I never know what to say to them. When I actually go on dates with them, I never initiate physical contact and they think that I'm not interested in them. My problem is that I don't know how to escalate things sexually. Relationships seem like a waste of time to me, I just want to go straight to the being comfortable around each other feeling. The feelings you get about two months into a relationship. This is my second semester in college and I've only gone on three dates with girls, and I haven't even kissed or held hands with a girl yet. It's so pathetic.

My friends go to parties and clubs every week but I dont feel comfortable at parties and I hate dancing and I hate looking like an idiot just sitting there bobbing my head to music.

I spend my days in my room by myself just browsing youtube videos. I occasionaly call up my friends to see what they're up to and they text me and stop by my door to see what I'm up to, but I just dont like to go out...ya know?

I tried to join clubs at school but none of the people seem interesting to me.

I am in great shape and I hit the gym 3 x a week. I am already an intern and Ive got a solid career waiting for me after college. 

I want to be social but I just hate being around people and its difficult for me to be as talkative as everyone around me. I am an introvert."

(Except brain),[deleted],cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/pmq3s/finding_a_cure_to_all_solid_cancer_except_brain/,"I am an intern for the Cure Cancer Foundation in Lubbock, Texas and we are about to kick off a huge campaing to raise around $5 million for the phase 2 trails of this new drug.  The two researchers doing the studies are graduates of the University of Southern California, why they decided to come to Texas Tech in Lubbock, of all places, I have no idea; yet I am extremely excited about it.
So anyway, the point of this is that when these two drugs that they have developed are combined, they produce about 300 times the power to fight tumors.  The first phase of trials are going on right now or are just about to start, but the results they've had so far have been spectacular.  It has worked on every type of cancerous tumor, except for brain tumors simply because the chemical(s) cannot pass the blood brain barrier.

Our website is www.ccancer.org if anyone wants to check it out, however please be patient as I am a new intern have just begun working on the website and there is MUCH to be done.

There hasn't been anything published yet about this as they simply cannot release anything since the trials are just beginning, but the studies are looking to be very promising! As one of the directors, founders, and most inspirational persons I've ever met, Deborah Curry, said, ""Our goal is to put our own foundation and the entire ""cancer industry"" out of business."" This research is groundbreaking and I hope that someday soon everyone will know of the cure to almost all solid cancer!
If anyone would like to make a donation, the website has links to do so, however I'm just glad to inform you all of the upcoming events in cancer research and hopefully to have everyone's support.

Edit: I apologize to everyone for my lack of information on the specifics so far, as I said I just began my internship as webmaster and there is a TON of work to be done and corrections to be made on the website. I just wanted to share my excitement with everyone as to what we are working on at the moment."
ppvh5,1,2012-02-14,What's my best strategy for getting my ex back?,Getherback12,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/ppvh5/whats_my_best_strategy_for_getting_my_ex_back/,"Ok complicated storying incoming:  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   I (24) broke up with my gf (25) of 3.5 years in December of 2010. We kept living together for 7 more months until our lease was up and we continued to act like we were together (did everything together, kissed, had sex). I broke up with her foolishly because she was my first gf and I was naive. She was always super in love with me the whole relationship, so I naively thought that breaking up with her wasn't risky, because I could have her back whenever I wanted.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   I broke up with her because we were having some issues (she was very jealous and insecure, I'd never been with another girl, and we were both getting on each other's nerves and running out of patience). What I really should have done was to initiate a ""break"" with the intention of definitely getting back together some day.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   So anyway, around October I realized how much I really loved her and tried to get her back. To my surprise and horror, she didn't want me back. She's told me so many different reasons that I don't know which ones are true: she still loves me, but needs time to herself; she could see us getting married if we get back together and she's afraid of commitment, etc. So I decide to let her have her space.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   Then around November, she starts dating an 18 year old guy. That's a 7 year age gap with the girl being the older partner. She's still dating him now and is apparently very enamored of him. Everyone is telling her (besides me, I haven't talked to her since new year's) that the age gap does not bode well for a long term relationship, but she disagrees with them all. She's possibly planning on moving far away for 6 months for an internship in the fall and her new BF wants to transfer universities and go with her.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   My theory is that they are just in the ""honeymoon"" phase or ""puppy love"" phase and that they are both just flooded with hormones and can't think straight. Especially the BF, because she is probably his first love and is therefor crazy enough to consider moving across the country to be with someone he's known for 3 months.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   Also, it seems that her new BF has some qualities that my GF thought were missing from our relationship. I was never big on watching football or playing soccer, two things her new BF loves to do. But I feel like these are trivial qualities and that me and my ex shared more meaningful qualities and made a better long term match. Her whole relationship with this new BF seems very un-thought out and hormone-driven.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   So basically my question is what's my best strategy for getting her back? Should I just not contact her at all until she contacts me? Or should I avoid contact until sometime in the summer (before she possibly moves away) and then try to let her know how I feel one more time?  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   I'm worried about so many things right now. I want her to miss me, but I feel like her current relationship is blocking that from happening. I'm worried that if I wait too long to contact her, her memories of how great our relationship was will start to fade and become less powerful and influential. But on the other hand, I feel like if I talk to her too soon, it could push her away. Also, I feel like even if she realizes that her new relationship isn't that great, that doesn't mean she's not going to stick around in it for years to come. Her BF before me was terrible and she stayed with him for 5 years. How can I know if she's in a mediocre relationship, so that I can move in and tell her that I still love her and that she should break up and come back to me? I guess at some point I could possibly call her sister or one of her friends and ask if they've noticed any conflict in the relationship.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   What do I do? (It's hard to convey in a short amount of words on reddit, but I do feel like her and I are really compatible and have a real shot at true love and a happy marriage. I really want to get her back!)  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
**TL;DR  
Broke up with GF of 3.5 years, wanted her back, she said no, not now. Is now dating a new BF that is 7 years younger than her (25, 18). They've been dating for 3 months and are already talking about moving away and living together. How do I get her back if her new relationship is really just a hormone-driven bad decision?**"

3) Stay with my job till about April and apply for a full-time job at a bigger firm.  The job I am currently with deals with my major but there is little room for advancement.

But right now I feel like I am slaving away as a $10/hr intern with such high expectations, and a crazy boss who still uses tables for layout and refuses to upgrade from *Macromedia* Dreamweaver.  And endlessly chews me out for not getting stuff done fast enough, his way.  Which is think is thick-headed.  But maybe I'm naive.

Just please tell me I won't be a lowly intern living with my parents for the rest of my life.  I know I am a good coder, but don't have a lot of time to devote to projects on my own and still get sleep.  I bombed an interview with a Silicon Valley startup last night because I didn't know anything about Javascript closures (been lookin' them up today, pretty cool stuff).

Where does one find out about good job opportunities for *entry level* developers?  I know my Javascript hacks could skyrocket in the right scenario.  I already have been doing some cool stuff on my own, but rarely get to use these tricks at my current job.

I had a gf for a year and a half, but throughout the relationship, several things didn't really go the way they should have, and one of them was sex. At the start we had a lot of sex, 3 times a week minimum and sometimes multiples in a row, but after some time this degraded and near the end it'd be just once a week or so, sometimes less. I had been fapping to porn almost daily for several years before I met her, and it got a lot less early in the relationship but increased over time back to the old level, leading to us having a lot less sex and feeling detached from each other.

We broke up in November and both of us are now abroad on intern ship so we wont be seeing each other for some time to come. We've talked at length, and I confessed to her about the porn thing. She never really noticed, and now understands what caused my disinterest in sex. I gave it a lot of thought and decided that I had to change myself, because she is incredibly pretty and also damn good in bed.

So, early January I decided that I wanted to do something about it. I deleted all my porn and took a nofap until after two weeks or so I lapsed, with porn. Then I tried it again, but lapsed again after two weeks or so. Meanwhile, me and her had been mailing and skyping at length and I was missing her to death. I've been clean now for a week or so, but discovering these subreddits has strengthened my resolve to stay away from porn and perhaps, although I'm less sure abut this one, from fapping altogether. I feel (hope?) there may be a small chance that the two of us can get back together some months from now when we're both back home again, and when it does happen I want to give her my very best.

I've transferred schools and switched majors a few times, and last semester i just started  a major in Computer Information Systems. I've only taken two programming classes so far (an intro course in C++ and i'm currently taking a course in OOP also in c++). I've always had some interest in programming, but I've never been able to teach myself any languages. My problem is that I can't think of any projects to work on besides examples from the textbook. Even with these classes, the professors haven't really been assigning much homework, and when they do it is from the textbook, so I've been trying to do more examples on my own time. But, like I said, I have no ideas.

Anyway, my question is this: With no experience, no side projects, and still just basic programming knowledge, are there companies willing to take in students like me for some sort of unpaid internship?

Also, I don't really have any idea what I want to do when I graduate. I don't know if I want to go into game development, web, etc I don't even really know what my options are. I DO like programming and figuring out solutions to problems, I just don't really know where to go from here. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks."

I am in college as it seems to be the only way to get a career, but it's crushing me. I want to be free, and I don't consider working a near-minimum wage job for the rest of my life to be freedom. I can't get a job in my field because of the catch-22 of the job market, and not having a degree. Internship is maybe a possibility. Right now I am kind of in danger of failing a class for the second time anyway, in which case my degree path will be blocked anyway.

I have never even held a job in my life. I am trying to do what I want as a career in my spare time as a hobby, but I really have no spare time. Hell, for the past 3 summers I have applied to over 100 minimum wage jobs and the only callback I have ever gotten was from McDonald's, in which I was interviewed and didn't get the job.

At this point, I am just getting no joy out of life. The main reason I am alive is because I fear death.

Running away is the only ""safe"" option I can think of, but it's still a pretty terrible option. What am I going to do if I run away? I won't be able to get far with what little money I have (and I would have to reserve it strictly for food anyway) and I would just end up homeless.

So far I've just tried to get myself time to think by just leaving and wandering aimlessly through the city for hours at a time."

**Background:** Well about 2 months ago my girlfriend of 3 years went away to Europe for an internship during the southern hemisphere summer (shes still there as of posting). We are both 23, her being in the last year of uni while I graduated recently. Before she left I felt we had a fairly good relationship which in retrospect was kind of falling apart due to both of us taking each other for granted, yet I still thought I was a good boyfriend who tried to make her happy whenever I could e.g baking her cakes/surprise visits at work.

About a month into her trip she became really emotionally distant, never initiating contact or saying that she misses me. I became worried and asked her about it but she claimed that's how she was when she traveled abroad (this not being her first time). This continued for a week and finally due to the lack of answers I did something I shouldn't have done which was reading a conversation on facebook between her and a friend. In the conversation I discovered that she was planning to break up when she got back because she claimed she didn't miss me at all and I annoyed her when I called. After revealing this to her a shitstorm ensued where she got angry about me invading her privacy but showed deep regret for saying the things that she did and we both admitted we did things that were wrong and said we would try to work it out.

**Now:** Eventually after a few days she broke up with me as she felt it would be better if we be friends instead. Its been a month since all of this happened and in the original break up on the phone she used vague terms like ""its not you, its me"" and other things along those lines. It took a week of prompting through email to get her real reasons for breaking up which were that she had changed and gained more confidence/independence/fashion sense as a result of being away and didn't think she could return to her regular life back home which included not being able to stay emotionally committed to me. She still has a year of uni left though but she plans to move into the central city away from the suburb where we both live until she can move away next year to a different country.

Essentially from her given reasons, I feel like it was her polite way of saying ""I've become to good for you and feel I can do better"" and its really eating up my self-esteem. After discovering this I told her that we can't be friends as I felt those were fairly selfish reasons for breaking up. Shes kind of an insecure person and I feel the changes she is feeling is just based on a travel buzz rather than actual change though I could be wrong.

In retrospect I am kind of glad that the relationship is over as there were a lot of bad things amongst the good that I didn't see happening at the time such as her taking me for granted, yet despite this I'm feeling really ""left behind"" as she has a new and exciting lease on life while I'm stuck looking for work having just finished uni.

Besides the large hit my self-esteem has taken, I've been having a lot of distressing thoughts about her being with other guys/girls and her past romantic encounters that she told me about which are really eating me up on the inside. I know that the breakup was good for both of us, but I seem to be more sad and depressed about her being with other people both past and present rather than us not being together anymore.

So reddit can you please help me with some suggestions about how to stop thinking about her being with other people and maybe taking initiative to improve my own life so that I don't feel so left behind. I know this sounds like a big ask but any help would be seriously appreciated.

Thank you.

I wasn't originally going to get a Mac but a series of events and research made me wish i had more money to buy one... when I realized DID have more money. I wasn't used to thinking about bucket-o-change as actual funds.

In the end i had $735.60 worth of change. WOW!!

I've never been rejected because I never attempted to get things started with someone.

My skin problems range from acne to eczema as well as hyperpigmentation. I also have an apparent case of gynecomastia although the doc says it is not. But my chest does look like the ones on google images.

I have gotten glances from my female counterparts at work and in public. But I always have this lingering thought that they will not like me once they get a glimpse of what's under the shirt. Now I know, I should keep going to the gym but I get very self-conscious there too and sometimes I just don't want to leave my room to go outside. I feel that it's a lot better during winter since I can hide myself underneath the layers of clothing but come summertime, I vanish from sight.

I am an experienced Sound Designer who is looking for a job or an internship in the gaming industry as a Sound Designer. I have worked on small independent games, student films, and a web series. With my experience I feel like I would be a great addition to your company.

I feel like video games allow the sound designer the freedom to create atmosphere, bolster character design, and reward or encourage players for their actions. The crafting of a character or environment through audio is something I am incredibly interested in and I very much so want to be a part of that process.

In college I worked solely on films but expanded to video games after I graduated. I am familiar and proficient with Pro Tools, Logic, and Audacity. I have been trying to teach myself FMOD over the past month so I can become a more complete sound designer. I also have a large amount of experience as a Foley Artist working with sound stages or booths, recording equipment, and digital video equipment.

I have a resume which can be found [here](http://imgur.com/XaGto) and a Sound Cloud that can be found [here](http://soundcloud.com/nick-friedemann). I would like to simply point out that I am working on two games that have been unreleased and I feel like it would be irresponsible of me to post something that I feel belongs to them until the game is released. This means that my Sound Cloud is a bit out of date at the moment.

I would just like to say thank you for your time, I really appreciate it."

I finally got a decent paying job so I started buying some of my own equipment for some home network experimentation. 

I actually just bought a 2950 switch and a 2621XM router. I'm not really looking to make a certification home lab (I plan to do that during my next full time internship with Packet Tracer) just a place to experiment.

So i have a couple questions, I recently saw a Cisco Pix 525 firewall for sale and I was considering buying it. After a quick search I didn't find to much info about it, Cisco had a end of life statement. Would it be worth getting to know how to configure such devices? 

My next question has to do with other vendor's equipment, such as Juniper ( I really don't know too many other vendors). Should I invest in learning to configure a Cisco firewall? Or buy a Juniper router/switch and become familiar with that? 

Sorry if I spam questions on this subbreddit, I just realized how much knowledge is in this reddit and the classroom (so far at least) doesn't teach much beyond the technical skills."

Performed theoretical mathematical experimentation during undergrad for a professor in the physics department. My work was incorporated into a chapter of *Mathematical Modeling of Collective Behavior in Socio-Economic and Life Sciences* (Birkhauser 2010) and features me as a co-author.

The summers of '08/'09 were difficult due to the economic climate. No internships were received, though '09 was a blessing in disguise due to family illness that required me to be at home and handle most household tasks.

**Other Skills:** I am a quick learner who can pick up concepts and procedures quickly, in addition to becoming proficient in various design or programming software. I have some exposure to C++ and am proficient in MS Office. My French minor didn't result in my being fluent in French, but I have conversational ability and I'm diving into learning Spanish. I am a strong writer, am comfortable in interpersonal situations, have a highly pronounced aptitude for solving problems, and have a perfectionistic streak. My brain-to-hand artistic talent is limited, but give me time to familiarize with a program like AutoCAD and I won't make a fool of myself (there are plenty of ideas in my head, they just have a bit of a hard time reaching paper!).

I also have a health and fitness [blog](http://www.primaluniversity.com) and [social media presence](http://twitter.com/#!/PrimalUniv) targeted at college students trying to adhere to a ""Paleo"" eating style. The site has a strategic bent to it, focusing on ways to approach dining administration about offering healthier options, cost trimming, and still maintaining an enjoyable college experience.

**Entirely Work-Unrelated Interests:** Ballroom dancing, recreational sports (basketball, football), walking, reading (economics, politics, history, government, Grisham, Crichton), being outdoors

---------------------------------------

It's a bit difficult for me to nail down the role I fit when people ask where I aim to go. Because what I do best fits into a wide variety of industries and roles, I falter when asked such a question. I'm suited for consulting, particularly roles in which mathematical and strategic thinking are paramount, but in an industrial organization (e.g., engineering) I tend to bridge the gap between conceptualization and implementation. Think of answering questions of feasibility, devising strategies for attaining a specific goal or objective (and developing those goals/objectives), and designing solutions (actual products -- airport terminal layouts or lighting structures; or procedures -- better incentives, more effective curriculum, streamlined processes).

That's why I gravitate toward consulting in general because it allows for using those strengths across a variety of fields. Of course, diving into a particular industry (e.g., engineering, energy, finance) for a specific organization in a similar role allows for the same mobilization of my strengths."

I'm a third year IT student and I am very anxious about graduating for a couple of reasons.

1: My GPA is bordering on 2 -2.5 at best.
2: I have no work experience whatsoever in anything.
3: No connections
4: I have no drive anymore to do anything about it 

Don't get me wrong, I didn't pick IT for the sake of it. I love computers and all that and read up on that stuff in my own time, its just that I suck at programming and networking which is probably 80% of the IT sector 
The only thing im really good at is fixing computers, building computers and 3d modeling.
Looking at graduate jobs and internships also depresses is me as I know that I most like wont be able to do whats required thus not getting experience and not getting a job

I dont know if this belongs here, couldnt find a more relevant forum 
Any help would be helpful

Thanks

The thing is, how do we separate it from volunteer work, like what I'm currently doing while vying after a job with this place. Like internships, volunteer positions can also be a way of getting people to do the training without pay (there was really extensive training for mine, and the place pretty much exclusively hires volunteers, since the training is required for the job).

I mean where do you draw the line? What could you say defines a cause worthy of volunteering for vs something that is clearly an internship in a tuxedo? Because we obvs can't outlaw volunteer work, and there are some vounteer jobs that really do need people who are willing to train for them. 

Some thoughts."

When you apply for an internship, you download R/GA's Facebook application that grants them access to your wall. They will post questions, posing as you, and what your friends comment is your ""interview."" This must be legal because you granted them access and R/GA wouldn't do this if it resulted in court battles. Would you let your employer do something like this?

I'm a 1L at a top50 school. I'm in the top 25% of my class, highest grade in contracts, already Articles Editor for a publication, and I've been looking for a job for awhile.

The reason I'm pissed off is that despite all this hard work, I'm still going to be lucky to find a decent internship this summer because a) I didn't apply in December and b) I don't have any connections in the legal world to milk. I understand networking and how that works, but I still feel like the system way undervalues achievements on a resume. Plus, I always have this nagging feeling that whatever I do and achieve here is never going to be enough. I just imagine it always being, ""oh, you didn't go to a T14 school?"" Or, ""oh, you didn't join Law Review?"" It feels like a very uphill battle.

Not by a long shot.

Now we've moved to a new building. This allows the guys who have engineering degrees to have private offices, but the rest of us, i.e. Shitbird and myself, must share a mini cubicle farm in the front. Grrrrreeeeat. 

I've armed myself with headphones most of the time, but this guy is the worst to share a room with. Also, sometimes I have to take an earbud out to answer the phone or communicate with one of the other guys. Shitbird makes numerous disgusting noises approximately every 15 seconds. I'd actually clock him if I weren't so busy fixing his mistakes, but it's a good estimate. He complains about everything and blamed the fact that he ran into a fire hydrant in the company truck on his co-worker (who wasn't even driving). He fucked up something so royally that 1) my boss told me to do that part of his job from now on and 2) it is taking me three times, yes, that's not an exaggeration, three times as long to compile the digital portion of our submittal for this project. And Shitbird has the gall, nay, the *sheer impertinence* to ask me why I'm not done yet! 

I'm also even more behind schedule, because he ""just forgot"" an entire filebox on the floor behind his cubicle wall, so he didn't give it to me for processing. I'm tempted to ""just forget"" to give him the boxes after I fix all of his fucking errors, thereby forcing him to stay late to submit them to my boss. Soooooo tempted. 

I've sent out resumes everywhere,  but apparently I'm unhireable and stuck here. Kids, PSA: get a degree in something applied, like engineering or medicine, or pharmacy, and get intern experience while you're getting your degree, even if you have to function on 4 hours sleep for 4 - 5 years. No one wants a Masters Degree in Literature graduate with experience teaching university courses, ESL, and techwriting/office management/engineering technician. NO ONE. I'm actually really smart, creative, adaptable, a good teacher, and yet, NO ONE will hire me. Let that be a lesson to you. "

My good friend is being called on to go on mission to Uganda and Kenya this summer, to do disciple work as well as service projects. Here is her letter she wrote to facebook: 

"" Dear Family and Friends,

The Lord has been doing much in my life and heart since the last time I went to Africa. I have been praying and seeking His face since and I am pleased to inform you that I will be going to Uganda for 6 weeks to work with beautiful orphans and study under missionaries as an intern. I will also be going to Kenya for 2 more weeks to learn under the Hovinghs, the missionaries I first learned under my first trip to Africa. This is a total of 8 weeks I will be in Africa! My Father has been teaching me so much since I stepped off that plane in Africa, and I cannot wait to return. He has called me on a mission there, and I want to help raise awareness of the good that is being done, and also raise awareness for the needs.

The total approximate cost of the internship is 5,100 and it is July 14th ‚Äì September 9th in Kenya first, then Uganda.
I will be able to help disciple, have hands on service projects and activity planning, leading the children at the home, and they will be plugging some of us into our expertise! So yes, this means that you‚Äôll be seeing many pictures of what‚Äôs going on! The ministry I‚Äôm going with is absolutely fantastic. It has heightened my love for missions, and sets forth an extremely loving and godly attitude in their work. I‚Äôd strongly encourage you to check them out for yourself just so you know what else you‚Äôre supporting www.heartofthebride.org. 

If you feel you are in a position to support me financially, know that the bulk of this amount ($2,800) is for my airfare and is due as soon as possible. The remainder of the support is due May 9, 2012. I would like your prayer support above all else as I prepare for the trip and while I am abroad. I will need it, even though I‚Äôm not easily homesick, 2 months is a very long time. Also make sure you check out the picture that I is on the event thing. You can buy this on my website http://aegoinsphotography.smugmug.com/ and help further support me and my mission by buying the picture! You can get this one and other Africa pictures all under the album Africa.

Here are some specific ways you can pray for the team and me:
‚Ä¢	That our hearts will be in the right place with God as we lead an example of His love
‚Ä¢	That the glory will never be led back to us, but our Father
‚Ä¢	That our families will be safe while we aren‚Äôt there, but equally leading people to the faith while we are gone
‚Ä¢	That others see the Hope of Christ through whatever He has us do
‚Ä¢	That satan won‚Äôt be allowed to get a foothold, discourage, or weaken our health
‚Ä¢	That greater than anything we will be lights unto this dark world here and when we return





If you would like to financially support this trip, you can mail a check to:

Heart of the Bride Ministries
P.O.Box 786
Niceville, Florida 32588


Checks should be made out to Heart of the Bride Ministries accompanied by a note designating the check to Anna Goins for Uganda Internship All financial donations are tax deductible and you will receive a donation statement at the end of the year.

Thank you for your love and support in Christ""

pr51g,1,2012-02-15,Album Review: Fun. - Some Nights,[deleted],Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/pr51g/album_review_fun_some_nights/,"After the release of Fun.‚Äôs debut record, *Aim and Ignite*, the band began cautiously concocting sophomore attempt *Some Nights* ‚Äì a better, stronger, faster album. Teaming with a renowned group of German scientists, Fun. headed into their secret mountaintop recording studio, which could be accessed by navigating a series of underground tunnels carved deep in the Wetterstein Mountains. After tens of hundreds of triple-blind testing sessions in over 60 countries in a study conducted over the past two-and-a-half years, Fun. has released perhaps the most non-objectionable album of all time.

During the recording process, scientists quietly chained lead singer Nate Ruess to the brick wall in their basement studio. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he demanded, but it was clear they had their own agenda. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing,‚Äù Ruess asked as they slowly raised the tripod-based microphone stand to his face. He repeated himself, this time less of a question, but the white-coated engineer had already made up his mind.

‚ÄúYou see, Nate,‚Äù the man began, ‚Äúsometimes you have to think of things in a larger perspective.‚Äù The man brushed his coat and flipped a series of illuminated switches. Taking his cue, the studio interns began coordinating the sea of dials, buttons, levers, beakers, bulbs and patch cables affixed to the wall. Nate‚Äôs face was painted with a thin layer of sweat. ‚ÄúSometimes,‚Äù the man said, reaching for a large lever, ‚Äúyou must do things for the greater good.‚Äù The scientist pulled the lever; above it a large, bold-faced placard reading AUTO-TUNE.

Nate screamed in horror. ‚ÄúGood, Nate, very good,‚Äù the scientist said, adjusting the preamps. ‚ÄúI just need one more for safety.‚Äù

Weeks into testing, the scientists concluded that Ruess‚Äô less traditional, chromatic chord progressions were alienating to certain music audiences.

‚ÄúYou will play one-four-five progression, yes?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt,‚Äù Nate exhaled. He tried to explain that not every song‚Äôs chorus could be a one-four-five progression. It would be too lazy and clich√©. The scientist tightened his gloves, and relaxed his shoulders.

‚ÄúYou will play one-four-five progession, yes?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand. To be a respectable songwriter, you‚Äî‚Äú

1,500 volts of electricity blasted through Ruess‚Äô body.

‚ÄúFor‚Ä¶ the greater good.‚Äù

Ruess was released after 255 days of preliminary recording. Still, the scientist was not pleased with the album. He knew it could be better.

‚ÄúMore tracks,‚Äù he exclaimed. ‚ÄúMore Elton John! No‚Ä¶ more Queen! Yes. YES,‚Äù he was raving now, saliva dripping down his chin. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good. So‚Ä¶ objectively good. The greater good. THE GREATER GOOD.‚Äù

pr4nw,2,2012-02-15,Need some advice about my internship and future job situation,rockyroadnews,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pr4nw/need_some_advice_about_my_internship_and_future/,"I'm a senior in college, graduating this April.  I'm a journalism major and I thoroughly enjoy what I do.  I love reporting and writing and I want to make a career out of it.  I'm not half bad at it either, not to sound arrogant.

I've been interning since the beginning of this semester (about 6 or 7 weeks ago) at my town's daily newspaper.  I was ecstatic to even get the internship, as it's such an ideal position and there was a lot of competition for it.  As you probably know, opportunities in traditional journalism are, by and large, shrinking.  Since I'm graduating soon, I'm considering my career prospects rather closely.

My situation is this:  I'm doing well at my internship and the editors seem to really like my work.  I've reported on over 20 articles so far in the short time I've been there -- some short dailies, some longer-term feature-y stuff.  I'd love to work here permanently, but I'm afraid that there won't be any positions open towards the end of my internship.  

In the weeks that I've worked here I've seen 3 different open reporter positions get advertised.  The first one happened right after I started, so I didn't even think about trying to apply.  The second and third literally got posted within the last week and I'm torn over whether or not to bring up the idea of applying for them.  On one hand it's still relatively early in my internship; on the other, April gets closer by the day and I *have* been relatively well-received here.

What does Reddit think?  Anyone else have any experiences of getting hired out of an internship (or before it was technically 'over')?  Should I take the chance and risk rejection and potentially looking too eager, or should I wait?  "

It is long, but worth the read. I promise.


To give a little background, one of my friends is big into conspiracy, black helicopter, NWO type stuff and is a huge Alex Jones fan. While I am out of town at another one of our corporate offices, I get a demo Blackberry Storm (shitty device) and it happens to have a 202 area code (Washington D.C.) number associated with it. So I decide to have a little fun...

I send my friend a text:

*DC Line: Go to meeting point 13
DC Line: Contact 9685-P when you arrive.
Him: ?? What are u talking about? I think you have the wrong number.*

To sell him on the prank, I wait a few minutes and to make it look like I just found out who I sent the ""wrong"" message to and since he is on his father's family plan I sent the following text:

*DC Line: Father's name, please remove the two previous messages from your mobile device and disregard.*

He called me a minute later and is freaked the hell out...I hung up on him a few times like we were disconnected as he spoke of ""the incident"".

I waited for a few minutes and I sent him this message;

*DC Line: Father's name, please be advised that you must comply with the previous request under USSID 18 or you can be prosecuted to the fullest extent of Federal Law.*

He called me (you can tell this has really fucked him up his as voice was trembling) and said:

*Him: PLEASE don't tell anyone, I got another message from that number stating that if I don't comply under USSID 18, they can prosecute me! Didn't I tell you about the civilian labor camps and the police falsely accusing people of 'terrorist acts and combatants'?!?! SHIT, wtf. What should I do?

Me: Dude, chill out. Just do what it says. If you implicate me because you told me, I am going to kill you. I don't want any part of this. If they have your cell, why the fuck would you tell me this shit now and not wait until we hang out. You of all people should know.

Him: I read some things online about USSID 18 and it's serious man. Fuck, I'll let you know if anything else comes through tomorrow. I am going to get more smokes. This shit has got me freaked the hell out.*

The next day I am in the office and I realize that our intern is Iranian and can speak Farsi fluently. I had the intern star 67 and call my friend. My friend screens his calls so he was left a message in Farsi with ""CDC"" dropped in plain English for him to understand. Now it is time to let his mind wander as I get back to work.

A few hours later, we exchange some texts (my personal line);

*Me: Do you think something big is going down?
Him: I don't know man. I am thinking about going to the FBI office today.
Me: Aren't they involved since the DC number said you could be prosecuted?
Me: Personally, I would leave it alone. I know I am going by what they see in the movies, but you don't want to get involved in whatever it is going on.
Him: Well, from what I can tell, the texts came from the NSA. But with the VM I just got, I seem to be caught in the middle of something I want nothing to do with. I just want to make that clear to them.
Me: Just play it cool. Honestly, I would leave it alone since they know they have a wrong number.
Me: Shit like that should not be messed with.
Me: Just keep copies of everything in case....off-site somewhere too.....screen prints, etc.
Him: Apparently not, When they called and heard my message before you leave a VM they would know I'm not who they wanted.
Him: I can't. I had to delete the texts. They knew that I didn't after they told me to and sent me a threatening text telling me I really need to delete them. So I did.
Me: How do you know it came from the NSA?
Him: They cited NSA documents in their threat to me and I did a little research online last night.
Me: Well if you decide to go to the FBI wait until I get back. I have to fly today and I don't want to end up on any lists.
Him: Aight*

So now he deleted the evidence and has nothing to take to the FBI. During the time that this has been going on, I know which internet forums and sites he frequents so I keep an eye on everything. All of a sudden, I see this pop up on Twitter;

*xxxxIf you were getting text messages from the NSA and wanted to report it to someone in the government to let them know, who would you call?*

Since my friend doesn‚Äôt know what Farsi sounds like and can‚Äôt distinguish the differences in middle eastern/central asian languages, I wanted to tie in some theories around Tajikstan and Rendtion.
Since I am heading back home that day and before I head to the airport, I sent him this message from the ""NSA"" number:

*DC Line: Friend's name (Since he posted on Twitter), cease and desist from divulging any further information, including online outlets. Your cooperation is essential.
DC Line: We have intercepted an incoming call and voicemail to your device from Tajikstan. Delete immediately. We guarantee you will in no way be implicated if you comply.*

On the way to the airport, I give him a call and the conversation goes something like this:

*Me: Hey man, what's up. I am going to try and get any earlier flight.
Him: Dude, something is going on, something HUGE. I really can't talk about it, let's just say I am being monitored online and via phone calls.
Me: Uhhh, are you serious? How do you know?
Him: I can't say much, just that I am being watched and I am in some shit. Think Eagle Eye.
Me: Are you still going to go to the FBI?
Him: No, this is bigger than that?
Me: How do you know?
Him: Trust me, in a message I received there was something that set off some flags to me. (In an obvious voice like someone is listening in) I am just going to comply and delete everything. I don't want any part of this. I am just going to leave it alone. I need a job and I can't be a dumbass. Hit me up when you are in town.
Me: Ok man, if anything happens let me know.*

About 15 min later I call him back...

*Me: Man, I think you are right, something is going on. There is a blacked out Tahoe on my tail.
Him: Fuck are you serious?!
Me: Yes, I might just be getting paranoid, but I noticed it leaving work and it is keeping pace with me like 5 cars back, but following me, ya know?
Him: Just be cool, we have nothing to hide, remember I told you about this last night and this morning.
Me: You motherfucker! You should know not to say any of this, couldn't you have just waited til I was home and told me in person?! I can't let this fuck up my job.
Him: Shit, if you can, let me know if anything happens.
Me: Alright.
Him: Peace*

At this point I make my way to the airport lounge and begin plotting my next moves. A friend in Europe has agreed to join in on the prank and while he is getting acclimated to what is going on, I have the intern call and leave another message, but this time mentioning ‚ÄúRendition‚Äù. I immediately follow up the message with a text from the ‚ÄúNSA‚Äù;

*DC Line: You have just received another message from the same number in Tajikstan. Delete and disregard. This is a matter of national security.
DC Line: This matter will be resolved shortly. Your continued cooperation is appreciated.
Him: Done. Thank you.*

As I am talking to my friend in Europe I suggest that he go with an approach like this;

*Let's go with something along the lines of you are working along side the US Government. I am sorry that you (my friend) is involved, but this matter is of the utmost urgency. I want to say there is a leak in the Tajik gov't wanting to expose the US (don't say about what). Tell him you know he has already been contacted by the leak and that the US is working to silence this threat.

Let me know when you will call and everything is setup. I will give you the number and set him up by texting him from the NSA number to expect your call. Let's say you are with the UN???*

While I am planning my next move my friend in Europe calls as ‚ÄúMr. York‚Äù.

I get notification once the call has completed and I called my friend to BS since my flight is delayed and it goes something like this:

*Me: What up man, flight is delayed til 8.
Him: Sorry man, I can't talk. Expecting an important call.
Me: Ok, later*

I wait a few minutes and send him a message from the NSA number;

*DC Line: Again, the United States thanks you for your cooperation. Mr. York and I will be your contacts. Your name is guaranteed clear and will face no implication.*

Again, I let some time pass and I send another message;

*DC Line: The leak has been contained and under USSID 18, all information is to be kept confidential.*

Unbeknownst to me, he ended up calling the FBI. I called him to chat while I wait for my plane and he filled me on his phone call with the authorities. He told me that the FBI said if this was real, numbers would be changed and you would have never been contacted again, blah blah blah, that you are possibly dealing with a scammer. He said the FBI was shady and the person he spoke with would not give him their name. My friend said that the shadiest thing was that as soon as he hung up with the he got a text from the ‚ÄúNSA‚Äù that said:

*DC Line: You will no longer receive any communications about this matter.*

My friend told me that he has been shaking all day thinking about this, like he woke up in something just like Eagle Eye. However, he did give the FBI my demo number‚Ä¶thankfully I was never contacted by them.

I finally get back in town and after all that has transpired I head directly to his house from the airport to find out more about what has ‚Äúhappened‚Äù.

He said he was getting these texts and it was freaking him out. He couldn't sleep at all the previous night because he was so paranoid. He showed me everything that he was looking at via his history on the browser. Oh my god, he Googled everything and then some. Since everything I had done tied together, this fucked him up even further.

The next day as the prank continued he kept getting more and more freaked out. The voicemails that were left in Farsi followed up by texts from the ""NSA"" couldn't have been timed more perfectly. He still believes he was under complete surveillance. The tweet I saw followed by the ""NSA"" text telling him to cease from divulging any further information, including online outlets really got him. Got him so bad that him and his dad went into the bathroom, turned on the water, and left their phones on the other side of the house (he believes the gov't can randomly turn on phones and listen to convos) to chat about what was going on.

Apparently, my friend (the target) had recorded the phone call with my friend in Europe. It couldn‚Äôt have been more perfect‚Ä¶accent, information, everything. 

However, my text after that call almost blew the prank and that is when he called the FBI with his father. Apparently, the FBI didn‚Äôt take it seriously and the guy on the phone actually laughed at them. He said it was like a Nigerian scam for money and to just disregard it. My friend pretty much quit caring about it until I sent the text saying ""You will receive no further communications"". Unknown to me, the timing couldn't have been better. He said he got it less than a minute from hanging up from the laughing FBI. This kicked his paranoia back in.

Throughout him telling me what has transpired, I keep a straight face and plant seeds of doubt to dispel what the FBI said. I asked him how can this be scam if they accurately monitored your activity. That's all I needed to say, he started freaking out again. I really might be driving him to a nervous breakdown.

Over the next few days I kept the seeds of doubt planted in his head while I plan my grand finale.

A few days later, I texted myself from the ""NSA"" number before I hopped on my motorcycle to meet him. I hauled ass over there and made it in 10 min rather than 15 so that the text would have ""arrived"" while I was on my bike and I wouldn't hear it.

At first we had a good laugh about the crazy ‚ÄúNSA‚Äù shit that has happened over the past few days, then things got real when I checked my phone and I got a shady text from the ‚ÄúNSA‚Äù number. The text said:

*DC Line: izmatron, we are aware of your knowledge in the matter at hand. Both yourself and friend's name must keep all matters confidential.
DC Line: We are aware that friend's name has called the FBI. Please note that they are aware of our activities through inter-agency cooperation. This is an international matter and out of their jurisdiction.*

So when my friend saw this on MY phone, he almost had a panic attack. His mind wandered and he just wants this to be over, it's a bad dream.

I finally decided to end it on a high note. My friend and I were hanging out at my house and I had my cousin come visit us in formal army attire since ‚Äúthey‚Äù have been monitoring my friend‚Äôs where-abouts and to bring closure to his black-ops paranoia (he has been having nightmares about this). I tried hiding my digi cam to capture the whole thing, but the lighting was terrible, the zoom was grainy, and audio could barely be heard. Sadly, all of the footage was worthless.

My cousin comes to my door and I pretend that I don't know him and he asks if my friend was there. I get my friend to come to the door and my cousin introduces himself as Lt. Colonel Jacobs. My cousin gives my friend a run down of everything that had occurred to recap. After he recapped everything, he had my friend and myself sit due to association and ""knowledge"" of the matter. My friend is sweating, face is red, you can tell he is quite uncomfortable. I had my cousin refer to this as ""Operation Greyfish"" in honor of other friends who helped generate ideas along the way. Finally, after my cousin finished the recap, he pulled a piece of paper that originally was going to be a non-disclosure agreement, but since I was lazy, it just said:

""izmatron has been fucking with you.""

It took a second for everything to register, but when it did he just busted out laughing. Called me a fucking asshole a few times, but that was the extent of it. He was happy that it wasn‚Äôt real, but more interested to know how I pulled everything off since I can‚Äôt normally keep a straight face. I told him how it was done and he was quite impressed. He said he is going to get me back, but we'll see‚Ä¶

I would like to work part time for a company locally that could ideally pay me and give me benefits and tuition reimbursement but I do not believe I have the network set up to land me that job so I'm willing to grovel at the feet of geologists and environmental field scientists for some relevant, professional experience that I can use when I graduate to have some real world experience. I live in Indianapolis. So far I have considered the parks department or to go out and blanket some environmental firms with my resume (not field related but I can work the English language and I have some pretty good references). The problem is, they most likely won't want to hire me to do any crucial work but might hire me to... be a lacky? Again, I don't think I mind getting paid but it would be nice because that would prevent me from needing to get another job to support college and my internship. 

What I'm saying is, what should I try to do to get a job that can help me in any future geology job? What will look best on my resume?

**Important information: I currently attend a community college (without a geology program) and will be transferring to a state college this fall. I have good communication skills and can learn things fast. I have a mediocre understanding of why chemistry works and how it works on the atomic level, but not a thorough understanding yet.

Still drinking a recovery shake after every workout and adding in protein to my diet, I think I'm starting to tell the difference. It seems like I'm getting much more muscle tone this week as apposed to before. Still shooting for fruits and veggies everyday too, I think that's helping my snack choices the most. I've been avoiding fries in favor of bell pepper sticks and apples instead of granola bars. Good deal! 

Still have yet to miss a workout, though sometimes they happen at 1:30am because I feel guilty about going to sleep without having done anything. I guess that's the definition of a habit? The workouts are not getting easier yet so I haven't switched it up but I do feel like my form is getting better and would like to keep my focus on that for a while. When it starts to get boring I'll switch to my other planned workout (kettle bell).

Just found this board and I thought maybe I could get some advice from some of you. I am currently an intern at Noyes Hospital in Dansville (Alfred State requires our last semester to be a internship) and I am currently going to start looking into sending out resumes/looking at apartments. I will graduate with a bach in software application development (focused more on systems A&amp;D)

1) What would be a good place to look at for apartments? I did browse for one while internship hunting but did not look to deep into it. I would be moving up from Wayland with my fiancee, and probably would enough for a decent lease payment to start off with.

2) Does anyone know of/have open positions in their IS staff they are looking to fill? I will be done in May and should have my degree (if ASC does not screw yet another graduate over, has happened to about 3-4 of my friends in the last year). 

For some REALLY quick and summarized info, I have led dev teams in large class projects, worked help desk related jobs (at Noyes and also at ASC). I have taken classes with c++, Java, VB, I am trying to currently learn python since it was suggested to me. I was apart of the networking team over the summers to install the dorms networks (mostly just construction work, not entirely related). 

No biggie if no one has any large leads regarding a job, just thought I would try my luck here as well as normal job hunting. Thank you very much in advance!

My question is: how do I handle salary?

I don't have experience at this level. Salary.com says the bottom  10% of marketing directors make 57k, but due to my inexperience I think even 40k-45k would be good. Due to my inexperience, do I have any ground to ask for a salary bump like this?

All my friends have changed around me they are all keeping count of their scorecard and who gets what first. It has drained me emotionally, and I'm just sick of it. I'm 22 years old and I am back with my parents and I feel like a tottal failure in life. My GPA went down to a 2.4 from a 3.0, because of poor grades, and people treating me unfairly while I was working on projects. I cannot believe that it has gotten to this point. I'm lonely, depressed, everyone is an asshole, I FUCKING HATE IT. On top of it all I gotta deal with my over competitive family.I just hate that its not going my way at all..."

I'm finding college extremely frustrating and the stress is driving me nuts. This makes me wonder: Am I being weeded out? Is CS not for me? Should I drop out? Pick an easier major?

I don't want to give up on programming or CS, even though I'd love to give up on college. I believe I'm interested and motivated enough to become a self taught programmer. However, I'm concerned that employers will not take me seriously without a college degree.

Obviously, the first step is to learn how to program. I would plan on working through various textbooks, but also working on projects to build a portfolio. I'd like to code some Android apps and contribute to an open source project. 

Are employers going to give me a fair shot, assuming I am competent and have a good portfolio? I want to work as a developer, although I'm not sure what field specifically. Video games, embedded devices, accounting software, even web development; it all sounds interesting.

How do I get my foot in the door? Can I get internships if I don't attend college?"
pqeut,5,2012-02-15,Today has been one of the worst days in recent memory.,ihavehadenough,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/pqeut/today_has_been_one_of_the_worst_days_in_recent/,"First time I have been a long time lurker and I really did appreciate knowing that there are others like me out there. I just had to make an account and share my day just to get it out there and not have it eat away at me on the inside. So to start off I had long preparations for the 2 main events of today: a job interview for an internship I really wanted and a 30% midterm.  

Over the past week I put in nearly 4+ hours every evening learning and understanding everything  I needed to do well on the midterm. As for the interview I was making sure that I was able to answer all types of behavioral questions that were common in most interviews. So to cut the story short I woke up today morning knowing that I had done my preparations to my fullest. But the day started off on the wrong note, I went into the interview and suddenly froze up and couldn't focus on the questions being asked nor was I able to reply back without choking on my words. I was going through some major anxiety to the point where I had looks of concerns from my interviewers. I managed to get through the interview and walking out I knew that I had just lost out on the job cause of that horrible interview. Saddened I still had my hopes up since I hoped they would overlook my breakdown for my qualifications and carried on with the day cause I knew I had to be focused for my midterm. But the midterm only further pushed me into my current state of depression, since that was probably one of the worst tests I have ever written in my life. So I come home and find that I had received an email from the employer from the interview earlier and they informed what I had expected in that I was not going to be a good fit for the role. 

So to summarize today was as clear of an indication that no matter how hard I try and how hard I try to make things work I still end up screwing it all up. I have no one to talk to about the pain and suffering I go through just trying to be happy. For once I wish that things would go my way. These past 6 years of my life have been hell and everything I have touched has turned to shit.  I try harder than most of my colleges at school and yet I'm always the one with the shitter grades. As of right now I feel like i should just drift away with my useless life and just not care while I await my death with open arms. 

Sorry if this was a rant that went no where, but i wanted to put my anger out in words. For those who read this thank you.

First time posting here, but I'm looking for a little advice. I am currently a sophomore Biochem major, but I've been thinking of switching to a math major since I passed exam P. I've always really liked math and economics and at first entered college planning on being an actuary, but being an international student it seemed easier for me to pursue some scientific major and then move on to graduate school. I like biochem, but lately it's been draining and I feel like I'm going through the motions without finding any of it really interesting. I took the exam in order to see if I had the mathematical acumen/studying skills necessary to be an actuary.

My question is, how important is it that I have a internship? My school doesn't have an actuarial program and I don't know if I could get a CPT for a summer internship at a firm, so it might be difficult for me to obtain an internship. I'm obviously still going to try finding companies that offer internships to foreign students, but I just want to know how much it would effect my chances at getting hired later on if I don't have an internship.

Also, from your perspective, how willing are companies to hire foreigners that would obviously need H1-B sponsorship?"

She wanted me to clarify if I was looking for freelancing or an internship. Now, I'm 6 months out of graduate school and I've been searching for work in Post Production for months. But on the other hand, although not ideal, having more experience can't be bad and this may help me out in the long run.

So not wanting to turn down an opportunity, I reply that while I'm looking for full-time/contract work, I may consider an internship under certain conditions based on stipend, availability and duration. I just got a reply stating that it's $10/day, and most interns go for 5 days a week, though they are flexible with scheduling. 

My problem is if I am considered an internship, how can I balance this while trying to work my other job? I'm underemployed as a substitute teacher in Queens, where the days are not consistent (I may work 0-5 days a week, with only a day's notice). It gets me by, but not nearly enough. How could I best commit to this position when I'm so dependent on my regular source of income? Transportation alone for this internship for me is at minimum $23/day. Any thoughts?"

I'm aware I've made some less favourable choices but I'd really like some advice/help with what to do, okay...

I'm from the UK and before going to my sixth form to do my A-levels, I was set on becoming an architect and I'd be on set on that for a few years after being introduced to Frank Lloyd Wright &amp; John Lautner at an early age by my dad. However, I also had a passion for music and I had been playing guitar for 6 years then and was partly focused on that. 

So, unclear in hindsight I took A-levels that wouldn't fit with taking an Architecture degree at the end of it and ones more suited towards a music career - however, a career in the music industry (in any position) isn't very well supported in the UK and I only really had the choice of one college (ACM) that seemed to have relatively good prospects.

Fast-forward 2 years and I haven't done that well in my chosen subjects and have been rejected from my music college and don't have the suitable grades to go to Uni. So I take a year off to work and try and gain some suitable work experience.

Now it's February 2012 and I have an acceptance from the music college however, the fees are ¬£9,000 and the most I can get a loan for is ¬£6,000 so that's basically out of the question. I've tried to gain internships at record labels including: Atlantic, Warner &amp; XL Recordings and I'm considering heading back to my Sixth Form to try and gain a couple A-levels that will help me start a career in Architecture but this could cost over ¬£5,000. 

I don't know what really to expect from Reddit but I've seen such great, inspiring advice before for other people's troubles so I am really asking for some genuine advice/past life experiences or suggestions for other pursuits. Any advice, comments or opinions will be very appreciated.

psn0z,132,2012-02-16,My wife is holding a grudge against me because of a dream she had six years ago.,[deleted],Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/psn0z/my_wife_is_holding_a_grudge_against_me_because_of/,"Six years ago while my wife was pregnant with our first child she had a dream/vision/message from God, as she likes to call it.  In that dream we were living in a different town and I was sleeping with our nanny and told my wife I was leaving her.  She woke up angry and said she knew this was going to happen and there is nothing we can do to stop it because her visions always come true and it is a message from God.

Fast forward six years, she is still holding this dream against me.  Just last week at a family gathering I found out her cousin got an internship in the city where I happen to work (its a really bad neighborhood).  I invited her to have coffee whenever she had time.  This was my way of looking out for her family, letting her know I/we are there if she ever needs anything.  The way my wife saw it: ""Oh my goodness my husband is trying to have sex with my cousin and hitting on her in front of my whole family"".  So naturally she quotes that dream and begins to threaten me with divorce while calling me a plethora of colorful names and cussing me out in front of two children.   
Last week I had it and told her she is putting her faith in a fantasy and she could move on if she wants to believe more in this stupid dream than she does in our marriage.  Not sure what to do here but I don't think I can continue in a marriage where someone is holding a conviction for something I haven't even done.  I know God hates divorce and I know the devil is trying to break up my marriage but Damn this has been a rough 6 years.
Thanks for allowing me to vent, I think this will really help and please keep me and my family in prayer.

EDIT: I never mentioned we had a nanny watch our kids from 7-6 and I never slept with her.  We now drop our children off at a day care."
psmtp,3,2012-02-16,What tips do you have for a recent college grad?,mackid,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/psmtp/what_tips_do_you_have_for_a_recent_college_grad/,Any tips for a recent college grad looking for a job? I just got a computer engineering degree and I can't seem to be able to get any jobs to stick. Part of the problem is I don't have any relevant experience outside of school.

I also don't have the money to do side projects of my own so I don't have that to help me out either.

psmd7,1,2012-02-16,My wife is has doesn't trust me because of a dream she had 6 years ago....Not sure how to handle it,[deleted],Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/psmd7/my_wife_is_has_doesnt_trust_me_because_of_a_dream/,"Six years ago while my wife was pregnant with our first child she had a dream/vision/message from God, as she likes to call it.  In that dream we were living in a different town and I was sleeping with our nanny and told my wife I was leaving her.  She woke up angry and said she knew this was going to happen and there is nothing we can do to stop it because her visions always come true and it is a message from God.

Fast forward six years, she is still holding this dream against me.  Just last week at a family gathering I found out her cousin got an internship in the city where I happen to work (its a really bad neighborhood).  I invited her to have coffee whenever she had time.  This was my way of looking out for her family, letting her know I/we are there if she ever needs anything.  The way my wife saw it: ""Oh my goodness my husband is trying to have sex with my cousin and hitting on her in front of my whole family"".  So naturally she quotes that dream and begins to threaten me with divorce while calling me a plethora of colorful names and cussing me out in front of two children.   
Last week I had it and told her she is putting her faith in a fantasy and she could move on if she wants to believe more in this stupid dream than she does in our marriage.  Not sure what to do here but I don't think I can continue in a marriage where someone is holding a conviction for something I haven't even done.  I know God hates divorce and I know the devil is trying to break up my marriage but Damn this has been a rough 6 years.
Thanks for allowing me to vent, I think this will really help and please keep me and my family in prayer."
pskh9,7,2012-02-16,Celebrate the end of the gun registry! Celebrate freedom for guns!,fluffityfluff,halifax,https://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/pskh9/celebrate_the_end_of_the_gun_registry_celebrate/,"Today parliament erupts in celebration for the end of the federal gun registry. There will be loud cheers heard throughout Canada. To magnify the ectasy a cocktail party will be held afterwards to celebrate the vote that ends the assault on gun rights and freedoms.

Gun dealers will no longer have to record information on the guns they sell nor to who those guns are sold once the bill is passed.

""This is wonderful news for gun rights across Canada"" said one federal conservative MP. ""For too many years the freedoms of firearms have been neglected. They have been held down and trampled on by the liberal left of Canada. Today we, as conservatives, have taken a stand and shown to the world that we reflect the priorities of Canadians. We are executing the clear mandate given to us by 11% of the voting population who were clearly informed of the bills and changes we are now seeing passed through parliament.""

""Our priorities are clear. We value freedom from government interference and intervention in private lives and we respect the right of inanimate objects to be free of liberal oppression.""

In other news, the Protecting Children From Internet Predators Act being tabled by the conservatives is set to make its way through parliament. The bill will require internet and communication providers to allow government agencies to monitor and access all customer information and usage history. Service providers will have to record information on the ~~guns~~ phones and internet packages they sell and to who those ~~guns~~ packages are sold once the bill is passed.

The bill is to protect children from child pornographers.

""This is a great day for freedom loving Canadians across the Western provinces!"" said Vic Toews. ""I'm going to get loaded at the cocktail party and go inform John Baird's smoking hot new 20 year old intern about the sanctity of heterosexual monogamous marriage. Privately, of course."""

When I first posted this up here I thought I would only get two or three responses, I wasn't expecting this much. Thank you!**



Hi, I am currently taking an engineering course at my high school and as part of one of the projects we have to interview a couple of engineers. I did have a couple of my dads friends lined up, but they decided at the last minute that they did not have time. I would really appreciate it if some of you could take the time and answer the questions below, it shouldn't take too long, there are only 12 questions and you don't have to write a lot for them (If you don't feel comfortable answering some of the questions in a reply, you can pm them to me).

Also, if you do take the time to answer the questions, please pm me your first name and email address (My teacher requires that we have contact info for the people that I interview).

Questions:

* What discipline did you choose and why did you choose it?

* Did you do an internship, where, how long?  If not did you any on the job training?  How did it prepare you for your future/current job?

* What was the average salary that companies were offering you when you got out of college?

* Where do you work now, and what types of projects do you work on?

* How long does a typical project last?  Can you provide me with an example?

* Most challenging project, why?

* Most fun/interesting project, why?

* What do you do in a typical day?

* What is the most challenging part of your day to day work?

* What is the most rewarding part of being an engineer?

* In your opinion, what is more valuable in engineering, creativity or math skills?

* What advice would you give to a student interested in pursuing engineering?"
psiwi,1,2012-02-16,Louis CK solves the piracy debate.  (No Really.),wyverndarkblood,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/psiwi/louis_ck_solves_the_piracy_debate_no_really/,"My wife and I are fans of Louis CK and she recently bought and downloaded [his latest release](https://buy.louisck.net/) from Beacon Theater.  But his release is also an anti-piracy experiment.  Price it well ($5), and make it easy to get from him directly, and people won't pirate it.  The polls are in, and the experiment worked!  He even offers full financial transparency for how much the production cost, and how much it earned.  For the piracy part skip to the bottom half of the post.

TLDR ~ Louis CK is amazing.  And solved the Internetz.

A couple weeks after downloading the show (we've watched it at least 10 times), Louis sent us this email from the back of a cab:



**Hi.  This is LOuie.  It seriously is me. Im even going to leave
the O stuipdly capatalized because who would pay an intern to do
that?? Okay so you bought the thing with my fat face on it and
you clicked the button that said i could email you. And i know
that now you are thinking ""aw shit. Why'd i let this guy into my
life this way?"". Well dont worry. Because i really swear it that
i wont bug you. I will not abuse this privalage of having your
email. You wont hear from me again... Probably, unless i have
something new to offer you. The reason i'm writing now, in the
back of a car taking me to the Tonight Show set, is to let you
know that as of now there is some new and cool stuff on my site,
related to Live at the Beacon Theater. Theres a thing where you
can download and print a dvd box cover and label so you can burn
and make your own dvd of the video. And theres a new option where
you can gift the special to as many people as you want (for 5
bucks each) and they'll get a nice gifty email from you with a
link to the video.**

**Also, some of you may know, i recently made a statement (that
sounds so dumb. Like i'm the president or something) about how the
video has been doing online. Im pasting it in here below in case
you missed it.**

**Lastly I'm planning to put some more outtakes of the show on
youtube and i think i will put one on the site that is only
available for free to you folks on this list, who bought the
thing and opted in. But dont hold me to that because really i
just thought of it and typed it.**

**Okay well please have a happy rest of the year and more happy
years after that. And please even have been happy in your past.
What?**

**Thanks again for giving me 5 dollars. I bought 3 cokes with it.**

**Regards. Sincerely, Actually,**

**Louis**


===========================
People of Earth (minus the ones who don't give a shit about
this): it's been amazing to conduct this experiment with you. The
experiment was: if I put out a brand new standup special at a
drastically low price ($5) and make it as easy as possible to
buy, download and enjoy, free of any restrictions, will everyone
just go and steal it? Will they pay for it? And how much money
can be made by an individual in this manner?

It's been 4 days. A lot of people are asking me how it's going.
I've been hesitant to share the actual figures, because there's
power in exclusive ownership of information. What I didn't expect
when I started this was that people would not only take part in
this experiment, they would be invested in it and it would be
important to them. It's been amazing to see people in large
numbers advocating this idea. So I think it's only fair that you
get to know the results. Also, it's just really cool and fun and
I'm dying to tell everybody. I told my Mom, I told three friends,
and that wasn't nearly enough. So here it is.

First of all, this was a premium video production, shot with six
cameras over two performances at the Beacon Theater, which is a
high-priced elite Manhattan venue. I directed this video myself
and the production of the video cost around $170,000. (This was
largely paid for by the tickets bought by the audiences at both
shows). The material in the video was developed over months on
the road and has never been seen on my show (LOUIE) or on any
other special. The risks were thus: every new generation of
material I create is my income, it's like a farmer's annual crop.
The time and effort on my part was far more than if I'd done it
with a big company. If I'd done it with a big company, I would
have a guarantee of a sizable fee, as opposed to this way, where
I'm actually investing my own money.

The development of the website, which needed to be a very robust,
reliable and carefully constructed website, was around $32,000.
We worked for a number of weeks poring over the site to make sure
every detail would give buyers a simple, optimal and humane
experience for buying the video. I edited the video around the
clock for the weeks between the show and the launch.

The show went on sale at noon on Saturday, December 10th. 12
hours later, we had over 50,000 purchases and had earned
$250,000, breaking even on the cost of production and website. As
of Today, we've sold over 110,000 copies for a total of over
$500,000. Minus some money for PayPal charges etc, I have a
profit around $200,000 (after taxes $75.58). This is less than I
would have been paid by a large company to simply perform the
show and let them sell it to you, but they would have charged you
about $20 for the video. They would have given you an encrypted
and regionally restricted video of limited value, and they would
have owned your private information for their own use. They would
have withheld international availability indefinitely. This way,
you only paid $5, you can use the video any way you want, and you
can watch it in Dublin, whatever the city is in Belgium, or
Dubai. I got paid nice, and I still own the video (as do you).
You never have to join anything, and you never have to hear from
us again.

I really hope people keep buying it a lot, so I can have
shitloads of money, but at this point I think we can safely say
that the experiment really worked. If anybody stole it, it wasn't
many of you. Pretty much everybody bought it. And so now we all
get to know that about people and stuff. I'm really glad I put
this out here this way and I'll certainly do it again. If the
trend continues with sales on this video, my goal is that i can
reach the point where when I sell anything, be it videos, CDs or
tickets to my tours, I'll do it here and I'll continue to follow
the model of keeping my price as far down as possible, not
overmarketing to you, keeping as few people between you and me as
possible in the transaction. (Of course i reserve the right to go
back on all of this and sign a massive deal with a company that
pays me fat coin and charges you straight up the ass.). (This is
you: yes Louie. And we'll all enjoy torrenting that content. You
fat sweaty dolt).

I probably sound kind of crazy right now. It's been a really fun
and intense few days. This video was paid for by people who
bought tickets, and then bought by people who wanted to see that
same show. I got to do exactly the show I wanted, and exactly the
show you wanted.

I also got an education. And everything i learned are things i
was happy to learn. I learned that people are interested in what
happens and shit (i didn't go to college)

I learned that money can be a lot of things. It can be something
that is hoarded, fought over, protected, stolen and withheld. Or
it can be like an energy, fueled by the desire, will, creative
interest, need to laugh, of large groups of people. And it can be
shuffled and pushed around and pooled together to fuel a common
interest, jokes about garbage, penises and parenthood.

I want to thank Blair Breard who produced this video and produces
my series LOUIE, and I want to thank Caspar and Giles at Version
Industries, who created the website.

I hope with all of my heart that I stay funny. Otherwise this all
goes to hell. Please have a safe and happy holiday, and thank you
again for all this crazy shit.

Sincerely, Louis C.K.

psidv,0,2012-02-16,The value of teachers' unions...,I_hate_fountainhead,education,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/psidv/the_value_of_teachers_unions/,"I came here just to air one of my primary grievances over the current education debate in our country and provide an anecdote for why I think teachers unions are still very valuable to us. 

I'll begin this by saying, I don't think teachers unions don't need reformed, or are educational system in general. Teachers should be like any employee, accountable to to the quality of their product. I believe in a higher accountability, higher benefit system for teachers. However, the problem with the way our educational debate runs in this day and age is exactly what's wrong, there's an overdone focus on the accountability of the teacher. This is only one facet of what's wrong with our education system and it wrongly overshadows other aspects of the system

Now, the anecdote:
I grew up in a poor rural community in Ohio, where like many places in the rust belt, the few manufacturing industries were in a steady decline. Besides being just poor there was still an outdated cultural attitude towards education. ""You don't need college,"" was the mantra among most peoples' parents. On top of that there was a serious youth flight problem, so the demographics swung older.

As could be expected the schools were equally miserable. Our elementary and middle school were built during the Civil War. Passing educational bond items was damn near impossible. Every election our already slim arts and music programs were on the edge of being cut. Big class sizes, low teacher pay, etc... etc...

Anyways, it was our local teacher union which kept things together. Like many small towns we had an overemphasis on the sports program. Our baseball and football programs were regular state contenders and going to a game was the only thing to do on a Friday night. Every election cycle there was a movement to kill the arts and music funding, every election cycle the teachers union gathered and the teachers who ran the sports programs threatened to close up shop, arguing that their programs were no more valuable to the kids than music. Bond item passed. The sum up for vote was always paltry, averaged $9 a person, was still a struggle.

The teachers took it on themselves to actively recruit hometown kids in education in college, so that they could make sure good teachers would come in to the school system and hopefully stay there. If you were in education in college you had members of the teachers union not only checked in to say hello, but would offer to help you with your studies, hook you up with internships, etc... As a result our teacher retention was high and our test scores were the best in the county despite lower teacher incomes.

Our bus drivers and cafeteria workers pay had been static since the 70s and their income was &lt;$5 an hour, which resulted in a strike and informational picket, which because of the unwillingness to pass a bond item meant that we went without cafeteria workers or bus services for more than a year. The teachers were forbidden to strike as well because they had a different union and because of their contracts. Our school superintendents reaction to the striking of the people who used to feed and drive the community's children wasn't exactly.....rational. He hired a security service to protect us from the middle aged ladies waving signs at us and bought 15 vending machines to 'compensate' for the lost lunch services.  As it turned out the low rate security service had a few ex-felons on staff, including one with a rape rap. The controversy gave the teachers union the leverage to force the community to once again pass the controversial bond item...a dread $4 a person.

My point here is teacher's union doesn't just exist to protect teachers jobs. At the local level they typically have a very real concern for the value of the education they provide and for the experience of the kids. On an individual level there are good and bad teachers but they are as a group, out of their own self interest and a care for the kids in their class, the only people acting in the defense of the quality of education.

tl;dr the national education debate attempts to cast teachers unions only as selfish organizations only protecting bad teachers jobs but thy have real potential for measurable good in their communities."

They had us fill at a survey/contact info, but never gave the company name. My teacher seemed a bit weird-ed out by it, but let them do their thing and I sort of forgot all about it until I actually got an internship offer. After meeting with them tonight and actually learning about the place, southwestern advantage, I came home and decided to do a bit of research before my second interview tomorrow. This is what I found:

[http://southwesterncompanytruth.com](http://southwesterncompanytruth.com)

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_Company](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_Company)

WTF? How are these people allowed on college campuses to recruit students? If I hadn't looked into it I would have probably considered the program as I'm only a sophomore and it's hard to get an engineering internship at that level of education and I thought they were legit since they were allowed to present **in my class** at a **major university**.
This is their website, 
[http://southwesternadvantageprogram.com/](http://southwesternadvantageprogram.com/)
I'm not asking you to go there and attack them, I just want to make sure no one falls into this trap by thinking this company is associated with any academic insinuation. I'd also be interested in hearing stories from people who have worked with them.

[Edit1: I've provided a step by step look at what you do with this company over the summer.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/pryii/so_these_people_came_to_my_college_class_to_get/c3rvgam)

TL;DR A major scam company was allowed to come to **my college class with the teacher present,** take student contact information, and try to recruit me for an ""internship"" selling their products door to door for the summer with no wages other than commission, with no provided food or housing, in a random part of the US away from my home and anyone I know. &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

UPDATE!
So I heard back from my professor and she said she had no idea who this group was. When I told her about them it turns out that she has dealt with this group before. They came to her house one summer and, when she didn't buy anything, kept coming back once a week and trying to sell to her. It drove her crazy! She won't be letting them in her class again. I also spoke to one of the head of my college and she said she'd look into making sure all of the teachers know about this.

As for the group, I had one final meeting with them to tell them no and was very alarmed by what the girl I spoke to told me. She was super excited about how she'd work from 8am to 10pm, 6 days a week, every summer, and acted like it was the best thing in the world. She also told me that the stories at the southwestern truth site listed above are all true, but that's just because those people didn't follow the companies ""plan"" for how to sell. I was also informed of the companies safety policy for females. If you go to a house and a man answers the door, ask for a female. If there is no adult female present, speak to the man outside or move on. If a woman is present, it is safe to enter the house... NO IT'S NOT! O.o Females can be rapists and murderers too, but this company tell college age girls that, as long as there is a girl there, you're safe.... &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; 

Anyway, my ordeal is done and I hope this helps others avoid this program as it sounds really terrible! "

prsee,2,2012-02-15,I would appreciate a little advice regarding continuing grad. school.,ckallas2,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/prsee/i_would_appreciate_a_little_advice_regarding/,"Hello r/jobs,

I completed my undergraduate education from the U of I in 2010 and then I took a year off. In that year I worked in politics. I worked on a couple of different campaigns the largest of which was for a, now former, US House member. After that great experience I decided to jump back into academia. I applied and was accepted to a grad school of which I have just begun my second semester.

This semester started with me earning an unpaid marketing internship at a local NFP theatre. I have learned more about the work world in the last month with this internship than I have in the last 20 years of school. I really enjoy the work, it's challenging, I have a knack for it, and it is rewarding.

I'm thinking of withdrawing from this semester and pursuing the internship as full-time as I can (thinking maybe 20 hours a week).  
The pros of me withdrawing:  
I'm fatigued from 20 years of education  
I like the idea of having a job/career a year from now  
I'll be spending less money (school is expensive)  
I can concentrate on my theatre internship

Cons:  
My education will stop at a bachelors  
I will miss out on networking opportunities from my school  
???

I was hoping a fresh set of eyes would evaluate my position and give me an honest run-down.

TL;DR: I have education fatigue."

prpsx,3,2012-02-15,US Web Contractors: 1099 Form Woes,frustratedfreelancer,webdesign,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdesign/comments/prpsx/us_web_contractors_1099_form_woes/,"Back story for those of you who are bored:


I interned for a local marketing/design company this last spring. After they realized my skills were beyond legal unpaid intern levels, they kept me as a cheap contractor instead. I worked from their office for a couple months with regular pay periods, but eventually they moved to a different state and had me telecommute. Then, checks didn't arrive sometimes for as long as 3 months after jobs had been billed. Sometimes they would be mailed on the last valid day but to the wrong address even though the company is very small, the envelopes were done by hand, and my address is on the top of every invoice, a copy of which they have always mailed with the check for record keeping convenience^* . 

I've grown tired of the games, so I decided the most recent job I did would be the last. This meant that payment for that job would be the last thing I tried to get out of them, and the thought made me absolutely delighted. Then I realized that they needed to have a 1099 sent to me by Jan 31st and it was Jan 27th. Damn.

The next day I called and confirmed that one would indeed be sent along with the most recent payment which they were sending ahead of schedule in the next couple of days. Apparently ""a couple of days"" meant ""a week"" because on Feb 6  I finally received confirmation that both had been mailed.

I received the check on the 9th, but not the 1099. My inquiries into the missing paperwork  revealed that they'd actually been mailed out separately and I should wait a day or so more. Needless to say, it didn't show up in the ""next couple of days"" this time either. On the 13th I finally received word that USPS had returned it to them for bad address, same as the late checks previously, and am once again waiting through the ""next couple of days"" for it to arrive.

 
 
 
*- I could only come to the conclusion that this was intentionally done so they'd be returned by USPS and could be re-mailed to buy them a little extra time before the check cleared, as it was let slip that they were financially struggling and the address was never more than a couple numbers or letters off, so it wasn't like they had gotten it mixed up with someone else's.

---

**TL;DR:** Client with history of late payments/suspiciously mailing payments to wrong address is now over two weeks late with my 1099, and neither communicative nor apologetic despite our stellar rapport, as I've been overlooking their untimely payments for some time.

**Should I expect it to ever show up? Do I have any way of ""obliging"" them to produce it if anymore problems arise?**

My personal taxes are of course waiting on this, but more importantly I'm a full time grad student that needs this info for financial aid purposes ASAP since the ideal FAFSA filing date was Jan 15th.

Any general advice on dealing with late payments and paperwork is equally appreciated (though do bear in mind that this is not my primary source of employment, so best practices and common knowledge may not be worth ridiculing me over ;] )."

Just some notes about myself that might help you pick a story

1. I was a wild kid growing up and a party animal high school.  Got in trouble a lot, had to get arrested to open my eyes and find a responsible path and mellow out after 18. 
2. I'm scheduled to graduate from college next December.
3. Wasn't involved at all besides soccer and tennis in High School, am now in college with complete/current internships and organizations. (Going from not all to probably too much the past year)
4. Had 2 serious g/fs in high school. Nothing more serious than casual dating and hook ups in college. Not good at relationships in my opinion. 
5. Have anxiety on a daily basis and over think just about any and all situations.

I had just had an amazing semester and summer at an international internship and thought that everything was better. No one told me I was acting any different, so, although I was always tired and stuff, I thought I was fine...
It turns out, that I was being an (excuse my language) bitch. I was impatient, irritable, short-tempered, and all of the other things that go along with depression. I became fixated (this I was aware of) on the possibility of dying and what that would mean, what would happen, etc. It came to where I found it difficult to even get into a car. 

The crux of this is that I yes, I should have learned the first time I stopped taking it, but this time my grades were fine. This time it was my relationship that suffered and ended. I never told my partner that I stopped...and I became completely unapproachable. I couldn't be told how I was acting because of how I was reacting, so he sat in silence and bore it until he couldn't anymore. I don't know how to tell him that I've started taking my Lexapro again, and that I will probably have to for the rest of my life, and essentially that person...was not me. I don't want him to think I'm making up excuses (because I'm certainly not), it just...it makes things so much worse knowing how much I hurt others because of my ignorance and arrogance (the belief I had that I had ""beaten it"" and couldn't possibly have any more problems).

[I swear this is a true story. I went to a high school in LA and you crashed our prom after party (Universal Hilton). You ended up taking the virginity of a girl named Roseanna. You didn't call her afterwards. She cried a lot. Do you remember any of this and can confirm or have you been so knee deep in hollywood pooty for so long that this qualifies as a mere blip?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5swz?context=5)|I Am Woody Harrelson.
[How much of The Game is factually accurate vs. dramatization? I find it hard to believe you could capture all those quotes from all those people verbatim and then write about them later?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5o7i?context=5)|It is all accurate. What helped was: taking notes in the moment and immediately afterward. Also, at ProHo, once guys knew who I was, I started recording things. And I think in retrospect what really allowed me to put everything in there was the fact that when you were in the field, you were thinking, ""I can't wait to go home and write a field report about this."" So you were always immediately, while it was fresh, writing out a word by word, blow by blow, report for other guys.
[Everyone I talk to about Pick up has negative views towards it. They think it's bullshit.¬†Why is Pick Up so detested and/or seen as something ineffective or without substance?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5ni3?context=5)|It makes sense: Here's a quick rushed explanation. Women have naturally evolved a way to filter men of higher status that they should be with from ones of low status that they shouldn't, and if guys have somehow figured out a ""hack"" for this, then it renders that system useless. And that's not a good thing for them.
[Cross posting this from the other thread since I think I got it in there too late.  Neil-  Some critics of you and the seduction community assert that there is an undercurrent of misogyny in the community. Do you think this criticism is warranted?  In your own experience with the community, do you think any of those practicing PUA had or have psychological issues?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5o3g?context=5)|Oh, absolutely, a lot of the guys have psychological issues. I think everyone has psychological issues, in the world, just about--no one was raised perfectly. But I think the psychological issues in the community are more about men's low self-esteem, and not about negative attitudes towards women. In fact, as I write it, I realize their negative attitude is only toward themselves. So if their experience in the community fixes this, then that's a good thing.
[How is your relationship with Tyler Durden, Mystery, Ross Jeffries, Steve P? How are they doing, if you know? What do you like about each of the schools now, espcially RSD? Pick up is now generally moving away from routines/indirect and towards just pure direct intent.  How do you feel about this? What did you take away from routines? How have your views on building and maintaining relationships changed from the end of The Game to now? Alternatively, what would you from right now say to yourself from 7 years ago? Are you still meeting people (like in clubs or wherever)? How were the PUAs back in the day, like realistically, how good were they and what stuff did they do right and differently. And have you gone out with newer puas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5ntx?context=5)|I've seen all of them this year, and am on good terms with all. Feel like they were all part of my life and integral to the book. Trends in pickup are kind of idiotic. One does what works. I'm sure someone will ask me specifically about direct vs indirect, so if they don't ask that again so I can share my thoughts on it. Feel like you should read, considering your question.

[What age did you go bald? How did it effect you? If an easy cure came along, would you take it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5t9r?context=5)|Not growing a huge crazy 'fro while I had the chance.  Waiting so long to just shave it off, and going around for years trying to hide the bald spot and receding hairline. Hiding anything you're insecure about is generally not good. Like Mystery said in the book, if you can't fix it, feature it.
[Is there any way for a girl to go from a friends-with-benefits situation to something more serious?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5zgz?context=5)|What turns off a guy a girl is sleeping with is the same thing that turns off a girl a guy wants to sleep with: desperation and neediness. So eliminate those from your behavior in the friends-plus-ship.

(And if so, why wait so long to do an AMA??)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r6bh9?context=5)|I'm a lurker. But thank you.

[How do you feel the Pickup Artist show on Vh1 affected the seduction community? Also, did any of those people in the show go on to become teachers in the community?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5pv7?context=5)|I think it ended up getting a lot more people into it. And I thought it sympathetically portrayed the guys trying to learn it and, since the viewership was more women than men, actually helped in the end.  And I don't know if any of the guys teach it, but I know a lot of them are around and still practicing it. Great group of guys, and I see them as much as I can.  The toughest thing for them was they didn't get enough teaching on the show. The producers wouldn't let Mystery interact with them when the cameras weren't rolling, and the teaching time was really limited.  But thought the show was great and fun, both seasons.
[How do you feel about the monetizing of the pickup community?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5wra?context=5)|I feel like it's made it confusing for guys getting into it now. In the past, you'd go to the main forums and there was this free exchange of information. Now all the information comes with a price tag, and you don't know if it's from someone who's credibly using it with success or if it's just a good marketer with no social skills whatsoever trying to make money.   That's why communities like this are great: truth is (generally) sorted from bs pretty quickly.

Each time you see them, you can add a little piece and let the attraction grow more naturally (and also more subtly).
[Do you still keep in touch with Courtney Love?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5mt9?context=5)|Yes, talked to her for like two hours yesterday, and used to stay at her place in LA.

[Have you ever had approach anxiety, if so how do you deal with it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5mnr?context=5)|Yes, and in fact, the better I got, the more approach anxiety I developed. This is because people start to know who you are, and expect miracles and no failures. There is only one way to get over it: to approach. Right away. The longer you wait, the more the fear builds. Just accept it as a normal evolutionary response, but also a vestigial holdover fear from a tribal society that no longer really has a purpose.
[What's your opinion of *The Blueprint Decoded*?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5li2?context=5)|Actually, Tyler came to speak at a seminar I had a few months ago. Was great to see him and reconnect. He showed some incredible in-field videos that were evidence that the guy has balls of steel. Great escalation and cocky/funny/teasing/pebbles.
[Have your feelings about Tyler changed since releasing *The Game*? Should I feel bad giving into his teachings?   **THANKS!!**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5li2?context=5)|And you shouldn't feel bad, if it's working for you. In the end, the problems were really a function of living together, more than anything else..
[You've met all kinds of people form all walks of life - who is the biggest out-and-out asshole?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5ybh?context=5)|Interesting question, and I've had people be rude, but generally it was just a wall, and once I got through it, they turned out to be a great person. I suppose assholes are like bitches: we think someone is like that, but that's only because they somehow threatened our sense of self and self-esteem--and if we see them with empathy, in most cases, we realize they're just as insecure as we are, if not more so.
[Hey Neil. I read **The Game** (good job, by the way, it inspired me to read Ulysses) and **Emergency** and took a trip with my friend out to California to try to find the cache you hid. I got to Big Basin and to the Lane camp site, but there were a couple clues we just couldn't figure out, and the others we did figure out seemed worthless without the rest. How close were we? Also, has anyone found it yet? And what's the reward for it?  The 25 paces east clue (or however many paces it was, I don't have the book in front of me) was especially frustrating, because 1) I couldn't figure out where to start pacing from, and 2) even if I could, I'm taller than you, so I could easily wind up a couple meters off mark. The other thing, how deep is it buried? Is that one of the clues I couldn't figure out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r660y?context=5)|No way, and how'd you like Ulysses? Hope you had some help when you read it. And hey, I can't say what are it may or may not be. But good for you, and no one has found it yet. And it's not buried more than 2 or so feet deep.
[But as it IS an AMA, I guess I'll pop a question as well :) So here it goes: Do you really think ANYONE can improve their AFC status? I always keep on thinking that it's a great means of self-improvement **for the better looking** part of the population, as opposed to less/or undesirable looking people(I kind of find myself swimming in this latter crowd, as I'm a 22 y.o who suffered 3rd and 4th degree burns on more than 30% of my body). What I'm trying to say is, people like me have to work ten-times fold to even get accepted in society, and it's something you can only WORK on, unless you sit on a shitload of money that can rebuild your traits through surgery. What's there in-store for us? How do we find appreciation, human-connection and why not even love? :)  **TL;DR: [appreciation and personal opinions on Neil Strauss work...]**  **Do you really think ANYONE can improve their AFC status?**  **What's there in-store for undesirable looking people? How do we find appreciation, human-connection and why not even love?**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r6epi?context=5)|I like the way it was described, and very cool. Thank you for saying that: most people think of it as this crass how-to lad's manual, when, you're right it's really a memoir of a pivotal period in my life. As said below, what you can't fix, you feature. You don't need to rebuild your traits. You just need to build up your personality. And it just has to be a little more positive, funny, intelligent, and outgoing than the next guy's to compete---and I promise you, because I've seen it with many people with all types of handicaps, you will be able to compete with ANYONE.
[I'm impressed by your books, bust most importantly I read ""The Game"" over and over again.  And I'm still so interested by the chapters that include PROJECT HOLLYWOOD.   My question to you is; Was Project Hollywood as intense as you described it, or was it flared up some for sake of the book?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5ng9?context=5)|It was that intense and more. Had to leave a lot out of the book. Think about reality shows when a bunch of people are living together, then add Mystery and Courtney Love to the mix (lots of Courtney questions so far)--and you'll realize what would be abnormal is if there was no intensity!
[What is your stance on some PUA/seduction concepts like 'last minute resistance' (LMR), where a woman will resist advancing to sex. Many practitioners of PUA/seduction offer advice and 'tricks' on how to get a woman to stop resisting sex. How do you feel about that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5y8k?context=5)|You raise a good question, much more rational than your username would imply. And the answer is: Is it a technique designed to push someone to do something they DON'T want to do (in which case it's not only immoral but possibly illegal) or is it a technique designed to make someone comfortable with something they WANT to do but are just nervous about (in which it can end up being a great experience for both people)?
[On a separate but somewhat related note, how much do you feel the western world's increasingly 'isolationistic' mentality (i.e. walking around with headphones in, not wanting to be bothered or disturbed) works against the idea of actually meeting someone in your day-to-day life and asking them out, or even having a conversation? **Are future generations doomed to have to read The Game and similar instructional books in order to learn how to socialize and meet with people outside their immediate circles?**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5y0l?context=5)|And, yeah, wouldn't it be easier if the roles were reversed. That was always my ambition with The Game, that it would even out that disparity a little. And ""doomed to read The Game,"" nice word usage. Answer is: I think there will always be guys who have it and guys who don't, so some will always be ""doomed"" to read it. But for sure, every hour i spend socially interacting staring at a screen here probably lowers my comfort with socially interacting IRL. So the burden again is on the individual to make sure their life is in balance. And that becomes more challenging the more great tools people create online.
[Are you still what that girl you ended up going in a relationship with that you mentioned at the end of your book The Game? Also how many women have you slept with would you say since you first got into the seduction game, a rough estimate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5szi?context=5)|And never counted or quantified.
[I'm a mod at /r/pickup4dykes and am about to read The Game (it's on hold for me at the library right now - hope you don't mind me not paying for it!). Which of your books would you recommend for women interested in picking up women?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5qj9?context=5)|I'd read The Game and Rules of the Game of mine, maybe someone else here wants to recommend others more specifically on the subject. But it applies. Just had a Twitter discussion recently with a woman reading it to meet women, and have had female couples come up to me.
[How do you approach and engage a target who has her headphones on, or is absorbed in a book or newspaper without being obnoxious?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r6syp?context=5)|Offhand, what would be funny is to start talking and gesture for her to take them off. Then when she does, just be moving your mouth and not saying anything.
[Did you ever succeed in going 30 days without an orgasm?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5xnb?context=5)|Never!   Interesting username, just read an interesting manifesto by William Hazlitt (I think), called On the Pleasure of Hating.
[Can peacocking be so outrageous that it ends up becoming detrimental to the game?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r65vm?context=5)|Yes, the line is: Are you wearing the clothes or are they wearing you?
[If you could tell everyone who read The Game just one additional fact using what you've learned since then, what would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r8l4y?context=5)|Rule one of AA: Life is fun if you open your mouth.
[I ruined a relationship by not realizing how important it was to me, and now I have a serious case of one-itis while she's moved on. How do I get her back, or get over her?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r6sni?context=5)|Isn't that so true: people don't appreciate it while they have it, then when it's gone they do.  My sincere guess is that this is mostly your ego state. And as soon as you have her back and are confident that the relationship is 100 percent on again, you will start not appreciating her again.  So first you have to examine your true intentions and motivations here. Because if you do get her back, and then change your mind again or have doubts again, that's not fair to her.
[What do you do for fun (outside of writing/interviews)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5ybl?context=5)|Surfing and, my favorite, putting together groups of about 12 people (old friends and new friends and even people I've never met) and having a night of fun adventures. How about you?
[How did you get started in journalism? How did you make your way to the Rolling Stone? Any advice to a soon to be college grad looking to (roughly) emulate your career as a journalist/author?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r8g6c?context=5)|Got it.   And it was an internship during college that got me started. Hey, if you're willing to work for free, there's no end to the amount of people who will be willing to exploit you.  Seriously, best way to get experience. And once I was writing for that small magazine (called Ear, R.I.P.), then I started writing for a slightly bigger one, then slightly bigger, until eventually Rolling Stone.  So advice for you is: internships, and be willing to pay your dues and do the hard work and put in the Gladwellian 10,000 hours.
[Oh Man, I loved The Dirt.  When's the movie coming out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r6esm?context=5)|Thanks. The script is written, by Rich Wilkes, incredible! But don't know what's going on with the movie. Think a guy named Rick Yorn is producing, so let's get him to do an AMA and put the pressure on!
[Can we smell your finger..?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5vw9?context=5)|Yes, and you'd smell what you're looking for. Rolled out of bed to do this, so you may not want to smell my breath.

I attend Berklee College of Music (One of the best music schools in the world) and am on the Dean's list. I've made impressions on every teacher I've had so far and they've only said kind things about me.

In spite of this, I don't want to get out of bed anymore. Everything seems immensely futile since it will one day be gone anyway, no matter how much I try to preserve it. I don't get why I should try but I know I should. I don't want to be nihlistic anymore but my logical thinking contradicts any attempts at trying to live in the now and feel good. I haven't felt enjoyment for a long time, and I'm trying to give myself praise and time to feel happy but it doesn't happen. I take 100mgs of Prozac a day and I still feel this way. I'm at an ends and I really can't help but feel like suicide is the only way out. I just don't enjoy anything because I think about it literally - video games are me sitting down and just using a keyboard and mouse to do shit in some made-up world, movies are stories and summarized in minutes on Wikipedia, music doesn't even appeal to me anymore because I can't finish anything I do, and even if I did it wouldn't matter."
pua81,8,2012-02-17,Hi A2!  I'm hoping for help finding a place to live this summer.,Goonbaggins,AnnArbor,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/pua81/hi_a2_im_hoping_for_help_finding_a_place_to_live/,"I've looked around a little bit at sublets on Craigslist, but figured asking on here may be smarter.  I've never actually been to Michigan, so I don't know the town at all yet.

My currently planed dates are approximately May 1st - Mid August, and I'll need something completely furnished.  I'll be commuting to Dearborn for an internship, so I guess I'm looking for somewhere it's easy to head east from.  In terms of roommates I'm fairly relaxed as long as there won't be lots of late night parties on week nights.

So is anyone looking to sublet their place, or have any suggestions on where I can find something?  Any suggestions for spending the summer?  I'm rather excited about the weather.  Last summer I was consistently experiencing 110+ degree  days.  Thanks!"
pu9x8,9,2012-02-17,Should I omit my college experience on applications to minimum wage jobs?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/pu9x8/should_i_omit_my_college_experience_on/,"And if so, how do I make sense what I've been doing the past 5 years?

I'm almost 25, have my bachelor's degree, and just finishing up an internship at an amazing some-what-big-name company. Unfortunately, they are in a sort of hiring freeze currently and can't bring me on full time. 

I need to find another in-betweenie job, something like Target/Walmart/High-turnover retail type place that is always hiring -- just to make ends meet while I search for another career-oriented position. Problem is, I've already had 3 places tell me I'm basically ""over-qualified"" for the position. 

My internship, a work-study position I had in college, and a bit of freelancing is my only real work experience.


How do I make myself more appealing to retail employers? I'm sure they're afraid I'm going to leave at any sign of a better job -- which I AM, not that I tell them that. But, these places are notorious for high-turnover, what do they expect?"

pu4sn,5,2012-02-17,How competitive am I for an entry level recent graduate job?,TheTaoOfBill,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pu4sn/how_competitive_am_i_for_an_entry_level_recent/,"About to graduate in April. I'm starting to apply to positions far out of state. So I don't have too much as far as networking to rely on out there.

But I feel like I may have more experience than the average fresh graduate.

I worked 2 software development jobs simultaneously for 9 months. Both in ASP.NET and both for 16 hours each A total of 32 hours a week developing in ASP.NET. Recently I quit one of them because my last semester in college is a bit more intense and I didn't have time for both. I intend on keeping the job I am still working at 16 hours a week until I graduate and find my entry level job. Both of these jobs involved experience with SQL, JQuery, CSS, and anything else you'd expect a typical web app intern to work with.

During my time in school I wasn't an impressive student GPA wise and my school itself is probably a tier 2 or 3 school. However I was a member of a student organization focused on creating video games through programming and design elements. I attended the club for 2 years and I was eventually elected president of the club in my final year. As president I generally helped people understand game development concepts through the XNA as well as unofficially tutored members in their CS homework.

That's my story so far. How competitive am I for an entry level position?

My boss tells it me will be December when the position will open and I will get an offer (keep in mind it's June/July). A month later this random girl shows up and is a new full time employee in our depart. Her fiance works at a different location and bitched and moaned until she was hired. Her total time between interview-over-employment, 3day. Now dumb cunt is moving departments because she can't cut it in ours and taking the full time position with her, even though she's filling a contractor spot. It's been almost two years, still no job.

ptfnv,5,2012-02-16,Am I being ridiculous?,crayzeebitchgf,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ptfnv/am_i_being_ridiculous/,"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year and a half. For 6 months or longer, he (23) and I (F, 20) had been talking about maybe getting a place together when our leases end, since they end at the exact same time. We definitely hadn't made any concrete plans, but it was something I felt good about and was vaguely looking forward to. 

Then, we got in a big fight a few weeks ago, and he told me the next day that if we fight like that he's not comfortable living with me. Admittedly, the fight was my fault; I took out unrelated stress on him when I shouldn't have. I apologized profusely. His response seemed really weird and sudden since just a few days ago, he'd been talking about ""our place"" so excitedly, but I didn't want to disagree or pressure him or force either of us to make an immediate or rash decision. 

Since then, I've been trying really hard to keep the peace. He was still talking about moving in with a friend of his (who I'd never even heard of before), but I decided to spend next semester at an internship out of state. Therefore, I decided that since I'd probably be gone for a few months anyway, it was best if he just moved in there. I was a little hurt that he didn't want to live with me anymore, but I definitely understood.

Then he told me more about his plans, only after I asked. He wants to move into a duplex with 3 guys living on one side and 3 girls living on the other side. He only knows one of the guys. They're all friends and they hang out in each other's sides all the time. And that makes me really uncomfortable. 

I don't know if that's okay of me to be upset about, but I am. I guess it's partially my own insecurities. I don't think he would ever cheat on me, but I'm just afraid he'll get really close with one of those girls or just think they're all really cool while I'm in another state, and since they're all older and probably more independent (I don't have a car right now) than me. They all seem really creative and artsy- something that my boyfriend is but I'm not, or at least not as much as I'd like to be. I'm so afraid he'll start to think ""wow, she's pretty lame; I could do a lot better."" 

Plus, in general I'm just uncomfortable around a lot of girls, and I feel like I'm gonna be uncomfortable hanging out there ever. Just thinking about it makes me sick to my stomach. I don't know if that's weird or terrible on my part, but I feel like it's not right of him to move in with other girls, especially if he knows how much it upsets me.
I told him all this, and he was pretty mad and told me I was being selfish and ridiculous, and that he doesn't understand it at all. He said he wouldn't be uncomfortable at all if I moved in with 3 guys (which I kinda think is bullshit). 

Of course it's not up to me to make choices about his living situation, especially when he's so excited about it and thinks he could be so happy there. I get that, but I just don't think it's right of him and I know I'll be so nervous and uncomfortable all the time if he moves in there. 

I feel like I can't stay with him if he does it, but he says there's no other options. I guess on top of all that I'm hurt that he's afraid of moving in with me, but comfortable moving in with one friend and 5 strangers, 3 of whom are girls. I feel so shitty and sad and hurt, and I'm thinking of ending an otherwise happy relationship. Am I crazy?"

I'm currently based in the UK - graduated from a Ba Film &amp; TV course last summer. I'm trying to get into the industry - but I'm starting to get the feeling that it's not going to happen here (not on a writing level). Furthermore, I feel like I identify a lot more with American material (especially TV drama). 

In order to just get a feeling for the business across the pond - maybe get a foot in the proverbial door - I'd love to do an internship. I know they're unpaid most of the time - I'm not fussed about that for now.
  

So my question is - does anyone have any experience with this?  
I'd greatly appreciate any tips on how to approach people, what kind of people etc.  
I've read that there's a shitload of internships around Hollywood all the time, but it's a bit hard to get a feel for that all the way from London.  

Any tips on how to get a nice 4-8 weeks long unpaid internship at some sort of screenwriting related workplace would be incredibly helpful. I'm not bothered about doing the menial work, I've been a runner before, on and off set. I just want to get some work experience, and hopefully meet some kindred spirits in the process.
  

**TL;DR:** Currently in UK. Looking for tips on how to get a 4-8 week screenwriting related internship (in LA preferrably).

I already have my plans for this summer laid out which leaves me basically 2 more in which I can do stuff before graduating.

I feel I would not have a problem getting either a summer research position at my college or an internship. Summer research here entails working with a professor for either 4 or 8 weeks on a related field of study doing research and getting paid. I would probably prefer to do this because for one it is not terribly competitive to get and it also gives good pay. I would make $3,000 for 2 months of work.

An internship however may look better on a resume and I know that building a resume ends up paying off quite a bit more over my career.

I am certain that I will do an internship at least one summer, most likely my junior year summer. Is it a good idea to try to get a second internship my sophomore year summer or would I be alright going with the research opportunities?"

pvh8g,1,2012-02-18,Too many interests: I don't know what I want in life anymore or who I want to be,ThoreauIsCool,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/pvh8g/too_many_interests_i_dont_know_what_i_want_in/,"As a child, I have always enjoyed fiction, fantasy and history - whether within the quiet and reserved context of History Channel documentaries or Disney movies (Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily my favorite stylistically and thematically). I've always loved the worlds portrayed and used to wish I could live in those times. Indeed, my strongest academic subjects are the humanities: history and English I have consistently enjoyed all my life, both as hobbies and as classes. I love the hands-on, speculative nature of these subjects, how they give you so much creative and analytical freedom.

I've been told time and time again that I'd make a good archaeologist, anthropologist, curator, something of the sort. I could definitely fancy a nice job in a museum, helping to date and sort pieces. Everything about the past fascinates me, to the point it's almost a childishly nostalgic, Holden Caulfield-esque obsession. Some of the more trivial examples? I love the handpainted backgrounds of old cartoons, old boxy-framed cars, EGA 16-color computer games, what have you. Even the old Windows 9x icons, I felt, had more character and descriptiveness about them than the increasingly glossy, gradient-filled icons that have been plaguing the Windows OS since XP and now well into 7.
What's wrong with history, then? I don't know - I'm not a big academics person and I don't think I could ever commit myself to a job in history. One typically requires a master's or Ph.D in order to attain safe employment, but I don't want to teach either. I like to be my own boss and keep my options open, something I really don't think I'd be able to maintain if I had to fall back to becoming a professor.

I also have an interest in graphic design and website design, the former of which I've done a lot for my school over the years. I was assistant and later chief editor of our high school newspaper's layout in the last two years, and I really enjoy designing things like posters, logos, what have you. I really enjoyed working on the school's paper, just hanging out, throwing ideas around with one another and improvising with everything. A productive and creative atmosphere to work in, one I truly reveled in. I don't consider myself very good though, and whilst I do want to do some intern stuff whilst in college in this field, I don't know if it's right for me as a longtime career. I can only work on things that truly compel me, and I feel as though expanding this into a full-blown profession would sap me of my motivation and creativity.
 
My dad is a photo retoucher and graphic designer, and as much as I share his passion, I have the problem of questioning myself and my abilities all the time.

This is where things get particularly confusing. I've also had a huge passion for game design since I was a child. I've done a lot of game modding, particularly level design and texture artwork. Unfortunately, I seldom get anything done - admittedly suffering from a bit of an inferiority complex, it won't be long before I decide to completely scrap a map for whatever reason. I'll often imagine a modification fully complete, or imagine one totally cool room in a custom map, but then anywhere from an hour to weeks into development I'll realize I just have nothing else to work with to create the rest of the project. And then I scrap it.

Here's an analogy that only some gaming veterans who've really been in tune with the developers over the years will get. I think of myself a lot like Ken Rolston or John Romero - a visionary, who likes to do a bit of anything and everything and thinks about the final product, but often gets in over his head. I've had so many ambitious ideas for games, but I never get far with them. And I don't know what part of game design I'm best at - I can do everything but program, which kind of sucks because it means I can't really entertain any of my ideas.

As stated, I definitely am more of a theory sort of person when it comes to design, not a technical ""this is how it has to be"" sort. I think I'd be really good at writing or world design - focusing on the big picture, how the story or factions play out, how a city is designed and the history behind its architecture. There's one story in particular I've been gradually fomenting in the back of my head, that I definitely want to make into an adventure game someday. You know who I'd like to be like, sometimes? Yahtzee Croshaw. Someone who just kind of gets to do a bit of everything in designing games. Adventure and role-playing games are certainly my favorite genres, I'll tell you that.

I've kind of bounced around between level design, art, what have you. Texture design is the only area in which I feel moderately up to par with the skills of, say, a student of my age specializing in such a field. Jack of all trades, master of none. It's also the only website I've ever technically ""finished"", even though it's lacking some images and full of placeholders at that. I know the ins and outs of HTML/CSS/PHP, but I have virtually no incentive to use them unfortunately. I'm redesigning a non profit organization's website for a friend this month, but I don't know how well that'll go. I need to work on aesthetics for sure.

But I don't know where to go from here - I've considered simply keeping all the design stuff as a hobby, of course - most game developers start out that way. However, I don't know what to do for college. I was thinking of becoming an English major possibly, since I'd have a lot of freedom in what to work in. Too bad they get such a bad rep. I was thinking it'd be cool, somewhere down the line, to start my own printing/publishing business or something of the sort. Something on a local level, that's both involved and fulfilling to my want to play around with different aspects of design. I definitely want to play it safe though, to a degree. The fact my parents are baby boomers doesn't help much as my dad is pushing into his mid 60's. I want to be well-established, for my parents to be proud of me. Not go the way of some Bohemian hipster designer who's living in between social security checks. It's far too late for that.

I've had innumerable hobbies, interests and projects over the years, and yet I can never bring myself to stick to one of them. I can't commit myself to being a particular person - I simply feel it would be contrary to my (our) nature to live one's entire life as, say, ""that guy who makes the &lt;video games/artwork/short stories&gt;."" I have no real goals to aspire to in life, other than having the time and money necessary for me to sustain myself and my hobbies.

But familiarity is extremely important to me - if not in interactions with others than in personal rituals and routines. I'm a pretty conservative person (both politically and socially) and there's very much a sense that I can only do something if I understand it. I'd sooner fail a project than do some impersonal, ingenuine half-baked job that doesn't speak my true colors. I've abandoned lots of projects over the years (video game mods, stories) because I feel as though I'm not doing them proper justice. People will tell me that they thought my work was brilliant, and I'm simply too much of a perfectionist, but I simply lack the fortitude with which to tell myself that's the truth. I feel as though the notion of work, the thrill of starting a new project, is far more gratifying to me than actually completing it - perhaps it's because I'm more interested in distracting myself than attempting to evoke some particular response or criticism from others.

As a child, I was always lauded as brilliant in school - and looking back retrospectively, so many friends and family members wonder where I went wrong. People tell me of how much they would strive to achieve were they in my position, and why is it that I don't put my creative and intellectual energies to some great endeavor? I simply feel no reason to - it's pitiful, because I feel a strong sense of obligation and duty to my family and society at large.

I had a leg up on other kids in school, and yet my constant indecisiveness and self-doubt have led me astray. In in my hobbies and schoolwork, I'm constantly working frenetically, stretching myself thin if you will, to strive to be a jack of all trades because I don't know what I truly want to do - writing, artwork, video game design, etc. I had the potential and the opportunities with which to do virtually anything I wanted, to change the world, and yet I didn't act on them. Because I didn't specialize, and simply continued to try and remain on top of everything - for instance, I had wanted to do graphic design when I was a kid, and whilst in the beginning I would say I had a greater inherent talent for it than others, I would get stuck in a depressive rut, whislt other kids who had less ability but were more passionate about the field would take classes and do work.

And now everybody else has grown up and found their place in the world, and in spite of everything I had when I was younger, it's all been utterly wasted. The only thing I still feel even remotely confident about is my ability in writing, but nothing else. And there are some days, in my darker moments, where even that I completely shirk in favor of being an unproductive slob. I feel cursed for how my mind can wander so freely, and have such hunger to explore so many different fields whilst I have left my own social person and interaction with others blank and unrevealing."

John started for a moment, not used to the sounds of life this late. *Someone else has nothing better to do, I guess,* he thought idly, slowly plucking away a letter at a time. He sighed, he did have better things to do, rather he just didn't care to do them.

*Squish. Squish. Squish.*

Someone soaked from the downpour outside walked quickly across his doorway, shoes squeaking and squashing with water.

""Hey!"" John smiled.

Silence.

John rose from his chair and stuck his head out the office door, looking after the newcomer. However, the hallway was still, fluorescent lights droning, the lifeless expanse led to nothing but closed door after closed door. *Must work in one of those offices,* thought John, as he returned to his desk and proceeded to plug away on the project. The rest of the night continued without incident, but John couldn't help to wonder about the strange visitor. He concluded his work, packed up, and left for the night.

 + + +

Several weeks passed with John staying late, busying his mind and burying the past. Each time the evening saw rain, the man would make an appearance. Each time he would throw open the door. Each time he would make haste down the hallway, squishing and squashing and swishing with every step. And each time he would disappear behind one of the doors down the hall before John could attempt further contact. John had surmised he must be a caretaker of sorts, tending to the interior during storms or showers. When John saw the man, he would greet him as he passed, but the man never returned the cordiality. Never stopped to receive John, to piss and moan about the shitty hours, to banter on about some sleazy intern.

One evening the rain beat down harder than usual, setting liquid fists to John's window. He had been slaving over reports all week and things were looking up. Tomorrow held the allure of a date with the woman he had been seeing now for a week or so, and he had no intention of staying later than necessary tonight. Joanna held something special, and his memories of Marie slowly began to slip away.

Tapping at his keyboard, he heard the familiar *slam!* of the exterior door down the hall, the routine *squish, squish,* of the wet sneakers, the *swish* of wet clothes. He watched the corridor from the corner of his eye, determined in his lifted spirits to gain audience with the caretaker (*or technician, or plumber; whatever he was*). The subtle noises grew louder, louder still, and just as they seemed to climax at John's doorway, they began to rapidly vanish.

*Maybe he forgot something?* John thought, perplexed, as he leaned back in his chair. He studied the hallway from his seat, a small segment swathed in shadow from the large filing cabinet adjacent to his entrance.

The sound died out and John was left with silence.

3 minutes passed. *Tick, tick, tick.*

5 minutes.

10 minutes.

John rose from his seat and walked quietly to the door, peering up and down the hallway as he had done many nights before. As expected, nothing. John shrugged, returned to his desk, and continued his work, though with a bit more haste now. A chill drew his attention, and he turned to find his window ajar, the cool, moist breeze a welcome distraction. *I must've forgot to close that,* he thought. He stood from his seat and approached the window, gave a quick look out, letting the rain splash his face, and then wound it shut. As he returned to his desk, he made a quick detour to the supply closet at the far corner of the room. The printer was out of paper, and figured *what the hell, I'm already up*. Suddenly, John's hair perked, an uneasy sensation rolling over him, a feeling of being watched. He turned and looked over his shoulder towards the door and his heart leapt into his throat. The man was standing there, beset by the door frame, enveloped by the glow of the hallway, his face a vision of pallor. Clothing hung limply on his meager shoulders, water dripped to the floor. *Plop. Plop.* The face looked unaccustomed to the stubble it adorned, the eyes sunken, the matted hair in shambles across his brow. The stranger's gaze was fixed on John, beyond John, and though his labored breathing was a hoarse break in the quiet, his chest neither rose nor fell.

John's eyes dropped to the ax in the man's hands. A hickory handled, crimson bathed, 7-inch blade slowly rocked back and forth aside the man's knee. John went pale, his hands rattling against the keyboard as his terror took control.

""Wh-what do you want?"" He asked meekly.

The man parted his mouth momentarily, but instead of an answer, John was met with a deafening scream.

John screamed as well. Trying to scamper out, he stumbled, falling to the ground. He regained his footing and sprinted past the man, almost through the man. He didn't stop to wonder why the man didn't react, why he didn't try to stop him, he just kept running. He fumbled in his pocket for his phone, meaning to dial the police when a third scream echoed behind him. Only this one was different, this one was filled with agony, with pain and suffering. John stopped in his tracks and turned, chancing his fate to satisfy his curiosity. He stood there, once again counting minutes as the passed.

3 minutes passed. *Tick, tick, tick.*

5 minutes.

10 minutes.

John placed his phone back in his pocket and quietly advanced towards his office. *One quick look, that's all I need, then I'll call the cops,* he thought. The air felt thick, a sharp, metallic smell pervading his nostrils. Beads of sweat danced along his eyebrows, his breath became shallow, and the door moved ever closer. He finally reached his destination and snuck a quick look.

He stepped back in shock.

""What the fuck?"" he whispered, more a question of his own sanity than of the events that transpired.

The supply closet was open, paper and folders and ink and pens were strewn across the ground. A man lay on the floor, the ax buried in his chest, blood seeping into the carpet. It wasn't the stranger John had seen over the past several nights, no, this was a new visitor. The gun in his hand bespoke malignant intentions, the mask on his face confirmed it. John looked around the room, inspecting the corners, the dark, expecting the rain-soaked man to appear and attack him, but there was no one to be found. He once again fetched his cell-phone, fiddling with the keypad before finally completing his call to aid.

 + + +

The police report indicated that the dead was Lane Geotz, husband to Joanna Goetz. John had been a target of opportunity: Joanna knew he stayed late, that nobody else would have been present, that John had just received his paycheck, and that he carried the $17,000 engagement ring meant for Marie everywhere he went. No one believed his story of the soaked savior, the drenched defender, the man with the ax who surely saved his life.

A few days after the incident, John ran across a news story several years old that turned his heart to ice:

*Hero dies saving co-workers from late night fire; Rain delayed support efforts.*"

Local paper, statewide, craigslist. I post my resume in every place I can find, I call the state employment office, I go to career fairs, I walk into places and ask. I spend hours writing cover letters, editing my resume, making calls when I can. I apply for internships - both paid and not paid, for fellowships.

I have applied to every job I could find, including fast food, including janitorial, going so far as to apply two towns away. Telemarketing won't take me, retail won't take me. In nearly a year, I haven't found anything. I've been told that I'm under-qualified, overqualified, the position has been filled, and on several occasions an interview has been canceled with little to no explanation. I once even broke down begging to give me a chance. I hit my 900th resume on Wednesday, and I can't do anymore. It's just too many rejections, I can't do it anymore.  

Yesterday for the first time I tried panhandling. And then last night I had sex for money.

I've hit a new low, and my self esteem is shot enough that I'll do anything for money. But I feel so filthy, and already depressed enough and now I feel so much worse. I'm not good at anything except art, and even then I'm not good enough at that. I'm just so tired of hearing from my parents that I'm worthless. My friends are going to grad school and, they care about me but I'm afraid sooner or later they'll get tired of hanging out with a loser, and then I'll be all alone, and I can't do that again. 

I don't know what to do. I'm fat and ugly, so it's not like I could be some trophy wife. I'm not good at anything, have so much debt from college, and I'm so tired of sending in resumes and writing cover letters and never having anything to show for it. Once I lose my friends it's over. My parents gave me a year to get a job before they kicked me out and that's nearly over. I'll have nowhere to go, no job, no family and no friends. They'll do it too - they kicked my brother out. I don't know what happened to him after that, I don't know what will happen to me.

I just don't see any other option anymore. I'm tired of hearing ""it'll get better"". People have told me it'll get better but when? Before I'm kicked out? Before I lose everything? When is it supposed to get better? Why isn't it better now? What am I doing wrong?"

To give you some background information I'm going to be part of a summer program at my university where they send us out to Los Angeles for internships. Anyway, because of what the program entails I would really want to drive across country for a couple reasons.
1)The experience of driving across country
2)So I can have a car out there and I don't have to relie on borrowing somebody else's car in the program.

(I'd be leaving from either Philadelphia or New York)

My concerns are that my university is on the quarter system and there is 1 week between the end of spring term and the start of summer term.  

My concern is whether or not I will have enough time to drive out there in a week. I would not turn this into a vacation stopping everywhere as much as I may like to. Logically, I would want to drive out there with more than just myself so that we could spend more time on the road by switching drivers. If I couldn't get anybody from the program to drive with me I would try to convince my father to drive out with me and i'd fly him back just so I could have a passenger to share the drive with.

I hope I've made my concerns clear for you to read, if not just ask.
P.S. - Some of the professors have said the university may be able to get a deal with a car rental place in L.A but considering 99% of us are under 21 the rates for a rental car driver being under 21 would still be a lot. I am 20yo.

If you have any other suggestions please do tell :)

What would be the best route to get there?
Would flying out and renting a car be better?**"

My girlfriend and I recently got pregnant and neither of us are in a good financial position to have a child, as much as I really want to have kids. So yesterday, we got the pills and today she's in the other room having terrible cramps and conked out on phenergan.

This is my first (and hopefully last) interaction with Planned Parenthood. The city I live in has ONE clinic that does abortions, the rest are for other aspects of woman's health. The one we went to was run almost as bad as my residency's clinic (which is saying something) and we got to pay an exorbitant fee just to be seen 1.5 hours after our appointment (again, no procedure, just a pill). At one point my girlfriend asked me ""How can they stay in business being so inefficient and expensive? You'd think the government would offer abortions for free because *they save so much money in the long run*!"" I immediately pointed out that their monopoly was *because* of government, they already receive subsidy, and that human beings are NOT burdens to society, by and large, otherwise we'd have no productivity to tax to pay for this stuff in the first place.

It kind of occurred to me, listening to remarks like that from people and reading the threads in [/r/politics](/r/politics) others pertaining to abortion that people have a rather strange view when it comes to humans.

Sure, the book Freakonomics pointed out that elective, consensual abortions have a positive impact on crime in the long run, but how in the world can people think that intrinsically, the more abortions, the less burden/more stuff for the rest of us.

Human beings are the most precious resource of ALL. The left looks at the material resources of countries and thinks that's what makes them economically viable. In the long run, however, the labor force dwarfs the entire material resource industries every time, when the government gets out of the way and the labor force grows. 

Maybe it's these hard economic times, where it seems like if we could just round up all the people on unemployment insurance and welfare and send them to Bangladesh, all would be well. But I happen to think this feeling that human beings are just all mouths to feed and criminals is instilled into us with talks of overpopulation and socialized healthcare/schools/everything.

This misconception permeates every issue from Welfare to Abortion to Immigration. Everyone wants *fewer* people. Why not keep those same people, who are equally capable of making good decisions and producing more than they consume as us upper-middle class folks, and just put them in a position to succeed?"

Sure, the book Freakonomics pointed out that elective, consensual abortions have a positive impact on crime in the long run, but how in the world can people think that intrinsically, the more abortions, the less burden/more stuff for the rest of us.

Human beings are the most precious resource of ALL. The left looks at the material resources of countries and thinks that's what makes them economically viable. In the long run, however, the labor force dwarfs the entire material resource industries every time, when the government gets out of the way and the labor force grows. 

Maybe it's these hard economic times, where it seems like if we could just round up all the people on unemployment insurance and welfare and send them to Bangladesh, all would be well. But I happen to think this feeling that human beings are just all mouths to feed and criminals is instilled into us with talks of overpopulation and socialized healthcare/schools/everything.

This misconception permeates every issue from Welfare to Abortion to Immigration. Everyone wants *fewer* people. Why not keep those same people, who are equally capable of making good decisions and producing more than they consume as us upper-middle class folks, and just put them in a position to succeed?"
pwafy,0,2012-02-19,A Humble Plea For Your Advice,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pwafy/a_humble_plea_for_your_advice/,"Alright, well to start this all off, I am new to reddit and the rest of the jazz associated with it. With that being said, please forgive me for anything n00bish that I have done. Now I suppose I can begin.

So I am almost done with completing my BA (Hons) in International Relations, but I still have some time to go before I consider a Master's Degree or so. In general, I analysis and think everything through, any possible event, outcome, you name it. Right now I realize that I am coming upon a point where in a short period of time I will have to make a choice. I think I have the answer, but I like to have all doors opened and listen to any advice or wisdom that is offered. 

Originally, I wanted to just be a simple high school teacher of history and some sort of political courses. That was fine, I started to major in history when I started up at the university here, but during second, mainly in third, I jumped boat and started doing political science. So I have two options in mind, 1) High School Teacher, 2) The Foreign Service. 

In terms of teaching, I think I would like it. I think I would like it because I like teaching, I like being social, I like dealing with younger people since it is great way to see how the generations are thinking and acting on a variety of topics, and lastly, I would like to help give advice and pass some wisdom a long to help them in their first array into the real world. 

However, this is where things start getting a little bit complex. As much as I love to teach, part of me considers the notion of teaching as a retirement job, something that I would take up once I have done a bit of other kind of work in other places in the world. That job that I had in mind was the Foreign Service. My family lives in a foreign country, and, since I haven't seen them in almost over a decade, I wouldn't mind a job where I would be able to serve my new country, but also be able to see my family. 

The dilemma starts with the fact that I could technically become a teacher right away as soon as I finish up my degree here, with no education degree needed (private school). As for the Foreign Service, it isn't so clean cut. I considered trying to learn a couple more languages right after, and trying to do an internship abroad at a foreign states lower house of parliament. 

The idea would be that, though I would not have a Doctorate or MA, with an internship and decent knowledge of foreign languages, I could get hired at a low stage capacity at the Embassy that I was thinking of. The other option would be to do my MA, paying another chunk of my private and hard earned earnings for the vain hope that that will assure me a job in that sector. 

Third option is simply sell myself on the streets... 

tl: dr - Needs advice on what job he should pursue, education or foreign service, or prostitution. "

We have an intern from Germany who is 21. She's been here since January of 2011. We also go to church together on Sunday nights, and after that we do dinner at the High School director's house. We recently got somewhat closer, and I developed feelings for her. She's going back to Germany for college in May. She might come back to visit while in college, and she might come back to stay after college. I know she likes me a lot as a friend, but I'm not sure if she likes me any more than that. She's on staff for the High School program, so technically it's against the rules for us to even be alone together until I turn 18. What should I do? Should I tell her how I feel about her, in hopes that she'll wait for me and come back? The fact that she's leaving is super depressing for me. I always think about her. Thanks, women of Reddit."

We'd like to host the reading/pantry drive sometime during April, and probably on campus at Mason.

I know of some of the bigger theaters and so on like Harris, but it seems to me that a more intimate space would be more fun (and less awkward, because the crowd won't be that huge). As a current student, we thought you might be able to shed some light on a space that Mason students might be willing to come out to at night. 
Also, can you do a little research on what major campus events are planned for April? We'd like to have the reading on a weekend night, but avoid scheduling conflicts with any other events so that we draw in more people besides just grad students. "

She, on the other hand, will be leaving college with around $75,000 in student loan debt. Some of this is federal, but most is private. She has a bit of credit card debt ($1000), but nothing unmanageable.

I make enough money to support us both and have a little bit at the end of the month to save up. After the wedding, I will be virtually broke and will be starting over. I make somewhere between $55,000 and $62,000 gross a year and pay around $800 a month for rent. I would like to put her entire salary towards her loans, just would like some input.

I'm the type of person that likes to know my options and the best steps I could possibly make. I was thinking I would provide a summary of my career experience so far (I've been working for 3 years in May), then I will respond with any clarifying questions you might need. To put my experience briefly...I'm a ABAPer, but I will take on any role needed for our company to be successful. Your insight would be greatly appreciated!

**ABAP Experience: 2009-2011** *(I still will code a few random things when it's really needed)*
     Classes: BC400, BC402, and BC430
     Skillset: My main expertise is HCM relating to PA and PD. I would consider myself functionally weak in all other areas, but I've worked in Payroll, MM, FI, and Security. I typically need very good requirements for my weak areas. Lord knows that's hard to get.  I've also not really worked with BDC, applying OSS notes, Enhancements,  and there are a few other things that one might think I should be exposed to by now. 

**Winshuttle Administrator: 2009-Current**
Winshuttle is a data upload tool that utilizes Excel to let end users create and run upload scripts. It's much like BDC.I have been the admin since I started the job. I manage the license server and also troubleshoot issues with end users.

**Special Project Experience:**

**SAP Integration 1 - May 2009 - Jan 2010**
     Responsibilities: I helped with this project as an intern well into my transition as a full time employee. I helped manage the SharePoint site, but my main responsibility was working with the RICEF document and ensuring all of the Interfaces were setup. This required me to work with internal and external vendors to document requirements for transmissions, then ensure they were tested and implemented for our Go Live. 


**SAP Upgrade - ECC 5.0 to 6.0 - November 2010 - April 2011**
     Role - Business Lead
     Responsibilities: I co-managed (the other lead was from our consulting partner) the execution of deliverables required for the business teams to complete. This role was basically project management. Due to the nature of an upgrade the majority of the work was regression testing. There was also a big emphasis around the cutover. There is a lot here, so if you need more specifics I would be happy to provide them. 

**SAP Integration 2- June 2011 - January 2012**
     Role - Testing Lead
     Responsibilities: I co-managed (one lead was from our consulting partner, and the other was from our company we were integrating) the integration testing effort. For test preparation, I created and trained my legacy company subject matter experts in HP Quality Center 10.0. We then managed a team of test coordinators from both legacy companies to ensure test preparation and test execution were completed. I could go into much more detail, but I'm attempting to just provide you an idea of my experience. If you would like more information, please let me know.

**Current Projects:**
     Since the latest integration project my manager has kept me involved in more process focused work. Due to a recent audit of our transport process, I'm working to implement a new process to address our gaps. I'm also assisting on the completion of an IT principles document for our new combined company. I'm only assisting on a small piece of this project, but it's requiring me to interview managers and leads within our IT shop.  "

It'd explain I've got a spine of jelly. My dad has pretty much been absent my entire life, which is actually preferable considering how short his anger-fuse is. My lovelife is non-existent, I've never had a girlfriend. I had friends at some point, but they left because they didn't want to deal with the emotional burden I am, I can honestly not blame them.

I've never had a real job, only internships where I've done rather well but it seems they don't count to real employers. My schoolwork has been a damn rollercoaster until it grinded to a halt under 'Not good enough'. I wanted to go further with my studies and become an engineer but that dream popped. At this rate, I'll be considered a below-average electrician at best. Earlier this year, I discovered I'm allergic to chocolate, which just so happens to be the only candy-like thing I enjoy. 

That being said, I've always hated my life. I've been a lonely, stupid, untalented idiot since forever and I can't live with the memories caused by my social ineptness. I don't think I deserve to live, I got all the chances like everyone else and I failed. Yet with all this, I've been in therapy for my entire life, with three different therapists, I've been on and off antidepressants and while I haven't cut myself, I've literally bashed my head into walls and punched myself. I've already attempted suicide twice, once by hanging and once by overdose. At least nobody can say I never tried to get help, I did and it cost me my friends and made me more depressed.

1. How much should my emergency fund be?
2. I am currently using my TFSA to save my emergency fund. What are my other options to keep money accessible and get better rate than 1.5%?
3. For down payment, should I be investing in RRSP (HBP) or saving in TFSA?

edit:
    TFSA: Tax-free savings account (type of account where you don't pay capital gains tax, dividends tax, etc.)
    RRSP: Registered Retirement Savings Plan (tax-sheltered account, no income tax until you withdraw when retired)
    HBP: Home Buyers Plan (I can withdraw upto $25000 from my RRSP for 15 yrs tax free)

py1rr,1,2012-02-20,Ideas for psychology internships in the DC area,ImTastyTreats,AcademicPsychology,https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/py1rr/ideas_for_psychology_internships_in_the_dc_area/,"I'm going to be interning in the DC area this Summer, and I'm trying to help my girlfriend find a psychology-related internship in the area. We're both Juniors; she's a psychology major at Wellesley. She has a great resume and research experience. Unfortunately googling ""psychology research washington dc"" isn't quite as helpful as one would hope. She would also be interested in interning with a clinic/office, so I was hoping somebody might have some suggestions for quality/prestigious psychologists in the area that we could look into for summer positions.

pxygq,3,2012-02-20,Getting the CPA distinction - what's the best route?,username_goes_where,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/pxygq/getting_the_cpa_distinction_whats_the_best_route/,"So I'm not an ""accountant"" (by trade), although I have an accounting degree and a MBA degree with a concentration in accounting - so I have the 150 hours and a background in accounting.  I also did an accounting internship for about 6 months and multiple accounting projects during my schooling.  I enjoy accounting, just not the ""typical"" accounting desk jobs.  But that's one reason I wanted to study accounting, because of all the various jobs that one can do! Anyways....

I want to get the CPA as a personal goal, and wondered what other ways there were to get the ""work"" credit, besides working in a typical accounting firm for 12 months under a CPA.  

I'm currently in school getting a 2nd masters degree in industrial engineering and want to go into management consulting upon graduation.  I think having the CPA will improve my knowledge of accounting, give me more credibility and knowledge, and enable me more career opportunities as I transition out of that profession (don't want to travel 4 days a week forever). 

Any ideas/suggestions?"

I work at a non-profit that has a free training program for youth who are between 18-21. Kids who participate will get: incentives to complete the program, a free subway card, help finding internships and jobs, and will receive a Building Analyst Certificate (BPI) completely free, (a BPI is worth about 2 grand).

The website is here http://www.greenjobsnyc.org/ and you can apply online. It's usually weekdays during what would be school hours.  I'm not going to make any money if you click the link, its just something I'm doing recruiting for and I thought the people of NYC might be able to put it to use. If you have an 18-21 year old kid who can't find a job and doesn't want to go back to college this could be the kind of thing you were waiting for.

pxvia,6,2012-02-20,First Resume. Could really use some advice.,Bendetta327,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/pxvia/first_resume_could_really_use_some_advice/,"I've been a web developer for about 3.5 years now. I got an internship from my brother's friend my freshman year of college, and I failed out of school after my sophomore year. I've been working full time for the same company since then, and now I'm getting married and have a kid so I need to go some place where they'll pay me more - I asked for a raise and was essentially denied.

I never really needed a resume before, and I'm trying to update the one I did have during school, but never needed to use. Now that I'm going to be putting it out everywhere, I feel like this is very lacking despite having a good amount of experience now. I'm the only web developer here, and I do some IT stuff with the only other actual IT guy in the building.

I don't think I should mention my school experience. I also haven't had time with the newborn to get an actual online portfolio going. Is this considered a must and should be included on the resume?

##Concerning reddit:

&gt;What is the origin or meaning of your user name?

&gt;&gt;I needed an AOL screen name and had just visited Ireland. I thought it flowed off the tongue well.

&gt;Total number of reddit identities you‚Äôve had?

&gt;&gt;Just the one. I haven't caused any problems that warranted abandoning this account.

&gt;What is your favorite part of reddit?

&gt;&gt;The incredibly broad range of topics and stories that you can read and discuss. I don't know anywhere else that offers such a broad supply of content and commentary.

&gt;What do you do when you‚Äôre not on reddit?

&gt;&gt;Study, read, take a walk, listen to music, travel

&gt;Do you think reddit has changed in the last year or so?

&gt;&gt;I think a significant amount of the growth has come from memes and macros, like the kind found in F7U12 and AdviceAnimals. More people are coming to reddit for specific niches of content, like memes and MMOs like SC2, TF2 and LoL, not joining the site as a whole and discovering subreddits they find interesting.

&gt;If so, do you think it‚Äôs been for the better?

&gt;&gt;Reddit has always been what you make of it. The default front page was never a pinnacle of rationality as some old-timers (and more recent redditors) contend. Sensational and misleading headlines have been earning the top spots from the beginning.
At this point, I'm not subscribed to any default reddits, and haven't been for some time. The largest communities I'm subscribed to are /r/sex and /r/Android with just over 100k members. I don't envy the job of the moderators running the larger ones, since they have a nearly impossible task to enforce their rules (if they want to).

##Final Question:

&gt;Is there anything you'd like to plug/promote/advocate?

&gt;&gt;I'm a moderator of a few communities in the RepublicOfReddit network. If you're looking for replacements for many of the default reddits that maintain a higher signal:noise ratio and have transparent moderation, come visit us in /r/RepublicOfPolitics, /r/RepublicOfAtheism, and /r/RepublicOfReddit. If you've ever complained about reddit or think you can do better, come see how much of a difference you can make."

[Why not?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3sszbf?context=5)|I mean if its something your really wanna do go for it. Skilled welders are not paid or respected like they used to be. Theres been a pay freeze for the past 10 years, when I got in, jobs were paying $20-$25 an hour for someone who knew what they were doing. Now they want to pay $17-$18 starting off. Yet they will higher an idiot engy straight out of school for $50-$60 a year and you are cleaning up their mess all the time.
[Is this because most manufacturing has been outsourced overseas in the past few decades?  Or something else?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stdt3?context=5)|Mostly yes.
[Wow good for you! I'm 20 and I've been welding for a couple years now, I'm up in Alberta welding on pressure pipe. Recently I'm thinking about setting up my own truck but I'm not sure how exactly you go about getting clients, do you know? An also how did you end up landing those cool jobs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3sska0?context=5)|I never stopped looking for a job, Ive always known what I was capable of and was never happy doing production work. Push yourself to do better, be better, know more. Know what your worth monetarily and to the company.  As in terms of getting clients, I dont know much, I have a friend that has started his own business, the jist of what I have gotten is there are web pages out there that companies post bids on for work they need done. You go on and bid on the job after you have run your numbers and decided what you want to charge.   My recommendation and what I have seen work well is.  1) get your truck and everything you might need, little by little. 2) Keep a full time job, use your side work as means to pay off or buy tools needed. 3) Word of mouth, craigslist etc, just start building up your experience and client base.
[Miller or Lincoln?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3sske2?context=5)|Miller, or Fronius. Fronius is much nicer technology and they are starting to get into the US pretty strong. But miller because of the support in the northeast, Lincoln is more popular down south.  Every Lincoln ive used, just doesn't feel right. I have a harder time weldin I feel. I mean it doesnt really affect me using one or the other but how the arc starts, pedal sensitivity etc.   Lincolns a very storng company and are really pushing the welding simulators.   Funny Story I was actually at a demo for an American Welding Society meeting near me. The rep held a competition of Flux core mig. It uses a scoring system to rate your by how stable you were, consistency in rate of travel, angle etc. Now I'm in a room with 30 people, all have been welding longer then Ive been alive.  I actually won lol, by like two points. I was shocked as hell, got a nice hood out of it.  tl;dr Did a welding game with a bunch of older welders and won. Barely.

[Is the work physically demanding? Howso? Does it keep you in shape?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stj5e?context=5)|The work can be excruciating hard, like when I was doing confined space ont he condensers, or it can be laid back and easy as hell. It can certainly keep you in shape, climbing, crawling holding a 30 lb lead above your head for 10 mins at a time for 8-10 hours.
[How many hours a week do you work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stj5e?context=5)|Depends on how well you pick it up. Ive known guys who have welded for years that cant do code, its how much you want to learn and want to do quality.
[How long does it take to become qualified for welding work, starting from scratch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stj5e?context=5)|Yes a lot of welders develop eye problems later on from arc flash or just the eye strain, lung issues and skin cancer can crop up without proper PPE.
[Do you enjoy what you do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stj5e?context=5)|For the most, most days lol.
[Did you go to school for welding?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3ssvs5?context=5)|Yes i did, I went to a Technical High school where I learned the basics. Didnt really prepare me for the workforce, luckily I had people willing to teach me more once I got out of school. I got certified for my basic AWS cert while I was there. All other training I have gotten on the job.
[Wouldn't working with stainless technically be considered ""brazing""?  Or is it just all welding?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stscj?context=5)|Uhhhh. not as far as I know. Brazing is more of a Mechanical bond, between two plates and the filler. Welding more making two pieces one, using the material it is made of. Unless your doing dissimilar metals, then thats more complicated.
[I have to agree with that.  My dad was an underwater welder most of my childhood and then a foreman. Life was good when he had a rare union job.  But I spent most of my childhood moving from coast to coast while he changed jobs.  Out of curiosity, are you unionized?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stlgi?context=5)|I used to, when I was building for the Navy.

The coolest/most pain in the ass that I have worked on was the condensers for the Virginia class subs and the new super carriers. Defense contractors are spread out all over the place. I did have a friend in texas that said he was working on chemical weapon components. Thats something I really wanted to work on. As morbid as it is.
[Any artistic ambitions that you'd care to pursue in your welding career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3st5mn?context=5)|God Id love to, I am aiming for when I get a house and a garage making a blacksmith, sheetmetal shop and working on my projects in my head.   Make a real Katana is my dream.
[Best weld...stick or fluxcore? tell me about mixing shielding gasses. Personal Protection? respirators? have you noticed damage to your eyes? what color are they? (optional)what is your ethnicity/background? TIG tips?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stdxn?context=5)|Depends on the job and where your at. What do you want to know about mixing shielding gases? I have only ever used bottle mixes 75/25 90/10 60/40 60/38/2. PPE depends on the job at hand, I recommend respirators at all times if your grinding or mig welding. a p100 should be good enough. 3m's 7501 witht he pancake p100 is nice and comfy, if you dont have tor wear safety classes all the time. I have had arc flash but no permanent damage. green/blue to hazel. Im white, msotly western europe mutt.   Tig tips, Rest the cup on the piece if you can and get as comfy as you can. 45 degrees doesnt always work sometimes a 30/15 works great. Set your amperage to the piece your working on, the pedal is a percentage of that usually.
[What has been your greatest accomplishment as a welder?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3st5r3?context=5)|I did all of the new procedure qualifications for dissimilar metals, which included re-qualifying old procedures and developing new ones with my welding engineer for the new super carrier condensers. They were all ultimatley used. I passed 51/52, screwed up a 1/16 Inconel test. We didn't use it anyways. These all got X-rayed, cut up, bent( destructive), and macro'd (being able to see the individual pass, Heat affected zones and grain.).
[Any advice for a new student? I'm in my first semester, and I'm doing really good so far. Anything to look out for when I enter the work force?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stbjk?context=5)|First off, Thank you so much for your service to our country.  Youll need to feel out any new place, but trust no one. Sometimes welders dont like new guys.  Take your time, think everything out from start to finish. Double and triple check your math and measurements. Its better to take longer to make it right the first time then to have to make two.
[My question is, what type of process(es) and what type of material did you use for the majority of the spent fuel rod lockers? Could you walk me through your guys' quality procedures (ie x-ray tested? Destruct tested?)? Were you required to be AWS or some other type of certification to work with such dangerous material? What was the worst part of the welding (crazy out of position? Extensive pre-heating before laying a bead? Huge time-consuming multi-pass welds?)? And do they allow you to weave your hardwire welds or must you lay stringers only?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3sto6i?context=5)|&gt; What was the worst part of the welding (crazy out of position?

[How often do your friends ask you to make things for them? Can you 'feel' if it's a good weld? If so, how? Do you get sick of what you do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stbmi?context=5)|-Every once in awhile. I cant know, my boss doesn't allow personal work. -When you know what your doing, I can't stress that enough, everything went smoothly, good penetration and your weld looks good. BUT welds can look gorgeous and fail miserably. A good experienced welder trained in inspection cans pot the fakes.
[What's the hardest metal to weld with? The easiest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stbmi?context=5)|- Depends, all metal sucks to weld wihtout the proper prep. Thats the key. Aluminum can be the trickiest I will say, with thin gauge Stainless being a very close second. Theres a lot of details and procedures to follow with both.
[What's the hardest weld/job you worked on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3sstau?context=5)|The condensers for the submarines. They are so ridiculously tight in there.  A lot of areas I couldn't fit into so I have to improvise by welding with an extension on the mig gun, or hang upside. Sometimes I had to take my boots off just to get in there. It was hot as hell in there during the summer.
[Is there a different technique used in welding pieces going into a nuclear reactor? I'm taking a course in the radiation effects on materials and was just curious.  Also, do you have any experience/ knowledge of using acoustic emissions to find any cracks, whether on welding surfaces or not?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stva4?context=5)|Yes im familiar with ultrasonic work. No diffrent technique, just better welding.
[When I was working at Subbase Bangor in WA, one of the cryo techs in my shop filled an argon vessel with LIN before sending it back to the welders. An inquiry went down, and being the new guy I got the blame. Not mad about it; hated the navy by that time anyway. My question was, how much of a hassle would it have been to redo all those welds? What sort of testing would have to be done to determine the composition of the welds to see if they were done with N2 instead of argon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3ste9v?context=5)|I dont know what a cryo tech is, and I assume LIN is liquid nitrogen. Keep in mind not all acronyms are universally used. It is up to the weld engy to determine based on the purpose of the vessel is the n2 is gonna affect the  weld substantially. The AWS book on Elements of Metallurgy has tables and exceprts about the effects of n2 vs argon. Sometime they are neglible. Sometime they can cause cracking it all depends on material being welding. I dont know how much of a hassle it would be to redo the welds because you didnt say what you were working on. Typically argon adds some strength to SS and steel. But n2 can be used. If you are going to purging only.  tl;dr Welding engineers call on if they need to fix it or not.
[I want to get a cheap setup for basic car stuff: sheet metal and possibly welding heavier suspension components to the frame.  What type of set up would you recommend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3st9bh?context=5)|Http://store.cyberweld.com/mil175witecc.html  This should work as long as your not going over 5/16"". If you are need to go next step.  Be careful welding on frames, do your homework.

[Nice to see an AMA by a welder. I'm nearly finished my C level (year one in BC) and am going for my metal fabricator's ticket straight away afterward. Apologies if this has been answered, but what sort of gear have you got? What's your favourite/least favourite process? Ever had any close calls on the job, e.g. shit idiots have done that's nearly gotten you killed? Lastly, if you could be doing any kind of welding, anywhere, what would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stnmc?context=5)|I dont own much of my own gear anymore, I have a miller elite hood though. Tig welding is my fav. Ive had a couple ""I almost got fucked up"" Ive always been real careful with others around, ive messed myself up more by being a klutz then anything else lol.  Nuclear welding or weapons manufacturing. I love what im doing now though with custom sheet metal fab.

Ironically I wasnt required by the AWS to pass that in school and no one does it anymore really. Ive done it a couple times, but I love tig welding more.
[Off topic question. How much different is Carbon based steel welding for a MIG welder running straight argon gas as opposed to a 75 25 mix?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3swq8y?context=5)|Runs much colder, the c02 acts as a de oxidizer, increase the heat and Helps with penetration.

Do you have one of those in your shop?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stnf7?context=5)|Apprently a long time ago in the 70's the palce i worked at that built the condensers did have a midget who worked there lol.
[When my grandfather came home from the war, he settled down with the woman he's met at a USO dance and became a welder. It would be the only job he held until the day he retired forty-five years later (with the same company). He was a machinist, an engineer, and a true tinkerer. Because of that, I've always harbored this sort of romantic idea about the welding profession.  How typical was his experience? Is the profession still as stable as it was in his time? I worked in programming and IT for a while because I wanted to sort of follow in his footsteps, and I was disgusted by how transitory most of the jobs in that field were. Is it still possible to find a good company and stick with them for a career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3sv39c?context=5)|Its not unhearxdof.

What are a few things that I can do to make your life easier?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3swe6f?context=5)|The biggest problem I have is engy's making things to hard when it doesnt have to be, I.e. you have the software to pull measurements off anything. Every chance you can try  putting in extra dimensions, and other dimensions so we can check to make sure everything is correct. Otherwise I have to sit here and do half an hour of math ahead of time laying everything out.

Is it possible to weld, like, titanium?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3svgwy?context=5)|Titanium welding is very common and i have done it. It welds just like stainless but requires perfect and clean conditions. how hot the piece gets depends on how you have everything set up. clamped? gauge? amperage? travel rate?

[That seems kind of low for a x-ray certified welder with 10 years experience. I live in Alberta, and people here make $25 dollars an hour for manual labour with no experience or training. I'm assuming welders here make quite a bit more than that. How is the job market for welders where you live, high demand?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3styec?context=5)|Your right, but its a start up, i have stock share, im 9-5 and im in temperature controlled enviro. sometimes the extra coin aint worth it immeditatley.

But there needs to be procedures established by whoever does the r&amp;d or inspection.
[I did a internship at a company that tested welders in the construction industry by pulling apart 2 wires (which they use in prefabricated concrete constructions) that where welded (? idk is this correct?

pxsxk,0,2012-02-20,A perspective on yellow fever and interracial dating,whitedudesproblems,asiantwoX,https://www.reddit.com/r/asiantwoX/comments/pxsxk/a_perspective_on_yellow_fever_and_interracial/,"This is sort of a response to the Lena Chen article that is on the top of this subreddit right now.

About *my* supposed ""yellow fever"": I was in China for an internship and have to do a complimentary language course in university . I was accused of yellow fever the second I started studying in University.

I'm a white dude and have been together with my pinay girlfriend for 3 years now. I am quite used to the looks we get on the street. (There are not many asian-white couples where I live) One thing I will never get used to though is the jokes I get on a regular basis from friends, family, or just random people at parties etc. I was accused of ""yellow fever"" so many times its not even funny. Its hard enough for SEA-white couples to get over all this ""does she love you long time?"" thing that still far too many people have in the back of their mind. Wearing a suit to work hasn't been much helpful with the ""your girlfriend is a mail order bride"" for me either. Being accused of yellow fever is additionally hurtful. What most people dont realize is that its extremely devaluing for a relationship to get called names like that.. As if the relationship is based on some kind of sexual fetish.

As asian girls are the most recent culprits of accusing me the most of my ""yellow fever"" I'd like to get a perspective on how you think about this. I have felt that some asian girls tend to abuse the word to poison existing and new relationships from the getgo. I also feel like the word is hurtful to any cross cultural relationships while being nationalistic and or sometimes flat out racist on its own. I have never heard the word mentioned in a positive way. So why keep asian girls using it so frequently? 

WARNING CONTROVERSIAL 

I feel that some girls feel entitled that they are the center of a ""fetish"" and abuse it to be condescending and get a sense of superiority.

And how is yellow fever different from the the ""gay-gene"" ? As in: you are born to like certain traits. And how is it treated so differently. Its as if gays were accusing gays of homosexuality. Why is it deemed to be pathological anyways? Most guys like blonde hair. Now liking black hair is sick?

END CONTROVERSIAL

I'd also like to know what you think ""yellow fever"" exactly is and why its so ""creepy"" to some girls. For me -- I am not into anime, I dont watch hentai. I dont watch korean dramas. I am mostly interested in asia business-wise. My girlfriend and I met by pure luck. My ex and I aswell. She was - interestingly - half asian. Which got me comments like ""you slowly get hooked on asian"". So asian girls are drugs aswell. 

So for me there might be a pattern here even though I might not be typical. But is my interest in asia now off putting? I've always felt like similar interest rarely hurt a relationship.

I also dislike the idea that one can get ""identified"" with yellow fever. As if my love for her is some kind of unnatural disease. 

I hope my rant is somewhat comprehendable. I am typing this on the train right now. I'd love to get a view on things so please leave comments aplenty.

pxpvz,9,2012-02-20,Losing/Maintaining Weight While Abroad,proserpinax,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/pxpvz/losingmaintaining_weight_while_abroad/,"Hi all, 
I'm studying abroad right now for the spring semester. Last fall before I left I was slowly losing weight and getting healthier; however, it feels like all of that has been thrown out by living here. I'm living with a host family, and while I really like living with them this means that I have no control of what I eat, unless I choose to go out to eat (which I don't have to tell you is both expensive and not the best for healthy eating). 
I've started trying to ask for smaller portions of the food I'm given, but the food my host mother cooks is, as a general rule, pretty unhealthy stuff. Any suggestions? I don't want to be rude and tell her that I don't like her food, but I know I've put weight back on and I'm worried I'll gain more before I leave in April. 
As for exercise, I admit I don't do as much as I'd like here because of time (I'm working a 20 hour a week internship in addition to full time classes), but I already do a lot of walking. My friend's done research about gyms in the area and they're honestly out of my price range, especially considering how little I'd really be able to go. 

So.. tips? I don't like being negative and feeling like I can't do it, but I""m really at a loss for what to do right now."

I'm trying to get into international consultancy- specifically working in the Middle East. I was hoping some of you could provide some tips or suggestions on trying to get a job doing this.

Here's some background about myself that I think is relative. I studied abroad in Cairo two years ago and lived in Egypt again this fall. I taught for a while (few months), but couldn't keep the job as the Egyptian government would not provide me with a work visa. (I don't have a teaching certification). Despite my time in the Middle East, which amounts to about a year now, I only have basic knowledge of Arabic. The big negative is that I went to a school in the top 150. I majored in economics and graduated with a 3.51 gpa, while in its Honors College. I do think I have excellent extra curriculars, and internships;however, the internships were for political lobbying groups, and had nothing to do with finance. "

I met her three years ago and she is the kind of person you only meet once in a lifetime. And, of course, I screwed it all up.

We were good friends for 8 months (I waited too long to clear my true intentions, I guess), dated for almost a year and a half and it's been 10 months since we broke up. Our relationship had many problems, but I think the main reason of its ending was my inability to handle them the right way. I was too jealous, controlling and impulsive. I blamed the society and her friends for influencing her to do things I disapproved, when it wasn't really up to me to decide all that. I judge people a lot (maybe I'll be a judge someday, maybe not).

After we broke up, I lost it. She was too important in my life, and that's never good. I lacked of other things to keep me interested and occupied when I wasn't with her, and once I figured I wouldn't be with her again, everything went down. Things got out of control and she filed a restraining order against me (and it gets better: I'm a law student). Her family was scared and who can blame them? I would've done the same thing or worse If I had a daughter and some guy wouldn't stop annoying her and going after her against her will. Long story short, I spent my 21st birthday afternoon in a police station explaining myself. I talked to a professor of mine and lawyered up. He solved the hole thing without getting me involved.

The fact is, after all that, I still miss her and don't know what do with myself. I've tried lots of things, good and bad. I searched for psychological and psychiatric help and started taking anti depressives; I used cocaine, which I regret; I spent a month in Europe (I could easily be living in London, but I can't just drop off college now); I started to practice Boxing and returned to play football, but injured my knee; I got in touch with old friends; I dedicated myself into a 4 months internship at the Federal Courts of Justice in Brazil (in case I didn't mention, that's where I'm from).

I'm much more mature now and I'm certain that I could do things differently, but I'm also certain that she will never be with me again. The thing is, at the end of the day, I can't help thinking about her and feel sad for everything. And I'm sure she doesn't waist any second of her life thinking about me anymore and is probably having fun with her friends - it's Carnival weekend over here. So I wanted to ask for some real advice, something huge. It could be anything, like growing a beard (even tho I'm incapable of doing that), buy an old Jeep and live in northern Norway. I don't care, I just want some ideas and advices to help me get thru this. 

And I know this is probably a cliche question, but believe me, this wasn't just a normal relationship break up for me. It's much harder, much deeper. The ""you'll find someone else"" is useless. I have strong issues regarding social relationships (you can probably tell by now) and I connected with her like I only do with one other person in the world, my brother who has Down Syndrome and is a very special person.

Don't know If anyone is going to read this, but writing and talking always helps me put my thoughts in order. And If you did read, thank you for your time.

Cheers and thanks for all the learning and laughter you promote here everyday.

Also, I have to interview at their office in Manhattan. All of the interviews I've had so far have been on my university campus... how much of a difference will this be? I'm pretty nervous and don't know what to expect regarding length/intensity. 

Any advice/interview stories would be great. Thanks!

AMAA,Sandbaggingforlife,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxf3n/iama_21yearold_4th_grade_dropout_and_a_voluntary/,"I say semi-recluse because I don't know the official definition; I don't think I never left home for a period of months, but when I did it was usually just to go out to dinner with my family.

I did go to college for a couple of weeks, but I was unemployed for my entire life until last month with the exception of a (very) brief internship when I was 16.

I do not know how to do many things that many people take for granted on account of not seeing any value in them, such as being able to tie my shoes or ride a bike.

I am making this AMA because one of my co-workers who I have told my story to said that I should write a blog, because people might be interested in it. I am not so certain, but I thought Reddit would be a good place to see if there if anyone is interested in knowing how such decisions have impacted my life.

I'm not certain how I can provide verification for any of this, but if anyone has any ideas, I'm happy to hear them. I would prefer to keep my identity private, so if someone comes up with a good method that I can do, I would run it through a moderator.

If there is a question I am not comfortable with answering, I will tell you."

I just thought I'd share with you ladies because I feel like you all would appreciate it. :)

So I'm in a graduate social work program. I was invited by one of the staff at the school to attend a kind of ""networking"" dinner with some of the school's important alumni and ""friends,"" as well as the Dean of the school.

I end up chatting with this older lady; she's very nice and seems genuinely interested in my interests in social work. I tell her I'm interested in working with the LGBT community, maybe doing counseling/advocacy, etc. She seems pretty thrilled, and tells me I should speak with the head of the LGBT Center at my University to see if I can get an internship hooked up. She seemed like a very cool lady, and I spoke with her throughout the night and we connected pretty well. I found out later (through some googling) that she is the founder of my (large) city's first PFLAG and is on the board of directors for the HRC. WOW.

On Friday, I ended up meeting with the head of the LGBT Center at my University after a presentation she gave. I let her know I was interested in an internship opportunity at her Center, and she let me know that a brand new counseling spot was opening up this next semester and she would love to interview me for the position. SCORE. I also told her I would be psyched to include some sexual health type stuff into my experience there, and she (being a past employee at PP) seemed really excited to hear that. I'll probably be interviewing for the intern spot there in about a month.

Finally...the best part. My girlfriend, who I've been dating for 3 1/2 years, surprised me with a visit this weekend. She showed up on Thursday night. She called me and told me she sent me something in the mail and I told her I'd go check it to see if it got here. I walked down to get my mail and she was standing at the door with her stuff for the weekend. :) 

I had to work Friday, but she spent the day making me [these](http://imgur.com/a/KurY2). (she made a bunch more- these are just some of my faves.)

BEST. VALENTINES. PRESENT. EVER. 

We spent the weekend cooking delicious food, cuddling, and drawing henna on each other (a present she got me for Christmas). 

Overall, one of the best weeks I've had in a while. Just thought I'd share :) "

I play guitar and sing relatively well, but decided that the music business was a good path to go on. In 2007 I enrolled as an Entertainment and Arts Management major at Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA. Classes included ""Arts Writing for Non-Profits"" to ""Touring and Promotions""... that being said, you really learn the real shit through the real world.
After interning with Umphrey's McGee, a midsize rock group based in Chicago, I was able to take in a variety of skills and tips to make it as a grassroots band/organization. Through UM I was also able to work two major festivals, including Lollapalooza which I will be doing again this August for my fourth year.
For my second internship, I took my skill set and decided to go big and apply it to a group that I figured had MGMT and a label, but really only had good buzz. Cheers Elephant ( www.cheerselephant.com ), a psych-rock group out of PHL, decided to take me on as their manager in March 2010. I was 20-years-old, managing four 24-28 year-olds who had already established a local buzz. My mission was to continue to build them in a variety of ways: structure Cheers as a business, polish their online presence, stay engaged with connections, tour, acquire new fans, etc. allowing them to focus on the creative side of things.
So, it's been about two years, and I'd like to think I've made a great impression in Philadelphia and beyond. We're about to release our third record that is truly going to put us on another level... which is all you can ask for. Constantly going for the next level. However, I've stacked the deck to have it all lean in our favor. Great album production, multiple music videos, new website, full blown PR campaign, and a tour to support the new record.
I've promoted a sold out show, I've taken a meeting in an NYC high-rise with fancy A&amp;R dudes, I've been a roadie, I made a tour poster, I've been a stage manager, I've sold merch, I've restrung a guitar, I drove the van... That's the key: you must be able to wear all the hats. Not too bad for a 22 year-old.
There's another key thing to mention, which I feel can apply to all aspects of life. Love what you're doing, love what you sell. People can see the bullshit in your teeth. I will never represent a band that I wouldn't listen to on my way to work, or recommend to a friend. First and foremost I am music fan, and you can't lose sight of that. Being a legitimate fan of your product, you have the ability to intellegently talk about it for hours on end because you are honestly into it. Common sense? You'd be surprised.
Some parting comments: 1. You hear it all the time, but networking is truly key. To make it in a scene, you must be immersed in it inside and out.
You should be spending most of your personal money on attending other bands shows. Introduce yourself, mention your band, and they'll likely return the favor.
Engage with fans, often.
Release new content, often. The whole world has ADHD now.
Things don't happen to you, you make things happen. Get used to it.
If you're a starting band, play as many shows that makes sense. If you're an established band, don't over saturate and keep your audience wanting more.

px6e7,2,2012-02-19,"Hey, Reddit. I just screwed up big time in regards to my boyfriend. What's the worst thing you've ever wrongly accused of your SO?",Zarephath,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/px6e7/hey_reddit_i_just_screwed_up_big_time_in_regards/,"A little back-story:

We're both in two different colleges about twenty minutes from each other. We started going out at the start of our semester. We talked to each other all the time, hung out as much as we could, the whole ""honeymoon phase"" thing. Well, he's studying nursing and told me that down the line it would be pretty tough for us to spend time together. Me being naive, I figured I would be okay with that.

The first problem occurred about a week after his talk with me; I wanted to know if he would be able to hang out at all over the coming weekend, but each day he told me he was bogged with work. So, I gave him his space. The weekend after that, he said he was going to pick me up after he took a nap. After about four hours, I decided to text him and see if he was awake yet. He tells me that a friend of his surprised him with tickets to Indianapolis to watch the Super Bowl and that he was at the airport about to board the plane. I couldn't be angry because hey, it's the Super Bowl, but I was definitely distraught and let him enjoy his weekend.

Fast forward to now, and I'm lucky enough to even get a one-word response from him, let alone see him. He says he's always busy and what free time he does have, he's relaxing which is completely understandable. This man has had three tests on the same day twice within the past two weeks for anatomy, physiology and microbiology. I can't possibly comprehend how busy he could be because here I am on paid internship with free time to spare once I get home.

I expressed my concern about it to him, and he said he felt terrible, but there wasn't really much he could do. I told him it was okay and that I would be patient. We told each other that we should take it slow and I agreed. But Friday night, I kind of snapped and told him I felt I was being jerked around. At that point, I figured he wouldn't talk to me again, so I firmed up my resolve and was prepared to move on, but just a few hours ago he sent me a text saying he thought I was patient and understanding enough to deal with this and was utterly blindsided at what I said to him. My heart melted and I immediately apologized, but he said he doesn't want to talk to me right now.

I'm at a loss. I know what I did, and I'm fully ready to accept the consequences. His birthday is coming up soon and I wanted to get him a New York Giants Build-a-Bear regardless of his decision because I know he likes stuffed animals and his favorite team won the Super Bowl. I just drove myself crazy with thoughts of him being with someone else to the point where I accused him of such without any substantial evidence to back it up.

**TL;DR Started a relationship with a dude in a hardcore nursing program who forewarned me that he wouldn't have as much free time once the semester got into full swing, falsely hinted that he was cheating because of it, and now he won't talk to me.**

So, Reddit, how about you? What's your story?"
px59v,1,2012-02-19,"How to ruin the most likely relationship of your life: jealousy, restraining order, drugs... I need some advice to move on.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/px59v/how_to_ruin_the_most_likely_relationship_of_your/,"So there's this girl (that's how every problem starts, I suppose) and she was my first everything. I met her three years ago and she is the kind of person you only meet once in a lifetime. And, of course, I screwed it all up.

We were good friends for 8 months (I waited too long to clear my true intentions, I guess), dated for almost a year and a half and it's been 10 months since we broke up. Our relationship had many problems, but I think the main reason of its ending was my inability to handle them the right way. I was too jealous, controlling and impulsive. I blamed the society and her friends for influencing her to do things I disapproved, when it wasn't really up to me to decide all that. I judge people a lot (maybe I'll be a judge someday, maybe not).

After we broke up, I lost it. She was too important in my life, and that's never good. I lacked of other things to keep me interested and occupied when I wasn't with her, and once I figured I wouldn't be with her again, everything went down. Things got out of control and she filed a restraining order against me (and it gets better: I'm a law student). Her family was scared and who can blame them? I would've done the same thing or worse If I had a daughter and some guy wouldn't stop annoying her and going after her against her will. Long story short, I spent my 21st birthday afternoon in a police station explaining myself. I talked to a professor of mine and lawyered up. He solved the hole thing without getting me involved.

The fact is, after all that, I still miss her and don't know what do with myself. I've tried lots of things, good and bad. I searched for psychological and psychiatric help and started taking anti depressives; I used cocaine, which I regret; I spent a month in Europe (I could easily be living in London, but I can't just drop off college now); I started to practice Boxing and returned to play football, but injured my knee; I got in touch with old friends; I dedicated myself into a 4 months internship at the Federal Courts of Justice in Brazil (in case I didn't mention, that's where I'm from).

I'm much more mature now and I'm certain that I could do things differently, but I'm also certain that she will never be with me again. The thing is, at the end of the day, I can't help thinking about her and feel sad for everything. And I'm sure she doesn't waist any second of her life thinking about me anymore and is probably having fun with her friends - it's Carnival weekend over here. So I wanted to ask (finally) for some real advice, something huge. It could be anything, like growing a beard (even tho I'm incapable of doing that), rent a Jeep and live in northern Norway. I don't care, I just want some ideas and advices to help me get thru this. 

And I know this is probably a cliche question, but believe me, this wasn't just a normal relationship break up for me. It's much harder, much deeper. The ""you'll find someone else"" is useless. I have issues regarding social relationships (you can probably tell by now) and I connected with her like I only do with one other person in the world, my brother who has Down Syndrome and is a very special person.

Don't know If anyone is going to read this, but writing and talking always helps me put my thoughts in order. And If you did read, thank you for your time.

Cheers and thanks for all the learning and laughter you promote here everyday."

I'm currently a second-year student at Queen's University, pursuing a major in History and a minor in Spanish. I've been searching for the last month or so for a good summer job, but I haven't yet heard back from any of those companies. I've applied to internship programs with the Ontario government, as well as financial departments at automotive dealerships. I am not entirely picky about what I want to do, but having worked retail and food and bev. throughout high school, I want to acquire new experience and diversify my resume. 

I don't necessarily seek a paid position - it would be ideal for me to find an internship at a law firm (preferably in central Toronto, Mississauga or Brampton) so I can finally decide whether that is something I'd like to ideally pursue. As mentioned before, I have extensive experience in customer service (through part-time jobs in high school), I worked during my first year at Queen's and I'm now involved with the student government as well. 

If you or anyone you know has any kind of employment in mind, or a spot open at your own company, please PM me so I can provide you with a copy of my resume! Thanks so much for your time, r/toronto. :)"

First of all, I just want to say- what you're about to read is true. However, it is up to you to arrive at your own conclusions. I just need to get this off my chest because I have never told anyone in real life thinking they won't believe me. Not even my parents, my friends or my GF. Being anonymous here affords me an audience that I would not get otherwise. It's kind of long so please, bare with me. 

I like to run. I ran a lot and I've been running since sophomore year in highschool. I graduated in 2003, which means I have been running either competitively or recreationally for over 10 years now. I don't plan on stopping anytime soon, and to me, running is the best stress reliever for any amount of terrible things going on in my life. Over the years, girlfriends and loved ones have left and faded away, but the road has always been there. Gravel, cement, sand, snow, flat, curved, undulating- as long as I have two feet, and two shoes I can run and just, forget.
Sorry, I am getting a bit nostalgic, so let us move on. I ran through highschool, made state a few times for cross country, but never won it, and walked on in college for the X-country team (Div III nothing major). After college, decided to stop running competitively since my life was moving faster now- much faster than my legs could keep up. I moved, got an internship to another city and said good bye to my weeping mom, packed up my things and flew across the country. This new city of mine, had some of the highest costs of living in the country and so I moved out of the city, but kept my job. My commute to work everyday was not so bad, and the low cost of rent allowed me to afford some luxuries as a semi-decent car, decent clothes and decent food. I even started dating a girl that I knew from high school that happened to live nearby.


Anyways, this new place that I got myself was kind of in an older city. In fact, it was one of the oldest small communities in the East Coast. I decided to look up trails around my house and found an old park about 10 minutes drive; I looked it up and found that it had a circumference of about 10kms which would be ideal for a few laps. I made a mental note to drive down and run it the next day.
The next day, I got off work late due to some project I had to do and would be starting my run about an hour after I normally do- around 5:30pm. Since this was the fall, the sun would pretty much set around 6, and of because that, I was a bit apprehensive about running a trail I had never traversed before. I decided to do it in the end because I was a grown up, and there were probably going to be other people on the trail, and there has to be signs and some sort of lighting.
I arrived at the park and noticed immediately how old it looked and the thick the trees were. I got there around 5:45 and already the sky was turning dark. Right away I noticed how creepy some of these trees looked with their vacant branches clawing at the sky- as if they were trying to escape the soil that anchored them. The park was connected to the road by an over-pass, and I decided to make one lap around for today, a trial run, and see how it was. I quickly glanced at the trail map, laced up and ran over the bridge.
The trail was covered by trees and every time I looked forward, I noticed that there was just more and more of them overlapping. To me, their branches looked like interlocking fingers belonging to a series of giant hands that were enclosing upon me. It was around 6:15 when I was half way into my run, and the sun had set completely. All I could see were silhouettes of trees infront of me which seemed to go on forever. The sky came in cracks where the branches allowed it, and I could see no stars or clouds in the night above me. I could also hear no car noises nor did I see any other joggers on the path. The only sound were the sound of my Asics moving along the pavement. I made a mental note to speed up and finish as quickly as possible. I am an atheist, and I certainly don't believe in anything paranormal, but I also didn't want to get mugged or lost in the darkness. I checked my GPS at 6:27 which told me I had ran about 8kms in the last 40 minutes. I was making good progress, and had only 2kms to go. A sign that I pssed showing the direction of the park exit confirmed this notion. It was around this time when I felt a bit of relief that weird things started happening. Like I said, this is all true and while it may seem kind of weird, I swear that it happened exactly as I am about to describe.
Around 2 minutes after I had checked my GPS, I heard something- the sound of footsteps about 500 meters behind me. 

Great, I thought. Another jogger- at least I'll have company. The footsteps were a rhythmic pace with even intervals slightly slower than the pace that I was at, but also not at a slow jog. Pat-pat-pat-pat they went behind me in the distant darkness. I continued forward with my speed, honestly, a bit relieved that there was some else sharing the trail with me at the time and looked forward to leaving.

""Mark."" I heard a male's voice call my name from the background. No it can't be, must be the wind or the trees. I kept going forward...""Marrkk"". OK there was no mistaking it now that was definitely my name. I slowed down to a jog, but didn't stop, and turned around. Behind me all I could see were silhouettes of trees- nothing. A calm breeze rustled the leaves lying on the ground around me, but that was the only movement I could see. Or hear. The pat-pat-pat of my running companion had faded. I shrugged and kept going forward again. 
""Mark P____"" my full name was called. It stopped me dead in my tracks and a cold chill went down my spine. How could there possibly me someone that knew my FULL name in the middle of this park. Could it be a highschool or college buddy who recognized me and was fucking with me?
""Ya? Who's there?"" I called back into the darkness. One of my hands went into my pockets around my car keys in case there was a confrontation. No one replied. I turned around and began to start up again.
""What's the hurry you little shit?"" I jumped out and turned to the direction of my voice, seeing only an old hollowed out tree.

""Look man, I have to finish this. I'll see you at the entrance."" I answered back to no one in particular. I was trying hard not to show fear in my voice and was using the excuse of finishing my run to get the hell out of there. I started up again and really stepped on it.
""Race ya, Mark"" said the voice in my ear. I looked back, but again saw nothing in the woods behind me. I started running faster- a really fast jogging pace.
This is when shit got REALLY weird.
I heard the pat-pat-pat-pat of the runner behind me. Unmistakable footsteps, but the cadence seemed off. His steps were faster now, but they weren't well spaced apart- as if he was speeding up and slowing down: pat-pat-----pat----pat---------pat--------pat--pat--pat--clonk
Wait what was that?
CLONK--CLONK--CLONK---CLONK---CLONK
Were those? Hooves? Ok I have totally lost my mind. Paranoia and adrenaline was starting to make me hear stuff that was not there. But it was unmistakable. It was the sound of hooves running. Fast. Not a horse's hooves where you can hear four , but the clonking was a lot shorter and faster tempo- as if there were just two feet. I glanced back and again saw nothing but twisted branches reaching up to the sky.
I started sprinting towards the overpass that I came across. It was about 600 meters ahead of me and I knew for whatever reason that if I made it there I was safe.

clonkclonkclonkclonk
My pursuer had also started sprinting. At this point my heart was going a million beats per minute and I knew I could not let him catch me. Whatever he was, I HAD to get to that overpass before him. Every race I had ran: from state in highschool to NCAA races in college were just races. In the end, win or lose you were going home. All that was on the line was pride. Like I said, I am a non-believer, but I knew in the back of my mind and with every tendon that was screaming for me to stop, and every sinew of being in my body that was racing at that very moment, that I had to make that overpass before he did, and if I lost this race, something absolutely terrible would happen.
I sprinted. I sprinted like it was the 2003 state championships, like the 2007 NCAA championships. I knew that out of every race I had ever ran- from small relays when I was a kid, to races in front of thousands, out of all those races, this race of the last 400 or so meters between me and whatever the fuck was chasing me, and making those sounds...this race I was in, was by far the most important race I have and will ever run.
I ran as fast as I could. I ran until I felt my lungs would burst- I ran at a sub 4:30 mile pace. I ran for my life. And he was gaining on me. Clonkclonkclonkclonk. Each step I took it seemed he got closer- the hooves got louder, and each step I took the overpass seemed to be even further away.

I gritted through my teeth and with every ounce of strength in my body pressed hard for the last 50 meters and ran right to the overpass. I turned and got off the trail and planted both feet on the reassuring wood planks. No sooner had I turned into the overpass, I knew that he was right behind me by no more than an inch. And at that moment I felt him. And I smelt him. I smelt decay, and embers, and funeral pyres and incenses. I also felt the coldest chill went down my spine throughout every neuron and fiber in my body and I felt completely paralyzed as he passed me. The whole world around me stopped at that moment and time itself seemed to slow down. My heartbeat grinded almost to a halt, and my breath came out in a long slow sigh- in a long slow funnel of mist infront of my face. I saw and felt everything, even thought this happened in mere seconds. And for those mere seconds, that I felt him pass behind, I knew I had experienced death.
""See you around"" he whispered, so close into my ear with this terrible, sickly breath.

Clonk-Clonk-Clonk--pat---pat-----pat------pat-----pat
His stpes faded away down the trail as I looked back from the overpass. Of course the path was empty and only a slight breeze passed through the tree branches. I walked over the bridge, my heart rate going back down and didn't say a word. I got in my car and that night, after I showered and changed at home, I collapsed in my bed due to exhaustion that I had never faced in my entire life, and fell asleep for 12 hours.


It's been over a year now, and I still wonder about the events that transpired that day. Did I imagine it all? Was someone playing tricks on me? Then how did they know my name? Yet, I each time I think of it, I get right back to that day- I remember every detail so vividly and it all felt so real. I still feel that sense of dread every time I am around a fire or see images of a funeral. Then again, it could all have been my mind having a hallucination due to my paranoia and adrenaline from the run. I am a skeptical, educated person, and it takes a lot to unnerve me, but what happened that day, I still cannot understand no matter how much I try. Regardless, I am still not a firm believer, but I am an agnostic now. Thanks for reading. "

My advisor asked me to make a list of 10 dream things I'd like to do in this month. I have explored the options of WWOFFing, and looked at the Berlin craigslist and found an internship that sounds like it could be fitting for me.

Maybe I'm being uncreative, but I can't think of any other viable options for this month, granted I only have enough money for the first and third legs of this trip.

Have you ever known anyone in this situation? Could you point me in the direction of some resources (other than Berlin craigslist) for people like me?

EDIT: here are some other ideas I came up with. 

-Greenpeace type thing, here in the states they hire people very short term, all the time!

-Nanny/tutoring - after talking to a friend whose uncle is a professor and might know of a family who will let me be a live-in nanny for only 1 month.

-housesitting, I found a site where people can post that they'll be gone and need someone to watch their homes

-teach english in a summer program (although all I've found is for a term longer than one month.)

-bike around and couch-surf (becoming a legit option)

-play guitar on the street for money...and hopefully not get robbed.

My name is Andrew Frink, I am an intern at the Louisville Nature Center. A truly unique community resource, the Louisville Nature Center offers wonderful opportunities for nature study and recreation--right in the heart of the city! Part of the Nature Center‚Äôs goal is the give a well rounded nature education to the community and to local schools. The Nature Center is often the destination of school trips and family outings.

Currently, the Nature Center has many displays and live animals that are kept on exhibit to help educate and inform visitors about the level of biodiversity in the state of Kentucky. While the Nature Center has snakes, snails, frogs and even a salamander, the Nature Center does not have a display highlighting the vast series of streams and rivers in Kentucky. The commonwealth contains over 90,000 miles of streams containing over 250 different Native Species of fish. We have the largest amount of navigable 
water in any state (except for Alaska).
  
The Green River System is ranked in the top 5 river systems for diversity in the United States, this precious resource deserves to be protected and appreciated. Everyday, the rivers of Kentucky are continually polluted by everything from mining to urbanization. The first step to protecting this resource is to understand and appreciate its natural beauty.

As a intern at the Nature Center, I would like to set-up an educational display highlighting the natural beauty of the Kentucky Rivers. The display will include a river aquarium containing native plants and several species of wild caught native fish as well as an educational poster. In order for the display to be possible, I will need donations from wherever I can get them. I would LOVE to recognize Reddit and/or Redditors for helping with my project!

I think it would be awesome to put the Reddit logo on the display to let people know that my project was made a success in part by this community. Obviously, I‚Äôd follow up with pictures and videos of the completed display.

In the rare event of excess donation, all extra donations will go directly to the Louisville Nature Center. In fact, all money will go to them first and then they will allow me a budget for the project.

I guess PM me if you have anything to offer or comment/upvote for support.

Thank You,

Andrew

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Do you have any tips you would like to share on preventing bugs and animals from eating your plants?  How do you feel about Monsanto and the whole GMO issue?  Thanks for a cool AMA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tbw08?context=5)|Our philosophy on bug control is ""plant positive"" rather than ""pest negative.""  This means concentrating on creating the ideal soil for the plants, making them as naturally healthy as possible.  Bottom line is, 90% of the time bugs will go after unhealthy plants rather than healthy plants.  The reasons behind this are too much to get into on reddit, but if you're interested, Eliot Coleman (organic production pioneer) explains the philosophy and technical details behind this method in his book ""The New Organic Grower.""  We've had pretty good success with this method and have even had years where we didn't have to use any pest negative approaches at all.  When this isn't a realistic approach, there are some natural pest negative approaches we have used.  Releasing beneficial insects has been rather successful.  Using row covers at the right time nips some problems in the bud.  There are certain plants some pests go after first, like aphids with mustard.  So in any plot we're worried about aphids, we'll place mustard plants throughout and check them for aphids every day.  If we find them, we'll remove them and keep an eye on the surrounding plants to make sure they don't spread.  In worst-case-scenarios, we'll use some organic approved ""pesticides,"" like Bt or spinosad.  We normally don't have to resort to this though.  Keeping an eye out for pest eggs or initial infestations is really the best way to handle bugs.  As far as deer, we use some simple deer fencing around crops they might eat, we've never had rabbit problems, and our dogs will usually dig up any ground rodents going after root crops.  As far as Monsanto and the GMO issue, I think the two should really be discussed separately.  Monsanto has proven to be the epitome of ""evil corporation,"" and tried their best to become sustainable organic farmers' worst enemy, but I don't think that should put a halt on the GMO discussion.  Just because they have behaved irresponsibly doesn't mean GMO's will offer nothing to our society, and could possibly solve some otherwise unsolvable problems.  However, being able to manipulate genetics is an incredible power, and ""with great power comes great responsibility"" (thanks Uncle Ben).  All implications should be considered and studied very very very thoroughly before implementing any sort of GMO use (which hasn't been the case so far)  The fact that GMO crops can contaminate natural crops is one issue which definitely needs discussed, but ad hominem attacks regarding Monsanto should be left out when discussing GMO's.
[&gt;The fact that GMO crops can contaminate natural crops  How, exactly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3th2jy?context=5)|Pollen drift.  They have found GMO contamination in crops up to 1000 miles away from GMO production.  There are even some strains of certain grains which have gone extinct due to GMO contamination.  I'm sure there would be a way to sterilize the pollen, or manipulate it in some way that it won't pollinate non-GMO crops.  They haven't given this a second thought, and Monsanto even sues farmers whose crops have been pollinated by GMO pollen and planted the GMO contaminated seed for patent infringement.
[How and when did you get started?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tbk5x?context=5)|It's a long story of how we got started, but long-story short: retirement funds were drawn from, houses were sold, land was bought, an investment was made, and hard work was done.  I personally came from a rather cushy life, with an easy job with decent income which was not satisfying in the least.  Seeing the issues with the world, I figured getting involved in food production was a literal way I could live an ideal and help support a shifting food production system.
[What was the process of becoming sustainable for you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tbk5x?context=5)|Sustainability is a constant process, as we're still not completely free of environmental impact.  However, it is much easier going into it with sustainability in mind.  We ended up with land with very fertile soil, so all we have to do is maintain that.  Other than that, it's just a constant brain-storm.  Observing natural surroundings and drawing inspiration from the natural processes of the Earth produce amazing results.  We keep in the forefront of our thoughts that nature is not an enemy, and we abide by her rules.  We've had great success and have produced some great food this way.
[Also, Do you believe that food industry as a whole has any chance of becoming remotely sustainable or carbon neutral?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tbk5x?context=5)|As far as whether the food industry has a chance of becoming sustainable, I don't want to say it's impossible.  The only way for that to happen is if consumers make the choice.  They have to vote with their dollar and become intimately involved with the process of food production, knowing what practices they are supporting when they buy food.  That being said, there is a quickly growing demand for sustainable food.  But there is still a long long long ways to go, and some people I don't think will be willing enough to get involved in the process.  People have become very separated from food production and have no clue how it works, nor do they care.
[How are you doing financially? Are you able to sustain a lifestyle for you and your family from this, pay back debts etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tdgls?context=5)|Finances are fine, we're almost always able to at least break even with debts, operating and living costs.  However, I have no family to worry about...which honestly, is pretty nice.
[Have you managed to tap into a niche market selling to people who care about sustainability for a slightly higher price?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tdgls?context=5)|Luckily, yes...that's the only way to succeed as a small sustainable farm, really.  You have to find people will to pay what it costs to maintain a sustainable operation.  The USA pays less of their income for food than any other nation...small farmers in places like Italy and France have no problem making a living selling food locally, they thrive and are revered for what they do.
[Why not move to Italy or France?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tg52b?context=5)|Hmm...never thought about that.  Maybe I'll just do that.
[So, would you say it's difficult for small organic farmers to distribute their product (say, locally)?  Or are there established distribution lines that will buy your product, and your main concern is how much you are able to grow?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tg1ta?context=5)|I think it depends on the area, really.  Where we are, there's a decent demand for local sustainable produce.  We are basically only limited by our production...we very often sell out of most of what we bring to the market, especially eggs and chicken.  Sometimes we have a major surplus...in that case, we're happy to donate the food.
[Do you find farming difficult since you are so small?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tbg1q?context=5)|I think I see what you did there....
[Where do you sell your food? Does it bother you when you have to kill your goats? Do you get attached to any of them? :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tcapk?context=5)|We sell at local farmers' markets within 50 miles of the farm, we also have a CSA subscription program (Google it for more info).  I am not bothered by killing the animals, though I wouldn't say I don't get ""attached"" to them.  I care for all the animals a lot, and I do my best to make sure they are able to behave naturally and live a comfortable and happy life.  Being a farmer, you become intimately familiar with the circle of life.  I've also done a lot of reading regarding philosophy, spiritual philosophy, and the nature of self-awareness, and I am always growing my understanding of the nature of life and our existence, and I feel comfortable being a steward for the natural cycle of life while I feed my community.
[How much do you sell your products for at market?  How does it compare to the products at you local supermarket (organic products or otherwise)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tg9u1?context=5)|Organic eggs at the market are around $5, our organic eggs are $5.50.  Organic chicken raised in the same conditions as our's at Whole Foods is around $4/lb, our's is $5/lb (yet a far cry from the 75cent/lb for conventional chicken from Walmart).  As far as produce goes, we normally base our prices off of organic prices from the local Harris Teeter, unless we find that we need to increase the price more to make it worth it.
[How much money do you make?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tddie?context=5)|It's hard to separate personal finances from business finances.  Luckily my partner was a CPA before we took to farming, so he handles all of the financial intricacies.  Consistent cash-flow is hard to count on, too.  At the end of the month, after all bills have been paid and the budget for the next month is planned, if there's anything left we split it up for personal pay.  Sometimes it's $0 sometimes it's $500.
[What are your cash crops?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tddie?context=5)|Normally, the biggest money-makers would be tomatoes, okra, salad mixes, micro-greens, and winter-time carrots.
[Do you sell to restaurants?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tddie?context=5)|Rarely...there are a few restaurants around town that will feature local food once a week, or once a month, and shop at the farmers' markets.  We will sell to them sometimes.
[Do your eggs taste better?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tddie?context=5)|One of our friends had a blind egg tasting contest, 5 judges, 4 different eggs (3 farm fresh, 1 store bought).  We took a clean sweep with all 5 judges.  I'd say the reason is because our system has more green space per chicken than the others (basically unlimited), and the amount of young greens they eat really affects the flavor/color.
[Did you have any legal troubles?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tddie?context=5)|Not yet.
[What vegetables make money and what don't?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tddie?context=5)|There's not much that doesn't make money...we just charge what it takes to make a profit, or at least break-even if the price is outrageous.
[Say I had an acre of watermelons. How much money would that make?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tddie?context=5)|No clue, honestly, we haven't done watermelons yet.
[How many acres of plants do you have?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tddie?context=5)|At any time we'll have 3-5 acres in production, and 2-3 acres cover-cropped and out of production.
[Suppose you had half an acre of tomatoes. How many tomatoes would that produce and how much money would that make?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tddie?context=5)|There has never been a consistent tomato crop, there are too many variables to really say.  Diseases, weather, varieties...last year we barely broke even on tomatoes (labor+budget) because there was a long drought followed by an intense rain, causing all the tomatoes to split and putting the plants out of commission for two months.  Off the top of my head, I'd say on an average year of tomatoes, a half-acre might bring $4000-$6000 profit margin, and that would be after paying ourselves for labor.
[Who buys the goat meat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tddie?context=5)|Mainly Indians and adventurous foodies.
[Do you slaughter it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tddie?context=5)|Thanks to stringent meat handling laws, it's basically impossible for small farms to slaughter meat themselves.  The goats we have to take to a slaughter facility.  Luckily, there is an exemption for chickens, we can process up to 10,000 a year on-site as long as we submit to regular inspections.
[How does it feel to slaughter an animal and watch as it gurgles on its last ounces of blood?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tddie?context=5)|The goats are insta-killed, the chickens are stunned before they're bled-out.  Never seen any gurgling.  Normally, the chickens will just bleed until they go into the death struggle, at which point they're basically dead.  The death struggle is what is most traumatic for most people, I think.
[Is halal-ity an issue?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tddie?context=5)|We are Animal Welfare Approved, which does not allow halal processing because of some incompatibility with their standards.  Never been asked for halal meat anyways.
[What do you feed your chickens?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tddie?context=5)|Organic grain mix from a local supplier. We have less than a 5% mortality rate.  Sometimes it's impossible to know why they died.  If just one dies, for no apparent reason, we don't worry about getting it necropsied.  Sometimes the chicks will huddle so tight that they suffocate one.
[What kind of a coop do you have for them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tddie?context=5)|We use inexpensive portable coops on PVC skids with thermal material for weather protection.  Costs about $400 and holds 75 chickens according to Animal Welfare Approved standards.
[Say you had 500lbs of carrots and no one wants to buy them; what do you do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tddie?context=5)|Carrots always sell out, but hypothetically, we would donate them.  We donate all food we don't sell at the end of the week (besides meat, potatoes, and sweet potatoes) to the local Interfaith Food Shuttle. Local farmers' markets and CSA (google it if you're interested).  We could also sell through co-op, or set up a stand/store-front by the road.
[Could you sell to a grocery store or restaurants?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tddie?context=5)|We could, we don't sell to any grocery stores though.
[What uses are there for alpacas and llamas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tddie?context=5)|Fiber, mainly.  Alpacas have great fur.  A lot of people just raise them for show.  Llamas make great pack-animals and I actually know a lady that leads llama ventures in the mountains.
[Have you heard of Albrecht and AcresUSA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tddie?context=5)|Not Albrecth, though Acres is a great publication, I read every copy. You'd have to be in a farmers' market first, and they usually only take applications at the beginning of the year...but otherwise, yep, you could do that.  There are a couple vendors I know that just grow produce in their back yard as a hobby and make a couple hundred dollars a weekend doing that.  No lawyer needed...and as long as you do your taxes right, no accountant needed either.
[I heard some people sell chickens and have to label ""for pet food only"" or ""not for human consumption"". Do you do that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tddie?context=5)|Someone might do that to avoid having to get a meat handler's licence.  I don't know of any farmers' market that would let you sell meat without a license, and even if you label it as pet food,  you'd probably get shut down anyways. I'll be back to answer the rest later.
[What does it mean to be a small sustainable farmer? Does it mean you only farm enough food for you and your family; not making any profit and just breaking even?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tdqed?context=5)|Excellent question!  In general, a sustainable farmer grows for production (to sell at markets), and concentrates on minimizing environmental impact of the operation.  This requires maintaining natural ecosystems instead of destroying them and replacing them with synthetic substitutes.  Soil health is probably the biggest factor in sustainable farming, ensuring that the natural fertility of the land is not lost.  If you tried to grow food on land which has been conventionally farmed for a decade or so, without using massive amounts of synthetic fertilizers, you aren't going to grow anything.  There will be no worms, bugs, or micro-organisms in the ground.  The soil will be dead, possibly beyond repair.  We concentrate on minimizing fossil-fuel use through selling locally, not using a conventional tractor, and minimizing inputs to the farm.  We also work with local water conservancy agencies to maintain quality of local bodies of water.  Sustainable farmers work with nature instead of against it.
[Do you intend on expanding and devoting the rest of your life to farming?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tdqed?context=5)|Absolutely, I can't imagine doing anything else.  Not just farming myself, but spreading knowledge to allow others to do the same.
[Currently, how big is your farm?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tdqed?context=5)|25 acres.
[Are there any pictures you could show us (I'm mainly interested in the size of the farm)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tdqed?context=5)|I'll try to dig some up later tonight.
[About the chickens and eggs, how many chickens do you have and how often do you collect the eggs (how often do chickens lay eggs)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tdqed?context=5)|We have around 400 laying hens.  Chickens will lay an average of 5 eggs a week, more if it is a breed bred for production.  We collect eggs once a day at the end of the day.
[What do you eat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tdqed?context=5)|A lot of my diet comes from what we produce, or trade at the farmers' markets, but I've always loved going out to eat.  And, to be completely honest, sometimes I just crave a good fast food cheeseburger.  Dunno if that makes me hypocritical or whatever, but I don't beat myself up over it.
[Mind going into detail about the green houses? How do you heat them? How large are they? How much are they? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3th40a?context=5)|The high-tunnels are *unheated* greenhouses, they have no source of active heat at all.  For high-tunnels with frost-intolerant plants, we line one side with compost, which emits an amazing amount of heat throughout the night.  We'll also put black buckets of water inside which absorb heat through the day and release it at night.  Otherwise, we close them up around 3 or 4pm, let them accumulate some heat, and that does the trick.  If it gets down into the teens, we have to put an extra layer of protection of them inside, using cloth row covers.  Temperatures still get below freezing inside the house, but if you grow frost-tolerant varieties, the houses offer enough protection.  Things like kale sometimes don't even need to be in a tunnel; we just cover them with cloth row covers and they're fine all winter.  Our houses are 14 feet wide and 8 feet tall, and as long as we need them to be (usually between 45' and 90').  We bought a bulk amount of frames from a nursery going out of business, which averaged out to about 1 hoop for $10, and the hoops are spaced 5 feet apart.  The plastic is anywhere between $200-$400 and lasts up to 5 years if you treat it right, and once it's done on the house it has a number of other uses around the farm.
[How many acres do you have?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tc96e?context=5)|We are sitting on around 25 acres.
[What's the minimum number a acres a farmer would need to be economically viable?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tc96e?context=5)|It really depends on what the farmer wanted to do.  Just growing vegetables, it's completely possible with just 5 acres to maintain a lifestyle just growing food.  Adding chickens to that mix wouldn't require any extra space.  As you add other livestock, you need more space.  We maintain 30 breeding goats, so our heard usually tops out at 90 goats, and we rotate them on 3-7 acres any given time.  Less space would mean you'd have to import feed and you would probably start having disease problems.
[Sorry for my ignorance, but what do you need 90 goats for?  --city folk.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3ukqrv?context=5)|30 to breed, 60 to process to sell meat throughout the year.
[Thanks for the reply. I read a blog about a family in Colorado who were operating an organic farm on six acres. Iirc, they sold their produce at the local farmer's market. They basically supported themselves from their farm, but I think the father did some side jobs from time to time.  I've got about three acres and was thinking about trying to grow some produce and sell at the local farmer's market. I've grown a garden before for a few years, but don't really have a green thumb. What's the best way to learn?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tcjjv?context=5)|Check out Eliot Coleman's ""New Organic Grower,"" it's comprehensive and a great place to start.  It is where I got the 5 acre number from...his system maintains that 2 people can tend to 5 acres, each acre costing $2000 a year to maintain while producing up to $8000 a year, average.  Get in touch with your local Cooperative Extension Agent, have them inform you of any workshops, conferences, seminars, or anything about growing for market.  Go to a farmers' market and find someone who is doing something similar to what you want, and ask if you can come out and take a look around.  99% of the time, they will be more than happy to share their knowledge with you.
[How long have you been doing this and how did you learn? Do you come from a gardening/farming background?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tci3w?context=5)|6 years now, I'm still learning.  I had absolutely no gardening or farming background...hadn't grown a single plant or raised a single livestock animal in my life when I jumped into it with my friend.  I learned by absorbing as much information as possible from every source available.  Visiting farmers' markets and asking to come out for a visit and asking lots of questions.  State universities all had free seminars and events.  Sustainable Agriculture conferences were a great source of networking and information.  The local Cooperative Extension Agency is a great place to go to for info...they're in place specifically to help farmers (among other things).  They would often have field trips to farms, events, seminars, conferences, classes, workshops...free rides all around the state to help farmers learn.  I bought a few key books, scoured the internet for info...for about a year, all we did was learn.  Nothing beats experience though.  It took a couple years to really get in the swing of it.
[Do you feel that a country folk would have an easier time getting into the industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3ulivj?context=5)|I doubt it, unless the country folk grew up on an operating farm.  Other than that, the only advantage I see is the fact that country folk tend to have larger properties and probably spend more time tending to the landscape, which is similar to a lot of farm work.  Other than that, the main factors required for farming are diligence, patience, and hard work (passion doesn't hurt either), and I don't see these as inherent in country folk vs. city folk.
[Do you name the laying hens? Do they help with pest control? What kind of enclosure are they in? Do the dogs get along with them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tcoz8?context=5)|I've got names for the roosters...we've got 4 roosters out of around 400 hens, and they're the only ones that are easy to pick out from the crowd.  There's Foggern, Draco, Top-hat, and Doofus.  They definitely help with pest control.  We keep them in portable coops out on pasture, and we'll normally keep them adjacent to the crop production plots so they take care of bugs heading towards the crops.  If we till up a plot for production, we'll let them on there for a few days so they'll dig up grubs and weed seeds.
[Is Top-hat a polish?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3thk86?context=5)|Yeah...unoriginal, I know.  I usually call him Mr. Top-hat.
[As a farmer, what is your opinion on the legalization of marijuana? I've heard people say farmers would start growing it instead of other crops to make more money and it could possibly cause a high increase in imports of crops from other nations. What's your take on that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tbkn0?context=5)|There definitely are farmers who are only going to grow what will bring them the most money.  We're sort of seeing that now with the implementation of biofuels.  Most sustainable farmers aren't really in it for the money...it's not a very glamorous lifestyle.  We do it to provide food for people in a way we think is best.  I totally support legalization and would definitely grow a small crop if it were legalized, but it would not take over the operation.  I think it would be much better to grow marijuana rather than tobacco and hemp instead of cotton.
[Have you seen ""The real dirt on Farmer John""?   What are your thoughts on CSA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tc6kk?context=5)|Heard of it, never seen it.  My personal opinion of CSA's is that they're god-tier food distribution.  People who participate in CSA's tend to care enough about their food that they're willing to get involved in its production.  They understand the inherent risks of farming and are willing to share those risks with the farmer.  But on the other hand, they get to share the benefit also (when there is a surplus, they get extra food).  Last summer we had so many peppers that we told our CSA members to just take as many as they wanted.  A CSA allows farmers to avoid having to use government funded grants for finances and connects them to the community they're feeding.  Our CSA customers visit the farm frequently and we have big events where they can help us plant transplants or harvest certain things, and we make a big fun day of it.
[I'm somewhat amazed small farming can make it as a business. Do you make a decent profit? How much debt did it take to get started?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tbl9e?context=5)|We make enough of a profit to maintain a comfortable life and grow our business however we want, as well as throw some into both business and personal savings.  Small farm finance is impossible to separate from personal finance, so it becomes a lifestyle rather than a business really.  The initial investment was around $20,000, not including the land.  However, we took no grant money, which there is no shortage of when it comes to agriculture.  There is also great financing options for people looking to get into agriculture, though the only thing financed at the moment is the land/house.
[What do you do for health care?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tfmpq?context=5)|I just have to pay out of pocket for individual health care.  It's not horribly expensive, but the deductible sucks.  It's basically for emergencies.
[Do you receive any subsidies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tgmro?context=5)|No.
[Do you farm alone or do you have help?  Do you make enough money to live on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tc9ml?context=5)|It's myself an two others that live here, two of us work the farm full-time and the other works another job and helps out whenever he can.  We sometimes have interns/apprentices during busy seasons.  It is my only job, and we make enough money to live comfortably.
[Difference between intern and farmhand?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tkrrb?context=5)|A farmhand is an actual paid employee, either permanent or seasonal.  An intern is almost always a student or recent graduate who is working simply for the experience...for scant pay if any at all.  Internships are understood to be temporary and primarily a learning experience while farmhands are primarily there to get work done.
[Grass fed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tbcu6?context=5)|To be allowed the ""grass fed"" label, the animals have to be fed absolutely nothing but grass their entire lives.  99% of the goats' diet comes from foraging on pasture, but we feed them a very small amount of grain at night.  They go bonkers for it, and it gives us the ability to bring them to a central area whenever we need to tend to them.  Chickens cannot be ""grass fed""; seeds, bugs, worms, and other small animals are a natural part of their diet and a chicken that only ate grass would be extremely malnourished.
[Dabble in permaculture?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tc54w?context=5)|Sure, a bit...you could say some of our techniques draw from permaculture, but I've always found it difficult to define exactly what we do that would be considered permaculture.  We use local trees and shrubs with agroforestry in our goat rotation, the meat chickens are raised on veggie plots in the season preceding the production of the plot, so they fertilize it directly and eat weed seeds.  We collect rainwater to irrigate some veggie plots.  We use compost piles to help keep high-tunnels warm in the winter.  Permaculture seems to lend itself more to self-contained communities rather than production systems, and I'd love to explore it more if I ever have time.
[How do your yields compare to growers using artificial pesticides and fertilizers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tcio0?context=5)|I have no clue, honestly...I'm not in direct contact with anyone using synthetics to grow produce.  However, Iowa State University recently came out with a comprehensive 13 year study which claimed that organic yields comparable, even greater, than conventional yields.
[How did you learn to do this kind of farming? Did you grow up around it, did you just garden a lot as a kid, or did you work in other, more industrial kinds of agriculture before switching?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tcio0?context=5)|There were just a couple questions about this right before you posted, see those.
[Have you given any thought to sustainably growing grain on a large scale?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tcio0?context=5)|Not really...I'm not interested in ever going large scale, to be honest.  The only grain I'd ever want to produce is to feed the chickens anyways, I'm not a big fan of grain-heavy diets.  We buy our chicken feed grain from a local farm which is certified organic and maintains responsible practices, but it doesn't seem appealing to me.  I'm glad someone else is willing to do it.
[How do you till?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tfuhg?context=5)|For ground that is very compact, and for deep compaction, we use a rotary plow on a two-wheel walking tractor.  If it isn't too compact, we'll do it by hand using a broadfork.  For shallow tillage, we use a rotary tiller on the walking tractor.
[How old are you and when did you decide to go into sustainable farming?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tchtn?context=5)|I am 29, I got into the game at 23, right around the local food movement really took off.
[You mentioned that you've done a lot of reading, but how did you transition into this field?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3tgrhy?context=5)|Very poorly!  Nothing beats experience.  We had a lot of failures before we got the hang of it. From another post: ""I decided to start farming because I didn't like working for people. I wanted to do something that seemed more practical where I could measure the outcome and see how my input was having a direct effect on my personal life as well as on a societal scale. I wanted to be more involved in building communities and helping people. Farming seemed like the best way to do this. I love everything about it. Mostly I like not working for someone else. Before I was a farmer I was doing general tech consulting work for two different companies, one for-profit corporation and one non-profit. Web work, computer work, networking, IT security...stuff that has always been second nature to me, and I made a decent living doing it.""
[Do you plan on having a family?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3ty5uq?context=5)|I don't ""plan"" on it...if it happens, it happens.  I'm not cursed with the intense loneliness most people seem to have which compels them to seek a life-partner (usually mistakenly, according to divorce rates).  I've had some great long-term relationships but never felt compelled to trap the other person in a binding agreement, and have never felt the urge to settle down or have kids.  I'm sure if I find the right person it could happen though.
[What do you miss about your former cushy life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3ty5uq?context=5)|There was something nice about not being attached to my daily responsibilities.  If I slacked off at my job or fell into a rut, my livelihood was hardly affected.  I can't do that now.  If something doesn't get done that needs done, things fall apart very quickly.  Also, with a CSA, I'm held highly accountable for the quality of my work.  It's a fulfilling type of responsibility but can wear me down sometimes.  The pride that comes from producing a product and selling it directly to a customer makes it totally worth it though.
[How far are you from a large town/small city?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3ty5uq?context=5)|10 minutes from the small local town (4 or 5 restaurants, 1 grocery store, dead downtown, and of course a Walmart), 30 minutes from an actual city, and an hour away from a large city with decent social scene (where we sell most of our product.)  I've gotten used to driving an hour to get anywhere worth going, luckily I have a fuel efficient car for social trips.
[How fast is your internet access?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pyvh9/iama_small_sustainable_farmer_ama/c3ty5uq?context=5)|It caps out at 10mb/s, with a 10gig/month transfer limit and $10 a gig after that.  Kill me now.

By that point we will only have been dating for 7 months - am I wrong to say we should think about breaking up? 

He is going back home and I will be here during the summer, and it is about a 10 hour plane ride to see each other. Then I am graduating and plan on going abroad to work for a year. I wanted to go and see him during the summer but he says he is busy with family things and might go abroad for an internship. 

I get that and encourage him fully (although the little niggling doubt keeps making me feel it is an excuse not to see me - though I think that I am being silly here it still is affecting my judgement). 

He will be going home for Christmas and I may see him then - after 7 months apart. But I think there is no promise of this given he will have family things to do and so we may only get a couple of days together depending on my work schedule. After that we have another five or six months apart until the summer and again we might not see each other even if our relationship lasts... 

Am I being silly for suggesting we talk seriously about this now? And is there any advice from people in or having been in a long distance relationship that could help? 

Thanks..."

(Details Inside)",DoomKitteh,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/pzc2d/how_do_you_create_an_ultimatum_for_your_so_if_you/,"I need help.  My boyfriend has been unemployed for almost a year now and I need for him to get a job soon.  I understand that it is a bad economy and I have tried to be patient and let him do this his own way at his own pace.  But I'm not happy with the way he is doing it and I need for him to get a job soon or it will ruin my life (since I am currently working three part-time jobs to support us and have had to cut back on school).  Every time I try to talk to him and help him, he gets upset and rejects my advice and tells me to stop lecturing him.  But he is not trying.  He will not apply for jobs just to bring money in right now and is convinced that he deserves a better position.  We cannot wait though!  I need his help.  And every time I try to tell him that to encourage him to apply for ""lesser"" jobs (in his eyes) or encourage him to go back to school to network and land internships at better companies, he tells me he will look into it and then does nothing.  On top of that, when he does get a rare interview, he goes in so condescending and cocky that I'm pretty sure its why he doesn't get the job (he doesn't have this attitude regarding any other area of our relationship).

I don't want to break up with him.  Our relationship is great...except that he is unemployed and has a terrible attitude about finding a job.  I just want him to take this seriously in order to contribute and let me do what I need to do so that we both aren't screwed (I need to finish school and find a better job myself).  He needs to get a job soon or at least develop a different attitude towards this or my feelings towards him will change and I don't want that.  How do I, essentially, create an ultimatum that he change regarding this without making it an ""I want to break up if you don't"" issue?  I don't want to break up...I just things to get better for us. 

Edit:  We are both 27 (soon to be 28), we have been together almost 6 years (lived together for 4), I am female and he is male.

pz0v5,5,2012-02-21,"""We raised you better than this.""",anxietyistheworst,familysupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/familysupport/comments/pz0v5/we_raised_you_better_than_this/,"tl;dr version- I'm 26, I started working in NYC about six months ago and have been saving up money to move out of my house in NJ since.  I found an awesome place to live with two guys that I know and trust.  I told my family (my grandma and aunt whom I live with and my mom) and they told me I was not allowed to move in with guys / to Elmhurst, NYC / with roommates at all.  What the fuck do I do.

long version aka backstory &gt;

I've always butted heads with my family.  They are very strict and set in their ways whereas I have always felt the need to explore the world and get out there and see things for myself.  They like to watch a lot of television and never leave the house, but I never wanted that kind of life.  I found school to be my niche early on, when my family members were fighting, I was always safe with books and my own world.  I was given a computer at 13 and made a lot of internet friends and found punk rock.  I loved going to shows and had to fight with my mom and grandma to let me go for years.  The first time I wanted to go to a club show with my friends (to see Dashboard Confessional play acoustic!), I made a powerpoint to show my mom I wasn't going to get hurt.  She let me go.

When I wanted to go to college, I had to fight to go away to school. I got a BA in English in 2008 and came home and couldn't find a job.  I had planned on going to grad school right away but I broke my leg that fall. I had to cancel my honors thesis and live at home while I spent the semester in a wheelchair.  My mom worked from home at the time and I kept going to two classes so I could graduate on time.  That summer, my mom told me that I wasted all of her money because I got a useless degree, despite it being something I was really passionate in.  She said if I didn't go to grad school by fall of 2009, she would kick me out of the house.  I got in, worked full or part time for most of the semesters, spent summer 2010 taking an online class, interning in NYC twice a week, and working retail in NJ to afford my unpaid internship so I could graduate in October.  A job landed in my lap near the end of the summer.  The pay wasn't great but it was my dream job and an opportunity I couldn't pass up.  My family didn't want me to take it because of the money.  I did anyway.  I have never been happier in this respect, I am totally in love with my job and it is exactly what I want to be doing with my life. 

Last month, a friend on a music message board I've been posting on for two years told me they were looking for a new roommate.  This, again, was an opportunity that fell into my lap and wouldn't happen again.  It was in my budget, in a really nice neighborhood, would cut my commute in half, and I could take my pet with me.  I checked out the place and loved it.

The next day, I told my grandma and aunt I found a place and was really excited to move out. They immediately said no.  I explained that it was in my budget, I had researched the area and it was safe, I loved the place, and I was ready to move.  I didn't want to discuss moving with them at all previous because I felt like if I did, they would have shut it down.  If I had everything all set to go, how could they say no?  They started asking questions about the people I'd be living with.  When I said they were both 30 year old dudes, I was asked ""what kind of 30 year old men would lure a 26 year old girl to live with them"" and ""what kind of man would want to date you when they find out you have two male roommates. you will never find a boyfriend.""  My grandma was livid and told me that she raised me better than this.  I asked her what it meant, what is better than completing two higher ed degrees, starting a career in a recession, and finding a safe affordable place to live on my own?  She scoffed and never gave me an answer.  They argued that I was not street smart enough to live in the city, despite the fact that I've been working there for half a year now.  That these men, no matter how often I run into them at concerts, will just steal my things and rape me in my sleep.  I offered to invite them over but they refused. I asked why they didn't trust me or my judgement in this and they said that it wasn't me they didn't trust, just everyone else in the world.  They said they didn't want me moving until I could afford a place on my own and when I said that I did not want to live alone, I wanted roommates, they said that there's three people they know that they would let me live with.  None of them want to live in NYC. 

I went to my mom's after this and she had a little bit of a cooler head but was offended I didn't discuss anything, she said that wasn't adult of me.  I told her my reasoning (if its in place, how could anyone say no) and she still said it was childish and proof I shouldn't survive on my own. I explained to her that I am not afraid of the world, and I don't want to be.  I see how fear cripples her, my grandma, and my aunt and I don't want that to be my life.  I want to experience things for myself and live my own life now.  I need to fuck up and learn things for myself, I can't just go by hearsay anymore.  She again said that roommates cannot be trusted (if you left your world there and went to work, would they take everything you own?) and gave me a list of things she hated that I did that prove I am not an adult (stay up too late, don't eat breakfast before I go to work, go to shows) and would rather I waited until I had my job for a year before I started looking for a place.  I understand that, but with the hours I work, it's really hard to make the NJ trains home.  If I lived somewhere subway accessible, I wouldn't have to stress out so much, trains would run more than once an hour.

However, my mom did say that she would think about it if she looked at the apartment with me.  Which is hopeful I guess?  But still incredibly, incredibly frustrating.  All my friends and coworkers think this whole situation is completely absurd.  I don't know what to do now.  I hate airing this shit on the internet but I really am at a loss for how to proceed.  My move in date is April first, so I have some time to figure this shit out, but not much.  What should I do, Reddit?

Sorry for the tl;dr. I just felt like the backstory was necessary."

pyxiz,3,2012-02-21,"[19M] Depressed, terrified of the future, want to feel happy again.",[deleted],ihaveissues,https://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/pyxiz/19m_depressed_terrified_of_the_future_want_to/,"Hey Reddit, this is all probably pretty petty, but I need someone to talk to. I never feel happy anymore, and at night I cry to myself. I can't talk to anyone about this and I'm worried about how much this is going to progress. There are multiple little things that just add up so I'm going to just list things off in bullets. I'm sorry if this is a mess.

* I don't like myself. Not really. Since high school I've always felt stupider than everyone else, and like like I'm going to accomplish far less. I lie about my personality all the time, I try to sound more confident than I really am but eventually everyone starts to realize how incompetent I really am. The people I'm charge of at my job could probably do a better job than me.
* I think I'm broken on a social level. I have friends, but I feel like I have to act more interesting than I actually am to keep them around. My last girlfriend hated me because of this. I couldn't think of how to be a better boyfriend, she grew bored with me and grew to resent me. I feel like once someone gets to know me well enough this is always going to be an issue.
* I'm a sophomore in college and I have no chosen major or career aspirations yet. My passions are either unrealistic or point me to fields I just don't have the intellect to excel in. I know if I did law school I'd destroy myself, if I was even able to get in. I don't have any internships lined up, I do mediocre work in my classes and I feel like I'm wasting my parents time and money. I have a job as an RA in the residence halls and nearly all of my residents have more of their academics and personal goals lined up than I do. 
* I'll feel fine at the beginning of the day, but during the evening, or in my bed at night I'll be overcome with self-loathing and fear for my future prospects. I can't keep coasting along like this but I can't live up to other people's expectations or my own half the time. I feel like time is running out for me to figure out what I'm supposed to or to try and be a whole, unbroken person. I cry to myself at nights until I fall asleep. On rare occasions during the day I've had to hurry back to my room to keep anyone from seeing my mini breakdowns.

I don't know how to fix myself but I just want to let some of this out. It gets worse as time goes on. I don't think of killing myself or anything like that, I couldn't do that to my family, though I worry about where my thoughts might take me in the future. I just want it to stop so I can be happy like I was before high school.

I'm sorry for posting this. I don't know what else to do, can't stop crying again, but feel a little better. I think I just want somebody to talk to."
pywik,7,2012-02-20,Any GISers want to help me with an awesome project?,zacharius206,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/pywik/any_gisers_want_to_help_me_with_an_awesome_project/,"I am an intern on a [large public transportation project](http://projects.soundtransit.org/x1698.xml) in Seattle, WA. We are building a tunnel through the city for light rail. As the construction progresses, I need to produce a map of what has been done. I have been doing this very primitively, and would like some ideas or some help on providing a map that is accessible on the web. While the tunnel is being built (by a giant [tunnel boring machine](http://imgur.com/a/oYf6H#8)), data is being collected from the machine as well as hundreds of instruments that monitor movement in the ground and surrounding structures. I would like to put all of this information together on one easily accessible map. 

I have access to all the GIS software I would need, but I don't know how to use it, and have only limited knowledge of what it can do. I am hoping someone will share my vision and want to get involved. As an intern, I am in no position to hire anyone, but you will definitely get credit for any effort you put into it. If you want to just offer suggestions about how to figure it out on my own, that's great too. The only problem is that we only have a few months until the tunnel is complete. Sound Transit will continue to expand the light rail system for the next 20 years or so - both above and below ground, so it would be a great opportunity for anyone who might want to get involved.

TL;DR - I want to create a web-based application to track the progress of the light rail construction in Seattle.

UPDATE: In less than 24hrs, I have received a lot of helpful responses. Thank you to everyone who has already replied or contacted me. There are a lot of directions this could take, and I could definitely see getting several people involved. I hope to one day be a GIS expert, but for now, I would love your help. I will post periodic updates of the project as we progress. Please feel free to contact me here or by PM if you have some ideas or would like to help."

She wasn't into me at first, explaining that she wasn't really in a position to date and that due to her life experiences she felt a decade older than her 20 years.

Eventually I wooed her into it and when we were together for three months, I invited her to spend spring break with me rather than alone in the dorms. My dad was only 35 at this time and they got on rather well. He even offered to entertain her when I went to my internship. 

We broke up abruptly afterwards. I was hurt but I loved her and wanted her in my life. We stay friends. I notice she spends a lot of time on the phone and is vague about her how she spends her weekends. One day she gets in a carwreck. Her roommate calls me. I get there and my dad is already there, holding her hand. And I just know.

They got married when she graduated at the end of the semester and now have three children. That was 10 years ago and they are disgustingly happy and disgusting in general.

tl;dr Meet beautiful girl and fall in love, beautiful girl meets my dad and breaks up with me. They get married and have three kids. I try not to look petty at Thanksgiving."
pyp3a,1,2012-02-20,"Interviewing with VMware, looking for any advice.",vmwarethrowaway,vmware,https://www.reddit.com/r/vmware/comments/pyp3a/interviewing_with_vmware_looking_for_any_advice/,"I have an interview with VMware for an inside sales intern position. I am an MIS major and know a good bit about cloud computing conceptually, but have never really had any hands on experience with their products. I don't know that I want to do sales forever, but I figure while I am young it will be good and help my interpersonal skills grow. 

I have done some research and started looking at their white papers as well as history and some financial articles, but I can't really find much on the culture at VMware. I know that until recently it has been under a female CEO which probably means they're big on gender equality, but that doesn't really help me for the interview.

I've been lurking around this subreddit and have learned more from it than anything else I can find. I figure that technical knowledge doesn't get me too far with a recruiter, but a broader knowledge of the company would. I hope this doesn't come across as laziness on my part. I am just really excited about this interview and don't want to waste my one opportunity with VMware.

Any advice for the interview, links to good articles, general knowledge of VMware, you could share would be greatly appreciated. Also if anyone knows anywhere to point me for salesforce.com information that would be great. They use it and it wouldn't hurt to know a little about it as well.

Thanks!"
pynug,5,2012-02-20,Help looking for a summer Journalism internship in Metro Detroit!,SeanEqualsYes,Detroit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Detroit/comments/pynug/help_looking_for_a_summer_journalism_internship/,"I'm a Journalism student at MSU and I'm looking for a Journalism internship for this summer (or next fall) in the Detroit area. 

The position doesn't have to be paid (though it would be a plus), but would have to work around a IT job I already have. Also, my schooling is more in the graphics/design/layout side of things not really writing (though I would consider writing if it's something I'm interested in, I am a good writer, it's just not my focus). I also have a pretty good handle on producing web content and video.

Anyone have any good ideas?"

pyma5,1,2012-02-20,I don't want to lie to her about me dating other girls. Is it even necessary to tell her that I am?,LA_ultimate_crush,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/pyma5/i_dont_want_to_lie_to_her_about_me_dating_other/,"The girl and I have be dating each other for almost 2 months now and we decided that we were ""seeing each other""... but not in a relationship. The reason why is because she might be leaving to Japan to teach english or for some internship.. I forget.. and she still needs to find her individuality. 

Anyways.. I'm guessing we're not exclusive? I'm so confused with terminologies in ""dating"" ""seeing each other"" ""exclusive"" etc.

So I was wondering, if I'm going to go out with other girls.. should I give her a heads up or talk to her about them? She told me she's not trying to see anyone else, just me. But at the same time, I don't know if that makes us in a relationship or am I able to date other girls? 

I mentioned to her I recently got a girls number at the bar, she got upset for a hot second but cool down because she knew we weren't together. And I asked her so where do we stand with dating other people? She said something along the lines of ""If we do start seeing someone and start getting serious with them, then we should tell each other"" I told her she was the only one I'm seeing right now. But we're still not in a relationship I think.. I still want to play the game.. she said I can go get girls numbers.. Should I tell her, when it does happen, the day when I go out with someone else.. I don't want to lie to her.. I want her to tell me if she was going out with someone.. I just want to keep my options open because we might not even be a sure thing.

Any advice?"

[How much did fear/excitement play a role in your ability to aim?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2dne?context=5)|I didn't aim per se, I just reacted the way my dad taught me and like we always practiced.
[Where you aware of how many rounds you were firing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2dne?context=5)|Oh, and I didn't need to keep track of the rounds, because the second shot misfired, and by when I reacted and did the TRB procedure, I could see they were fleeing already. And I was scared that my gun was jammed or something and they'd notice it.
[How was the recoil.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t5rpx?context=5)|Barely noticeable. It's a good balanced gun, and so is the MiniThunder 45.
[Edit: As for an actual question, do you feel guilty or any regret, or do you just shrug it off?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t57gt?context=5)|Edit: Neither. I don't have reasons to feel guilty because I'll never now how badly injured was the guy. But even if I'd learn for some reason that he died, I don't believe I'd feel guilty. Sad? Maybe, but not for him.
[How long did the attack go on for before you realised it was serious enough to need you to shoot.. did you hesitate at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2e1a?context=5)|You can keep the islands, they look dry and boring.
[Why do you want the Falkland Islands back?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2e1a?context=5)|I was holding my gun inside my purse. When I saw them more closely and noticed they were a treath, I took the safety off. When they jumped (one of them reached for his waist, the other one jumped towards us grunting something that would translate as *""staystillstaystill""*, I just told my sister to run, took my gun and shot him.
[&gt;would translate as ""staystillstaystill""  No te muevas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t627v?context=5)|Literalmente dijo algo como *""Quietaquietaquieta""*.
[Karma works though...he was clearly a much worse person than you and you ruined his evening for sure. I would guess you have to be in such a life or death situation to make a call on shooting someone. Odd that you're angry and that you even sound disappointed the gun misfired.  You achieved the main aim which was to make them run away..did you want to empty the whole clip into him or something?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2o7v?context=5)|In that particular moment, I thought that only out of fear; my dad has been a cop for 37 years and is still on active duty, and I saw many of his friends being killed by wounded perps that had the time and strenght to shoot even after being badly injured. You just want to live *so* much, that you really can't stand the thought of having any chances to die there. But now, that years have passed, I'm glad that everything worked out that way. Like I said, it's the best possible outcome for us, because we didn't get in trouble. But... again, you should have seen them. Their looks and their body language. They *hated* us, and we never harmed anyone.
[Did the assailants steal your clothes during this altercation?  If so, why did you not purchase more in the years since the incident?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t7abs?context=5)|Because I decided to stay naked from that moment onwards, for the rest of my life.
[So what happened to the other assailant who saw his buddy get shot? Run after you? Run away screaming in terror? Help his buddy out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2dzk?context=5)|I would have shot the whole cartridge, though, if the second shot wouldn't have misfired.
[Did you call the police to report the crime or did you just go home and hope nothing came of it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2fn1?context=5)|I ran like hell ‚ÄîI even lost my sandals on the way‚Äî back to my friends' house, and called my dad. I never reported it to the police, for the obvious reasons.
[You are being VERY polite to certain commenters. Kudos. Do you think you killed him? If so, do you feel secretly excited that you've done what few do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t8d12?context=5)|I... don't know. It could have gone either way. I've seen so many people die from much lesser wounds, and at the same time, I've seen people survive absolutely *terrible* injuries.  I stopped wondering about it a long time ago. I'm content with the fact that I *ruined his fucking day*, that's for sure.  If I did in fact kill him, I don't think I'd feel different about it in any meaningful way.
[Why do you feel the need to only show pics of your tits? is that the only way to get attention?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t5r5k?context=5)|Oh, hai _oogle. Are you some teen girl angry because some guys go off topic about cleavage? Don't worry, that's how the Internet goes; they'll be right back to your [/r/gonewild](http://www.reddit.com/r/gonewild) post as soon as we finish talking here. No need to be so upset. :)
[What is your occupation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2m3g?context=5)|I'm a licensed Surgeon's Assistant, but worked most of my life as a commercial model, dancer and some other stuff in the same venue. [I'm a mom now](http://imgur.com/a/FAWG7#0), so I'm working only a couple of hours on weekends for the time being.
[Also, what were you and your sister doing that night before the attack happened?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2m3g?context=5)|It was December 30th, and we were at a party in a mutual friend's house. It was just five blocks away and we couldn't get a cab. She insisted she had to be there, so I accompanied her, thinking what the hell, it's close and I have a gun. It was a stupid mistake that I never, ever repeated.
[Do you usually carry a gun?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t3gq3?context=5)|I don't usually carry a gun anymore because I just don't go where I might need to. I learned my lesson and try to avoid those situations if possible. I also work much less now that I had a daughter.
[You never reported it to the police, but i assume there was some newspaper article about it? What did it say/what happended/where there no witnesses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t4gvd?context=5)|No witnesses, except a poor [cartonero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartonero) that *maybe* heard the shot. He was around the corner and saw us running back to our friend's house.  Besides, Buenos Aires is a *huge* city. I hardly think that any newspaper would be interested in such a trivial shooting, where nobody died ‚Äîat least on the scene‚Äî and nothing of value was lost.
[I assume when shot u fall down and scream on top of your lungs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t4qoq?context=5)|I'm afraid that's not like you see it in the movies. You can just google for videos of people being shot if you want, but you'll end up in dark corners of the Internet watching horrible stuff. Or 4chan. I had to do internship in clinics and hospitals for three years to get my Surgeon's Assistant degree. I've seen many, *many* cases of injured criminals going to the hospital with ludicrous stories about how they got shot. Some of them waited for too long and couldn't be saved, and it was amazing how they managed to even get to the hospital in the first place. You'd be surprised of how much the human body can whitstand, and I'd suggest you don't bait for the gore lovers to explain it to you with links.
[Any guilty feelings about shooting the guy? any idea where you hit him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2ie7?context=5)|He had a baggy... er, what's the name... like a T-Shirt, but with a hood. I could see the impact somewhere in his torso, as his clothes flapped noticeably.  I don't feel guilty. You should have seen his eyes. He really meant us harm, because he hated us, and whatever we stood for in his mind.
[How did the police respond to your self defense shooting?  Did they treat it like a crime and indict you on charges, or did they act differently?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2g23?context=5)|I never reported it, because I didn't own the gun, and the HP bullets aren't permitted here. Which is stupid.
[What are gun laws like in Argentina? In the US, it's generally pretty simple to legally own and carry a gun. Is that the case?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t4w77?context=5)|Quite the contrary. It's very, very hard to be a legal owner here, and even if you are, the laws are very strict ‚Äîand stupid‚Äî about concealed carry and permitted ammunition.
[~~Would you get in trouble for killing someone in self defence?~~   ~~Why did they attack you? Robbery? Rape?~~   Did you shoot to kill or injure?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3tcsuc?context=5)|I shot to neutralize, didn't really care about my target's health.
[What did you dislike about the Bersa Thunder 380?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t37cz?context=5)|I didn't dislike the Thunder 380, it just wasn't mine.
[Can civilians buy handguns easily?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t8ms8?context=5)|No, not at all. It's not impossible but they surely make it really hard.
[Where did this happen? Is this common?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t69jg?context=5)|It happened in [San Mart√≠n](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Mart%C3%ADn,_Buenos_Aires). It's not uncommon if you're stupid like I was and walk alone at night thinking that nobody will be in the streets, but it's not a particular unsafe place to live.
[How did you cope with the stress after the event? how long it took you to get completely recovered from the shock?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3tb7pm?context=5)|That's a good question. It took about four or five months until my life was practically the same as before the attack.  Before that, I had periods of sheer bliss for every trivial little thing that I could enjoy in my life (like being with friends, watching a movie at home, having a nice dinner, playing a new game), and serious worries about my safety (triple checking my doors many times a day, avoiding going outside, buying firearms, etc.). All in all, I think my life was improved and I ended up being much wiser after that incident.  **Edit:** Oh, it was *you*, and I just noticed! (n.n) Why didn't you tell me on Skype you were posting in my IAMA? /hug You sexy macfag! &lt;3.
[What a pervert that guy was‚Ä¶.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t4uyd?context=5)|To be completely honest, if I would be in the mood for sex, I wouldn't be answering questions in a IAMA.
[So, did you want to have sex?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t4uyd?context=5)|I know, total party-pooper of me to say that.
[You party pooper!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t52vu?context=5)|:(
[ where would you be in that case?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t7r0t?context=5)|Out there *poppin' a cap on some mofo's ass*, of course!
[Damn girl, what do you do with that ass?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t8n4k?context=5)|I make money.
[Do you think you would react the same way if put in the same situation again, especially knowing the .45 is no joke compared to .380?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t5xk0?context=5)|My dad's Colt 1911 is the best example. Such a big gun, and such a smooth shot.
[Was it a racial thing? Strikes me as odd that these randoms would stop you out of hate? Unless it is somehow racial.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3tos0h?context=5)|It's not about race, no. It's more about our socioeconomic differences. Some people hate you just because you have things that they never will.  Don't get me wrong, I believe their intentions were probably mundane: robbery, rape, who knows. I was talking about their *motivation* when I mentioned the hate.
[How many years ago was this? i've been to buenos aires recently, it's a lovely city, but many places seemed abandoned and scary. many weird people walking around and asking strange questions. do you think violence in buenos aires has grown recently?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2jlx?context=5)|Yes, but it's not really different from the US if you [check the statistics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate). You just have to take care of who you trust and where you go, like in every part of the world where you are a tourist.  Oh, and it was about 3 or 4 years ago.
[Do you feel that a 380 is an adequate defense round?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t86wv?context=5)|It was the ammo, because it was somewhat old. Winchester is widely regarded as a good manufacturer, so in this case it was just the user's fault.  I do not carry the Thunder 380 anymore, and I never knew what happened to the attacker I shot.  Personally, I'm all for stopping power, but of course, you have to be able to put the bullets in your targets. I would recommend acquiring the biggest caliber *that you can comfortably control*, and no more.
[Why do you post pictures of your tits? attention whore much?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t94gj?context=5)|You're so original, [jane408](http://www.quickmeme.com/First-Day-on-the-Internet-Kid/?upcoming)!

So, let me see if I understand: your suggestion would be that, if I have to share pictures of myself that millions of people will see, I should *purposefully take unflattering pictures* in order to... make a better impression on the Internet?

[You're boring.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3tlg8d?context=5)|And yet, you keep reading my comments and take the time to respond in anger.
[Your argument is invalid.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3tmhng?context=5)|It's not. You said you were ""done with me"" about two hours ago. And yet, you keep coming back.
[Can you please tell me where in my comments that i seem the least bit angry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3tmhng?context=5)|Really? Okey: you are aggressive and did nothing but post grammatically challenged *ad hominem* attacks; you clearly seem to have a fixation on my looks and didn't contribute anything to the discussion. I can only conclude that you're just a sad, spiteful and envious teenage girl, making a poor attempt at trolling, and [your post history](http://www.reddit.com/user/jane408) does nothing but confirm it, so I'm gonna ignore you from now on. Feel free to have the last word and post whatever childish insult you had prepared. Bye!
[Has this incident made your sister consider carrying a gun with her?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t5438?context=5)|No, she hates guns. Or more precisely, she is afraid of guns.
[She's so cute :)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t3jon?context=5)|I'm not gonna be an hypocrite about it and say that I don't enjoy the compliments. Every girl does, regardless of her age and line of work.
[When you say that you took advantage of some propositions, can you get more into that? Was it casting couch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t469j?context=5)|The option to do some stuff for a considerable material gain ‚Äîwhether that's money, gifts, job opportunities, etc.‚Äî is always present. Depending on your working environment, it's almost *mandatory*. The article is a recent case in which a somewhat known manager was arrested by the Interpol because he pimped his models. And nobody was surprised.
[Where did you shoot him, like in the head, tummy, etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t7cfi?context=5)|In the torso. I couldn't see the exact spot because he was wearing a baggy hoodie and it suddenly flapped with the impact.
[Are you from Argentina or were you just living there at the time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2zgy?context=5)|I was born in Argentina.  But my family came from Europe; my grandparents, from my mom's side, are German and Russian. From my dad's side, both grandparents are Italian.
[German, huh?   When did they come over from Germany?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t84ww?context=5)|Like so many Germans, during WWII.
[Ah ok. Well I'm glad you made it out of that encounter okay. In a crisis you revert to the lowest level of training you have mastered, not the highest level of training you ever practiced. Is it legal to have a duel with someone in Argentina if both people are registered blood donors or is that just an urban legend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t3211?context=5)|And that's the first time I heard that urban legend about duels.

I am nearing the end of my undergrad and am applying for internships this week. I am trying to get an idea of what the climate is out there, in the Big 4, in smaller firms, in industry, etc. I am trying to figure out where I want to work, and I can't believe I've come this far without thinking to ask people what its like to be gay in the business world. I've been more concerned with OMG TAX OR AUDIT?!

I will also be doing interviews soon, and while I don't feel the need to let people know when I meet them that I am gay (because who cares right?), I also don't want to lie or find myself in a negative work culture. My assumption is that people are professional and its not a big deal, but I still would like to hear the experiences of others. 

so again...

* any thoughts on if its better to be at a big 4 or a smaller firm?

* any idea if any get-to-know-you questions will come up in interviews?

* should I just be vague and not offer ""unnecessary"" information, or should I be casual and mention my partner of 4 years?

* am I being ridiculous for even asking these questions?

thanks reddit, hope to get some responses :)"

I am doing well, but I would like to do other programming related stuff on the side to broaden my knowledge. I know a bit of Java so I am wondering whether I should focus on learning data structures and algorithms using the language (there'll be a course on that next quarter), another option I was thinking of was doing programming problems on websites like project euler and programming praxis, or I could just take one of the online courses at udacity.

I know that learning is an ongoing process, but I am wondering what will improve my programming skills while also being useful in the real world. I will be doing an internship this summer as well.

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!"

q1lo9,140,2012-02-22,It's the little things (differences between living in the US and Germany),leechnerd,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/q1lo9/its_the_little_things_differences_between_living/,"I'm an American and I've been living in Germany for nearly a year and a half now. Life here in Germany isn't really that much different for me from life in the US. Most of the differences really are just tiny or little things that I've gotten used to and/or take for granted.

Here are some of them, maybe some Americans/Germans would find it interesting, especially cause I see some posts asking about what it's like over here. These aren't meant to be taken too seriously or as a definitive guide or anything, just my take on them.

**Home**

Windows. They open in two ways; tilt it back from the top to let in air, or swing it open from the side to open the whole thing. In the US, they slide to the side.

I'm not sure if closets physically built into the room are common here; people just have wardrobes. In the US, every room I can think of has a closet built into some section of the wall with sliding or deal doors.

**Groceries**

Shopping carts are locked and require a deposit to unlock it. Shopping carts in the US are free to take. The ones here can also be pushed in all directions (i.e., left and right too), while in the US you can only push them forward and backward. This was the strangest thing to get used to IMO.

Eggs come in cartons of 6, or cartons of 10. Why not 12? Who knows. Eggs are also not washed here, so don't be surprised if you see dried feathers stuck to the side of the egg. In the US they come in cartons of 6 (I think), 12, or more, and are washed.

Bags cost money, so people generally bring their own bags or backpacks. In the US, bags are free and plentiful, and are way thinner.

Americans are used to looking for milk in the refridgerator. You can find such milk in the fridge here too, but I'd say most people buy this ""utra-pasteurized"" milk which come in cardboard cartons and is unrefridgerated. Unopened, it can last ages, but once opened, of course you put it in the fridge. I find this milk tastes much better. Milk also comes in 1.5% and 3.5%.

I've seen refrigerator packages of food such as ""American Hotdogs"" which is like a hotdog in a bun with onions and ketchup prepackaged. (Side note, our ""American"" hotdogs are more like the sausages that come in the glass jars over here).

**Restaurants**

You're expected to seat yourself. You really do just walk in the door and find a table to sit down at and do it. In the US, you just stand by the entrance and just wait until a specific employee, usually a hostess, seats you.

At McDonalds (for example), you order your hamburgers and then you stand there in front of the cashier and wait. In the US, they'll take your name and call you when your food is ready, so you can go sit down or stand out of the way of people ordering.

Drinks do not come with free refills here. Most places in the US will happily refill your drink until you burst. In popular restaurants in the US they typically won't even ask if you want a refill and just bring you another cup when they see you're like 2/3 done with your current one. This applies to tea, soda, water, but not alcohol of course.

Here the waiters typically won't ever ""bother"" you. They'll just take your order, bring you your food, and when it looks like you're done eating they come and ask if you're finished. In the US, they're more personal and come by every so often to ask how it tastes, if they could bring you anything (e.g., more sauce), if you want to try anything else, deserts, etc.

**Entertainment**

You can order, pick and reserve your seats at the movie theater online, so it's pointless to show up to the theater earlier than the starting time. In the US, most theaters have first-come first-serve seating, so for popular movies people will typically show up hour(s) early to wait in line to get a good seat.

**New** Something I find hilarious is [Tanzverbot](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzverbot#Stille_Tage). There are some days in Germany where dancing is actually forbidden (actually what they mean is that clubs can not be open for dancing). On Good Friday in every state dancing is expressly forbidden. I guess you should instead go to church or something.

**Cultural**

One thing I find strange is that at a job, when *you're* leaving (on good terms), *you* bring a cake to work and share with everybody. When I left my internship back in the US, my coworkers brought *me* a cake to work.

**Other**

What Americans know of as the ""first floor,"" the Germans know of as the ""ground floor."" What Germans know of as the ""first floor,"" the Americans know of as the ""second floor."" I am never going to *not* instinctively press 1 whenever I get in an elevator to go down :(.

German (and really, the rest of the world) paper is size ""A4."" US paper is size ""letter"" aka ""8.5 x 11."" A4 paper is a bit taller and skinner than US letter paper.

These are just the things I can think of at the moment. I can post more or answer some questions too if anyone has some."

I did a physics-engineering dual degree program. Basically, I will end up with a degree in physics (as well as electrical engineering), but took a bit of a shortcut by double-dipping with overlapping course requirements.

Thus, the only real physics electives I've taken are optics, classical mechanics, and a modern physics class.  I've also taken a few ""physics lite"" engineering classes, such as semiconductors and E&amp;M.

I just got a physics (neutrinos, specifically) research job, though, and it is so cool. SO COOL. I am flying solo on a project that I (and my advisor) think might end up with some very noteworthy results, the kind of paper that might actually get me somewhere with my quasi-imposter physics degree. It's unclear exactly how long the work will take me to complete, but this Monday my advisor suggested I put in time this summer.

The next day, I was offered a summer internship for a semiconductor company. Like many engineering internships, it involves pay that is very difficult to refuse. I support myself financially and money is always tight - this would solve all my problems, but condemn any dream that I had of a career in physics.

I'm into my second week as an intern at an IT consulting firm, and they are having me do some changes to their in-house IT infrastructure. I've been helping them migrate from Perforce to Gerrit/git as a versioning and review system, and I think that I've got almost everything planned out the way I want it to, and have found resources for most of the things I want to do.

Gerrit needs to integrate with Jenkins, Jira and Fisheye, and all of those things have plugins ready. And most of the integration with git is done through SSH with RSA keys. 

However, the company infrastructure uses CAS and ProxyPass to enable single-sign-on sessions, and I haven't been able to find any good material on how to get gerrit to authenticate with a CAS cookie or anything like that. 

I've found anecdotal evidence that mod_auth_cas for Apache should work (through there being bug reports on it, heh), but no real HOWTO. Does anybody here have any pointers? 

Should I just go at it from the other way around, and read up on how both CAS and gerrit integrates with Apache, and then build a custom solution?


Thanks."

*(I heard this subreddit relies on a certain suspension of disbelief, but this is an actual true story that I first submitted to reddit a while ago, and now in the comment linked above.)*

================

(...) Warning: explicit. The following story is 100% true. (...)

I was 23 years old with the same condition -  phimosis. Not as severe as some of the pictures you see online, but there was also this pinching feeling when I had sex, so I decided to get circumcised.

The doctor had told me to relax, it would be a relatively painless procedure and I could walk home from the hospital after less than an hour of surgery. So I walked into the OR optimistically.

Turns out, the procedure hurts quite a bit. For anesthesia, they stuck a huge syringe into my penis 4 times. Each time felt like... well, a big needle being stuck into your penis. When they started cutting, I still had a lot of feeling down there. The feeling when they cut off the foreskin was... how can I describe it? The pain itself wasn't as bad as the knowledge that what you felt was a part of your body slowly being severed. Horrible. Then they started sewing me together and kind of folding and fusing together the skin-- how exactly it works, I couldn't see. It hurt a lot. It hurt a lot in my *penis*, and the awareness of that made the time ten times worse.

When they were done, the bleeding wouldn't stop. The doctor mentioned that I took unusually long to stop bleeding and asked me whether I had taken any aspirin or something earlier. I didn't. Well, they put my penis into a tight bandage and sent me home saying the pain would stop soon.

It didn't. 

Soon, it started to hurt really, really badly. They hadn't even given me a painkiller. It was terrible. At the that time, I actually did an AMA ""I am a 23 yo male who just got circumcised"" or something. It never made the front page though. And I had no idea the worst was yet to come.

At the time, I had just met a girl that would become my new girlfriend. Despite the mess in my pants, I met her a few evenings in a row. And we would make out. And I would get an erection.

I had never known this kind of pain. Every time I got turned on, it was torture. My penis would also start bleeding into the bandages, which I would have to change several times a day. Sometimes they would bleed through my pants and I didn't notice in time, then looking down in public to discover I had red spots between my legs. And yet, the worst was still to come. 

I pulled through the make-out session with my girlfriend-to-be like a champ. The pain got a bit better over the course of a few days. The bleeding would become less frequent. I later learned I was never supposed to bleed at all. To conquer the bleeding, I always wrapped my penis in toilet paper as well as putting bandage-pads into my shorts. Keep this in mind.

At first I had evaded sex with my new girlfriend, but as time progressed it was hard to make up excuses, and I told her the embarrassing truth a week after surgery. She was okay with not being able to have sex for another 3 weeks. But we still made out a lot, and in the heat of the moment she would sometimes dry-hump me a bit.

One night when she was dry-humping me, I felt a sudden sharp pain in my penis. Keep in mind that that happened all the time when I moved the wrong way or accidentally brushed against something with my crotch, so it wasn't unusual. Still I told my girlfriend to stop and we went to sleep.

The next morning when I woke up, I felt extremely weak, and my crotch was aching heavily.

When I pulled back the sheets, my entire sheets and shorts were SOAKED with blood. Blood everywhere. The bed was full of it.

I let out a loud ""AAAAAAAH!"" and jumped up, running to the bathroom. As I was running down the hallway, blood was dripping from my shorts to the floor, leaving red spots on the carpet. 

In the bathroom, I frantically tore down my shorts. The bandage pads fell off, and I was looking at my penis, completely wet and red from blood, and what looked like chunks of torn skin hanging down all over it.

Those were the worst few seconds of my life. My heart thumped and I felt sick. My girlfriend, who had woken up from the screams and followed me to the bathroom burst in, looked at my penis and screamed.

Then, thankfully, I realized that I wasn't looking at chunks of torn skin. I had forgotten the toilet paper wrapped around my penis. It had soaked up the blood and hung down thick and heavy, looking like flaps of skin. I yelled ""it's only paper, it's only paper"" to calm down my girlfriend, and pulled it off. Still, underneath it my penis was torn and bleeding. Turns out, the seams from my circumcision had ripped when my girlfriend dry humped me. I had went to sleep without noticing. The tightly stuffed paper and pads had held back much of the bleeding, but still I had woken up to the bloodbath in my sheets. As I stood in the bathroom, the shorts and pads removed, blood dripped down from my penis at a steady rate, going *drip drap drip drop* and leaving a puddle of blood on the floor between my legs.

I yelled at my girlfriend to go home and let me take care of it, and went to get dressed to go to the hospital. Since I was in a hurry, I only threw on old pants and a shirt and some sandals.

I'm a European student in a big city, so it's not out of the ordinary for me not to have a car. I got on the next metro train en route to the hospital. Halfway through the ride, I catch a little girl staring at me and whispering something to her mom. The mom is looking at me, and quickly pulls her daughter away.

I look down and see that there's blood running out of the legs of my pants, all over my feet and into the sandals. 

I only had to drive for two stations. Then I got off and had to walk the last 300 meters to the hospital. As I walked, more blood ran down my leg and made squishy sounds in my sandals. Some blood dropped onto the pavement. I left a trail of blood behind me on the sidewalk. 

When I reached the ER, the nurse on duty was quite unphased. They let me wait a few anxious minutes. Then I was called into surgery.  The doctor asked me whether there was anything unusual she should know. I told her that the last doctor had noted that my bleeding stopped unusually slow. She dismissed that tidbit and went on.

I had to go through the same horrible procedure that I was so glad about never having to go through again, again. They stuck a big needle into my penis, five times this time. They started to sew the torn skin under the head of my penis back together.

That's when the young doctor noticed what I had already told her: The bleeding was strong, and it wouldn't stop. She went on. Bleeding went on strong as ever. Blood flowing out of my penis all over it,  and over her fingers.

Now she freaked out. She was like a junior doctor or something, an intern? resident? I don't know. She refused to go on with the surgery and used a phone to call for the chief of medicine to take over. The chief of medicine was occupied with a heart surgery. Only after a while, she reluctantly went on with the procedure. 

They finished up the sewing part and wrapped a bandage *way* too tight around my penis. (I was slightly incontinent for the next few days that I had to wear it). 

They sent me home, again without painkillers, and again telling me not to have sex for another month. For the next week, the pain was worse this time around.

And when I had sex for the first time after the month was over, I was terrified that a seam would rip again every second through.

So there you go, that's my story. The moral of it: Treat your dick like porcelain, OP. Don't dry hump. Don't have sex earlier than advised. It could go horribly wrong."

q17c0,8,2012-02-22,I felt a bit down today; GF shot down my feelings,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/q17c0/i_felt_a_bit_down_today_gf_shot_down_my_feelings/,"Me - 22/m
Her - 20/f

Been dating for little over a year.

Today I had a little of a breakdown about my weight. I was getting dressed and looking at myself in the mirror, I just did not like the way I looked in a dress shirt. I went to the internship fair yesterday in the same getup and I had no problem with how I looked; I felt confident. Today was different. I'm usually not sensitive about my weight (I've been doing something about it, I'm pretty active, lost 60lbs already) but it just hit me for no reason. 

I texted my girlfriend how disgusting I felt and looked and I just wanna crawl back into bed. She responds with ""I didn't know I was dating a 12 year old girl."" This really hurt me, because the person I trust a lot just shot down my feelings. I felt crushed. I told her I was sensitive about it today and that I felt hurt. She says while she knows the feeling, it's still childish of me, and that it's all her fault that I'm feeling this way. When I asked for a little support, she said all I'm doing is whining, and she'll talk to me later.

This isn't the first time. When I feel down and go to her for support or someone to talk to, I get told I'm a child or immature for having these feelings, and she won't talk to me for hours. After ignoring me for hours, she'll come around and actually talk, but will not be apologetic. It's starting to take a toll on me because I feel I'm losing a support pillar, and I can't trust anyone with how I feel. When I tell her that it's not right she does this, she gets very defensive and says it's all her fault. 

Am I overreacting about this, or is she just being insensitive? Any and all input will be appreciated. 

**Edit:** I should add that I rarely get upset about my weight. In fact this is the first time I felt weird about it in at least 4 years. I am a very confident guy who knows what he is. I get the fat jokes from my roommates everyday, and I deal with it because I know I'm chubby and they're teasing. Also to add on the support thing: I'm usually the one who emotionally supports my SO when she's down. The past month or so she's gotten really upset over silly things, but I did not tell her they were silly or stupid, but rather I comforted her and told her silly jokes and played with her hair, or sent her cute pictures. It kinda sucks when I have a bad day (which is very rarely), she's nowhere to be found emotionally, and shuts me out. "

q13qu,0,2012-02-22,My SO's father treats him like shit and it's pissing me off. Afraid it's gonna affect our relationship now. Help!,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/q13qu/my_sos_father_treats_him_like_shit_and_its/,"27/F here, he's 24/M. Together 3 years.

Little back story, I have worked my hands to the bone since I was 15 years old. I have no college education, I have supported myself all these years and lived on my own a lot longer than him. I come from an extremely poor family and I am the only child who has moved out of the over crowded house. My other siblings live at home and help pay bills. I've been on my own since 17, lived a rather traumatic young adulthood.

My boyfriend comes from a wealthy family, has some college education and during the 3 years we've been together he was going to school. He's lived a really good life, except his dad has always put him on the back burner and has generally ignored him. He's never held a job while we have been together cause his mom just gave him money, basically. He's done 2 unpaid internships for like...2 months. In fact, I lived with him and his parents for a year and finally had enough of it and moved out 2 months ago, took him with me.

His dad is the money maker. Man has millions of dollars. I have no relationship with him, we don't really speak. I think he treats his son like shit, loves his son in law more than him and his daughter gets whatever she wants. His parents have just a fucked up, bizarre marriage (one sleeps on the couch, the other in the bed). Recently my SO got his associates in science...and then told his dad he didn't want to be a doctor. His dad wanted him to be a doctor and thats not what he wanted to do. He wants to be a chef. His dad says ok, cool. Tells him to find a culinary school, he'll pay for it.

His dad owns several businesses and my SO has a sister who is my age with 2 kids and she's married. The sister's husband works for his dad and his dad loves this dude way more than his own kid. He buys his daughter and son in law everything. He helped purchase their first home, paid for both of them to go to school (they both dropped out after a year), pays for the grand kids ""school"" (it's fucking daycare...school for kids under 2 my ass), bought them a huge TV, grill, furniture...whatever they want. My SO is luckier than most people, though...thanks to his mom. His mom slips him cash when he visits and runs errands for her. She makes sure that he's got a car, his cell phone is paid for and his insurance. 

A few weeks ago I got on my SO's ass about school (I'm paying our rent, bills, etc the money his mom gives him is used for gas in his truck and whatever he wants to spend it on like helping out with groceries). Eventually in my eyes, his dad is gonna find out mom is slipping him money and cut it off real quick. So he asks his dad if he can start school. His dad tells him ""Sure, but you're paying for your own school."" My SO said ""but...dad...you said you would pay for it so I'm not drowning in debt from loans."" His father said: ""I never agreed to pay for culinary school. No."" I hit the fucking roof. He told my SO, his mom, his uncle...and said in front of me that he would pay for it and he totally welched on his offer. My SO tried to tell him he did and his father is one of those guys where his word is law, it doesnt matter how many people heard him say it...he's right and everyone else is wrong. You can't argue with him or change his mind because he does not cave in.

It's gotten to the point where I hate the guy. I can't stand him, I don't want to be around him and I resent him. I don't understand why he treats his son like shit. He has made fun of him in front of the whole family during the holidays, he has no interest in meeting my family (my parents invited him to a birthday dinner for me they scraped and saved for and he turned them down), he purposely will pick a fight with you about anything if you disagree with him (I watched my SO's cousin fly at my SO's father in a rage over a debate about science and the guy is working on his masters, my SO's father has no college education), he has a just complete asshole personality to anyone who doesnt agree with him. I absolutely love my SO's mom and I want to continue seeing her when I can...but not with his dad around.

I just don't know what to do. I want my guy to go to school NOW but he refuses to get loans. He wants to save up for school...but he's been supposedly job hunting and nothing has come of it. I'm paying all our bills plus my car note, full coverage insurance and my cell phone on barely $10 an hour. His dad has the money and won't help his kid. I feel like he resents his son and I don't know why. We moved out because I was sick of living there, the drive was much longer for me to and from work and being around the bizarre marriage was putting stress on us. His mom hides things and tells us about it and his dad is never home. His mom got real sick around the holidays and we wanted to take care of her but his dad kept pushing our help aside like we're bumbling idiots so I said fuck this, I gotta get out of this crazy house.

TL;DR: My SO's father is a rich asshole who refuses to help his kid, but favors the other one. He agreed to pay for his school and then backed out of the deal. I'm broke and want my guy to start his future ASAP. Don't want to be in another relationship again where I'm the financial support. What do I do? "

q11tk,3,2012-02-22,Not supernatural... but almost worse somehow,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/q11tk/not_supernatural_but_almost_worse_somehow/,"In 2005, I participated in a quarter-long study abroad program that placed me in an internship in a Middle Eastern city in Qatar. The city was quite reminiscent of Dubai, though not nearly as opulent. I worked on the top floor of a skyscraper, and I was awed by how similar the office life seemed to that found in the States, even as I blundered through numerous cultural differences. Despite a few embarrassments, it was a positive experience overall - until the day I quit in terror and raced for the first flight home.

The first few days at my internship, I marveled at the view from the high windows. I could see all the way to the dusty horizon‚Ä¶ though, for some reason, looking for any period of time sparked a tinge of dizziness. I began avoiding the view, though the vertigo still seemed to come and go.

Often, I found myself growing nauseous for no reason. I eventually hit on motion sickness pills as a cure, also taking up constant caffeination as its own solution to the drowsiness side-effects. I did my job well, but every day was a struggle of conflicting highs and lows‚Ä¶ so when I noticed objects on my desk changing positions overnight, or curious shivering sensations running through me as I worked, I suspected nothing.

I remember that day well. The sky was a horrid grey-brown, and visibility dropped as a sandstorm rolled in. By that time, I was no stranger to the weather, and I thought nothing of it‚Ä¶ until I got to work, and found myself inexplicably dizzier than ever. Right at the edge of the windows, I happened to notice the sand-dimmed Sun moving up and down.

It was then I realized that *the building was moving* - swaying in the wind. A hellish nervous energy gripped me as I tried to ignore it and work. I told myself that it was designed to sway, that everything would be fine, even as the blasting wind against the high windows grew to a dull roar. I watched in apprehension as a pen rolled back and forth across my desk in time with the nauseating sensation of movement. It felt like I was in a car turning sharply back and forth, or a rolling ship on the ocean. Nobody else seemed worried‚Ä¶

We heard something in the distance explode, and I followed my coworkers‚Äô startled motions in time to see bits of an adjacent skyscraper‚Äôs communications tower crunch with the sound of rending metal. I gripped my desk with white knuckles as I realized *I could actually see the other building swaying back and forth* like a tree in the wind.

The gale reached a crescendo, making it impossible to hear my coworkers‚Äô frantic words‚Ä¶ and my desk and chair slid an inch toward the windows, jerking me forward. A few terrifying seconds later, they lurched the other direction. Almost overwhelmed with nausea, fear, and helplessness, I fought a powerful urge to throw up.

As all the desks and chairs slid away and impacted the windows, I panicked. Stumbling through debris and clutter, I ran for the stairwell. The lights inside were out, but I ran down them in the darkness for a seeming eternity, fighting the building‚Äôs sway and praying that the stairs hadn‚Äôt broken or collapsed. It felt an amazing relief to rush into the abrasive sandy winds outside. I literally ran all the way home, somehow finding my way with near zero visibility.

Later, when I calmed down, I e-mailed my manager explaining my concern with the building‚Äôs safety. His response chilled me to the bone:

*Yes, lowest bidder construction. Don‚Äôt worry, you get used to it. It happens frequently.*

I replied with my resignation and booked the next flight home. Even years later, I still have nightmares about the experience, and I watch for news of building collapses. There‚Äôs been quite a few, but not mine‚Ä¶ not yet."

I became intrigued by every new person I encountered and their individual spirit and drive. During the summer of 2010, I acquired a Citizens‚Äô Humanity job as a field staff. During my employment, I communicated with a vast array of people every day. This allowed my interpersonal skills and experience to flourish dealing with customers. I have learned how to mirror and relate to customers allowing me to understand the consumers‚Äô mentality. 

What initially sparked my interest in the field of Mass Communications, whilst taking a course for Broadcast Announcing, was my Professor who informed me that I had a knack for this field. This led me to pursue my second major, Mass Communication. To follow up on my interest, I have worked as a promotion manager for liveLIVE!; a musical booking agency for grassroot artists. As a senior, I took on two majors and an internship which shows how great of an interest I had for Mass Communication along with my dedication and commitment. As you can see by my resume, I handled public relations by professionally attending musical events where I communicated with the public and handled merge tables. I networked through social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter along with the company‚Äôs website to communicate the artists performing along with their genre and style and where and when the venue would be held and the admission fee. I promoted the artists by blogging, face to face interviews and visual displays for my internship. I was also in charge of producing a monthly calendar along with attracting new patrons to the venues by handing out handbills and conversing. 

I feel that employment with NBC Universal INC would be the next logical step in the development of my goal to work for a major network company full-time. The well established Sales Assistant position would provide me with an invaluable experience to compliment my dual major from State University College at Oneonta. The skills that I have obtained in the classroom as a Mass Communications major have led me to use communication skills in a global context. The experience that I have obtained at my internship would allow me to be part of the NBC Universal‚Äôs global team working together with others, with the goal to seize greater opportunities presented within the company. I believe that I would succeed in the company‚Äôs exciting and motivating environment and my strong work ethic, impressive interpersonal  and communication skills as well as my ability to quickly execute decisions and problem solve would make me a valuable asset to your company. 
	I am available for an interview at your convenience and look forward to meeting with you.

On the off chance one of you is a lawyer, knows a lawyer, knows of a hidden jewel of internship opportunities, or something equally awesome, I'd love to hear about it.

I have had people tell me I am a liar about this history, that I did not do any of this. Do you have any ideas on how I should present this or what I should do?

I grew up in a machine shop/garage working with my father on engine repair for cars and trucks. (I can repair anything.)

In the 90s I was a body piercer and manufactured titanium, niobium, and stainless steel body jewelry. I used medical implant standards according to ASTM standards at the time, and implemented CDC standards for universal precautions into my practice. I was one of the founders of the Association of Professional Piercers and consulted with National medical boards and organisations including the CDC and the AMA. 

I have a passion for computers and in the mid nineties I had my first experience with Linux. I began installing Linux on everything. The server side of Linux, what happened behind the scenes for web pages fascinated me, so I began setting up servers and firewalls for companies. I attended Devry and worked for a company doing video monitoring of day care centers to ease the minds of parents that had to abandon their kids all day while living in the cubical. 

I had to move back to my hometown to help with a family member that was ill, so I changed course and adapted to working conditions in that area. I took a job in the kitchen of an Italian restaurant. I had no idea how much I had picked up from my Grandmother in the kitchen, as she was a chef for 40 years running some pretty big kitchens, and I swiftly shot through the ranks. Within 6 months I was the second chef and kitchen manager. I proceeded to work in this kitchen and a few others for most of the 2000s. Except for a year in which I wrote, distributed, and published a monthly tabloid magazine. 

The economy was getting pretty bad so I went back to school, doing what I loved when I was in High school but never had the chance to be properly trained. I have finished a Bachelors of Fine Arts for painting and sculpture. I took an intern-ship in Italy doing art restoration for the Fall of 2011. I learned some Italian, and discovered many little facts about art from the Etruscans down to Baroque artists and their techniques that I am incorporating into my work. 

Oh yeah, I drove cab, ran a cab company for a while in 1992-1993 when my grandfather-inlaw was sick, and again in 2000 after moving back to help that family member. I drove school bus for a year and a half, but I don't have the CDL on my licence any more -- the medical exams were too expensive once I was no longer with the district.

I think that is everything, thanks for reading.

I graduated last June with a BS in Clinical Nutrition from UCD. It was difficult to find a job in the Nutrition field and harder to continue my studies into a Dietetic Internship program for a RD credential. 

After half a year of no luck in getting a Full Time or Part Time per diem, I picked up a part time job as a Support Staff for a local ambulatory surgical center. Now they have transferred me to a clerical job with more hours. And I am slowly sliding away from what I have studied for.

This job is very steady, but I feel I need to keep trying to stay with the nutrition field. I am still an AND member and keep up with the news. But reading journals at leisure can only keep me in the field for so long as I slowly progress away from it.



**I am seeking** for a Short Hour Nutritionist/Diet Clerk/Dietetic Assistant job for weekends. My goal is not only to earn a little more cash, but stay connected to the Nutrition field. 

I have various experience from laboratory and human research to surgical sanitation, and complex data entry. 

A lot of the dietetic or nutritionist job are per diem or short hours. I am hoping someone on reddit may help me.

Through several internships and academic projects, I have developed a strong set of engineering skills. During my internship at NASA Ames Research Center, I developed a set of MATLAB and Simulink models to facilitate real-time analysis of disturbance forces and torques during orbit. I was also tasked with integrating these models into the main Simulink model for the orbiter, providing more accurate data for exact position and attitude during simulation. My supervisor commended me for my ability to take charge of the project and my problem-solving skills, as well as my ability to work with many different people within our team to accomplish my goals on time.

I developed leadership and teamwork skills through my involvement in academic projects such as this previous semester, where I participated on Carnegie Mellon‚Äôs Google Lunar X-Prize team.  My team of four undergraduate students was tasked with developing a trajectory controller for the descent sequence of the lander. Throughout the semester this project required a large amount of personnel organization and interfacing between our group, the course teaching assistants, and the professor. In order to maintain high levels of productivity I constantly identified future objectives and subdividing tasks in order to ensure the project was completed.

I am looking for any full-time positions available around the Bay Area. If you have any questions or wish to see a resume, please PM me. Thank you for your consideration.

I'm in a bit of a predicament right now as to which opportunities I should pursue as an undergraduate geology major.  So, I have applied to a couple of research internships, one which is REU-sponsored, and another that focuses on seismology.  I have also applied to an internship with an environmental remediation company in my hometown that uses geotechnical/environmental techniques to solve various projects  (Superfund projects, etc.).

Now the env. remediation internship requires a 40-HR Hazwoper training course, which my small liberal arts college doesn't offer to pay for (~$400). 

So I have decided against taking that course which would give me a solid chance at landing that internship.  Also, if I took the course and then got into a research internship, I didn't want to take the course and not have the training apply to anything.

As a Sophomore (rising junior in the summer) I am hoping to be accepted into one of the research internships, as I have experience doing first-hand geology research with an advisor at my institution. 

SO,

**In terms of getting into graduate school, where I will be studying the geosciences, do you think I made the right decision with forgoing the ""job"" internship and pursuing a research internship?**
**Will Hazwoper training now really be beneficial when applying to jobs/internships in graduate school?**

Upon researching your internship program, I found that intern positions are restricted to undergraduates/grad students and law students. Considering that an undergraduate's major is stated to be inconsequential, I am puzzled as to why applicants are required to hold a college education at all. As an open minded and rational individual, I have made an informed and prudent decision not to expend my time, resources, money or motivational drive pursuing the so-called ticket to success we know as a college degree. I am deeply disturbed by a great many facets of our higher education system in this country. Not only do I feel that it has become the biggest scam and most corrupt, self serving institution in the history of society, driven entirely by greed and upheld almost unilaterally by the media and powers that be, but I feel also that the necessity of every person to hold a degree is a fallacy which escapes scrutiny, no matter the integrity of the system which grants it. We live in an information world, where a plurality of individuals carry with them daily a smart phone connected to a data network capable of delivering in mere seconds the answer to nearly any question, or the details of any scientific subject, historical event, mathematical theory, philosopher's works, and so on. As a person with an active, inquisitive mind always seeking the power of knowledge, I spend considerable time researching various subjects of interest. These interests vary from scientific studies and reports, the moral justification of law and role of government in a free society, history of American politics and government policy, theories and beliefs relating to ethical philosophy, human psychology, the human brain, our solar system and universe, and a great many others. I pursue this knowledge because I respect it and desire it, not because I must memorize it long enough to pass a test in order to obtain a degree which is supposedly requisite to being productive and successful. It is my sincere hope that your astute organization will reconsider it's policy of barring a great deal of brilliant young minds from opportunities to advance the noble cause of liberty, and that you allow applicants a chance to be selected based upon their merits instead of just ""qualifications"" issued by a system bent on extracting every last penny it possibly can from the unsuspecting masses. I may not hold a degree, but I see that as no valid basis on which to automatically discount me, or anyone else who shares my outlook, from consideration for a position which may well suit us in many ways. I respectfully thank you for your time and consideration.
 
PS: My decision to forgo college was made even with full military benefits which would cover nearly all of the costs incurred. I am continually told that it is foolish of me not to take advantage of these programs, but I have made a decision based on principle that I will not use taxpayer money to pay for something I am not willing to spend my own money on. In many ways, they are right in saying I should use the benefits afforded to me. It would be much easier to drink the kool aid and do as everyone else does, but I am stubborn and proud of it."

&gt;Dear (Name of Person Reading My App): 


&gt;I have been actively seeking an internship opportunity that will utilize my experience and training in writing, editing, and travel in East Asia, and I am thrilled to apply to be one of your global news interns. I graduated from the University of Derp as a National Merit Scholar in December, 2011. I know that my education and professionalism will help make news productions in the form of text, video, and photos run smoothly and efficiently. 


&gt;My university education as an English major was tailored to making me a consistently excellent writer and editor. I had extensive training at the University of Derp Writing Lab to provide proofreading for graduate and undergraduate students, which prepares me for interacting with a diverse group of co-workers and interview subjects. I assist my employer in updating her blog. I also have a Chinese minor and am passionate about East Asian social issues after I spent time studying abroad in China. I stay up-to-date on news from that part of the world and on most domestic affairs. 


&gt;I am enthusiastic about traveling and would be very much interested in one of your news positions in an international city. I would love to visit London again, or to see a city like Seoul for the first time. 


&gt;My resume contains additional information about my qualifications and intersts. One of my favorite courses at the University of Derp was ""Issues in Contemporary Cultural Studies,"" taught by Dr. Vincent Leitch, the editor of the Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism. He kindly wrote my letter of recommendation on short notice, and you will find it enclosed with my resume and supplementary materials.


&gt;I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to apply for this position. If you have any questions, please contact me via phone or by email. I look forward to hearing from you.

I've been stuck in a rut for the better part of 7 months, and I have exhausted damn near every viable career option.  There have been phone screenings, Skype interviews, and there was even an offer for an internship, but I couldn't make the deadline for work because I was in the middle of moving.  Funny side note, for one Skype interview, I pointed out a flaw in the preliminary test they issued, and the recruiter/CEO became so embarrassed/frustrated once he realized the stupidity of the question that he shut his laptop (He arrived at my explanation when he tried to walk me through the question).  Anyhow, I don't have the tools to further my portfolio because they were provided by my school, and I can't afford them since I don't have a job.  

My folks want me to go back to school, but I don't know if I'll get into grad school because my school raped my GPA because the ridiculous standards, which no one seems to comprehend...My last two years were where I did best too, but no one cares about that for some reason.  Basically, it looks like I'll end up going to a community college for some course work.  Don't get me wrong, that is fine, but this transition is just eating away at my soul because I reviewed some of the course curriculum and I already understand everything that they are trying to explain...Are there some other options that I've just neglected?

The following is a list of things we, the young, graduated, and unemployed wish you knew.

We are not lazy.  We have done what all the articles say, and we have treated looking for a job like a job.  We have applied for more than 100 positions at this time.  We have had interviews, phone interviews, follow ups, you name it. None of them have panned out.  

Please do not look at the gap of employment in my r√©sum√© as a reason not to hire us.  If anything, it is a reason to hire us.  We appreciate the value of a job, and certainly more than we did after we‚Äôd been searching for a month.  We are not just working hard to find a job, but are willing to work just as diligently to keep a job.  We are the people that will go above and beyond and will never give up.

Offering only entry level positions that are internships and not extending internships to non-students hurts.  We will prove our willingness to work while working for free.  But you have to let us.  75% of positions we come across that are not internships or part-time expect 3-5 years of experience.  To bring you that, we need your help, and we are willing to be molded.

For those businesses that take the time to reply to applications, thank you.

**Background:** I'm a PhD student in computer sciences, specializing in artificial intelligence - specifically bioinformatics. The only other member of my family to go past a bachelor's degree is an aunt who I see roughly every three years and unfortunately don't talk to much. My parents are college-educated but my dad works as a handyman/carpenter and my mom is a social worker. Nothing even remotely related to what I'm doing.

**Dilemma:** And no I'm not going to make dilemmonade.

My advisor gave me the ""you need to figure out your post-PHD career path"" talk yesterday, with a deadline of next Wednesday. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I WANT TO DO WITH MY LIFE. My general choices are:

- Professor at large research university. Research-heavy. Will involve spitting out as many papers as possible in the next few years. I have one in revise/resubmit stage right now.
- Professor at smaller university. Teaching-heavy. Will involve refocusing on teaching classes in my department (which I have done and do enjoy).
- Researcher in the industry. Also research-heavy, but emphasis would be on getting internships in the industry rather than focusing on the academic sphere.

Has anyone gone (or have parents or close relatives who have gone) any of these routes? Please help. I seriously have no idea what to do."

Every firm I've looked at has asked for a resume, cover letter, and work samples combined in a single pdf of 5 MB max...how do I do this though?  5 MB seems like such a small size to fit everything in; is there a way of saving my files in a manner that would get them even smaller?  I've tried saving them as jpegs, which has made them smaller, but even then I can still only manage to get only one sample of work in the pdf before it goes over the 5 MB max.  I've thought about simply writing my cover letter in the body of my email to get a little more space for a work sample, but it's never that much space that I'm gaining.

So, I got into accounting because I was interesting in working on people's taxes. I graduated college a couple years ago with a degree in accounting and several upper level credits in taxation, and I did the VITA program in college and LOVED it. However, I've run into the typical catch-22 of not being able to find a position doing taxes because I don't have the requisite experience, yet I can't find a position to give me the experience in the first place. I did intern with a local CPA firm after college, but it was a short internship with no potential to hire and I felt like it didn't give me great experience in taxation. In the interim, I've been doing temp work in bookkeeping, but have not even touched taxes.

Now, the only ways I can see myself getting the experience is to 1. Somehow get a job with a CPA firm in their tax department, or 2. Get a job with a big name tax prep company like H&amp;R Block or Liberty Tax to get the experience, then move on from there.

My goal is to eventually get my EA or CPA designation, but I would like to get practical experience first.

Any suggestions on a course of action r/accounting? I am willing to work my ass off to do what I love - I just need some direction on how to work my ass off. All advice is welcome, even if its ""RRR YOU STAND NO CHANCE YOU ARE A LOST CAUSE MANOABOI!"""

Sorry to bother you all with an intern posting, but I trust redditors and would rather give this opportunity to you all rather than craigslist. 

I work for an Art Dept for a Production company in Culver City that makes Web Series. We're always filming multiples series and the production schedule is getting pretty busy, so we need an extra hand around to make movie magic. 

The perks:
-Union Crew
-Meals are provided
-Gas Reimbursed
-Actual Budgets
-Actors you may actually have heard of
-Most weekends off (This really means most all. There's only one saturday on our schedule and that's because of an extreme scheduling case.)
-The fun people that populate our Art Dept (Our production designer is scottish)
-Room for advancement for right person


Cons:
* No Pay (I'm sorry I know, but that's the only con I can think of)


What you'd be doing:
* Researching/sourcing props and dressing
* Making runs/pick-ups
* Assisting the Production Designer and Art Director
* Helping to dress and finish the sets
* Being awesome

I'm just looking for someone who is a fast learner and likes to do a good job. So if you think this is you, PM me with your information, or send it to wigscoarthiring@gmail.com. 

Cheers!

Edit: I am looking for a student, college credit can definitely be offered. I'm sorry that I neglected to post that originally.

q2mm3,1,2012-02-23,"My GF (of 2ish months), her ex(of 3 years) and me. Advice/Perspective Request.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/q2mm3/my_gf_of_2ish_months_her_exof_3_years_and_me/,"So I did some searching concerning my  problem/feelings and how I feel to see if there have been any relevant posts. Compared to what some other people have posted with their SO's ex in their relationship, perhaps my feelings are unnecessary and petty. I am really new to relationships and figured I would give posting a shot. I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to impart me with their logic and reasoning.... here it goes. 


I am 23, my gf (I'll call A) is 22. I met her about a year and a half ago when she was dating J, an acquaintance of mine. Sometimes I would hang out or go to the bars with J and his roommates, but we were never super close. I talked to A online and at school when I saw her and generally thought she was a great person. We would ride bikes together as we are both into road biking but I never thought anything more of it than just riding with a friend.


A and J had been dating for almost three years before they broke up last september. As we are all finishing our undergrads this year, A essentially broke up with J because (as she told me) she thought they didn't have a future together. [I have never heard of another reason but assume that there were other causes.] Anyways, A and I continued to talk a lot and I started to think something more could be there. I was very reluctant to push anything so I took my time trying to remain simply friends. She would always ask me to go out to the bars with her, go to parties with her, etc. I rarely obliged as I thought I would certainly lose control of myself if I was drunk around her and make a move. As time continued, we were hanging out more, but never in situations that could lead to hooking up. She seemed to be doing fine from her breakup with J and I had developed stronger feelings for her so one night I decided to go out with her and her roommates. We hooked up that night (as it was obvious we both wanted to) in mid November and have essentially slept together every night since then. We decided to make things official on new years. She is my first girlfriend I have loved, who has said she loves me, and who I genuinely want to spend all my time with. 


A told J that she had been hooking up with me in December (because she felt compelled to do so out of respect for him... I was in favor of the 'why does he need to know' option) which brought up a lot of hard feelings from J. J and I don't talk anymore as I know he resents me for being together with A. That doesn't concern me. Nonetheless, A and J remain friends in pretty close contact. When we go out at night, there is a good chance we run into J and his roommates. This happened once and was extremely uncomfortable for A and I. She can have a great time with him alone, but when I am involved, I hate the fact she feels we still have to hide being together in fear of running into J and his group of friends. 


I don't wish to insist that she stops talking to J, that seems irrational. I know she wants to remain friends as she isn't the burn bridges type but they text almost everyday and see each other outside of school perhaps once a week whether at a party or at a coffeeshop together. I guess it is weird for me that they remain in SUCH close contact, is this normal? I recently saw on her phone saying to him ""I keep on going back and forth about breaking up with you but think it is for the best."" It was very causally said in conversation but it really took me by surprise as she had told me she *was* over him and didn't love him anymore. I would never bring it up to her and say that I saw it on her phone, but feel very distraught and backseat because of it. (I brought up something I saw on her phone once along the lines of them hanging out. She wasn't pissed off I had read it, but asked that I respect the privacy of her conversations between her and friends, including J. I know I shouldn't have been looking at those messages, but whenever I see something like that, I can't help but think that my looking is ~~justified~~ probably causing more grief than if I just left it alone)


My own insecurities have taken a toll on me in the past when J and A would talk. I would tell her I feel left out of the picture and she would help talk me through it. I used to get really anxious if he texted her, but have since been able to more rationally cope with my feelings that doesn't imply increased heart rate. Though because she still talks to him so much and says things that she misses him (said to him back in Dec.) or is back and forth between breaking up but hinks its for the best (said last week) I still feel concerned about...something. ( I don't know what I'm concerned about myself, She tells me she loves me and I believe her, but don't know what my concern is ABOUT).  

Situational context: We have tickets to travel to europe for 3 weeks together after graduation and then she is moving away for a summer internship. After that she is going to grad school. I am also going to grad school(hopefully), but the closest locations to potential universities are 200 miles apart. I would love more than anything to stay together, but the most we have talked about is, ""if it is meant to happen, then it will"". I'm not sure how much I subscribe to that thought, I mean maybe, but it is hard to think about have an expiration date on the relationship with the first girl I have loved. It really is a discussion for after we hear back from grad schools. For now, we have tickets to europe together and I just hope she isn't texting J the entire time we are training through Switzerland. 

Sorry, I guess I don't have a solid question. More so I have used this as a platform to vent my concerns in hopes that someone can provide some sound advice (female and male) for a relationship newbie. 


TLDR: GF and her ex's history greatly overshadow our time together. Her talking to him gets me down because I feel left out and wish she would just forget about him, move on, and enjoy our time together.

I am 21 and she is almost 22!

To start with this, I had a relationship of 4 years with a girl who I thought I'm going to marry and to this day, I still want that. But, in those 4 years together she has lived abroad for atleast a year, maybe even longer. During that time we would only see eachother during summers, during the time that she needed to be here and for family related things.

But in those 4 years, she cheated on me, when she was in China. I believe cheating is a horrible thing to do, but, being me I forgave here. That being said, she lied to me saying that she didn't cheat for 9 months! In all that time I knew and asked her many times if she cheated on me, she profoundly kept saying no. After she did tell me she was surprised by my reaction, I didn't get mad, I didn't get anything, only thing I felt was utter disgust. She cheated on me because she missed my embrace, my touch and just male attention.

But fast forward to now, and why I am making this post is this: I want to be with her, I want to live with her and I want to have kids with her. She wants this as well but our situation is dire. She still lives abroad and works there for an important company. But her contract will run out in a month, meaning that she has to find a new job. And, she insist on getting a job in the country she is in now even though she wants to spent her entire life with me. I could go to her country and study there after this semester, but that being said I have to give up my fantastic social life, my wonderful friends, my job, my internship and my honors college. Just for her. The fact she doesn't want to go back to my country is that she really fucking hates it. She hates it here and I don't want her to feel that, just for me. 

But, now I have met this wonderful girl, who is also quite a lot older than I am (almost 25) and overall is a great assest to my life. But, as soon as she starts talking about a relationship I get scared, I get really, really fucking scared. This happend twice with others girls before I met her. It's just this endless loop of wanting to be with my ex, then being with a different girl and then crawl back to my ex about how much I miss her. It's just, my mind is full of fuck, I can't just comprehend what to do and it's destroying me. This might be because I'm HSP as well, so most emotions do tend to look bigger then they are. It's just that I want to be with my ex, but I can't right now, but I can't have a girl being with me knowning that I want to be with my ex, I don't want to put her through any misery or false hope. I feel so caged in and I have spoken to my ex about this and we see no clear  answer. Help?

tl;dr: i want my ex, ex wants me, another girl in my life who I really like, no future with ex for now and no future possible from my side with new girl (mind full of fuck)"

&gt;What was the best thing about the last year?

&gt;&gt;The best part of last year actually blossomed from my worst part of last year. I had to go to the hospital a few weeks before graduation which sucked. It made me stay in college for the summer to catch up on the work I missed over my 2 week hospital stay. But that summer one of the best summers I had filled with old friends, new friends, and a lot of alcohol

&gt;What are you looking forward to in the year ahead?

&gt;If you were granted one do-over, what would it be?

&gt;&gt;Better decisions as an undergrad

&gt;A butterfly flaps its wings... what small thing have you done or said that lead to something disproportionately larger?

&gt;&gt;I was once at my aunts house. She has 3 kids. One of the kids was bothering me so, offhandedly, I told him to go see what his sister was doing. Turns out his sister was playing Mario Kart on Wii under his account. They ended up fighting which caused my aunt to go see what was wrong. She started yelling which caused my grandma to yell at her which caused my uncle to step in. It caused a big family fight. I quietly left the house.

&gt;All things considered what is the most important thing in the world to you?

&gt;&gt;Happiness. It's often overlooked.

##Concerning reddit:

&gt;What is the origin or meaning of your user name?

&gt;&gt;It's random. But I have learned recently that it's Latin for 'my plunder'. So there's that.

&gt;Total number of reddit identities you‚Äôve had?

&gt;&gt;3 or 4

&gt;What is your favorite part of reddit?

&gt;&gt;All the small gems I find while writing for /r/subredditoftheday. It also gives me a smug sense of superiority when my non reddit friends show me something hours after I've seen it

&gt;What do you do when you‚Äôre not on reddit?

&gt;&gt;I watch a lot of TV and try to discover new music every day. And of course, 9gag

&gt;Do you think reddit has changed in the last year or so?

&gt;&gt;Can't really say. I've only been redditing for a year.

&gt;If so, do you think it‚Äôs been for the better?

&gt;&gt;Sure

They gave me an ETA of the end of this semester, and if they try to stretch it I'm gone, I'm sick of doing password resets and email tickets all day.

My question is, are there any useful small projects I could do to bolster my experience/resume/interview topics before I switch over? The only 'admin access' I have now is to reset passwords, so I'm thinking about all I could do is customer service things like presenting a uniform interface with ticket responses. There's already a full time employee whose entire job description is to take care of the knowledge base, so I'm staying away from that. Any ideas for other stuff I could do?

New position sounds more like an internship, the supervisor seems really excited about bullet-proofing my resume before I graduate.

I should add we have been dating for a little over 2 years. I was talking to my college advisor today and he said that I should intern in Florida this summer (I live in Washington state). I told him that I'd rather intern somewhere like Seattle, because I already sacrifice 9 months out of the year away from my boyfriend for education. He said that if the relationship is strong enough, it will be fine and I need to put my future career plans first. Is it just me, or is this not right? I think taking away the few months we have together as a couple would be unfair, when I could get an internship in somewhere like Seattle/Tacoma.

I initially enlisted as a Dental Technician, however in late 2005 all Dental Technicians became Hospital Corpsmen. Wanting to stay in the dental field (which was difficult for Dental Technicians at the time, as there was quite a bit of cross-training to the medical field), I took on additional training as a Dental Laboratory Technician to 'stay dental.' Knowing that I did want to become a civilian eventually, I started course work and eventually earned my BS in Health Sciences with a concentration in Health Care Management, and I am continuing to work towards my Master's in the same. I have operated as the senior NCO in several dental clinic/laboratories, directly managing the work schedules of 12 people.

That said, for the past two months I have been applying to positions as a Dental Office Manager with little luck. I have received, perhaps, a 15% callback rate for applications submitted. However, when my potential employer learns that I have no real world experience with insurance claims, I'm often quickly dismissed (albeit, quite politely). To rectify this, I have attempted to contact several practices in my local area for an unpaid internship position where I can learn this portion of the trade but have had absolutely no responses.

At this point, I'm quite concerned. I'm contemplating going back to school for a year to earn my ICD-9-CM certification. However, I'm not sure if this certification is particularly valued in the civilian dental sector. Is there, perhaps, an alternate certification that is more valuable to the dental community?

Also, I have included a [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rV-tmLcIzcO0wNGyF8PyAVKdhj0TQFVraTx_gEXvPiY/edit) to the resume I have been using to secure job interviews. Any comments regarding how to improve it would be greatly appreciated.

You can read more about it here: http://international.nau.edu/GSEP/Info/GSEP-overview.html

Basically, the just is this: While enrolled in your normal Computer Science classes, you also take foreign language classes. This is either in German, French, or Spanish. In what would be your senior year of school, you travel to a foreign country for a year. Obviously this is a country that speaks that language you are learning. 
For 6 months you attend a university there, taking a very light course load, mostly consisting of liberal arts classes and only 1-2 actual Computer Science related classes, which will transfer, and thus count towards my degree at NAU. You then have a 6 month internship at a company, obviously somehow relating to Computer Science. You then come back, and finish your degree in your 5th year. At the end of all of this, you end up graduating with the following:

* B.S. in Computer Science
* B.A. in a foreign language
* 6 Months at a foreign university
* 6 Months at a foreign company

Now, my question is this: What language should I learn? I took very basic High School Spanish, and have forgotten it all since then, so I feel as if I am basically at the same level in all three languages. I am leaning towards French, only for the reason of my sister and brother in law traveled in France and loved it. Is one language better, in the sense of there are more Computer Science jobs in a country that speaks that language? Even if I don't end up working at a job overseas, I feel that it would be an amazing experience to have, and I don't think it can ever really hurt having a foreign language degree."

I started programming when I was 14 and started making mods for quake and stuff. I just started getting hooked. I was at the top of my class for math and I took every single possible AP math class I could take (Statistics, Computer Science, Physics, etc) but I always had this lingering thought in the back of my head that I didn't really like it.

Anyway I eventually got so good that I basically had an internship for $15/hr land in my lap as a Junior in high school, I was the kid at my school making the most money. Sure, it was really hard work but I made a shitload of money.

However, I saw the other jobs that other kids had, like McDonalds, Baskin Robbins and Target and stuff like that and I saw all the fun they were having and all the friends they were making and I kinda got jealous. I basically just sat on a computer and programmed while these other people got to interact with people.

Now, it's my first year at Uni and I'm majoring in computer science (obviously), but I *really* don't think it's for me. Sure, I'm at the top of my class right now but I am seriously not enjoying my life. Like, **none of my friends like computers**. I think that says a lot about me.,I have nothing in common with my comp-sci classmates so I made friends elsewhere. 

I'm really fucking scared, I'm so good at this shit it's unreal but I fucking hate it now. In a perfect world, I would just change majors. But I'm so good at programming, it just feels like so much wasted time, effort and potential. I honestly have no idea what I would do for a living other than computer science but I think I'm about to break. I can't take it anymore. I want a life. I want friends. I want to party. I can't relate to anyone else in my class. it sucks.

So here is the back story: I'm 20, and never had a  job going to uni as a CS major. My mom has a friend whom we see all the time which is opening a start up and offered me an internship(nonpaid). I really couldn't say no to the interview since they knew I had the time, and no other work. So I go to the interview, and meet the guy. He tells me what the job entails: windows server administration something which I know nothing of. I told him that I knew nothing of it and explained to him what I had known. He was a bit shocked at the complete polar knowledge I had which couldn't work with his business. Yet he said it was alright and he was willing to teach me. I figure it would be alright agreed. So fast forward two weeks and he is going really in depth and having me analyze and learn from RFCs. Asking me really obscure questions and expecting me to read tons of books to know what he is talking about. After teaching me more or less didn't really help he decided to just have me jump in and assigned me a huge assignment to map out all the server in the company with corresponding ips, subnets, and much more. It was way over my head. After a month of work I have gotten barely anywhere with it. It's not that I am dumb, or don't like my major. It just I was more of a programmer and highly unqualified to do this with the time provided. 

Anyways so here is the problem. I could give the guy any excuse and quit but I know for sure it will break my mom's heart and result in some level of shame. I know this because my mom has said time and time again that she is getting old and wants me to hurry up and work and support the family. I have no problem doing this, I just wanted to do this my own way. I know no lack of opportunity where I live and can easily get a better internship or part time job. I usually an advocate for the truth being the best answer but I know that it will not end well. So I need an excuse which will defuse the situation the best way. So far I have: telling the guy that I have too much schoolwork to keep up while telling my mom that I also have-

too much schoolwork- not good enough of an excuse for her

telling her that I was severely unqualified- she knows they were willing to teach me

I could get a better one- won't matter she wants that I learn first from friends.

EDIT: So I tried telling my mom that it was too hard, and I didn't have enough time to commit to it because of schoolwork. She just basically said try harder by skipping meals and doing less extracurricular activities. I have the resignation email written up for my work but I want to send it after my mom accepts it because I do not want her to learn of it from someone else.

EDIT2: My mom insists not to quit. However she said that if I find a viable replacement I may do that."

6 months ago I took a structural engineering job. It's difficult to pay attention when every day I want to scream and run away, never turning back. I am just an EIT now, but I don't *want* to become a PE. I don't *want* a promotion. The work is just so... boring. Every single day is the exactly same. My biggest fear is that this is just life after college and isn't specific to engineering. Alas, I want to know my options.

All throughout college, my professors would talk about how diverse civil engineering is, and how many opportunities there are even outside of the field of engineering. I'm just wondering if anyone here has any first-hand experience outside of engineering, or knows someone who does. Maybe hearing the experiences of others will spark something in me.

TL;DR: I'm a naive little child who wants life to be exciting, but I'm finding more and more that it is just kind of boring.

The catch is, 2 of our choices have to be industries that we worked in during our internship. I've worked on 3 year-end audits, 2 were consumer &amp; industrial markets and the other was financial services. I was okay with the 2 manufacturing companies, and although I liked my engagement team for the third, I did not like the work I did, so that's definitely at the bottom of my list.

The industry I'd truly prefer working in is public sector (governmental, universities, NFP). My previous internship was 2 summers at a smaller CPA firm, where I worked on audits at school districts, townships, etc. and compilations for small NFP companies. I loved the work, especially compared to the experience I've gained working in other industries, and I know that's what I want to do.

I don't know if this is true for the other Big4 firms, but the public sector group at my firm is pretty small compared to the other industries we work in. I'm guessing it's a small group either because nobody really wants to go into it or it doesn't require as many people and is therefore more difficult to go into. Given my background, I wondered why I didn't get placed into that group for my internship, and I think it's because it's such a small group because there are no interns assigned to any public sector clients. It seems that the more popular industries that everyone tries to get into are financial services and real estate, because a lot of those companies are right in the city, so I'm hopeful that the fact that I even want to be placed in the public sector will help me get there.

**My question is, would it be likely for me to be placed in the public sector industry if I rank that as my top preference and let them know I have experience in that area?**"

This is obviously a simple task done manually, but I'm not really sure how to attack the problem through code.  How do I invoke a method or trigger an action on javascript?  

My guess is I might be able to spoof the http request headers (get/post/etcetra), but my knowledge on that is very limited.  I downloaded a program which records the get/post headers.

This man had been like this for 3 years, in a wheelchair, hardly being able to speak. I almost lost it in the middle of the room. I left the room abruptly and just sobbed. The thing is I see patients all the time and this had never happened, and it shouldn't. in front of a patient at least. "

q49j0,2,2012-02-24,Graduating in a few months and trying to get my ducks in a row... How difficult is it to have an unpaid internship and a full time job at the same time?,theotterone,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/q49j0/graduating_in_a_few_months_and_trying_to_get_my/,"Not sure if this is the right subreddit, but here goes..

I graduate from college in May with a BA in psychology, but what I want to go into is film production. A few months ago I interviewed with a local film office and they were ready to create an internship just for me, but I couldn't get the credits approved through my college, and I wouldn't have been able to graduate on time otherwise. They did however express interest in letting me volunteer after I graduate, in what I presume would be an unpaid internship. 

The thing is though, that I'm currently commuting to school, which is about an hour away. One of the concerns that the film office had was that I do not live locally which would affect my availability, but I can't move unless I get a job that will pay enough to sustain that. I'm currently working retail on the weekends while I finish my last semester, but it's really only giving me enough for gas and a little extra, and I want to find a decent job that will allow me to survive frugally while getting unpaid experience on the side. 

How much would it kill me to get a full time job that could pay rent and also do internship duties, which could include being on film sets for 12+ hrs a day? Would it be wiser to just continue to commute from home with a shittier job to pay for gas? I don't know yet if there is a potential for the internship to turn into a paying job, I'm trying to gauge my situation before talking to the film office again to make plans for 3 months from now. "

I have no formal training, but have made due with learning from tutorials and blogs.

I'd like to partner with the local university, and create an internship for someone who is being trained in this stuff. It would help free me up, and probably give us better looking content. But I don't want to do it if the students portfolio isn't going to benefit from it.

The student would have the chance to design:

‚Ä¢ Tickets (Season and Suite books, and single game tickets)
‚Ä¢ A poster schedule
‚Ä¢ Posters for the concourse pillars
‚Ä¢ 1-2 Pocket Schedules
‚Ä¢ Self-promo materials (flyers, postcards, etc)
‚Ä¢ And clothing for our store

Is that something that would help someone out after graduation? Or would I just be taking advantage of someone for free?

This is not the first discussion we've had about the state.


Me: People are bad so we need a government run by people are bad so we need a government run by people are bad so we need a government run by...you get the point. It's circular logic


Him: Nope, all peeps aren't bad, some peeps are bad, some are dumb, some are smart, some like to bitch and moan about shit without any plan on how to better it, sitting around smokin weed working complaining about nothin that concerns them. That's ignorance good sir, childish ignorance. Grow up pal :)


Me: How does my own liberty not concern me?


Him: You have liberty because the government gives it to you, your liberties are not being violated, and haven't been, You're bitching because you wanna smoke weed and not pay taxes. You want that go live under a bridge. Our government isn't perfect by any means, but it isn't nazi germany, you 
have a choice to leave if you want, see ya!


Me: If we both justly acquire property where does your authority come from to banish me? I could claim authority from God but that doesn't make it right.


Him: You don't have property, You don't work full time, You're not entitled to shit. You have to earn it dude. You haven't earned shit my friend. You sit around all day looking this shit up but have done nothing to change anything.


Me: Attack ""me"" instead of the argument. That's called strawman fallacy. My socio-economic position at this given point in time is irrelevent to that fact that the State is coercive and non-voluntary. In order to have a truly free-market all exchanges must be voluntary.


Him: Look pal I would love to go back and forth with you all day, doesn't change the fact that I live a good life in america, so I don't give a shit. I smoke weed when I want, I work where I choose, I live where I choose, I eat what I choose. So until that changes, I don't give a fuck good sir. Hulk Hogan taught me well.


Me: All those examples are of personal anarchy. Which, by g'all it, I sure love just as much as you do. You don't ask the government to save you from that type of anarchy? Why do it in some of the more important aspects of our social life as well? :)


Him: Because I'm too lazy to worry about that shit, I don't wanna farm my own food, or dig my own well for water, I am content giving up a fraction of my $ so I can enjoy the things I do. LOL you a funny guy, if only you put this effort into something that matters or pays.....Oh well.


Me: You wouldn't have to. There would be a market demand and people will make voluntary exchanges. When that happens both parties benifit otherwise the exchange would have never taken place to begin with. We produce more effectively working together then we would if we had to individually....and I am looking for a job in this. applying for summer internships with organizations that share in the feelings. but thanks for the complament regardless lol :)


Him: Good luck with the hippie commune


Me: Fuck those socialist douchebags lol


Him: LOL well at least we agree on that."

Neither of us is from Florida, originally. We met in college and eventually moved to Florida because she was accepted to a PhD program down here.

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[What's the difference between an angel investor and a VC?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u6pju?context=5)|Broadly speaking an angel investor invests their own money and may not do it full time.  A VC is a professional who invests other peoples' money in a fund.  Also angels tend to invest earlier in less developed companies (sometimes called seed stage).
[Are there generally legal or structural differences between angel and series A funding?  I know that angel rounds are usually smaller but it seems like there is more to it.  What constitutes ""closing"" a round, does that mean that all the equity that you're going to sell for that round has been sold?  Is it generally the case that no equity changes hands until a whole round closes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ue3o8?context=5)|While most angels are coming in at a seed round (pre-series A), that's not always true.  I've participated in Series A funding before as an angel.  Seed rounds can be done as convertible notes which is popular now and basically is a loan convertible to equity on the same terms as the next, Series A round.  This avoids negotiating terms and valuation before it makes sense to do so since a VC will likely want to dictate these.  There are drawbacks.  Seed round docs or docs for angels used to be less sophisticated / simpler in terms and conditions but nowadays I think this is less so.  Angels are investing in more developed companies and so are asking for much the same things as VCs so structurally they may be similar, especially if groups of angels are investing together in a syndicated deal.  Closing a round literally means signing the docs (getting the equity or notes) and wiring the money.  Popular these days is the rolling close where there will be multiple closes as money comes in, however as an investor you really want a minimum before any close because if the company doesn't raise what it wants that greatly magnifies the risk.  Also all things being equal you want to wait as long as possible (maximize your optionality) and close when the full round closes.  Which is why sometimes companies offer incentives to people who close early.
[What kind of covenants are there in the converts? Like can you convert given specific credit events or do you have to wait for the next round of equity? My thinking with your system is that your writing paper, for which there's presumably no secondary market, and in the downside case (start up blows out before they can raise the next round of funding) you're the only capital in the company, so even if you have recourse, it's not to anything really. Meanwhile you're debt, so until you convert you have no say in corporate governance... So it's sort of a catch-22 right? You don't have any real recourse unless your upside case proves out, at which point recourse wouldn't really matter. Seems like kind of a shitty deal from a fixed income POV. How do you protect yourself against the downside?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uerqd?context=5)|Yes you can convert on specific credit events but as you say it doesn't matter.
[What is your view on ""lifestyle"" businesses?  Ie. those that make their owners a nice bit of money to live on comfortably, but allow them to spend very little time actually working.  Do you think those are great?  Or do you think those people are missing out on huge opportunities?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u7axr?context=5)|Funnily I think many owners of lifestyle businesses never actually reach that goal of working little.  Keeping a business going through all the ups and downs is hard and you can never really trust someone else who is just on salary to look out as you would (as an owner).
[Pardon my ignorance in this area, but are there other types of exits beyond selling your stake?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u9p4d?context=5)|You don't have to sell it all and then there are all sorts of things like earn outs, restrictions, etc.
[Is this something an angel investor would be interested in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u6otx?context=5)|I don't know your space but there is no reason why angels wouldn't invest in OEM or suppliers to OEMs so long as it is a scalable business model that can payback the investment with a gain!
[What are OEM companies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uj93x?context=5)|Http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer.
[How did you get into it? What education? Background? Parents come from money?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u701k?context=5)|Kind of accidentally honestly.  People I knew were looking to found a company and I liked the idea and had made a little extra money from working on wall street so put it in.  Frankly I was completely unsophisticated about it but was excited by the opportunity.  Plus I still had a bit of the entrepreneur in me from etechtransfer.  There were a lot of twists and turns from there but as time went on I heard about more companies and it went on from there.  Originally I'm an MIT Engineer.  No family money.
[Course # at MIT?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u9w4w?context=5)|6.
[Did you even have a chance to invest into twitter/facebook early on? Or similar question, what company became successful but you weren't interested?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u74j0?context=5)|Nope.  Better question is would I have invested had I the chance.  Honestly I didn't really care for either when I first heard of them.   Frankly I haven't been doing this full time or near full time until recently (~2 years) so there haven't been any huge successes yet that I know of where I declined.  There will be!
[Proof please?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u6nnp?context=5)|Just tweeted this iama.  you can see my companies on my profile.  http://www.newcanaannewsonline.com/news/article/Stamford-Innovation-Center-unveiled-to-the-public-3333718.php  http://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Stamford-Innovation-Center-lands-500-000-aid-2970722.php Not much left on the web on etechtransfer but here's an article: http://knowledge.emory.edu/article.cfm?articleid=179  At one point three of the founders (again not me!) were on the cover of the Industry Standard.
[Just curious about your thoughts on Angelist. How do you like it? How often do you use it?  Also from a start-up Point-of-View, do you think it's easier to get attention, and reach out to angels. Any tips or other comments?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u7nu0?context=5)|I like Angelist a lot.  Naval is doing great things with it and it is getting a lot of traction.  As I mentioned to him the flow on there is surprisingly good and in some cases better than I get through my local angel group.  Perhaps because since it is public people self-filter or peer-filter out the really bad ideas... Attention is easy to get but really do you want it?  Meaning buzz can be gotten but is often fleeting.  In general, I think startups should make as much progress as they can without taking outside money or only friends/family.  If you can get all the way to making revenue (or profit) even on small scale then you'll get the attention you need to scale up, no worries!
[How do you compare potential value of a smaller idea/product that might be more niche or a larger (but more high risk/reward) opportunity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u6u46?context=5)|Personally I like ideas that don't have to be home runs to succeed.  World changing potential is great but let's be honest, there are few of those ideas and the ones that get there often evolve a lot (facebook is a perfect example).  Break up the larger idea up into concrete executable smaller ideas and dominate niche by niche.  [insert cliche here like walk before you run]
[Also, what kind of returns do you expect if the company becomes successful? Do you think that investors put too much pressure on startups to have an exit strategy and help everyone cash out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uc53l?context=5)|There definitely is a lot of pressure on exit strategy and the more money you take in in later rounds the more pressure builds.  That's why you really shouldn't take money unless you really need it because the incentives can get misaligned. That said early exits often make sense for the entrepreneurs too and it is important to have founders who are starry eyed enough to shoot for the moon but who are practical and understand when they've done well enough along the way and external concerns just make it impossible to really grow as fast or easily (such as lots of new competition, big entrenched player is throwing money at it, etc)
[What is the timeframe for that? How does it work--do they pay you after raising bigger money from venture capitalists? Isn't that sort of close to a ponzi scheme?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uc8u9?context=5)|No one is promising any returns so it's not a ponzi scheme.
[For those seeking angel investors, what is the best way to find one?  Once we find one how do we convince you to invest in a start up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u7fev?context=5)|Reach out to angel groups in your area or on angellist (which BTW is a great newish site bringing together angels and companies).  As for the convincing have a great idea and a great team to execute it.  Know what you don't know and be honest about weaknesses.  Get us excited about building a business with you!
[How did you get started in your career? Did you build your way up from nothing?  What is the best advise you can give about being successesful in the corporate world?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ueh5y?context=5)|I did some internships while in college and was recruited by Lehman Bros my senior year.  I started off in the front office as a jr trader = coffee boy.  Then went back to tech as a consultant at JPM but it wasn't long before I left w/ some others to found a startup.  It went on from there.  The corporate world is a tough one.  I think the number one thing is to understand it is all about people and that there is a lot of politics.  So just being right isn't enough, you need to make sure you get everyone going along with you too.  I don't think I ever completely learned that.  Also you should understand where the money gets made and be as essential to that as you can.  Of course startups are kind of non-corporate which I like ;)
[One last one...  I consider myself an extremely savvy marketing person with a very broad digital background who has been very successful at what I do in the digital marketing space for some pretty large companies.  With that background, is there any sort of place for a person like me who does not have a Finance/Wallstreet background or who doesn't have a successful list of startups they've created to join a VC firm in some capacity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u7bjx?context=5)|As an employee off the bat I'd say no.  If you want to get involved you should start by networking and becoming an advisor/subject matter expert where you can leverage your background in a way that benefits them.
[, whats your first tip to a person who is not necessarily a designer/developer but wants to start his own startup?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u84q5?context=5)|First tip: get involved in the scene and meet people doing it.  See my earlier response but in particular you should come to the Stamford Tech Meetup.  Despite the name, it isn't all for techies.  Also get involved in startup events like the startup weekend stamford we are hosting soon.
[Yeah I've been to a few of the Stamford meetups, thats actually how I got my current position.  I saw at the SUWeekend you have a ticket for non-developer/designer.  What exactly do you expect someone who attends as that category to do at the event?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u89xv?context=5)|Join a team!  I know other startup weekends have done it differently but really I think broader teams are better.
[Which investments/companies have panned out and which have failed? What lessons have you learned from each?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ueu2m?context=5)|As I've said below I've had limited gains/losses and most investments are ongoing so I can't talk specific names.  That said major lessons learned are: 1) Team ability to stick together in rough times with the same goals and commitment is critical.  This was a huge issue in my own startup failure and in my largest investment was an ongoing struggle that led to 3 of 6 founding team members leaving before management could stabilize enough for the company to mature.  2) Always be analytical not emotional in investing.  On my investment where I had to write most of it off I didn't put my usual rigor into the market opportunity and long sales cycle because I knew the founder very well and the company too.  3) Growing customers/revenue too fast can be a killer.  Keep your eye on expenses.  I'd heard this before anecdotally but one company just scaled up and up and when the recession hit they were caught with a too large office, too many staff, etc.  4) VC/PE and institutional money in general play for keeps.  If there is something in the contract or DD they can exploit they will, so make sure everything is in order.  5) On that note run the company professionally.  This means things like keeping minutes, voting on board meetings, audited financials, etc.  Act like a larger, professional company or you won't ever get there!  6) You need a strong supporting team not just a single or two strong founders.  Especially technical, financial, and marketing.  If these skills are represented the company will spend time finding people after the money comes in.  Individuals should be identified ahead of time.

[How do you pitch your idea to an Angel Investor without them stealing it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uawor?context=5)|In general you shouldn't pitch pure ideas because pure ideas don't get funded.  You need some traction (prototype, team, etc).  Also I can't speak for every angel investor and I'm sure there are bad apples out there but most of us don't have the capability to execute your idea and just like you certainly couldn't do it without a team.  Even if I could execute it if I think your idea is a good one and I think you are a great jockey (see above) then why would I steal the idea vs backing you since you've already taken it somewhere (presumably)?  Especially since doing that means there is a motivated and angry person out there doing the same thing who can also sue me?
[I live in a city famed for it's abundance of angel and venture capital and am a partner in a kitchen-sink start up. The kicker is, the money is focussed on tech and bio-pharma and we're in music... Do you think it's possible someone might invest in music for vanity purposes ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u8y08?context=5)|Lots of people would want invest in music for vanity purposes so they can say ""I found that band"".  It's up there with restaurants and bars.  How many actually do I bet is limited though.
[I am a PhD student in Nuclear Engineering right now, thinking about my plans after finishing my degree.  I read economics books as a side hobby, but have no real business-type skills.  If I want to commercialize my research, what kind of market would I need to attract an angel investor?  I understand that I really need a Day 0 product that I need to develop and show to potential investors, but what kind of return would they need to see?  Also, how in-depth would research of that nature need to be to be realistic?  What kind of business plan would I need to show them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ukwcr?context=5)|Hi you've got a lot of questions and I really am not the best person to answer them plus it would take quite a long while to do so.  You should speak to the commercialization people at your university and they can get you going.  End of the day though if you have no real business-type skills then you need to partner with someone who does.
[What's a good amount to start angel investing? I know Angel investors aren't considered Accredited investors by the SEC, but are there any legal hoops you have to jump through? At what point did you hire a lawyer to deal with your deals?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u8pkn?context=5)|Angel investments are by definition highly risky and illiquid so you shouldn't invest money you will ever need.  What that amount is is different for each person based upon their needs/lifestyle.
[How did you originally qualify to be an accredited investor? I'm not sure I'll be able to get to the point of $200k annually or $1 mill net worth easily. Should I go the route of opening a business investment company?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u9myi?context=5)|I think qualifying as an accredited investors is the minimum before you can make investments.  Of course the gov't is looking to lower the barriers on certain types/sizes of investments.  I'd wait on that.
[Do you happen to know of any one/site/groups who do what you do in western continental Europe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ub1sl?context=5)|Sorry I don't.  I know Europe has a lot more funds than angel investors though anecdotally.
[What are your thoughts of getting an MBA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u7uvz?context=5)|Ok broadly speaking I think an MBA's top value is in the people you meet (networking) and in the name on the diploma.  In this economy given the cost I think anyone should think hard about the actual value versus two years of learning by doing.  Can you tell I never got one myself? As an entrepreneur or as an investor?
[Hey rich 1 percenter stealing from the poor, get off the internet!  All kidding aside, do you think capital gains should be taxed at a rate closer to income tax?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3udnsm?context=5)|Nope.  Unless you inherited it, you paid income tax already on the money you used to buy the asset that you were lucky to have capital gains on.  Even if you did inherit it, if it was in a year other than 2010 (recently), you paid estate tax.  So capital gains are already double taxed.  Furthermore I should be incentivized to put my money to work by investing it in stocks, bonds, real estate, and yes startup companies (which by definition create jobs!)  And I think the AMT already causes capital gains rates paid to be higher for big earners.  I think our tax code is hideously and needlessly complex and full of loopholes, fix that not the capital gains rate.
[Ok, I've got a great idea and need money to pay a programmer - probably less than $25k. Infinitely scalable and ridiculous profit potential. Your wheelhouse?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ubo0u?context=5)|If that's what you need and potential is as huge as you say then you should borrow that money from friends and family so you keep all the equity.  Seriously.  Don't reach outside unless you absolutely need it.
[Do you invest in technology biz, or any kind of start up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u8d3m?context=5)|I'm pretty broad and have invested in pharma/biotech, sales/marketing, ecommerce, fashion, etc.  All of my investments have a technology component but these days what doesn't?
[I work for a startup that is seeded through a VERY wealthy individual. We are a SaaS company with patents. The market we're trying to sell to right now has a sales cycle of about 1.5YEARS. Every day, I lose a bit of hope for longevity, and for ultimate financial success here. Is there any way to get in touch with you when you're done with this AMA so I can pick  your brain?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u7hzf?context=5)|Sure.  I'm @tedsensei.
[I have a very successful website that is read by most hedge funds, investment banks, and securities law firms in the United States.  I do this on the side in addition to my full time job working on Wall Street.  I would like to expand this website but need capital and time to do it.  Do you suggest I quit my job before reaching out to angels or contact angels while I still have a seat and get soft circles and a lawyer retained?  In addition, can I contact you offline for further advice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u95s4?context=5)|First I think you should make sure that you aren't in conflict with any policies of where you work.  Assuming that you are ok then sure, stay employed while you get everything else lined up.  Since you've been able to run it successfully while keeping a day job nothing should change.  If your plan to expand makes sense and you get a good read on capital, then you can quit and be happy.  Clearly your investors will want you 100% focused on the site after that.  Some may care that you are working a day job now but honestly I think most will understand, again provided that the site is doing well that's the most important thing.  Caveat: they probably won't fund your salaries or whatever on the assumption that you have savings from keeping the day job for so long.  @tedsensei.
[It seems like there is no room for young people in VC.  Is there any entry-level way into the field?  You would think there would be plenty of associate level work to do but these positions don't seem to exist.  It seems like I have to either launch a startup or have a tremendous amount of wealth to start doing VC as a career.  Any idea how one would make the career transition?  I'm in the Northeast.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uaim1?context=5)|I don't know firsthand having never worked at a VC, but I hear where you are coming from.  Fact is there are way more people who want to get into it than there are spots because it simply doesn't take massive teams to do the work (and they can't afford them anyways).  This is one of the cases where you might actually get an MBA so you can network your way in and have the ground level skills through internships or whatever.  Also many people transition to VC/PE from working at banks.
[However, nabbing 10-30k from a single Angel isn't really enough for me to quit my job and invest heavily in the business.  Do you recommend finding a group of angels?  Do you usually make investments with three or four others?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u9omy?context=5)|See above, I don't think it will happen that you'll get money to do it as a side business, frankly it isn't fair to the investor that you have such a huge hedge/out.
[If one has a great business idea with a business plan that doesn't require too much capital, say &lt;100k. Should one take out a business loan or seek capital from a VC?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uh20s?context=5)|I think you'll find it difficult if not impossible to get a loan for a business plan if that's all you have.  Same goes with a VC (plus that size is way too small for them).
[I should also mention one does not like to share profits. Is there an agreement one could put in place stating that you can make 100-300% back on your initial investment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uh20s?context=5)|Not sure what you mean about sharing profits?  Legally you can cap returns through some kind of buyback clause, but I don't see why an investor would agree to do that given the risk/reward.  After all, if it fails are going to guarantee they get their money back or some part of it?
[Well isn't that part of the risk that VCs take? They either get a healthy return on their initial investment or lose it if the business fails?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ulmq7?context=5)|Right but then why should/would they agree to cap those healthy returns if the downside is not similarly capped?
[So what would you do if you were the guy with the business idea?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uq00i?context=5)|I've been that guy. Take it as far as you can without taking money or taking money only from friends and family.  Then when you are ready you can bring in investors if you need it.  If you really can't do it without lots of money, break the idea down into smaller bits that are probably more realistic to execute on anyways.  Then by the time you really need money you'll be able to get investors on terms more like you want.
[Which verticals is your accelerator fund most excited about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uah7o?context=5)|Right now media is a big deal, especially in Stamford as more production facilities are moving in.  Similarly there are a lot of opportunities in healthcare related companies.  But we are open to all verticals.
[Do you invest more in the horse or jockey?  (idea or entrepreneur)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uah7o?context=5)|Definitely the jockey.  Most if not all companies pivot through several ideas IF they ever win the race.
[I have an invention idea. Is it worth pursuing? It's not very technological, but it's original and (I believe) fairly useful. Do you ever consider these projects?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ucm8n?context=5)|Personally usually not because I have limited connections in the consumer goods type businesses plus it is very marketing ($) intensive.  That said if it is a good idea you should go for it!  What space is the invention in?
[I'm also working on a startup in the music space (and no not another Internet radio platform) and planning on launching prior to SXSW. We are considering angel investors but we're incorporated in Illinois (I'm the lone NYCer). How urgent is it to reincorporate in Delaware when looking for angel investment? Also, would you say it's worth paying a lawyer for a few hours of their time to go over the terms and services, etc prior to launch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uh2az?context=5)|Is it a C corp?  If not then you should take the time/money to reincorporate as a C in Delaware if you are seriously looking to raise money.  However you can always do it as a conditional to the raise.
[No we're an S corp. I was told that most startups should incorporate as a LLC, so C corp is new news to me. Can you explain that a bit further?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ulqx6?context=5)|There is no one obvious answer other than S corps don't work for angel investors and any kind of pass through tax treatment won't work.  Unless they aren't investing in equity.  That said people will do just about anything I guess, I'm just saying most won't.  If you already have an S you should just go to C which is ultimately what you must have if you want institutional money at any point.  Here's a quora: http://www.quora.com/Should-a-tech-startup-incorporate-as-an-LLC-a-C-Corp-or-an-S-Corp-Why.
[How do I begin?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ucr29?context=5)|Honestly I don't know but maybe someone else does?  I would guess you need to make or find someone to make a prototype first to validate it actually works.  At the same time figure out the market for it so you know how to position it.
[Thank you! Maybe I'll be able to afford my swimming pool of gold sometime soon..... Haha. Once I've done those steps, could I message you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uk1dg?context=5)|Sure - I'm on twitter @tedsensei.

[What are your thoughts on the show Shark Tank?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ubdju?context=5)|I watch it and I think it is ok since it exposes people to the angel investing world and to people starting companies (creating jobs!) Except Burnett made it too human interesty and blubbery.  Oh and some of the deals are ridiculously overpriced (which I've started to tweet about).  The original show is called Dragon's Den and is all over the world.  I'm a big fan of the UK Dragon's Den which was the first popular one.  1) The Dragons aren't as big a-holes and really try to give good advice and help even when they must be harsh 2) There isn't a huge amount of backstory, it's about the companies and investments 3) They don't want one up each other just for the ""drama""
[Can you go more into ""recovering wall streeter?""  BTW I am in Stamford too!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uaoiv?context=5)|I used to work at banks and hedge funds.

q3xhc,0,2012-02-24,Spongebob horror storry! LONG READ (Part 1),[deleted],WTF,https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/q3xhc/spongebob_horror_storry_long_read_part_1/,"
I‚Äôm NOT saying this is real. I just find it interesting. One reminder: NONE of the stuff said below are in my own words, but instead in the words of an intern at Nickelodeon.


‚ÄúI want to start off by saying if you want an answer at the end, prepare to be disappointed. There just isn‚Äôt one.‚Äù


‚ÄúI was an intern at Nickelodeon Studios for a year in 2005 for my degree in animation. It wasn‚Äôt paid of course, most internships aren‚Äôt, but it did have some perks beyond education. To adults it might not seem like a big one, but most kids at the time would shit themselves over it. Since I worked directly with the editors and animators, I got to view the new episodes days before they aired.‚Äù


‚ÄúI‚Äôll get right to it without giving too many unnecessary details. They had very recently made the Spongebob movie and the entire staff was somewhat sapped of creativity so it took them longer to start up the season. But the delay lasted longer for more upsetting reasons. There was a problem with the series 4 premier that set everyone and everything back for several months.‚Äù


‚ÄúMe and two other interns were in the editing room along with the lead animators and sound editors for the final cut. We received the copy that was supposed to be ‚ÄúFear of a Krabby Patty‚Äù and gathered around the screen to watch. Now, given that it isn‚Äôt final yet animators often put up a mock title card, sort of an inside joke for us, with phony, often times lewd titles, such as ‚ÄúHow sex doesn‚Äôt work‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúRock-a-by-Bivalve‚Äù when spongebob and patrick adopt a sea scallop. Nothing particularly funny but work related chuckles. So when we saw the title card ‚ÄúSquidward‚Äôs Suicide‚Äù we didn‚Äôt think it more than a morbid joke. One of the interns did a small throat laugh at it. The happy-go-lucky music plays as is normal.‚Äù 


‚ÄúThe story began with Squidard practicing his clarinet, hitting a few sour notes like normal. We hear Spongebob laughing outside and Squidard stops, yelling at him to keep it down as he has a concert that night and needs to practice. Spongebob says okay and goes to see Sandy with with Patrick. The bubbles splash screen comes up and we see the ending of Squidward‚Äôs concert. This is when things began to seem off. While playing, a few frames repeat themselves, but the sound doesn‚Äôt (at this point sound is synced up with animation so yes that‚Äôs not common) but when he stops playing, the sound finishes as if the skip never happened. There is slight mummuring in the crowed before they begin to boo him. Not normal cartoon booing that is common in the show, but you could very clearly hear malace in it. Squidward‚Äôs in full frame and looks visibly afraid. The shot goes to the crowd, with Spongebob in center frame, and he too is booing, very much unlike him. That isn‚Äôt the oddest thing, though. What is odd is everyone had hyper realistic eyes. Very detailed. Clearly not shots of real people‚Äôs eyes, but something a bit more real than CGI. The pupils were red. Some of us looked at eachother, obviously confused, but since we weren‚Äôt the writers we didn‚Äôt question its appeal to children, yet.‚Äù


‚ÄúThe shot goes to Squidward sitting on the edge of his bed, looking very forlorn. The view out of his porthole window is of a night sky so it isn‚Äôt very long after the concert. The unsettling part is at this point there is no sound. Literally no sound. Not even the feedback from the speakers in the room. It‚Äôs as if the speakers were turned off, though their status showed them working perfectly. He just sat there, blinking, in this silence for about 30 seconds, then he started to sob softly. He put his hands (tentacles) over his eyes and cried quietly for a full minute more, all the while a sound in the background very slowly growing from nothing to barely audible. It sounded like a slight breeze through a forest.‚Äù


‚ÄúThe screen slowly begins to zoom in on his face. By slow I mean it‚Äôs only noticeable if you look at shots 10 seconds apart side by side. His sobbing gets louder, more full of hurt and anger. The screen then twitches a bit, as if it twists in on itself, for a split second then back to normal. The wind-through-the-trees sound gets slowly louder and more severe, as if a storm is brewing somewhere. The eerie part is this sound, and Squidward‚Äôs sobbing, sounded real, as if the sound wasn‚Äôt coming from the speakers but as if the speakers were holes the sound was coming through from the other side. As good as sound as the studio likes to have, they don‚Äôt purchase the equipment to be that good to produce sound of that quality.‚Äù


‚ÄúBelow the sound of the wind and sobbing, very faint, something sounded like laughing. It came at odd intervals and never lasted more than a second so you had a hard time pinning it (we watched this show twice, so pardon me if things sound too specific but I‚Äôve had time to think about them). After 30 seconds of this, the screen blurred and twitched violently and something flashed over the screen, as if a single frame was replaced. The lead animation editor paused and rewound frame by frame. What we saw was horrible. It was a still photo of a dead child. He couldn‚Äôt have been more than 6. The face was mangled and bloodied, one eye dangling over his upturned face, popped. He was naked down to his underwear, his stomach crudely cut open and his entrails laying beside him. He was laying on some pavement that was probably a road. The most upsetting part was that there was a shadow of the photographer. There was no crime tape, no evidence tags or markers, and the angle was completely off for a shot designed to be evidence. It would seem the photographer was the person responsible for the child‚Äôs death.‚Äù


‚ÄúWe were of course mortified, but pressed on, hoping that it was just a sick joke. The screen flipped back to Squidward, still sobbing, louder than before, and half body in frame. There was now what appeard to be blood running down his face from his eyes. The blood was also done in a hyper realistic style, looking as if you touched it you‚Äôd get blood on your fingers. The wind sounded now as if it were that of a gale blowing through the forest; there were even snapping sounds of branches. The laughing, a deep baritone, lasting at longer intervals and coming more frequently. After about 20 seconds, the screen again twisted and showed a single frame photo. The editor was reluctant to go back, we all were, but he knew he had to. This time the photo was that of what appeared to be a little girl, no older than the first child. She was laying on her stomach, her barrettes in a pool of blood next to her. Her left eye was too popped out and popped, naked except for underpants. Her entrails were piled on top of her above another crude cut along her back. Again the body was on the street and the photographer‚Äôs shadow was visible, very similar in size and shape to the first. I had to choke back vomit and one intern, the only female in the room, ran out.‚Äù

q3x3q,15,2012-02-24,"Are you supposed to suffer through times in your life that you hate, or try to change them?",[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/q3x3q/are_you_supposed_to_suffer_through_times_in_your/,"21 y/o female here, just need a little space to vent and ask people how they get their enthusiasm for life back. I'm in my senior year of college, and for some reason, every TA this year wants to make my life a living hell. I haven't been going to class because I simply don't give a fuck. I get straight Bs-ish on essays and exams, but they still harass me for not coming to class (which makes me less inclined to go, to avoid their harassment). All I want to do is to pass with a C and move on, but I feel like I'm sinking deeper and deeper into a deep-dark pit of senioritis. Plus I have an internship that I hate (and don't get paid for), plus a part-time job. I just got denied for extended summer housing from the school, and my boyfriend does not want to move in with me just yet. I also have no prospects in line for a full-time job, so I feel completely fucked on finding an apartment in Los Angeles. I don't have any friends, and all I can focus on is bringing my colt (as in, horse) out to Los Angeles in the fall - but knowing I'll probably have no money to do that either. 

I just feel like my life fucking sucks at the moment. I feel constantly exhausted, depressed, and unable to cope with my situation. I'm now constantly lying about having diseases and illnesses in order to get out of class and work. Sometimes I seriously consider how I would fake a car accident so that I could get hurt enough to stop going to school. The only thing I look forward to any more is chilling with my boyfriend and smoking pot. When I was in high school I used to have so much more going on - I used to train horses, act for commercials, model, etc. but now I have no money to do anything that previously made me happy and fulfilled. All I want to do is up and leave from college, but it's my senior year and I know that I have to stick it out - especially since my poor parents are paying as much as they can to put me through my ridiculously expensive private college. 

All I can do is lie around at home and sleep all day, stay awake all night worrying about my grades and school, and now I've suddenly begun breaking out into uncontrollable sobs whenever someone lightly criticizes me or confronts me about school work. I just want everything to be over with and for everyone to leave me alone, but I know this isn't healthy behavior and I don't usually feel this way. I keep fantasizing about running away and starting over without these tedious obligations. There is nothing wrong with my mental capacity, I'm just tired of doing bored, useless work. I've always disliked school, and I have completely lost interest in my current major.

My boyfriend is being very supportive of me and encourages me to stick it out my last year, but I don't know how much longer I can last feeling this miserable. I apologize if I'm being dramatic, but I'm wondering if there is anything I can do to stop feeling so tortured all the time. I feel like all my problems would go away if I just had enough money to afford my hobbies, a new apartment, etc., but that's just something I don't have right now. What should I do?

**TL;DR** I'm completely burnt-out and depressed with my broke-ass senior year of college and need advice on how to start feeling better."

I have no goals. I have nothing I want to accomplish, except paying my rent and taking care of my pets. Part of the reason I never finished my degree was that I thought it was pointless to do it without a goal in mind. I have very niche interests which are not able to generate income. Right now, I have general entry level experience in several fields (music industry, travel writing, customer service, etc) but I have yet to find anything to chase after. Three internships lead to nothing due to ""the economy"".     
  
When I want something though, I am absolutely tenacious about getting it. I've researched a ton of fields in everything from autopsy technicians to stage hands, but nothing's really clicked. I'm just..kind of drifting. Part of the problem is that I have a sleep disorder so I can't work mornings, which cuts 90% of my career options. I can't ever work a normal office job. I considered talking to disability services, but I get judged because I don't ""look"" disabled. Sleep disorders are severely misunderstood. I don't know what to do with my life. I'm on unemployment now. How to get unstuck?"

q3ssi,3,2012-02-24,Somewhat confused about my options,SonOfSpades,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/q3ssi/somewhat_confused_about_my_options/,"I am about to graduate university with a Computer Science degree, with a Minor in Geomatics, and i am somewhat confused as to where i stand/go from here. I have taken almost all of the Geomatics courses offered by my university from Remote Sensing to Cartography, unfortunately I feel really confused as to where I fit in. 

A bit of backstory, my first coop internship was with Environment Canada, working as a developer, coding applications (in C++) to process/convert/etc satellite imagery into formats that were more usable for the analyists/science people, following this I ended up creating/working on extensions (or add-ons as ESRI calls them now) for ArcGIS, along with other various tasks. I really had no understanding of what a ‚ÄúSpatial Reference‚Äù or what ‚ÄúSymbology‚Äù was and why it is so important, at the time. However I loved the work, so much that I ended up doing a minor in Geomatics, and ended up working with Environment Canada for two years on and off, as a developer (for coop).  Also for the last year I have been rewriting/porting (Ugh Avenue)/updating peoples Python Scripts/Geoprocessor tools, ArcObjects/ tools and extensions. I have been doing this for free, to try and get more experience.

I tried to get into and contribute to the Open Source GIS Community; however I never really was able to get into it. However I do love the open source community, libraries such as GDAL, Mapnik, and even applications such as Geoserver / Postgresql + PostGIS are invaluable, and I have used them a fair bit for my classes/thesis/personal projects.

Skillset wise however the majority of my experience is using ArcObjects / Python / GDAL (Since working raster‚Äôs in ArcObjects/arcpy + numpy is slow and horrifying). However I do have a fairly good grasp of the open source GIS tools, especially when it comes to a lot of the Web GIS stuff. 

I somewhat feel I over specialized with ESRI, and should have instead been more focusing on the general areas of GIS. What should I be focusing on? Furthermore where do GIS Programmers really fit in?

q3qns,26,2012-02-24,"I'm a recent college graduate looking for an unpaid internship  in a music studio in the LA area. I'm not asking for one. What I'm asking is, what kind of resume/design/approach should I use in reaching out towards studios?",[deleted],WeAreTheMusicMakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/q3qns/im_a_recent_college_graduate_looking_for_an/,"I graduated from UC Davis this past summer. I'm looking for an internship in the LA area (SF Valley specifically), but I am not sure what the steps I should be taking are towards reaching out. My questions are...



How should I contact studios? E-mail, phone, in-person? My inclination is that e-mail is the best way, but what should I send?

What kind of resume/cover letter/message should I be sending out? Obviously, I finished college with a degree in philosophy and have not really prepared for anything in this field, but I want to make a good impression that all I want to do is learn. So I'm not sure what kind of resume to draft up? I know resumes come in different formats, so which would you recommend for this ordeal?


Basically, I want to say this. I'm a recent college graduate and all I want to do is be in the studio. I'll do any job you ask me. I know photoshop, I have other computational skills, and I'll also have a car so I'll do the most menial crap from coffee to running around, etc. I know Logic, FL Studio well, etc. and have been practicing all sorts of mixing techniques for 4 years now. All that I ask is that amongst these things, I have the opportunity to just sit in. I just want to observe, ask some questions, see how the work-flow operates among professionals and in general how records are made. I'm not just a kid off the street, I was good enough to graduate with a UC degree and want to treat an unpaid internship as professional as I would law school or a paid job. I have a great amount of patience for this and all I want to do is act upon it and learn something. In reality, I just want a mentor to give me the boost I need to develop a skillset that I want badly.



So if I wanted to say all of this in an e-mail, but do it professionally rather than just a blank e-mail of text, how would you guys format it?

If it makes any difference, my primary goal is to be involved in mixing of hip hop, pop, electronic (house) records but sound editing/mixing for film/commercials/video is also something intriguing to me as well. I just want to be in the world of the studio, the gear, being able to practically apply that knowledge into creating something, etc.

As of February 23rd I still have not received the letter of rec (I'm using a website called Interfolio for my letters of rec).  I know the letter request was sort of on short notice, but I can't help but worry that maybe the professor has forgotten about the letter and I will be sans a letter of rec for my application.


I've heard of people asking their professors for the letter of recommendation progress, but I'm not exactly sure how to go about it.  It seems kind of derogatory to ask the professor if she has started working on my letter of rec (like how a teacher asks a student how their assignment is coming along).  I know the website is working because I just received the other requested letter of rec several days ago.


Am I still supposed to send her an email and ask for a follow up?  If so, does anyone have any idea how to phrase it eloquently so that I don't look/feel like a dick?"

Well that being said, on to the subject. I am an American and am currently a year away from completing a undergrad degree in history. Once I finish I would like to go on to a masters in Anthropology or Archeology. More specifically I would like to do so in Europe with the intentions of working there upon completion of my studies. 


While my living abroad experiences are far from broad (pun slightly intended), I have done enough to develop a taste for it.  I've lived in Peru for two years (a religious mission), studied for an all too brief month in Germany, and have plans to spend two months this summer in Siena, Italy (to study and do an internship). From these experiences I've become fluent in Spanish, gotten a basic grasp on German, and am making headway in Italian.


So basically my request to you, my fellow IWantOut Redditors, is any advice, tips, leads you can give to help make possible my dream of becoming an European citizen. My countries of choice would be Spain, Germany, Italy, or the UK. But really any foothold I could get in Europe would just be great.

I initially enlisted as a Dental Technician, however in late 2005 all Dental Technicians became Hospital Corpsmen. Wanting to stay in the dental field (which was difficult for Dental Technicians at the time, as there was quite a bit of cross-training to the medical field), I took on additional training as a Dental Laboratory Technician to 'stay dental.' Knowing that I did want to become a civilian eventually, I started course work and eventually earned my BS in Health Sciences with a concentration in Health Care Management, and I am continuing to work towards my Master's in the same. I have operated as the senior NCO in several dental clinic/laboratories, directly managing the work schedules of 12 people.

That said, for the past two months I have been applying to positions as a Dental Office Manager with little luck. I have received, perhaps, a 15% callback rate for applications submitted. However, when my potential employer learns that I have no real world experience with insurance claims, I'm often quickly dismissed (albeit, quite politely). To rectify this, I have attempted to contact several practices in my local area for an unpaid internship position where I can learn this portion of the trade but have had absolutely no responses.

At this point, I'm quite concerned. I'm contemplating going back to school for a year to earn my ICD-9-CM certification. However, I'm not sure if this certification is particularly valued in the civilian dental sector. Is there, perhaps, an alternate certification that is more valuable to the dental community?

Also, I have included a [1] link to the resume I have been using to secure job interviews. Any comments regarding how to improve it would be greatly appreciated.

EDIT - Wanted to add that I have applied to Dental Front Desk positions in the hope that I could gain insurance experience there. However, I have found I have absolutely no callbacks when I apply to that position.

I got an email this evening telling me that I have an interview for an internship I recently applied for. Now, I know I'm jumping the gun a bit, as I might not even get the placement, but I am reluctant to even reply to the interview offer. The job description involves designing brochures and portfolio material that showcase the business, and this includes setting up meetings to get information (gulp), writing copy etc. 

I know this is a GREAT opportunity, and I will go to the interview and try my best, but I am terrified. This feels way too big for me. I don't have any actual real experience, I'm rubbish at photoshop, the project I'd be doing sounds really important and I don't think I'm good enough. What if I screw it up? What if at the end of the placement, everything I've done is rubbish and I've just wasted their time and money? 

I want this so much. I want to do a great job and get on with everyone and have some solid experience. I just don't know what they would expect of me, and I'm awkward and I don't even know if I'm very good at design or writing. I get good grades but I always feel like people are 'just saying that' when they compliment anything I do.

I know I need to cool off, I might not even get past the interview... But just so I can calm down a bit, any advice or support would be great, and any experiences with similar internships would be wonderful.

I fucked up last summer and made out with another man, who tried to have sex with me. I stopped. I didn't want that. But I still cheated. I was upfront. It took until I returned to the state I hail from (I had an out-of-state internship for 4 months when it happened), about a month but I told him what happened. To this day I am sorry.
He also hates that every so often I smoke. He hates it.
Since getting back together after the summer, I've been busy. I'm in college, have 3 jobs, and he lives an hour away. I know I could've tried harder to see him, but it was simpler for him to stop by up here since he worked 20 minutes from my university. 
Ever since this summer he's been hesitant to let me go out with friends. And ever since this summer, I've been feeling really independent. 
We started fighting a bunch. He wanted me to put forth more of an effort and I wanted space. One day I finally asked for it. We ended. But he wanted to make it more of a break. So I did. I didn't hook up with anyone, do anything stupid or break any of his 'rules'. 2 weeks later we agreed to talk. We didn't. He was too scared I'd break up with him.
All I wanted was him back in my arms. I knew it was stupid, but he wanted the break, so I thought he wanted me back. 
Now he doesn't know if he wants me back. It's been 2 weeks since we were supposed to talk. Whenever he calls me we fight and cry. I feel he doesn't care. He doesn't want to see me. He says he wants to get back together, but he says no whenever I ask if we are going to. 

I feel played. Manipulated. I wanted out, but I worked on my feelings and myself to be able to get back with him at his bequest. Now all I want is him. I still love him deeply.

But he won't have me. He says he still loves me, still cares, but he won't take me back. He claims I don't deserve another chance, and that I shouldn't talk to him, give him space. But I feel like if I do that he'll leave and never come back.

I've been carrying this for a while. I've never told anyone about this.

I once knew a great man. His name was Phil Pilalus. He used to be a millionaire during the ""dot com"" explosion in silicon valley. Among being a tremendously accomplished entrepreneur, he was a master salesman, and a prodigy in the field of civil service. 

He didn't only advocate human rights, he fought for them with a fervor that I have hardly known. If you were/are a foster child, a disenfranchised child, or a ward of the state, Phil Pilalus pioneered the fight for your rights. He drafted, by hand, many documents that guarantee your safety.

The ""dot com"" bubble burst, and Phil lost everything. He spent his time after that volunteering for local community service efforts. ""Sandwiches on Sundays"" was one among many local programs he donated his time to. To make ends meet, Phil rented a room out to people who he thought needed a hand. 

Two years ago I moved out to Mountain View, CA for a coop with NASA, while I finished going to junior college. I had no support structure within a two-state-radius. No health insurance for interns, and I couldn't afford a car let alone health coverage. Phil decided that I could use some help, so he rented me a room. 

We spent the next 6 months getting to know each other. Phil and I were both somewhat off the ""beaten path"". Neither of us had medical coverage, and neither of us were very stable, economically. During our talks, Phil would often express how it was hard for him to get a job now a days, since the business world didn't have need for an aging salesman. He would talk about how costly medical coverage is, and how he would have to contact the drug manufacturers directly to be supplied with his medication. He would talk about how sometimes he would meet doctors at the events he volunteered for, and they would give him the occasional free checkup. More than anything, Phil would talk about how he wasn't beaten yet. He was going to make his comeback. He would say that it was only a matter of time until he would be a millionaire again, and I completely believed him.

One night I woke up to a gentle tapping on my wall at about 3:00 am. I trace it back to Phil's room. I open his door, and see him sitting on the side of his bed in his boxers. He's struggling to say something, but I can't make it out since he's having a lot of trouble breathing. I shout that I'm going to call 9-1-1, and I rush to the living room to do so. The operator tells me that an ambulance is on its way as I jog back into Phil's room. When I enter, I see Phil unconscious, collapsed face up on his bed. He's not breathing. The operator walks me through the CPR process until the EMT's arrive. 4 hours later, they wheeled him out in a body bag. 

Phil Pilalus died that night because of heart complications that arose from mixing his medications improperly. He never got to make his comeback. He had accomplished so much, and helped so many people, and he died alone in a shitty fucking apartment. They just let him die.

I'm sorry if this wasn't the most eloquent way of telling this story. Phil Pilalus deserves so much more than this. It's all I can give him. I'm so sorry Phil.

(excuse me if my site seems far more cocky about my design skills than I really am, I don't think I'd have much chance with finding clients/an internship if I mention that I am a total newbie)

Anyway, heres where I need help!

Though I got most of the site to resize through mediaqueries I can't figure out how to get the text input areas on the contact form to resize and thus I sloppily applied an overflow:hidden at the smallest window size (480px). 
Related: the contact box as a whole isn't resizing as small as I would like it too (im 90 percent sure Im just forgetting to declare something in the mediaqueries). Any idea?

When viewed on a browser that doesn't support @font-face the design breaks horribly. Im not one hundred percent sure why, but it appears guilder is much smaller and more condensed than the fallback font (arial narrow), this may be a super newbie question, but is there a solution to this that doesn't involve me using alternative type (or setting each instance of that typeface as an image)? also, I've got my website to show these typefaces as far back as IE6, is there any significant browser share that would use the fallback font anyway?

I know the blog link is a little awkward as it renders that other nav links useless, I plan on cleaning that up soon. I think thats one of the bigger problems in my site currently, are there other major things you would suggest I do to my site?'

Thanks guys!"
q5eqx,3,2012-02-25,I feel really stuck in life and I'm not sure if there is much of a point to it. ,saturniid,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q5eqx/i_feel_really_stuck_in_life_and_im_not_sure_if/,"Sorry - this is a bit lengthy. First of all, I don't hate life itself, and I wouldn't necessarily say that I have anything like depression - more like my life's circumstances are making me depressed. 

I'm not entirely sure where to start with this...I took out an insane amount of loans to pay for an essentially useless BFA. (Well, not useless but the only jobs would be in major cities.) This is my own fault, of course. Throughout most of college (west coast) I was living with my boyfriend. He ended up moving to NYC the year before I graduated. In my last semester of school, I opted to finish my classes online to move in with him. There had been nothing wrong with our relationship, and NYC would have been the ideal place for me to be anyway.  But he started having a problem with alcohol - basically becoming verbally and sometimes physically abusive towards me, and refused to acknowledge how he was treating me or seek treatment. So when it was time for me to fly back to the west coast for my college graduation, I decided I wasn't going to go back. (I wouldn't have been able to afford to live in NYC on my own, and I don't know where I would have stayed until I could have figured something out.) I ended up moving back home with my parents. 

I'm still on the west coast, but my parents are in a pretty small town. There are no jobs in my field, and the only ones even remotely close are unpaid internships (but in the nearest city about an hour away.) I did do one of the internships, but the company only wanted to keep me as an unpaid intern after the 3 months were up. I have tried applying to jobs in larger cities, but they either want me to be an unpaid intern or they won't consider anyone who has to move. 

Currently, I'm doing freelance work online and I'm also a webcam ""model"" (please don't judge me for this). I am making more than I would taking any sort of retail job. But I'm not even making enough to be able to live on my own and pay my disgustingly large loan payments. I am currently taking classes at a community college as well to try to gain some new skills and to defer my loan payments in case there are months where I don't make enough money. 

Ultimately, I feel like I've gotten stuck. I don't blame anyone, of course, but I just don't see any way out. It's been almost a year since I've graduated, and the longer I go without any reputable job, the less likely I'm going to be to ever get one. Because of the loan payments, I'm also terrified that if I did move for a job and then lost it, I would be completely fucked. 

I don't have any friends anymore, and my parents basically refuse to acknowledge what is going on in my life. (My mother is bipolar but refuses treatment - she goes though extreme fits of rage on a daily basis and doesn't really care about anyone else. My dad spends all of his time trying to calm her down.) 

Again, I don't hate life. I hate the fact that I can't experience it - I feel like I can only live vicariously through the lives of others. I would gladly go back to school if I didn't already have so many loans.  I don't see much of a way out of this, and the more I consider it, the more appealing driving somewhere beautiful and simply going to sleep seems. 

I'm sorry if this is horribly written and makes no sense, it's 5 am here. 

EDIT: I'm not sure if anyone is going to read this, but because the majority of my loans are private, I can only defer them by going to school. My parents cosigned my loans so I can't apply for bankruptcy without affecting them. "

q5ba2,1,2012-02-25,Visited my SO... and now I no longer have one...?,[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/q5ba2/visited_my_so_and_now_i_no_longer_have_one/,"My (former) SO and I have had a long, ridiculous past. This year, though, I decided to take a chance. I convinced my feelings to my long-time-crush-thing, and he reciprocated.

Two months of communication later- we were talking all day, every day. He'd call me when he knew I was walking home from work; I'd accidentally wake him up with texts. I'm bad at time zones. :)


Anywho, things were going extremely well, and when a trip to his area in California became an option, I jumped on it. A couple hundred dollars provided me with a vacation, a wonderful visit to my boything, and opportunities for internships.

My SO had plans, so I waited for my ex to pick me up from the airport. I went to dinner with my ex and his friends. 

The next morning, I went to the beach with friends. 
Finally, I met up with my SO at a show. He was happy to see me, but a simple hug was all that materialized this excitement.
My stomach sunk.


Hours later, he found me and told me he and his friends were going for dinner. I asked if I could join and did.

After some nommy noms, we went and enjoyed some trees. His friend was there, but he soon caught on and departed.

We kissed.
Then we sat through Monsters Inc.

My SO took me into the guest bedroom and stood awkwardly as he told me I could sleep in there. My stomach sunk further as I assumed he no longer felt attraction towards me.


I texted him a few minutes later, telling him I was cold. It was my last ditch effort to get him into the bed.

He told me to grab a blanket off of the couch.

I cried.
When I woke up in the morning, he was playing his guitar.
The California sunlight swarmed the room, and I literally felt as though I was in a dream.


We got Starbucks. He took me to meet up with some friends.
Then, he awkwardly hugged me.


Since then, he has not contacted me.
No calls. No texts. No Facebooking.

Radio silence.
My heart is breaking.
Even though our relationship was new, it was important.

I am sad.



TL;DR: My SO and I were 2,500 miles apart. I visited and nothing happened. He stopped talking to me.

q5b93,23,2012-02-25,"I've been straight-ish my whole life, but suddenly find myself desperately wanting a girlfriend. Confusion! Help?",PixelatedMouse,bisexual,https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/q5b93/ive_been_straightish_my_whole_life_but_suddenly/,"This is my first real Reddit post, and I have no experience with any of this, so please be gentle with me. 

  I'm 20 and I live in Los Angeles. I've been pretty much straight my whole life. I've always found girls attractive, and I find myself checking them out sometimes, but not the way I check out guys (not necessarily in a sexual way, although I do often notice their bodies). I've only ever had boyfriends, and the most I've ever done with a girl is kissed one. I've had two serious, long term relationships with boys. One I dated for two and a half years, one for one and a half. Both times I've been potentially open to a threesome with another girl, or at least liked the thought of it, and both times after the breakup I've found myself considering the possibility of a girlfriend. After the first breakup, I was going to Mills college in Oakland, which is an all girls school, and so I was considering a girlfriend for that reason. Now however, I'm back in Los Angeles and am leaving for Berlin in a few weeks for a paid internship. I went through a breakup about two months ago (I think), and although I've slept with a few guys, I haven't really wanted to or been seriously interested in anyone since the breakup. I've just been trying to force myself into liking someone, because I feel like that's the norm for me I think.

  A week or two before Valentine's day, I started thinking about a great date to take a girl on. I joked about it for a second in my head, kind of planning it out, and then I thought ""I'd love to take a girl out on a date like that. I'd be the best boyfriend ever!"". I know that is incredibly dumb, and that a lesbian relationship doesn't have a boyfriend and girlfriend dynamic, but somehow I fixated on that idea. I'm not sure why, but I feel like I should say this. I'm very girly. I wear heels everywhere, I giggle, and I typically like my boyfriends to be the dominant ones. I love being a girl and don't want to be anything else. Somehow, though, I seem to be thinking more and more that I would make a fantastic boyfriend, for lack of a better term. I've been thinking that I'd love to be the dominant one sexually, and that I'd love to dote on a girl and take her out and do sweet and lovely things with her. 

  I initially thought it was just that, and that I wasn't really sexually attracted to girls. That maybe it was just that I don't think I could ever be attracted to a submissive boy, so I was just switching teams for that idea. I've always thought of myself as only liking girls in my head, and even then only above the waist. As I've started thinking this over, however, I've started having these fantasies. I think of having a girlfriend, and all the things I could do with her and to her. I imagine being dominant in bed, and with a girl specifically, and it actually interests me. A lot. Instead of fantasizing about boys, I now fantasize about kissing a girl, pressing her up against a wall, feeling her chest against mine (maybe doing some other things, but I'll stop there for your sakes).

  I just have no idea what to make of this. I'd love to try a girlfriend, but I have no idea if I'm actually interested in girls or not because I just have this fantasy, this idea, and no real experience. I don't want to experiment on someone and then find out I'm straight. In fact, I don't want to use anyone as an experiment at all. That seems so horrible, especially because I feel like everyone else pretty much knows what their sexuality is by now, and it feels to me like I'm mocking people who are actually bi or lesbian by just trying it out to see if it fits. There's the huge chance that I'm just fixated on this idea in my head and that in reality I'm actually totally straight. Then again, I was never able to find guys sexually attractive until I had had a positive sexual experience with one. 

  I'm not sure I'll be able to figure this out  unless I try, and I desperately want to try. Which brings me to my next problem. I'm sure no girl wants to fool around with and/or date a straight girl, especially one that has no sexual experience with other girls. I wouldn't even know where to start, really. I mean obviously I know how my own body works, but I can't help feeling there's a bit more to lesbian sex than that (you know, just a bit). On top of all that, I don't know how to pick up girls, and I have no idea if I'm attractive to other women. I get in to bars all the time, and someone suggested that I try a lesbian bar, but I don't know if that's how this works. I just feel so clueless and inexperienced, and I'm completely confused. I especially don't want to hurt anyone, or demean anyone by being some dumb little straight girl who thinks she likes girls for half a second and then finds out she doesn't really. Help? Please?

(Also, sorry for the giant wall of text and the shitty writing. It is late at night, and i had a lot to say, but I'm being horribly inarticulate. I'm so much better with words when I'm speaking them.)"

I've never had a girlfriend, and while I can make the friendzone excuse all day I know my own cowardice is the ultimate reason for this failure. I feel like I'm going to be stuck in college forever, doomed to taking classes I could give a fuck about that aren't really relevant to what I want to do; and perhaps worst of all I feel like I'm the retard in the school for geniuses (I'm an Aerospace Engineering Student). I'm only happy when I'm just slacking off and at home with my high school friends, and that scares the shit out of me. I don't want to fall into a life of mediocrity that most of the species happily pursues without a second thought; hell even most of the students at this school don't really want to do anything important with their lives beyond being one of a thousand nameless engineers on some project that does precisely jack shit at advancing the aerospace industry beyond the same boring flying tube they've been building since the 60s. I feel like no matter how hard I try to go after my dreams they always seem to get pushed just a little further away. After 4 years of college I FINALLY got a reasonable shot at an internship, but I'm so used to companies turning me away that part of me is convinced it will never happen.

In my life, I am always constantly interested in learning about many diverse things, but I never become greatly proficient at those things (or become expertly knowledgeable in a given subject). For example, one day I'll be reading about dark matter and dark energy and black holes because it seems so fascinating, the next day I'll be reading about apes that have learned sign language and watching videos about it. Then I'll watch a discovery channel special on endangered orangutans, read about lighting and colors in OpenGL(Im a Computer Science and Engineering Major), look up pictures and rumors about this year's planned Jordan releases, boot up the xbox and keep trying to fix my Gears of War ranked statistics, look at the revenue made for my youtube channel and try and think of other ways to get exposure and make more money, and then try and figure out how to get the most calories and protein in my diet to maximize my workout results. I could go on and on and on about all the different things I go on and read about, do, try, etc (weed, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu training and competing, gaming, programming, and blah blah) but I want to get to the point of my post here. 

   I feel like while it is extremely fun learning and trying all kinds of things, I am not really becoming an expert in any particular thing I do; the only consistent things in my life are my girlfriend, my major (I like programming but I hate the engineering side of things), working out, eating healthy, and gaming.  I feel like my curiosity (or imagination even) takes away from my focus a lot of times; I'm that kid in class who likes to doodle in his notes alot, which means I tend to have to go back and relearn some of the things for my classes. I was wondering if there was any particular way I could get into the habit of just focusing on specific things and getting very knowledgeable at that one thing. At the moment I really wish to just get really good at programming so I can get an internship before I graduate and start building up to a career (its my last year at my university). Also, I was wondering if this sort of thing was indicative of maybe the Attention Deficit Disorder? 

TL;DR I am very energetic and love learning new things, but feel very scrambled and easily distracted and wish to get into the habit of focusing on specific things to become less of a jack of all trades and more of a specialist on a few things. 

EDIT: With the nature of this topic, I thought it would helpful if perhaps people could post a few personal techniques of their own for not only retaining information but actually understanding it and developing fundamental problem solving skills. I know there's not some ""secret"" technique that would solve all (otherwise every student would be getting Straight A's) but everyone is different and everyone learns different ways.  "

I have been extremely fortunate to have already accepted two internship offers: Company A for the spring term, and Company B for the summer term.  However, just today, I received an offer from Company C, and this really is my dream internship.  

So, I want to do an internship at Company C in the summer, but want to find some way to push back the start date of Company B's internship to the spring.  This would mean Company A gets the ax.

I'm halfway through my arts degree, majoring in honours political science.  I've had some anxiety vis-a-vis the practicality of this choice for some time now, and in geography classes (minoring in that) and a recent internship I've been exposed to the world of GIS.   

GIS interests me as I've always been fascinated by maps and it seems to be a rapidly growing occupational field.  However, my knowledge of anything computer science related is slim to none.    

My question for you is if, in your opinion, job prospects in the field of GIS warrant switching majors while I still have the chance.  Its important to note that my school only offers two undergraduate courses that are explicitly concerned with GIS, so I am also wondering if completing my PSCI degree and taking the two GIS courses and subsequently obtaining a graduate diploma in GIS would provide me with an adequate level of education in the view of employers."

6. Male/female ratio for engineering?

7. How much should I expect my final costs to be? (including tuition, residency, etc)

8. I have a 94% average, am I likely to get accepted and/or receive scholarships?

I want to do a Masters in Civil Engineering and particularly want to specialize in Transportation. 
Thanks! 

**Edit:** Thanks guys! I really wanted to know what McGill would be like, and it seems awesome! Definitely my first choice."

I'm a junior in HS, and I've wanted to be an astronaut since I was around 8 years old. The problem is, last year was a wreck for me and although I think I'm out of the worst of it, my grades have tumbled and I face an uphill battle to bring them up. I'm preparing to take the SAT's and whatnot. I want to apply to schools like MIT or Cooper Union to get an engineering degree and hopefully intern somewhere like the Goddard Institute in New York City. 

My question is, do I even have a shot? I know the application process for good schools is extremely selective, and I know NASA's (and everything else) going through some tough times. Should I follow this through? Or give up before I fail? If you think I do have a shot, what can I do to accomplish my goal?

They aren't G4 ponies (it would be awesome if they were), but yeah, close enough. P.S. clicking on any artwork that comes up causes more artwork to come out.

I've just bought a domain and am beginning to build my portfolio website.  I'm just sketching ideas at the moment, so I wanted to gather some insight for the best approach to the task.  

Here's what I'm thinking- I'm graduating soon with a degree in Cognitive Psychology, so I haven't got much to show for experience in UX, though I've had two internships in the field, and my background is largely web-design based and pretty technical (I have skills in HTML &amp; CSS too).  I'd like to use my portfolio design itself as an example of my work, since it will actually be the first ground-up project I can show.  I'm thinking I should just go the route of designing it in photoshop and building it out in dreamweaver, but I'm not sure if there's another route that might be better at showcasing relevant skills.  

So far my plan is that the site will contain a breakdown of how I went about building it (to showcase my thought-process and design workflow), my cv, and other creative endeavours including my photography and filmography. 

I'd really like to hear any thoughts you guys have on the matter from a more experienced perspective.

Cheers! Meredith"

q6yex,6,2012-02-26,"Ladies of Reddit, I could use some help. I just found out my fiance (4 years together) cheated on me - bad - 2 years ago while on a trip overseas. What are the chances we can stay together given the circumstances?",Sorry_Dude,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/q6yex/ladies_of_reddit_i_could_use_some_help_i_just/,"I'm crushed. We were in a good place. I'd like it to work out, but recidivism on these sort of thing is damn near 100%, right? 

Back story: Two years ago, she graduated college and got a 2-week internship in Southeast Asia. She stayed for 6 weeks (against my wishes) and while there convinced me to fly out and meet her. Before I got the chance near the end of her trip, she was robbed and came home before my flight left. By chance, my trip was cancelled. 

I suspected strongly she was cheating on me with one or more guys, but certainly one, while over there. I also figured it was more than a one-night stand because his salacious messages on her on her FB wall quickly disappeared. 

The inquiry: During her trip, I suspected something was going on. All the signs were there. I begged her to tell me and she insisted I was being jealous etc. After her trip I basically found out, but without hard evidence, all I could do is ask her to tell me the truth and let the chips fall. She insisted nothing happened. I had asked her while she was abroad, specifically, if I was flying out and going to find her with a new boyfriend? She lied. I tried to believe her. I'm reasonable and forgiving, but not totally stupid. Later, getting insecure from time to time about this, I begged her for the truth so we could move on. 
She lied to my face without hesitation, total denial, maybe 10 times between 2010-2012. 

Despite my concerns our relationship did well. We got counseling. I was told my fears were normal but unfair. I needed to trust her and so I did. I began to trust her again. We got engaged. Our families are very close and she and I live together and run a business together. 

Fast forward to January 2012. She left on vacation again, this time to Central America for 20 days without my blessing. With her dad. I wanted to go with, but work wouldn't allow me the time off until April. Her dad had to go on vacation in Jan/Feb, so I was left at home.

The Discovery: I was cleaning the house in preparation of her arrival home. In the living room on the floor - plain sight - I found a black berry with Thai writing on the keys. Never seen it before. I honestly tried not to look - for 1.5 seconds. Then loneliness and curiosity got the best of me. 

The Details: She was carrying on a relationship the whole time she was gone. Fully - banging this guy, maybe more, but one over and over, maybe 20 times in 40 days. She was texting him salacious stuff. 100% guilty. Between messages about how excited she was to have sex with him later, she texted me that she was thrilled I was coming to meet her. My messages to and from her were dispersed through a sickening lattice of adulterous text messages that are hard to forget. 

So now she's coming home in 2 days. It's her birthday the day she gets home. I confronted her on the phone and she says she's sorry. She's devastated. It was the only time. She's been keeping some contact with the guy, Jonathan, through Facebook since then, she admitted, but not regularly. She's so sorry. She says she was in a bad place then and now were good and she want's to have my babies. ETC. 

So...

What should I do. I love/loved her. Dearly. I was all in with her. But this hurts.

  
tl;dr: Fiance cheated on me and lied about it repeatedly for two years after until she was straight busted. Any chance of salvage or is this sort of thing game over?  
   



**UPDATE: she's going to read this thread again in a few hours. If anyone has anything to add to her that might help, it would be most appreciated**

[¬ø What scarred you for life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uxs6t?context=5)|The one thing I will NEVER forget is a young girl who hung around on the weekends.  I had a suspicion that she was younger than 18 but she claimed she was 18.  When I asked to see her ID, she showed it to me and it looked legit (holograms and what not) and said she was 18.  I come in one weekend and ask where she is because she was not around.  It turns out she was a runaway who got sucked into the sex trade which is rampant in Ohio and was shipped down to Columbus.  Guys were passing her around upstairs for 10 bucks a pop.  She was 14.    I felt fucking horrible for not trusting my gut. I guess I will tell you something else since I already posted something about a young girl who was a a runaway and was passed from guy to guy for 10 dollars a pop.  Another instance involved another prostitute.  She was legit mentally handicapped, could barely function.  She started showing up towards the end of my time there.  She was passed around as well but I believe her rate was 5 for sex.  Apparently she was having a heart attack and a guy just put her in the elevator and pressed the down button so she would come to the lobby.  The elevator opened and she was obviously in need of help.  I laid her down and called an ambulance.  It turned out it wasn't a heart attack but she turned out to be alright and showed back up later that night.
[Since when is the sex trade rampant in Ohio?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uyh9v?context=5)|Toledo is a huge hub for interstate human trafficking.  I will find some stats if I get a chance.  I'm not insulting Ohio, it is just that you can get to somewhere like 75% of the country within 24 hours from Ohio. http://www.examiner.com/women-s-issues-in-toledo/recent-study-cites-toledo-as-fourth-worst-city-nationally-for-human-trafficking-offenses.
[Did you make friends with any of the people there and what did they think of you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uxv69?context=5)|Oh yea of course.  There were about 150-200 residents there. I tried my best to help everyone.  When I first showed up they thought I was a cop because I was white.  There was a guy James who would come and mop the lobby every night at 3 AMish.  We built a pretty strong bond.  I helped him make a resume and he eventually got a job because of it.  I found out that he had never eaten out at a breakfast restaurant so I took him to breakfast one morning after I got off and he had a blast.  The funny thing was he ordered a burger and fries for breakfast.  There were plenty of people I made friends with they were usually older than me though.
[What can you tell us about your views on systemic problems? That is, on a macro scale, what problems do you see with the overall system (i.e., the governmental response to poverty via the policing system/war on drugs, welfare system, social services, education, etc) that have impacted the lives of people where you work? Do you have a sense of what changes could be made to improve these people's lives over the long-term?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uyixj?context=5)|As with anything else on the macro scale it all comes down to money.  These residents cant afford to pay 1000+ dollars of rent every month so they are ignored.  Columbus is also trying to gentrify the west side where these projects are so they are in talks to blow this building up because they dont make money off of it.  The police really could give two shits about this place.  I called the police plenty of times and it would take them an hour or more to show up. That's what pissed me off the most.  They would show up, write things down and leave.  Even if we had video footage they would say that a detective would be there Monday to investigate and the detective would never come. This happened twice. If you do not have money you are fucked. The fucked up thing is that say a person who is paying 20 bucks a month in rent gets a job.  Their rent immediately goes up to about 460 dollars a month.  Most jobs residents got were minimum wage so how are you supposed to work you way out of the system when the system keeps taking any money that a person makes. I do not see a wide spread change such as tearing the building down and giving residents housing assistance working for everyone.  I talked to residents all the time about how life could get better and it seemed like a more micro approach would work.
[460 dollars a month? I live in Columbus and that's more than I pay... Is that comparable to other apartments in the neighborhood?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v4sn4?context=5)|I am not sure.  From what I saw while I was driving around that part of town there are not too many other apartments.  The location is ideal though.  Downtown Columbus is a half mile away.  Like I said rent was on a sliding scale, however I did not dig deeper into how they decided those rates.
[Did anyone ever lie about if they had a job to keep their rent down?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v0mx5?context=5)|Yea...I even advised a few to do so...
[What was the racial makeup of the residents?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uy620?context=5)|Racial makeup=80% black, 19% white, and two mexican guys.
[Was there ever a time where you saw someone being treated unfairly or being taken advantage of because of race, age, ethnicity, etc? If you saw this, did you ever feel compelled to do something about it? Could you have done something about it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uxsz6?context=5)|The Housing Authority (CMHA) really treated these people like dog shit.  Most residents barely paid rent. Rent is paid on a sliding scale so some residents paid like 20 bucks a month but that might have been 50% of their net worth.  Anytime ANYTHING went wrong in their apartments (flooding, heat not working in the middle of winter, AC not working in older residents apts in the summer) residents had to wait until monday.  I did my best to hound them until they sent someone out.  Sending someone out meant paying overtime and they were too cheap for that.  Maybe three times they sent someone out in the year I was there.  I tried to help and have basic mechanical skills but I am limited in my abilities to help.
[So you saw a lot of misery. But with 150-200 people there, and you with a (remarkably) open compassionate attitude, I'm guessing you also saw some good people trying hard to make good lives. Can you recall some things that *pleasantly* surprised you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uyc7q?context=5)|Oh yea there were plenty of people who just had slipped in life and they were working hard as fuck to make it back in their lives and when bad shit happened to them I just felt horrible because I knew they were working.  One big success story was that guy James who mopped the floors, he helped out anyway he could around the building.  Whenever pipes would burst he would be there to mop up the floor and put buckets down.  He would wash and wax floors. He got back on his feet. Got a job. And because of all of the work her put in around the building the building manager actually paid his rent for a year. I would say 2/3 of the residents were hard working people who either were injured or just kept fucking up and ended up there.
[What was the most dangerous situation you were put in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uxt1v?context=5)|There were plenty of times I had to defend myself.  One time in particular a couple was walking into the lobby to go up to their apartment.  Another couple came up behind them (who did not live there) and tried to snatch the ladies purse and beat up the guy.  I hopped over the desk and had to ""L"" the one guy out until he agreed to leave.  I saw his lady Friend reach into her purse and pull out a knife at which point I let them go.  They left and I called the police.  I believe they were caught later.  I HATE bullies and to see that just pissed me off.
[What is ""L""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uymlg?context=5)|It is a choke hold.  Looks almost like a sleeper hold.  One arm goes across the throat and the other one behind the head.  It immediately shuts off the airway.
[""L""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uynmg?context=5)|Sorry it must be something we called it growing up.
[Kill niggers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uzo1t?context=5)|The funny thing is, the couple who was doing the robbing was white..
[What? o.o.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uyp06?context=5)|I explained it above, it was a chokehold. I am sure it has many names.

[*cwitics.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v0cow?context=5)|Damn autocorrect.
[What was the biggest moral decision you had to make there? and how great was the racial tension between you and the majority black population there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uyb5t?context=5)|Moral decision....that is a tough one.  I would say always just trying to remain unbias no matter how shitty a particular resident had treated me.  I  was threatened pretty much on a weekly basis. I just brushed it off.  But the next week they would usually be apologetic (and sober) and would ask for some kind of help.  There wasn't too much racial tension. It wasn't like they hated me because I was white.  Once they got to know me and realized I had grown up in Baltimore and was not just some rich ohio state student they started to accept me. However I was called ""cracker"" and ""honky"" on a regular basis and I had to explain to them that this wasn't ""the jeffersons"" and those words dont sting anymore.
[What was the craziest thing you saw?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uxrxn?context=5)|There are a lot.  I wouldn't say this was the craziest.  I mentioned my craziest in a previous post.  A particular resident was really off the hook.  Let's call him E.  He was addicted to crack and would wander the streets all night and just steal from people (how this guy survived this is beyond me) but he would show up every night with a cart full of stolen goods/shit he found in the dumpster and try to sell it to me.  I started calling him Bubbles but he didnt get the reference. The craziest thing was probably this twenty something year old guy who had alot of women in and out of his apt.  One day during the day shift (I wasnt there but saw on camera later) a girl came and started arguing with him in the lobby.  He beat her within an inch of her life.  Closed fist punches and everything.  Once she was on the ground he booted her right in the jaw.  Teeth and blood were everywhere.  When I had gotten to work I noticed the stain and asked the working second shift what that was and he said it was the womans blood.
[""He just waltzes in there, and becomes the king of the carts. What the fuck does he think I'm supposed to do? ""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uy85j?context=5)|Yea man I am from Baltimore, so any chance I get to quote the wire. I take it.  I actually did a project at OSU which involved videos and references to The Wire...
[What is the story that you would most like to share with us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uxwni?context=5)|There are plenty of stories.  There was alot of crazy stuff there.  I mentioned some already.  One story that comes to mind was with this resident nicknamed Frog.  He was hooked on crack.  Right before I left he got hooked on bath salts which is a rising craze among addicts because it doesnt show up on piss tests.  He attempted to commit suicide and almost jumped but the fire dept saved him.  While I was there two people jumped (1 survived).  Two guys died from medical reasons.  One guy died from going fishing on a boat while drunk as hell and falling in the water and did not know how to swim.  A lot of misery there.
[What do they do with bath salts and how does this get one high?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uyt1r?context=5)|Haha I am still learning tryin to figure it out.  From what I have been told you snort em and it is just like a coke high.  I hope your not gonna go out and start snorting haha, shit will fuck you up.
[Was there a housing police force that policed the area?  If not, was it just the city police force?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uxt6y?context=5)|Yea, they came by usually once a night.  But they were pretty much rent a cops even though one was cool and former Air Force.  They were not armed.  Pretty much stopped by every night around 2 AM to take a shit in the employee bathroom haha.
[&gt;One day the cop arrested CT for a humble.   Do you mean that the cop's intent was to humble CT, or is ""humble"" some kind of slang for an amount of drugs or something like that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v1yc2?context=5)|Its slang, sorry its habit.  It means a minor misdemeanor charge (i.e. disturbing the peace etc.)
[What is the drug scene like in a project high-rise?  Is it run of the mill crack and impure heroin? Or since it's Ohio is meth a big deal?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uyv9y?context=5)|Not much meth.  Mostly crack and heroin. We had dealers come in and pay residents to move in with someone else so they could just set up shop in an apt and people would go right there.  They would usually last a couple of weeks and word would get out and they would either leave or be kicked out.  Like I said the police were useless. While I was working, there were two big drug guys everyone would go to for their shit.  One used to be a cat burglar who would pay hookers so he could go down on them (not the other way around haha), and the other was more of a stone cold dealer, never talking unless he needed too and people respected him.
[1) Did the residents ask you for money/handouts? 2) Did you ever give money to residents? 3) Ever get mugged/robbed or items stolen while on the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uytbv?context=5)|1.)ALL THE TIME! haha.  every night it was ""hey john, you got a dolla?"" Usually people would come with four quarters and ask for a ""hard dollar"" because the dealers didn't like change 2.) No, I would sometimes give change for a dollar if i knew they were using it for laundry 3.) No but someone did put nails under my tires so that they would go flat.  One of them did, I was lucky all four didnt.  I was careful to keep all my stuff locked up and my car within sight in the parking lot.
[&gt;Hey john, you got a dolla](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v6av4?context=5)|I need dolla dolla....dolla is what I need.
[Did you ever have to take the witness stand in court for something that went down during your shift?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uy88q?context=5)|After that attempted robbery the columbus police took my info but I was never called.  The guy who was working during the beating of that woman was asked to be a witness but turned it down.  He was changing jobs soon and didnt want the hassle.
[Good luck, and congrats. My wife's an LISW, MSW, from OSU.  *edit* I had asked first if graduation was in June, then remembered OSU is switching to semesters, from quarters, and it all made sense. You going to go to grad school at OSU?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v23ey?context=5)|No. I am moving back to Baltimore and going to grad school at the University of Maryland. Not at OSU.  They are still on the quarter system so technically they have 3 or 4 graduations a year.  I planned it so I graduated this quarter so I can get a jump start on getting a job.
[This is off topic but I'm thinking about joining the military to help pay for college. Are you happy with your decision to do so?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v1soh?context=5)|I do not regret the experience.  I do regret not being more prepared to handle my recruiters.  The GI Bill was def worth it but make sure when you go in you are doing what you want to do and not what your recruiter nudges you to do.  What branch are you considering?
[&lt;3 BC.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v1vdy?context=5)|Moi aussi.
[Did you like Seattle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v0qf2?context=5)|Loved it..I was a lacrosse coach on bainbridge island...I have a lot of great memories out there.
[Were the police shown the video evidence? what did they say about it? What is the reasoning behind them not making an arrest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v7cqr?context=5)|Yes they were shown evidence...they said I detective would be along Monday to investigate further....no detective showed up....it happened multiple times.
[Jeez.  How many justified arrests were made while you worked there in comparison to all the crime that was going on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uz6j0?context=5)|Honestly, one.  A guy named E who I compared to Bubbles from ""The Wire"" was arrested one time for selling stolen goods.  It was some shameful shit. Cops were there almost every weekend but no arrests were ever made.
[Sounds weird.. but has someone ever died while you were working?  Natural or otherwise?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uyp6l?context=5)|Oh shit...I almost forgot.  This did happen.  I think my second month working there.  A woman came in looking for her brother.  I called up to his apt but there was no answer.  She said that no matter what he always had lunch with their brother every saturday and he had not shown up or answered his phone.  I got a sinking feeling when she said that. I called the police (this had to happen for me to go into someones apt without their permission) they came and I opened the door and saw this guy laying there.  He was dead and I had to go down there and console his sister and nephew.
[Oh man, that sucks for them.  You ever find out what it was from?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uzk25?context=5)|He had heart problems.  I asked around and people told me it was a heart attack but I never saw a medical report or anything.
[So what's the solution?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uybei?context=5)|There is no solution really.  I could take it on a case by case basis but it is up to the people to want to change.  Believe it or not some people loved that existence and did nothing to better their situation no matter how much I tried to advocate for them.  They would just keep making excuses. It's sad really.
[If you had the capability, would you dust off and nuke the whole site from orbit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uyojv?context=5)|No haha, although after some rough nights I wish I could.  I did joke that we should somehow get the drug dogs into the building for a surprise raid and I would sit outside in a lawn chair drinking beer and laugh at how many drugs are thrown out the windows..
[My dad worked at a liquor store across the street from the projects, he always had a gun on him, in plain sight did you do the same?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uygad?context=5)|No I never carried a gun.  I am pretty good with my hands (boxing, wrestling etc.).  I know the corner store workers by the projects here had a gun.  A guy came back pissed off because the store owners pulled the gun on him for apparently no reason.  I didnt believe the guy at first but I could see how distraught he was.  I felt bad for him.
[Which do you think comes first; homelessness or addiction?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uyvkj?context=5)|Addiction definately.  Most of the residents were referred there from a local shelter called the faith mission.  None of the ones I talked to that used to be homeless were clean while they were homeless.
[Sorry, read through a little bit more and wanted to ask another question.  You're from Baltimore, where the drug trade and problems with the city was much publicized by The Wire (and David Simon in general).  Then, you worked in Columbus, which I think most people would be surprised had a ghetto at all.  Anyway, do you think the publicity of Baltimore's inner city helped it?  Does Columbus struggle to get help/resources because of an out of sight/out of mind mentality?  Or, do you think it has no effect at all?  Lastly, I'm assuming you're white because of your white flight comment.  Did race play any role in how the tenants treated you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v9hk0?context=5)|The only thing ""the wire"" helped was to open up people's eyes to a society they had no idea was 10 mins away from their fed hill rowhome.  I have not seen any reform or resources thrown to the west side of Baltimore since the wire came on the air although the ports which were focused on in season 2 seem to be doing a little better. Columbus's west side has its own reputation which is very well known.  Politicians know about it.  However right now it is going through a gentrification process.  A casino is being built and I believe 2 public housing complexes have been destroyed (dont quote me on that figure, I know of one for sure Riverside Bradley).  The projects that I worked in are scheduled for demolition but the date keeps getting pushed back so who knows.  Some resources such as section 8 housing vouchers are being thrown their way but besides that there is a long way to go.  FInally race did play a big role at first and in time that dwindled.  At first they assumed I was a cop because I was white, and then people took a long time to warm up to me which I expected.  After they realized I was not just some rich Ohio State University kid whose mommy and daddy paid for everything they warmed up to me pretty quick.  I said before that racial terms like Honky and Cracker and Whiteboy were thrown around but they never affected me.
[So, I notice a lot of negative questions, which is normal, but as someone who spent  years living in and around the projects I always was impressed by the underground economics of the place.  The residents are seriously very ingenuitive and find interesting ways to make money (fixing things that are FUBAR, getting ppl. free cable, making homemade meals for lunch etc...).  What are some interesting ways you saw people making money?  Also, as far as gangs go, did you notice the gangs and other organizations helping to police the community, or in your eyes were just making everything worse?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v9dd6?context=5)|Oh many the economy of the projects was amazing.  You nailed it.  People would make money doing anything.  Some people would clean your apartment.  There was one guy who would fix your car, another who would wash it.  Women would do your hair.  One sign I saw hung up offered to actually bathe people (this included a foot scrub and cleaning behind the neck haha).  There was always a way for people to make money. As far as gangs go, there was not too much activity in the actual project.  Dealers were there, however gangs were not their muscle at least in the building.  In the surrounding communities they were active.  However the dealers did try to help the residents.  They bought a TV for the lounge area, they would order the boxing fights and throw parties, and they would order pizza for random people and sometimes even pay peoples rent.  However if you got in debt to the dealers you better believe you would do your damndest to pay them back.  As long as you were on their good side you were fine.  However, I have digressed.  To your question of self policing, most of the time this is what happened.  People would fuck up and others would either help or punish whoever was involved.  Police were called quite often but it was mostly for minor squabbles. I hope I answered your question.
[Did any of the statues or props in the inner city houses come to life overnight?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uzfq6?context=5)|Naaa I dont think the golden tablet was there...probably stolen by one of the fiends and pawned.
[To my knowledge there is really only one true high rise projects in Columbus, by osu east? Is this where you worked?  Assuming you went to osu, how would you compare where you worked to the section 8 around campus?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v1cg3?context=5)|The one I worked at u can see it from 315. It is called sunshine terrace. I'm not sure if there are others..its on the westside by mt carmel west. I did not hang out too much by the on campus housing I live up in Dublin. So I can't compare.
[Also a question. ive done work with at-risk kids in these kinds of projects.   Are there any programs in place by you to help keep the kids off the streets, and out of the whole poverty cycle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uzhoi?context=5)|There were not any kids in these projects except for maybe those that visited on weekends.  We had one little guy call 911 and hang up in the lobby and all kids of cops and fire engines showed up.  I do work with at risk youth at my internship and there are alot of programs to help them get off the streets.  Two are LiFE Sports and Camp Mary Orton's Wilderness bond program.  Both can be found online..
[Why is it relevant that you're white?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v4w1e?context=5)|Its not.  I was just putting it in the title to get people's attention...it worked.
[Did you ever have any homo erotic experiences with any of the people that lived there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v07xm?context=5)|Aaaaaaalllllll the time....jjjjjuuusssstttt kkiidddiiinngg....there wasnt too much man love but I knew for sure three gay guys who lived there....its not exactly the most welcoming demographic.
[Were there any kids growing up there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v6d84?context=5)|No..kids would visit on the weekends and stuff but there were no kids living there.
[Mine is.....](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uzctz?context=5)|Nice...just recently discovered the band I love their shit. Although you could be a Dicken's lover haha.
[Why did you feel the need to call out that you are white?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v18kz?context=5)|Gotta be honest on this one.  It was kind of a big deal with people around here knowing that I was a white guy working in a predominately black housing project.  I could care less either way but it was just habit I suppose..

My parent's are both extremely uneducated. While they are both very supportive they don't understand what I am doing most of the time. I have a part time job at staples. plus the revenue from my free lancing that helps me pay for exams, books, supplies, track stuff etc. I live in downtown los angeles in an apartment with one bedroom. I take a bus for two hours to get to school, then 8 hours of school, 3 hours of track, 2 hours back home, 4 hours of studying/homework, 2 hours of client work. I've been able to go to a private school and go to camps because of scholarships. With the little time I have left after academics and athletics, I practice the guitar, drums, saxophone and bass guitar. All things I have acquired from trades for creating websites or various pages from businesses downtown. Usually if I work for a nice business I get monetary payment. My father is diabetic and my mother has heart issues. I pay for my dad's medicine and some of old friends help cover medical bills. Every day is a struggle and I always feel like I am pressured to succeed.

More recently though my mother has been needing more and more medication and my part time job just doesn't award enough money for her medicine. I know reddit is full with kind people. I know it is asking for a lot but I desperately need 600 dollars to pay for her medicine.  "
q6ffv,0,2012-02-26,"Reddit: I'm at a career crossroads, so to speak.",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/q6ffv/reddit_im_at_a_career_crossroads_so_to_speak/,"I'm going to try and make this as concise as possible but essentially I just need some slight guidance.

I am currently in my last semester at post-secondary taking a radio broadcasting program (which I love) and as part of our final requirement for graduating we must conduct a month long internship of our choosing. It doesn't have to be in radio necessarily as long as it still utilizes the skills we've come to learn over the years.

Going into the program I always knew I wanted to more so get into sound design for visual media (specifically video games which I love EVEN more) but the tuition costs on some of the schools out here, and in general, ushered me away. I chose radio because I would be able to learn a decent set of skills that could transfer into sound design, specifically production, on top of learning some marketing, accounting, sales, and in general, a more variety set of skills.

I'm not upset on my choice in school but more at a crossroads as to what to do with my internship, and possibly after that is completed. I had a slight in at a video game developer out where I live to hopefully get an internship with their sound design department but that unfortunately fell through which absolutely devastated me. I was able to rebound and manage to snag an internship at a radio station instead and I have no doubts it will be a good learning experience, but in the end, it's not what I want to do. Since the initial developer internship fell through I have applied to roughly 9 other companies in the area with no response even in the slightest. In fact it seems increasingly difficult to get any to even acknowledge my existence. It seems like having an ""in"" is the only way to go.

Essentially I'm left at a crossroads because I feel that if I don't get an internship doing some I know I'll love doing...than I'll have no progress, or chance, to achieve what I truly want in life.

What do?

TL;DR: Radio Broadcasting student. Want to get into sound design for video games, lost potential internship at a developer, have one at a radio station. Don't feel like it will get me to my overall goal."
q6erj,3,2012-02-26,22 m4f - stuck home on a saturday night -_- pic inside if it helps,[deleted],r4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/q6erj/22_m4f_stuck_home_on_a_saturday_night_pic_inside/,"Yeah, I'm stuck home on yet another Saturday night.  I've been so busy lately with my student teach internship, night classes, and part time job, that I don't really plan anything.  I don't get to see people much in leisure, mostly just school and work and all that stuff.

During the little free time I have, I'm pretty much on reddit or on my motorcycle so this could tie in to that I guess.

For what it's worth, [this](http://i.imgur.com/CeCJO.jpg) is my most recent picture.

That smudgey shit on my face is from helping some guy on the street change his tire.  I was riding my motorcycle for fun, and when I do that, I stop to help anyone I see (why not, if I'm not going anywhere in particular I might as well lend a hand), and this time was no different.

Anyway, I'll be here.  I'm not going anywhere anytime soon...that I know of at least."
q6eby,14,2012-02-26,Admitted to PhD without funding. Is there even a point?,[deleted],GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/q6eby/admitted_to_phd_without_funding_is_there_even_a/,"Throwaway account (I'm paranoid).

Yesterday, I just got admitted to a doctoral program via e-mail. However, it said ""Your offer is for admission only and does not include aid. Due to very limited funding, there were very few offers with aid that were made."" I have mixed feelings about this. Although it is great that I have a foot in the door, if I keep walking down that hall, I may end up in a worse place than when I started. In my opinion, no funding completely defeats the purpose of doing a PhD. You're supposed to get paid to work in your field, not pay to do work. Shit, an unpaid internship is a better deal. But if I don't get into any of the other schools I applied to or if they make similar offers, it may be my only way to a PhD. So has anyone else been in a situation like this? If so, what did you decide to do? Was it a good decision?"
q6djm,1,2012-02-26,How do I find an internship for this summer? (Musicians' advice please),Bledrosoft,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/q6djm/how_do_i_find_an_internship_for_this_summer/,"I am a junior undergrad music composition major in Nashville. Here's my skill set:

-compose for various settings (large and small classical ensembles, jazz combos and big band, MIDI mockups and fully sequenced music as well, using Logic and Reason)

-Skilled jazz and classical pianist, or any style really. Have played in numerous bands around town. (have teacher rec's if I need them)

-Very experienced with Finale; have had many original compositions and arrangements performed at music festivals and have done typesetting for a few professionals in the area, also freelanced many charts for worship leaders around town

-Great people skills, very focused and committed, quick learner.

I'm not trying to impress anyone here, obviously, but I've put down all that I think may be worth letting a studio/prospect know about me. Am I doing this right? What should I do after I've got a resume like this put together?

In fact, what kind of stuff is out there? I know I probably won't compose at all in an internship, but it'd be so awesome to just be around some composers who do their thing professionally in a studio. Or, I am also interested in being a session pianist. I don't know how much the two could go hand in hand, but I am working toward both goals as options.

Thank you very much to anyone who has read this far and is willing to share your advice with me!"

My university focuses on the mathematical analysis of algorithms and data structures, so I'm alright with programming something to run well/efficiently.

I can make a moderate to nice looking website and know CSS, PHP, and Javascript.

I'm currently a 3rd year university student in Green Bay and am looking for industry experience in any form.  It isn't quite easy around here to find anything relevant without having prior database experience.  That said, I haven't worked with SQL, Access, or Oracle much.

I'm extremely willing and able to teach myself the skills needed for a project and would be willing to accept local or remote work.  I'm mostly looking for any industry experience, being a possible non-paid internship or simple project.

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Was the divorce fair?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3upvv9?context=5)|Not at all. I'm still paying for the attorney fees, I lost my house (along with everything I *ever* owned...my childhood pictures included), I paid over $1,200 a month in child support, and I only get to see my kids every other Saturday and Sunday. I also had to pay off her credit cards (over $7,000).   Having read what I just wrote, I'm embarrassed to say that my lawyer was horrible. I guess that's one reason why I want to keep this anonymous. If I had a better lawyer, I feel my life would be a hundred times better right now.
[Reading stuff like this makes my outrage meter go off the charts.  How the fuck does she even get your baby pictures?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3usdoa?context=5)|Well my mom and dad gave me all of the pictures when I turned 21. I took them in my house and put them in a memory fire proof box in the basement. I asked her if I could get them and she has told me (for quite a long time now) that she cannot find them. I suspect they were thrown away.
[Better call Saul!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3v3yd3?context=5)|Oh hells yes!
[NO DONT DO IT!!!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3uss4s?context=5)|Too late...
[Know anyone that was discharged? Dishonorably? What did they do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3uptrm?context=5)|Actually, the only person that would have been dishonorably discharged was caught drinking, and when he/she was being sent home, that person was put on suicide watch. Unfortunately, even without their weapon, the person stole the weapon of the suicide watch guard and committed suicide.
[What was the thing that sticks with you the most?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3uptrm?context=5)|The ability to read and understand people without knowing much about them has paid off in dividends. I would also say that my skills as a leader have definitely come in useful.
[What was the worst thing that you saw someone do? On both sides of the war.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3uptrm?context=5)|I saw an Iraqi police officer in my prison put his genitalia inside another prisoner's bullet wound. It was constantly infected and needed to be drained by a medic. He did it because he knew it was utterly disgusting. As for our side, I saw a gunner have to shoot a vehicle with women and children in it (with a machine gun). He did this because they were approaching his checkpoint with a vehicle and did not slow. After we checked it, they found napalm (or something like it) inside. That was fucked up because there were young kids in there.
[How much did you sell the company for and how much did you earn out of it ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3upijc?context=5)|I was a military police officer working in interrogations. I also worked with the extraction of HVTs (high value targets).
[What was your job at the army ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3upijc?context=5)|Before I sold the company, I had made between thirty and fifty thousand. I sold it for ten thousand and a job that pays fifty-four thousand. They tell me that I can earn a quick promotion to eighty-four thousand.
[Why did you write out the words of the numbers instead of just writing the numbers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3uugg0?context=5)|Hmm, I am not sure actually. I thought that after a certain point it was more correct to write out numbers than it was to put the literal representations of numbers.
[Do you have any tips on how to stay positive during tough times?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3urfvr?context=5)|Well I know its kind of lame to hear, but avoid booze as a cure. I literally drunk drove my car and crashed it twice in 1 year after things got real ugly. Then I realized I had become something I did not want to be and started my company. So I would say doing your best to remember that no matter how much life, family, love, shit in general sucks (like cancer) that everything gets better given enough time.
[Have you ever fought CQB and killed a man, if so what was it like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3upf68?context=5)|CQB, for those who don't know, is close quarters battle (aka close quarters combat). I've been in hostile CQB situations, but never had to shoot someone where they ended up as a fatality. To be honest, half of the time I didn't stop to check.
[So where are you now with things? Are you dating at all? How is your relationship with your kids?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3urb1x?context=5)|You are welcome! I was dating for a long time, but finally lucked out with a pretty calm, cool, crazy beautiful girl. My kids are doing much better now that I can take them to school on occasion and go to awesome place like Chucky Cheese. Plus they love how their old man will play the games with them and crawl in a ball pit. I get some odd glances sometimes.
[Do you know why your wife cheated on you? Was the person she cheated on with someone you knew, and are they still together?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3uq7tv?context=5)|I don't know the person who slept with her, but I do know that it is because she's not the type of person who could handle waiting on me to come home. I honestly wish I knew more than that, but I don't think I ever will.   Obviously I have no way of knowing for sure, but I don't think the guy she's with now was the one. She's dated multiple people since then.
[That sucks. How and when did you know she was not the type of person to wait? And is there a general ""type"" of person that does this or can it come out of the blue based off of stories you've heard?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3uqcrg?context=5)|I found out because a friend saw a car parked in my drive way everyday so he e-mailed me while I was deployed. I would look out for people who are overly needy and might not be self stable enough to survive without affection.
[What was the company?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3upg72?context=5)|I was attached to the 1033rd ID. Anything more than that is too descriptive, and I'd like to keep this anonymous so I can be open to questions. Besides, I really don't want my ex wife reading this.
[What type of cancer did you have? are you cancer free right now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3upkio?context=5)|I am cancer free, and I had vocal cord cancer.
[James Earl Jones deep?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3utv37?context=5)|Shit I wish! Nah, just a tad deeper. Like when I hear my voice mail message play I hardly recognize that it is my own voice. So I guess a small change is all it takes for you to sound like a totally different person.
[What kinds of weapons did you use in Iraq?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3uprof?context=5)|I had an M4 with a 203 attachment, red dot reflex sight, a day and night sight, a Surefire flashlight attachment, a 9mm, and when I was in the prison, we would use either mace, a shotgun, or a tazer.
[What kind of shotgun?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3us3s7?context=5)|Http://www.kingarms.com/productimages/ka-scope-16d.jpg.
[What did your company sell or do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3upk3m?context=5)|We built, installed, and repaired computers and networks for residential and small-business.
[Interesting....what do you think is better for that type of business? S corp or LLC? And what did you find was the best way of getting new clients and advertising etc? Do you feel that type of computer business is too saturated with competitors these days?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3urw50?context=5)|LLC for tax benefits and the ability to have some flexibility. I used a lot of online sites such as Groupon and Living Social. I also taught interns how to fix the computers so I could go to networking events. I found that being far more personable and charismatic whilst being a a local veteran made life easier.
[Very curious about this. If you don't mind my asking, could you elaborate on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3uus6v?context=5)|I used to think that God was indefinitely real and that I would go to Hell regardless of what I did if I did not believe that. After seeing some of the shit that goes on in war, what was left from Saddam's reign (which was fucking awful btw), and talking to Vietnam vets that this is not as true as I once thought.   I believe that if there is a god then they have to be so powerful that men killing men and planets being blown up are equally unimportant in comparison to the fact that we exist at all. I would not say I am an atheist, but especially after realizing how small I am in the scheme of things (the universe if friggin huge!) that things aren't as black and white as you either go to hell or heaven.   My favorite question for those who think I am wrong would be that why are indigenous people doomed to go to Hell when they may have never even heard about Jesus, God, Jews, or anything like that?
[100% agreed!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3v9qal?context=5)|See the posts (That I put in the wrong order, dammit!) above to see what I REALLY think! :)
[How did your business start? How did you grow it? How did you get it sold?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3ut1f9?context=5)|At first, it was an epiphany. I was sitting at my old job (before I got laid off) and thought to myself I should charge what they charge for my services and keep the money versus just getting less than 20% of what they charged. I think a lot of us IT guys end up doing that.  I started it by working out of home until I saved up enough money to get the world's smallest office (it wasn't that bad, but it gets shitty when every single surface has a computer on it waiting to be fixed).   I grew by word of mouth (I don't suck at what I do), awesome friends helping me out, and hiring interns instead of employees which means no pay, but they get awesome free experience. I also had help from a close friend who had his master's degree in marketing. Then I picked up an amazing book called Guerrilla Marketing which helped a ton with getting an edge over the god awful Geek Squad and local shops.  I sold it without intending to sell. Someone heard my story (a local head hunter) and told his close friend about what I had been through and what I did. The friend turned out to be the owner of another IT company and he said that he wanted me on board ASAP and was willing to pay for that to happen. Aka sheer luck.  tl;dr Had a great idea and worked from home. Got a small office. Friends helped me and an assload of research in growing. Someone heard about me and liked what they heard so they bought me out and hired me.
[Do you personally feel, after your interactions with prisoners and even HVT's, that the threat from terrorism and people such as the ones you dealt with is big enough to justify things such as the Patriot ACT, government wanting to put security camera's everywhere domestically, the NSA recording all calls, emails, txt's, etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3urh5b?context=5)|Not at all! Actually, I think terrorism being responded to by reducing your citizen's freedoms is the opposite of what we should do. Terrorism only works when we as a nation show that we are not able to recover and move on. Regardless, no matter what we do in terms of monitoring and prevention of terrorist attacks they will simply find or create new methods of attack.
[One more question if you don't mind. What is your opinion on ""enhanced"" interrogations? Do you feel there IS an appropriate situation/person or combination of both that would warrant using more than back-and-forth questioning? Do you think it would be effective?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3urrzt?context=5)|Interrogation with aid of certain drugs (similar to what the CIA has been claimed to use) would definitely benefit in the area of identifying when someone is lying and how they behave given certain circumstances. Simple questioning does not always work and if they know they can just not say anything and nothing will happen to them.
[What's your OS?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3usu5r?context=5)|Lol, Windows 7 Ultimate. Ultimate because I didn't have to pay. I also dual boot Red Hat for my efforts of trying to be better at Linux, but my Linux skills are fail.
[Thanks for the response! i'm always interested to hear from other small business owners! any chance you could provide a link to the new/existing company website?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3ves34?context=5)|Can't do that, it would be a tad too direct and would reveal who I am almost exactly.
[I know that me asking this will be considered shit based on the series of kicks to the balls you've received, but what could you have done to warrant a court of law allowing an Iraq war veteran who was cheated on to lose everything including childhood photos?  What was the defense for that?  Your physical condition?  Unemployment?  Just curious.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3uznd4?context=5)|I did not lose the photos in court, she claimed she could not find them and I had already moved out so I was not allowed to go look for them. In court, at least in my state, divorce is a no fault thing meaning that everything is split up regardless oh how much a POS someone might have been. So that never even came up in court at all unfortunately. I gave up the house because I knew I would have to work since she had not worked in years and my children would need a home to call their own. The crappy thing about that was the court saw that as her taking on a debt (the house was not paid off) so they added up the value of our stuff and it was still less than the amount of 'debt' she had incurred. Had I known that would happen I would have fought for it!
[As someone who is going to become commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Marine Corps that will probably branch Field Artillery, what advice do you have for me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3uuf4o?context=5)|Stay officer and get your bachelor degree. As an officer you actually get a chance to change things, get paid well, and respect is a lot harder to attain, but once you prove yourself you never lose it. As an NCO I noticed that it didn't matter who I was, what my rank was, or what I had done. The only people who made the big shots or could change a damn thing were so far up the officer chain that I was already too old to get there.  Honestly, don't marry until after she has proved herself with a deployment. Get both her family and your family together and see who could help her out with stuff you normally would do in the house. If you can afford it, get her a maid to visit every week or two. Anything that will help reduce her workload and reduce the amount of stress she would have by your absence. Plus make sure she is hanging out with friends, getting out once in awhile, and eating right. A lot of spouses get depressed and start to neglect many aspects of their own life.  I would also suggest that if you don't have kids yet either then wait until you get back. That was the hardest part for myself and many others. Coming home to kids who don't know if they should hug your or not because they hardly know who you are anymore is tough. I literally cried when my child wouldn't even talk to me because he was too shy around who seemed to be a new person in his life.
[Dude, why are you such a badass?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3urymo?context=5)|It's all in the Wheaties!  Actually, I think most bad asses are made from pretty shitty situations and survive. You either die or end up 'living' in another reality like heroine or crank otherwise.  I also eat my Wheaties and rock climb daily.
[What were some the most important (or interesting) things that you learned in 1.) Pre military Life 2.) Training 3.)Iraq and 4.) in the Civilian world?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3v1fpb?context=5)|Before I was in the military I found the fact that people are all supposed to find someone, settle down, and have kids terrifying and depressing. Then I realized (or thought I had) that when you had a kid that was just the way it goes.  In basic I found that I and my many comrades are a hell of a lot tougher than we may have thought we were. I was kind of a big nerd (I made a computer repair company after all) in high school so I did not think I was too tough. Plus I discovered that you didn't have to be huge, ripped, or super tall (I am kind of tall though) to be tough. Knowledge was far more important than size all of a sudden.  In Iraq I found that life is not all peachy like I thought it was. You see terrible things on the news everyday, but when you see it firsthand it becomes real to you as well as those it happens to. I was also surprised to see that most of the people I met were very nice, charismatic, intelligent (different than Americans of course, their education system lacks in nearly all parts except for religion), and was surprised when I even became friends with some of them. It turned out that even though their lives were way fucking harder than mine that they did not seem to become ruthless or unkind because of it. They just were people like me who wanted to see things get better just like everyone in the world does. Plus when I saw how some of them had literally hit rock bottom, seen desperation's ugly face, and lived to tell about it, but had never done a single thing to deserve it.   After I came back I had that shit storm of being cheated on/divorced/cancer hit me then found out that I could hit rock bottom just as those I had seen in Iraq may have felt and live to tell about it and even live a prosperous life.
[Strange question, but were you laid off from a company you joined after you left the military?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3us4e1?context=5)|I was in the National Guard so when I came home I went back to my regular job after 2 weeks of vacation. Side note: 2 weeks is not enough time to be integrated back into society without incident.
[Can military personnel be laid off?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3us4e1?context=5)|Military personnel cannot be laid off as far as I know, but you can be forced to retire after you get your 20 years if you pissed someone off or if the budget is THAT bad.
[Are you sad? :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3vauwz?context=5)|Lol, nope! I just figured by sharing all of this people would have some pretty inventive and interesting questions. Plus answering all of them gives me perspective. I am very happy nowadays, I should have made that a point earlier. Worry not, life has changed for the better and I think everything will be just fine.
[What kind of company was it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3urgde?context=5)|A computer and network build, install, and repair company.
[So are you set for life now? What are your plans now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3urszr?context=5)|With the experience of the new job and my degree I will never have to worry about finding a good job again. I plan on paying all of my debt off, buying a house by the end of the year, and possibly start a side business.
[Thank you for sharing your struggles with us on this AMA.  Did your ex-wife have a shaved pussy or a hairy bush?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3v08xd?context=5)|Hairy when I first met her and shaved for the rest of the time (except when she was pregnant).
[Why did you go to Iraq?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3uzryx?context=5)|I did not volunteer, I was deployed and as a part of my contract that I signed I was legally bound to. I also wanted to see part of the world that I may not have ever seen if I wasn't in the Army. Plus like I have said earlier I think we all need to help our society out even if sometimes you don't agree with it. It's not like by not going the war would not happen so we might as well send level headed intelligent people when we can to make the best of an ugly situation.
[2) Did your wife show any guilt or sign of remorse in the whole divorce process?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3v5frq?context=5)|She denies it to this very day and claims what my friend saw was a friend she had over on occasion. I asked who it was and she said she is not sure even though I told her the make and model of the vehicle my friend saw parked at my house rather regularly and the fact that he saw that it was a man. It made it worse that she showed every sign of being guilty as possible, but never admitted to anything.

Thank you again!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3us1r7?context=5)|I did and probably still do. Sometimes I just get super pissed off for no damn reason, get depressed to the point where I have real thoughts such as 'Man, I wish a drunk driver would hit me' or 'Why can't I wake up like Donnie Darko?'   I found that stopping being an alcoholic, take sometime to be alone for a long time (it was like a year of that), and smoking green when I feel like I want to punch a wall made my life infinitely better.
[Wow what a bitch, where do your kids stand in the situation and how old are they?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3volez?context=5)|They are 5 and 6, they have no idea what happened.

[Thanks for serving our country. You're awesome. Run for President maybe? :)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3utrgt?context=5)|I think I would never make it up there because I would eventually end up punching someone in the face (a moronic politician) for making a side remark that I didn't find funny. Also, I am a little too blunt for most politicians to tolerate plus I would probably talk a tad too much about what war is really like.
[Haha. What are you looking to do now career wise?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3w4154?context=5)|Fix computers for medium to large size businesses. Meaning far less overly high expecting residential customers.

[You misinterpreted what I meant. I'm simply stating that soldiers get lumped in together as a collective whole with our government. The government tell enlistees what to do and it gets done. All I'm saying is at what point did it become our soldiers fault that maybe war wasn't the best idea or that actions taken by higher ups end up falling on your everyday grunt?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3v0tgr?context=5)|Exactly! Why not write your representatives and tell them what you think instead of stating that it is on the soldier's shoulders. If there were no soldiers what would happen if someone invaded? Soldiers are a necessary role in modern day Earth.
[Have you noticed a lot of your fellow veterans coming back to unfaithful spouses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3utkos?context=5)|A ton actually.

Did you really think killing Iraqis would help defend the USA? From what, osama? Can you honestly blame an Iraqi for trying to shoot at you as you invade their country and kill their neighbors? Fuck you for going over there and attacking innocent people, defending their own country from invaders. You should know better. You deserve every tragedy you got for doing that. Why the fuck do we glorify people who go off and fight in these baseless wars???? Fuck. That.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3uycnv?context=5)|You have a point. I knew exactly what I was getting into. My point was not that I got deployed or that it was hard. My point was that getting cheated on while being deployed, getting a divorce, and having cancer suck ass.   I joined the Army (read above) to serve my country regardless of if it was right or wrong. Actually when I was there people walked up to us all the time and were grateful. We helped small cities and villages get power and flowing water again. In fact, before we came they had power once a month because Saddam wanted all of the power reserved for Baghdad and his palaces. Running water simply did not exist before we built it.   Attacking innocent people? The people I fought not only made IEDs, shot their own people, and were wanted for various counts of murder, but were problematic before we ever even got close to that country. Not to mention that over half of the guys in our prison that were there for terrorist activities were from other countries and were there to ensure that the locals never worked with us by threatening to kill their families if they did not cooperate. I would love to hear your definition of innocent.  I am actually glad you came along and proved that unlike their country and many other like it, no one has the right to freedoms such as the ones for speech and the press except for ones with democratic systems. Under a dictatorship it is often a crime punishable by death to simply speak out against your leader. I digress, you are completely right and I am sure that cancer was God's way of telling me to go fuck myself.  Btw, I am not pro war as I have stated before, but feel free to go ahead and assume that not only are you always right, but that everyone else is wrong.   I leave you with this ‚ÄúYou can tell whether a man is clever by his answers. You can tell whether a man is wise by his questions.‚Äù -  Naguib Mahfouz.
[Rationally speaking, you probably got cheated and divorced because you were not around to maintain a healthy relationship. Kind of a no-brainer. As for the cancer who knows, but it couldn't have been good for your vocal chords, or your health in general.  Attacking innocent people. I have no idea what you did there. How would I, but I'm sure plenty of innocent people died from american ballistics, I wouldn't try to argue that one.  If you are not 'pro war' why did you go?  ""I joined the Army (read above) to serve my country regardless of if it was right or wrong"" What happened to thinking critically, or morally?  Wow, that's so fucked. You would make a fine nazi, son.  Hope you never have to experience in your country, in the place you live, what you did to that country. I'll leave you with this, wanna serve your country? Go teach in the projects.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3v3neh?context=5)|Casualties of war are real and an unfortunate byproduct of modern day weaponry (bigger boom, harder to control). But to say individuals are out killing innocent people with absolutely no knowledge of them or their experience is ridiculous. You should also hate the people who invented the bomb, the politicians who ordered the attack, and the factory workers that built the bomb. But hey, why not just settle for hating the soldiers, right? If mankind is going to make it as a species we cannot think like tribals. Problems globally are just as important as nationally. Once again, I did not CHOOSE to go nor did I vote for the man who sent me. I would say if our leader killed thousands of people for no apparent reason other than the fact that they were the wrong ethnicity then yes China should come in hard and strong to prevent the doings of evil men. Lol, propaganda. Egypt? Are you kidding? They have market bombings bi-weekly! Egypt is also in the top 10 countries for kidnapping Americans and various other out of country visitors. So we should just wait around for countries to fix their own problems while thousands or even millions could die? I wonder how many Americans thought that about Germany in WWII. I suppose a couple million more Jews dieing because that isn't an American problem is quite alright with you. This is why many (much more wiser than your or I) men truly believe that we will be the end of ourselves as a species. I have to ask, what have you done to help anyone other than yourself? I frequently find that those who seem to loathe soldiers and what they represent tend to be rather narcissistic, self-centered, and more concerned with their own problems than the ones that lead to the massacring of thousands. I am sure if you were in Iraq and had family members killed by your leader you would more than appreciate a first-world country aiding you and your countrymen.
[Ps. glad to hear you're not religious, that helps with having a reasonable conversation.  relevant: http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/17/business/energy-environment/17oil.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q4qpc/iama_26_year_old_iraq_war_veteran_who_came_back/c3w0s4z?context=5)|I know that they sold the oil and did so on the open market (anyone can buy it). Beforehand this oil was not the property of Iraq, but that of Saddam Hussein. That man literally cared for no one and nothing except himself. I understand your points and appreciate the evidence.

q627d,3,2012-02-25,The pain of an EET major.,ChristianCMcKay,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/q627d/the_pain_of_an_eet_major/,"A few months back I got my AA in Electronics Engineering Tech.  I'm currently working on a 4 year, but just because I know I'll need experience, I start looking for jobs.  Hoping to get something in my field with an employer who would understand that I'm in college and will have to have my school hours off.  That would be kind of nice.  I could get some experience and make some money doing something in my field.

I start looking online to see what I can find in the area.  Nothing.  No job for 50 miles.  I finally think to myself, ""kinda sucks, man.  Maybe I can find some kind of paid internship or something then.""  After a few days of searching for that, I find nothing.  No paid internships.  No unpaid internships for a 100 mile radius of my area, not that I could drive that much in my car anyway.  It's old and the engine has to be at 4,000 RPM's to do 70.  Not the best of ideas in a 23 year old car with over 200,000 miles on it.

So as if that's not enough, lets get on to actual school.  At my old school, the EET program was so heavily underbudgeted that my first semester there, I had to fix the trainers.  Not to mention that the program turned out to be such a joke that there were people graduating that didn't understand how to wire up potentiometers.  Not through fault of the teachers, either.  Every time some kid ends up not knowing anything and fails a test, he goes and bitches to the dean of students who was more than happy to talk the teachers into giving away passing grades.  I did alright in the program though.  Friends with the teachers there.  I was a TA for one of them.  He retired after having been a control engineer for almost his whole life, and is the reason I want to go into control engineering.  However at this point, it's starting to look like just anything in the field will be a godsend.

That being said though, there were certain things I didn't learn at this school, not because I couldn't, but because it wasn't taught due to the incredibly low bar.  Things that I didn't know I needed to know.  Now that I'm in a university, the bar has been raised significantly, and I'm trying to catch up.  That's okay though.  I'm going to be okay there.  It's just a tough catching up process.

So I'm in school, looking to make some money and my options have been reduced to unpaid internship when I left off.  It's not making money but at least it will get me that pesky experience thing that all employers keep asking for on entry level jobs.  It's an investment.  Well I can't get it still.  There's not one.  So what are my options down to?  I applied to work at Autozone yesterday.  The same job I applied for in high school.  I also looked into TA jobs for first and second year EET courses since I had already done that and was damn good at it, but the only way anyone knows to contact the guy in charge of that is on e-mail and he never answered mine.  I could go flip burgers, but it kind of stings to know that I graduated college having been on the Deans list 3 of 5 semesters and used what I learned to work in food service.

And who do you talk to about feeling that way?  My dad things I shouldn't even bother working because it will take away a lot of time from school.  My mom won't talk to me because she's afraid I'm going to ask for money to pay for school.  My girlfriend works two jobs and is in college.  She works harder than anyone I know and whenever I try to talk about it to her she takes it to mean that I'm insulting what she does and how much she gets paid, which I'm not.  Society has started their deal about how even as a college graduate, you shouldn't feel like you're too good to flip burgers.  I hate to say this too, because it makes me feel pretentious, but I do feel like I'm too good to flip burgers.  I have a skill that I worked really hard to learn and spent the last few years of my life trying to be great at.  I was always told I had to go to college to avoid this exact thing.

So who do I talk to about my problems?  I talk to you, Reddit.  Out of everything else in my life, writing these rants about my life and what a waste it seems to have been up until this point gives me my only serenity.  Thank you for listening.


**Tl;Dr** I feel like my AA degree isn't worth the paper it was printed on, and I'm ranting.  Reddit is the only place I can do it."
q8uqd,11,2012-02-27,Breaking into the ECE field,unspokenToken,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/q8uqd/breaking_into_the_ece_field/,"I hope this is an appropriate subreddit for this kind of question. I am graduating soon with a degree in Computer (and Electrical) Engineering from a Candian University. I have no real internship experience and have worked as a programmer for the past few summers. I really want a career in embedded systems development, so for the past two years I have been playing with micro controllers in my spare time.  Unfortunately, I can not find any work in the field of ECE, and out of desperation I have accepted a job as a Java developer for a small software company. 

After the initial relief of getting a job, I realized that my engineering career just went down the drain. Might as well burn my degree and melt my iron ring. My friends have tried to comfort me by saying that ``experience is experience'', but I'm not convinced. Do I need to look into going back to school? I can't find a grad program that I think will benefit me. In the opinion of an experienced embedded engineer, would you consider hiring someone with a B.S. in ECE (with some spare-time projects) and a few years of on-the job experience in Java programming (sigh). I've heard that the US is the mecca for Electrical Engineers; Should I look into moving to the US? Would an M.S. from a US University help?

tl;dr: Got degree in ECE. Good GPA, extra-curriculars. Can't find job in ECE. Accepted job as a Java developer, but really want to work in embedded systems."

Half way through my 3rd year and its now 2.8. Theres plenty in my year with 3.5 and higher.

I'd like to take part in a summer internship for summer 2012 to gain some valuable experience and hopefully advance further in the future.

The majority of the classes I have taken so far have been the introductory engineering courses like Dynamics, Ordinary Differential equations, materials science, among others.  I have also taken a C++ programming class and have started learning how to use solidworks for a machine drawing class.  I am also a part of the Concordia chapter of SAE.

I currently live in Montreal, but I would not object to moving anywhere too far for the summer like Ottawa or Toronto for example.

I'm in this space of ""I screwed everything up"" and ""this isn't how things were supposed to be"" without knowing how to move past it. It's paralyzing. Potential long story ahead.


I was the definition of over achieving growing up. I started university in a program that only took 50 students and required a very high GPA to enter the program and to stay there. I got through alright, but by the end of my first year, things were not going well. I was depressed, not sleeping, and having panic attacks. I went home for the summer, got some Zoloft, and seemed to be back on track. In retrospect I spent most of that summer in hypomania, although I'd give anything to be back at that level.


I start my second year and before I've even finished my first week of classes, I'm off the rails manic/psychotic. It was humiliating. My residence put me on behavioral probation. I fell behind in my classes and fell into a deep, near suicidal depression, sleeping, skipping class, crying, and drinking myself sick. Though I had seen a few different doctors and a therapist, no one suggested that I be treated for bipolar or even that I stop the anti-depressants. I finished second year with a C average and repeated 2 courses over the summer. I was out of my enriched program, obviously, and I had a lot of catching up to do if I was going to bring up my GPA in 3rd year. 


Every year after that I told myself that I would do better this time around, and make up for everything that I had done wrong. I got better but I've never fully ""recovered"". In my last semester of 4th year, knowing I wouldn't graduate without coming back full time for a 5th year, I burned out and nearly quit school altogether. I got a good doctor over the summer and entered my 5th year because I didn't know what else to do. 


That year went better, all things considered. I got Bs in most of my courses with the help of my Dr., academic counselors and the disabilities office. I was on and off medications constantly through that year to try and get the right dosing, so I was often drowsy or physically ill, or in a fog, which made if difficult to attend all of my classes and keep up. Luckily I was able to get extensions and accommodations when needed.


I got a BSc. and started my first job as a writer in the most awful workplace I've ever experienced. I was deeply depressed for the few months that I worked there and had frequent panic attacks and attendance issues. After 3 months of working there I moved to another city with my boyfriend and began trying to rebuild. I have been unemployed ever since - I've now been unemployed for over a year.


I had always wanted to go to graduate school, get my PhD and become a researcher. I loved my field of study (still do). I don't have the grades or references from my undergrad degree to get into any grad program. I applied to the near by university to take courses as a non-degree student in hopes of upgrading for grad school, but was told I didn't have a high enough GPA to even upgrade at their school. 


It's hard to find a job in my field with no advanced degree and mediocre references. Every day that I'm not working is another strike against me when competing for jobs. I am considering trying to find a volunteer position but am so anxious and lacking in self esteem that I am afraid to even talk to anyone about it. I can't sell myself to potential employers because I do not believe in my abilities. I've had too much failure and humiliation over the past 6 years to have much confidence.


I'm angry at myself because when I should have been getting good grades, building relationships with professors, finding volunteer positions and applying for internships, I was fighting just to get by day to day. Now all of those opportunities are behind me and I feel like I'm in limbo.

And I'm angry at the money that I have cost my family in medication, therapy, repeating courses, extra time in school, time spent unemployed, etc... when they have been supporting me. I don't know how to let go of this either.


tl;dr: About to turn 25, going nowhere. Angry and unsure what to do next.

I'm really sorry about the length. I've wanted to get this stuff out for a while and haven't known how."

I have a situation with two companies, General Dynamics and SAIC. I signed a contingent job offer about 4-5 months back with General Dynamics in order to have them sponsor me for a security clearance and customer approval. I am currently in the process of obtaining a security clearance. The problem is, I would like to get some internship experience because my graduation is still over a year away. General Dynamics has no internship opportunities for people without clearances. I recently applied to SAIC which said that they do NOT require clearances for internships, but require you to be eligible for a clearance so they can start the process. I have an interview with SAIC next week for an internship over the summer, but I think they want to sponsor me for a clearance if I am brought on as an intern. What should I do here? Should I tell them I am already sponsored during the interview by General Dynamics and am just looking to intern? I can almost guarantee that would get rid of any interest they had in bringing me on as an intern. Any advice on this?"

q8n96,3,2012-02-27,First week ,fapaguei,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/q8n96/first_week/,"Yay i did it! Never thought i would be capable but it turned out to be surprisingly easy reading you guys. I'm planning to do weekly reports to keep track of my journey and read them when necessary.

As an introduction, i' m a 25m virgin. I started fapping at a very late age (+16) but i have been doing it daily since then, except for two times: a trip when i was 17 and a nofap february last year on a different forum (both times meaning 3 days without fapping each).

What made me decide to do this was the ybop thing and this subreddit. I learned that i was addicted. though i always felt guilty when doing it, or at least pathetic, i used to say to myself that i should keep fapping because it made me happy and i ""deserved"" it since my life is so shitty. Apparently that's wrong, polishing the helmet keeps you in the cycle, worsening your condition and ultimately leaving you unable to change anything.

I realized that i had to at least give it a try, but i was extremely skeptical about a lot of the changes i read here.

However (i still think this is just placebo but whatever) this are the highlights of this week:

-First of all i haven't had any urges at all. zero

-On the first day nothing happened. I was happier with myself but that's it.

-On day 2 i was unusually chatty. I get along quite well with people but i'm mainly quiet unless you talk to me, however now i almost feel the need to be in a conversation. When i'm approaching a group in a coffe break i instantly know what to say instead of joining awkwardly. Its very funny to me.

-Day 3 i dreamed i was going to fap and i said ""no!"". Even unconsciously i'm serious about this! Then at work a girl asked me to have lunch with her (this was her first time doing an afternoon and for some reason she didn't want to go with her coworkers). She has a boyfriend and is very above of my league even though everyone here says whe should date (we are both first year interns). Still i had a good time, we laughed a lot and the conversation didn't die for a second. In my normal status that would have only been possible with girls i know really well. Later she came to my unit to see how i was doing (i'm alone in the afternoons)

-Friday was the best. My older?senior? intern(dunno how you call it.btw forgive my spanglish) the nicest, kindest, prettiest, wonderfulest girl you can imagine told me i looked happier last days. ""I know!"" I said.  She asked me the reason happily (we are very close and i'm cheerful with her but i know see feels bad for me whenever i'm in a uncomfortable social situation and i appear to be upset for no reason).
""uh, oh, shit, hmm...I'm playing better at starcraft again"".""Oh,cool"" &lt;-- yeh , she is that amazing xd. She feeling happy for me is far enough to keep nofapping.
Later as i was closing a door another girl gave me a stare from head to toes as she passed in front of me. too blatant to be casual. *.*
That night i got a text from a friend i hadn't known anything from since a year back, instead of texting back some bullshit i just called and talked with her for 45 minutes.  

-As usual i spent the weekend mostly alone. i was tempted to go to the local carnival to test my new powers but at the last second i decided to tidy my apartment instead. Now is the first time in one year i wouldn't be ashamed if someone walked in.

All the events in this first week made me realize i actually don't have a shitty life in the slightest, i just decided to live it that way. 

I have turned down every girl's approach (i was too drunk to actually say no during my first and only kiss. i passed out shortly after) because i think you need friends in the first place, wth are you going to do just with a girlfriend? Then i wouldn't make the effort to make a solid group of friends because i don't always feel confident with my social skills. Time passed and i didn't care or realize my problem. Masturbation kept me ""happy"". I worked out, i forced myself to look to people's eyes, and tried to avoid looking angry. All that made me feel more confident in general but i'm always tired and can't focus on anything.

Now i have probably lost some of the best years of my life (in school meetings i'm amazed at how people remind me, the amount of old stories i had a role into. college is the exact opposite). I don't know if i will be able to change my life but i'm ready to know if there's a different person, or the old one, in me. 

week one, checked.

q8mhx,1,2012-02-27,ADVIDE NEEDED: Turning an Internship into a Full Time position,JohnnyFive-0,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/q8mhx/advide_needed_turning_an_internship_into_a_full/,"I started working an Internship with a small tech start-up in June of 2011. At the beginning of my Internship, my boss made it clear that if I did good work throughout the summer, I would be considered for full time employment after completing my MBA in May of 2012 (I have an undergrad in Economics and went straight into my MBA last fall, directly after graduating). 

Throughout my internship I was continuously praised and was even told that they expect to have a position open for me after completing my degree. All of that being said, I stayed on part time and have continued to do my job and the added responsibilities given to me. 

A few months ago, I told them that I was in the job market, yet still very excited about the opportunity to work for them, just wanted to be completely honest about where I stand. It's been a few months, however, and at the position I'm in my my life right now, I really need to know whether or not they will have a position for me, and what it will pay.

Would it be bad/inappropriate to sit down with my boss (the CFO of the company) sometime this week and tell him that if he doesn't offer me something in two weeks that I'll be needing to focus my efforts elsewhere? I feel like it's time for me to get agressive here, but don't want to step on anyone's toes. 

Any advice on this would be awesome. Thanks a million."

I didn't have any internships or co-ops during school and I've had little success in my job search selling myself on my coursework alone, so I thought I'd explore the internship angle to make myself more marketable to employers. 

 - I received my Engineer in Training certification in Maryland after one attempt.
 - I have some experience with Pro Engineer and Solidworks through a class, and I've used MATLAB for various purposes and classes. Other programs I've used are LabVIEW and Fluent/Gambit. 
 - I have done some programming in C++ for a couple classes, as well as HTML and JavaScript just for fun in my high school days. I wouldn't say I'm an expert coder by any means but I am comfortable with programming. I've always generally been glued to a computer so I know my way around them and I can easily figure out anything I don't know.
 - I've worked on several class teams ranging in number from two to six people and in purpose from weekly laboratory experiments to semester-long projects. I get along well with people and have plenty of experience putting together technical reports.

I have been employed at a sports and fitness facility as a lifeguard since 2005, and was promoted to pool manager in 2010. 

My main responsibilities are to maintain proper water balance in the pools and spa and to ensure a safe environment through consistent enforcement of rules and timely and effective response to emergencies. 

I also supervise an average of 10 lifeguards, customer service representatives and maintenance staff.
The pool sees a lot of traffic and I interact with people of all ages and from a wide variety of backgrounds.

I'm not exactly sure what I want to do in the engineering world, but I am generally more interested in testing and evaluation (or research), product development and possibly maintenance roles. I am, however, certainly open to other possibilities. I am generally introspective which lends to strong analytical and evaluation skills as well as creative problem solving and a penchant for seeing the ""big picture.""

In fact, I love to travel, and I have never lived anywhere outside of Colorado so the prospect of moving out of state for an internship is actually quite exciting.

Anyway, I am looking for hardware or software internships. I have experience in C/C++, Java, Android, Arduino, Nios II, ARM M0, and soon a bit of MIPS.
I am confident using MatLab, Mathematica, LTSpice, SolidWorks, Emacs, and Eclipse.

By may, I will also have completed all my required analog analysis and design classes including microelectronics.

I am currently enrolled in a digital design lab in which we are linking the ARM M0 board to an Android app via Bluetooth and I have been enjoying it greatly. This tells me that embedded design might be my specific area of interest.

Other than engineering, I love music passionately. It would be amazing to get work in digital audio systems, although I do not really know where to look. I love to ski, bike, and read books. Pretty standard Colorado behavior I suppose.

I would love to find a company that values creativity and passion, as I think they are my strongest non-technical traits. I really do love working with technology, and I think there is a beauty well designed tech. I am hoping to find a place where I can help create something I am really proud of.

If I sound like I might be a good fit. Please PM me for Resume, Cover Letter, References, etc... and I will surely provide in a timely manner.

Hope to hear from you, and thank you for your time!

What type of places should I be looking to gain more experience in this, how can I break into the field with minimal experience? It seems all the job postings I'm seeing want tons of experience and knowledge. Also, what type of stuff do they look for in a portfolio for these types of positions? From what I understand it's not as heavy on the designing, and more the practical applications of design.

I'm currently finishing up a internship where I would consider what I did ""production art."" Though, I'm not sure that would be the correct term. I did a lot of what they called the grunt work, using template guidelines and already created graphic elements to compose finished products; cropping, resizing, color-correcting, placing of graphics into layouts; creating vector elements to be used in larger designs; coming up with templates/guidelines for designs that have many possible iterations; .... I don't know, it's hard for me to put into words all that I've done without it sounding pointless and boring -- even though it very much wasn't. A lot of it was the backbone of finished pieces.

Other than engineering, I love music passionately. It would be amazing to get work in digital audio systems, although I do not really know where to look.  I love to ski, bike, and read books. Pretty standard Colorado behavior I suppose.

I would love to find a company that values creativity and passion, as I think they are my strongest traits. I really do love working with technology, and I think there is a beauty well designed tech.  I am hoping to find a place where I can help create something I am really proud of. 

If I sound like I might be a good fit. Please PM me for Resume, Cover Letter, References, etc... and I will surely provide in a timely manner. 

Hope to hear from you, and thank you for your time!

So, I'm a student that is about to apply to an internship that focuses on UI for web and phone application. I have had experience in web design with a good knowledge of HTML, CSS and (decent) PHP.

With this as background, I would like to ask: What would be a good starting point for designing mobile UI? I have thought about designing some UI elements (buttons, hover-states, sliders, checkboxes, message boxes etc.) in Photoshop and then implementing the design for a mobile ""app"" or site.

What do y'all think? Thanks for reading!"

q87i1,11,2012-02-27,"My mom is diagnosed with severe depression, what can I do to help her?",blackhawknl,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/q87i1/my_mom_is_diagnosed_with_severe_depression_what/,"So my mom is diagnosed with depression she got from a burnout working at a doctors clinic as an assistant. She's been walking around with it for the last 5 years and went trough therapy, medication and the like. 

At the moment she receives Electro Shock Therapy. This means that she has to go under treatment twice a week, where they apply little pads or something (don't know how to call it in English) to her head and shock her brain whilst under narcosis. 

This treatment has severe side effects to her brain meaning that her short term memory is totally gone. Dory from Finding Nemo describes the current situaton the best and I'm not kidding. She asked me 3 times in the time span of 5 minutes if I liked my current internship at the IT company. And everytime when she comes home from the hospital it's always the same. She will tell me what she ate whilst in the hospital and that the staff there is very nice to her and so on...


My question is as follows: What can I do to help my mother deal with this, or to improve her recovery?


I try to help her with this situation by being very tolerant of the things she says and does. Doing my chores, talking with her and trying to get her to open up. She is very introvert with her feelings because she thinks people won't understand the things she is going through right now. This also presents a problem for the people working at the hospital. She has to mention when she's feeling down or insecure so that they can help her and monitor her progress.

But my dad is a different story. He's not the best at dealing with things like this so he is always joking about how she forgets stuff and impersonates her when we're eating dinner etc.

I think my dad isn't making things better for my mom as she is already having a very hard time dealing with this depression. I feel my dad is actually making it worse for my mom.

Can anyone here on reddit, who may have been through the same problems with a relative or a close friend, help me and my mom getting through hers?

**Edit:**
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Thanks for all the kind answers my fellow redditors. I really appreciate all the help i've gotten so far.
Just to clarify things, my mother does not have suicidal tendencies. The main thing here is that she is extremely occupied by thoughts and such. She has become very introvert and sees going to the supermarket or gas station to get cigarettes as an enormous task. Same thing for going to church. Everything she has to do besides staying indoor is seen as a task. She is affraid to run into fermiliar people, having to explain them how she is doing and the like.

Also, my mother ""hurts"" herself unknowingly. To be more precise, my mother used to pick the rims of her fingernails. I don't know how to properly explain that but in stead of biting nails, she bites her fingernail-rims. (I also have this tick). But ever since she was depressed, she started to rub her thumb on her lower arm, producing rug burn marks on her arm. Because of this, she became even more insecure because she doesn't want people to see this and think: ""Oh wow that's weird!"" or something like that. Even to the medical staff that have seen this sort of thing many times. We tell her to stop when she is scratching or rubbing her arm again, but since she has very short/no short memory at all, it doesn't stick. She won't listen or remember.

If there are any questions, or you want me to clarify things, please comment and I will try my best to explain.

Thanks again reddit!"

I'm not the strongest candidate GPA-wise due to a horrendous freshman year, but I have solid letters or rec, am (hopefully) going to be working on a research team this summer, and hope to have an internship lined up for Fall 2012.

 Realistically, I think I'm a fairly decent Masters candidate, but am not particularly confident about my competitiveness for PhD candidacy. I love research, and a PhD is definitely my end goal, and while I would prefer to gain admittance directly from undergrad, I understand I may have to go through a masters program first to get more experience and credentials under my belt.

Several of the schools I'm most interested in faculty and location-wise have both Masters and PhD programs. Would it reflect poorly on me as a candidate if I were to apply to both at the same school?"
q7wew,0,2012-02-27,Learning Multivariable Calc?,canas15,math,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/q7wew/learning_multivariable_calc/,"So, third year undergrad. Long story, but the honors sequence in my college doesn't really cover multivariable calc and diffyq- We're supposed to cover multivariable analysis and then do differential geometry. My year, the material got changed around (measure theory instead of multivariable calc...), but we still did differential geometry anyway, learning the ""kinda-basics"" as we needed to.

This hasn't been a problem until now. I'm doing an internship this summer in which people seem to like math a lot. This may include calculating things like gradients which I have little idea about: what are some good resources for a somewhat advanced undergrad who just happens to have a small gap around where multivariable calculus should be? I've got a couple of weeks to study before my internship begins, so I've got time to study. Also, books would be preferable to sites since I might be out of country and in a location with pretty cruddy internet.

Thanks guys!

P.S.: Yeah, I know, it's embarrassing not to know basic multi-var. But we literally didn't cover it since pure math people really don't like these kinds of messy things, apparently. 

Also, as a quick note, stuff which would help me build some computational comfort would be nice (aka not ALL theory please, although some proofs will not be completely unwelcome). I was thinking of Spivak's manifolds initially because it's such an oh so nice small book, but I'm not sure it does that :/. Also I'm kinda traumatized by his introduction to differential geometry book. Because that thing is scary. "
q7w1j,0,2012-02-27,My boyfriend just broke up with me via text at midnight on the eve of a series of stressful events. What's one of the most inconvenient break ups you have been through?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/q7w1j/my_boyfriend_just_broke_up_with_me_via_text_at/,"I'm sure this has done a million times, but I just needed to vent. I have been stressed out for a matter of months because of a series of major events in my life. Focusing that down to the past three, my grandmother just passed away in January and I wasn't able to spend much time with her before she died. I was busy working a full time job, going to school full time, and participating in an internship that had the promise of becoming a full time job. 

I've been dating my boyfriend since the middle of November. He is my coworker and I was hesitant to start a relationship with him for a myriad of reasons. We finally decided to be serious after about a month or so of fooling around and having fun. I haven't had more than a day off from work, my school, and my internship in over two and a half months. I haven't had more than two days off of work or school in about a year. I am wearing a little thin. 

This quarter also just happens to be one of the hardest quarters in school that I have ever had. For one class alone I have had two to three projects due a week. I am a graphic design student so this means full fledged projects with design briefs, concept sketches, digital roughs, the works. I ended up dropping a class and turning my internship into a class just to make things more bearable for myself.

ALL of my free time that wasn't spent doing homework I spent with my SO. I would stay late at work to spend time with him on his shift and get four or five hours of sleep just so that we could spend some quality time together. 

Three weeks ago I got offered a full time position at my internship. Two weeks ago I put in my two weeks notice at my current job. Last week for no reason at all, my boyfriend decided he wanted to take two days extra off this week because he felt like it. This ended up screwing up my schedule for my last week of work and messing up my schedule with my NEW job, because I didn't realize they would schedule me for as many shifts as they did. 

We got into our VERY FIRST fight about this on Saturday when I saw the schedule. I told him I was mad and he didn't understand why. I explained it to him and he didn't really say sorry. Then out of nowhere, he texts me tonight to tell me that he thinks I am a very pessimistic person and that I'm too emotional for him. I tell him that if he feels that way, maybe we shouldn't be together and he responds with, ""Well, if you think that's for the best""

So he broke up with me in the middle of the night, while I was working on a homework assignment for school. I also have to be at my internship at 9AM tomorrow morning and the class that my assignment is due for is tomorrow night at 5:45. I have several other huge projects coming up right now, my best friend is leaving the country for two years in two weeks and that friend also happens to be my room mate and I need to find a new place to live by the end of the month. Not to mention the fact that I still have two more days of work left at the place where my now exboyfriend works. I do not want to have to see him both of these days (and I will have to see him). This couldn't be a more inconvenient time to break my heart and trust in men. The assfucker.

TL;DR: My life is like a damn country song. Boyfriend breaks up with me, grandma dies, best friend leaves the country, have to move, and have to see boyfriend at work since he's a coworker.

So tell me Redditors, what's the most inconvenient break up you've ever been through? "

Anyways, I'm taking this semester ""off"" and getting internship experience back in CA. I'm working 5 days a week, 9-6. My commute is about 1.5 hours both ways so I wake up at 7 already, have a half an hour then drive. Get home around 7:30, eat dinner and am usually ""free"" for the evening around 8:00. 

I was wondering, what is a good exercise program for somebody like me? I want to get back into shape, but I also sleep terribly at night (exercising doesn't help me usually, was sleeping just as bad when I was working out regularly) and I'm not so sure I can convince myself to get up any earlier than 6:30 to get in about 30 mins in the morning. 

Maybe working out after getting home at 7:30 before eating? I guess I'm just asking if any of you guys are in a similar working situation? Do you always have to compromise rest hours to exercise? Are there any programs that can help you get into shape with short bursts of 30 mins?

I'm going to be doing an internship there, so Monday-Friday I will be in Germany, calling other German numbers, maybe to the US (though I'll probably use Skype for that). However, I will be going over with ~10 other students who will be scattered over the country. On the weekends we are going to be travelling around Europe together, and I will need to be able to still call them reliably. For instance, if we are walking around Rome somewhere and I get separated from the group, I want my cell phone to still work and not cost a euro/minute.

What are the best pre-paid plans for my situation? I will probably be calling/texting friends in Germany fairly often throughout the week, and definitely need good support if I'm in another country in Europe. I don't care about data, just SMS and calling."

This isn't a passing interest, I'm not talking about some casual introduction to them, I'm talking about really putting in the time and money necessary to *earn* some skills and knowledge. I'm self motivated, I'm a quick learner, and I'm not sure where to start.

Some background: I know something about how engines work, and I've done some minor work - brakes pads and fluid changes. I've got some tools, a 154 piece mechanics set from my dad in particular. I've helped my dad when he's done more serious repairs, but he's three hours away and wouldn't have the time to teach me anyway. I'm currently in school with two jobs related to my major (CS and Math), so vocational school or a entry level job in a shop aren't really an option. Depending on internships, I might be able to swing a job or volunteer as a gopher during the summer. Another idea for the summer is getting an old beater with a simple engine, then ripping it apart and putting it back together with the help of a chilton manual. What does cars think? Oh, and I have a decent amount of money set aside for this or other pursuits this summer.

TL;DR - I want to learn engines, and am willing to put time and money into it this summer. Where should I start?"
q7syg,14,2012-02-27,This weekend I put on my big boy pants and figured out if I wanted to be a trainer or just simply a man who liked playing with dogs.,Devlik,Dogtraining,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/q7syg/this_weekend_i_put_on_my_big_boy_pants_and/,"I had a put up or shut up weekend with the dogs at the local shelter I donate time to. Just some back ground I am an intern with the canine behavior team at the second largest shelter in my state. I have had a good amount of experience with guardian breeds especially those that have severe behavior issues ranging from fear aggression to kennel stress to simple house breaking issues.

So one of my favorite dogs at the shelter turned into a bite case as he drew blood on an intern (not out of aggression as he would have likely been put down).

 He is now out of bite quarantine and thankfully above ground. He is however, exhibiting symptoms of major kennel stress. For those that are note familiar with this, it is the dogs slowly and quite literally going insane from the stresses of a large kennel environment (constant barking, lots of people, the cleaning process, etc are all very hard on the dogs). Pit bulls especially and most bully breeds fall victim to this as they spend more and more time in the shelter. This pit bull has already bitten one person and is going nuts. This is a major killer of these dogs in shelter environments.

So what do I do? Not just work with him in the training rooms and outside but lock myself in his kennel to give him massage and work on stress reduction with him. Helping show that his kennel is not just a place of confinement but also where happy fun times and relaxation happen. This is critical in helping reduce the stress and keeping him adoptable.

So lets recap on my brilliant choice of hobby 

* 1) Work with guardian breeds almost exclusively 
* 2) Make sure they are the breeds that can really mess you up 
* 3) Find the craziest one of the lot 
* 4) wait for them to come out of bite quarantine 
* 5) lock your self in a space smaller than your closet with them in hopes you can help make him less crazy.

Either I trust my skills and these dogs or I don't and so far I am not finding my faith lacking. However I am starting to understand rock climbers, sky drivers, and other lifestyles that are bat shit crazy on paper but rewarding and worth it in the long run."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[What do you personally think about Registered nurse anesthetists (CRNA's)?   Have you worked with any?   Do you feel the level of care they provide is acceptable?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3v89su?context=5)|I think for a simple straight forward case they do provide an adequate level of care. However, for the most part if you ask them why they are doing what they are doing, they will not have an answer. They just know what they do, and if things start to stray from the normal they have difficulty adjusting. That's why I feel it is important for them to be supervised so that if things do start to go wrong, someone with a better understanding of physiology and a much more in depth and extensive training will be able to take over. I also would not want them to be performing anesthesia for the more complicated and risky surgeries.
[Thanks for the quick answer, which breeds a couple more questions from me.  So it is more of a skill based position then? Do you find they are Taking work away from you with them being cheaper to employ?  Do you find that they are being adequately supervised in their cases? I hear of them being independent practitioners in a lot of small town clinics and hospitals. I can't imagine you're thrilled about those scenarios.  Also, what has been the worst case you've ever been apart of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3v8okd?context=5)|They are cheaper to employ, but the majority of states still require them to be supervised. Often times they are not adequately supervised, and that is inappropriate. The supervising anesthesiologist is ultimately responsible if anything goes wrong and that is a risk they are taking. A lot of places where they are working independently, this is due to the fact that MD anesthesiologists are not available. I do not feel like this is the safest of scenarios, however unless more MDs go into anesthesia and are somehow attracted to working in small towns I do not know a solution.
[What's your education background until you became an anesthesiologist?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3v7olc?context=5)|I went to medical school at Washington University in St. Louis for four years after undergrad and did my residency in NYC for another four years after medical school.
[CNN did an article about top paying jobs and listed anesthesiologist as the top paying job, is this true from your experience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3v7olc?context=5)|Anesthesia, while being a good paying specialty is definitely not a top paying job. There are other specialties that definitely have a significantly higher average salary than anesthesia. Some of these include radiology, radiation oncology, cardio-thoracic surgery, neurosurgery, dermatology and others.
[How'd you like Wash U?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3v9wul?context=5)|It was fantastic. The hospital is absolutely amazing in every aspect. The faculty at the medical school was incredible and I made some great life long friends. St. Louis definitely leaves a lot to be desired but the school was great.
[Whats the deal with red heads?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3vae4k?context=5)|Natural red heads due to some unknown genetic disposition are known to be more resistant to anesthesia. No one knows why, but it has been proven to be true.
[Is this something us gingers need to mention to our anesthesiologist, or is it common knowledge in the profession?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3vbo47?context=5)|It is pretty common knowledge but it can be overlooked. It does not hurt to remind the anesthesiologist, most will not take it as anything but a friendly reminder.
[1) Have you ever been sued for malpractice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3v8348?context=5)|1) I have personally never been sued for malpractice but I do have colleagues who have.
[2) has any surgeon you have worked with ever fucked up badly during a procedure?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3v8348?context=5)|2) Surgeons definitely mess up during surgeries, that's one of the reasons we are there, to make sure the patient does alright while the surgeon fixes their mistake. Most often its related to hitting a major vessel resulting in significant bleeding.
[5) Wildest story from the OR.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3v8348?context=5)|5) hmm...wildest story. Don't know if I can give a specific story. Saw a 20 lb tumor taken out of a 110 pound patient. Spontaneous cardiac arrest? Blood loss of 60 liters during a surgery (average persons blood volume is about 5 liters, we were replacing as it was coming out)
[How do you get 60 liters of blood back in someone that quickly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3vayvq?context=5)|Seems to be some confusion. A person has about 5 liters of blood in the body. What was going on was continuous loss of blood through arteries in the abdomen. We were transfusing blood bank blood using a rapid transfuser through a large central line that can handle over 500cc of fluid a minute. Transfused over 100 units of packed red blood cells.
[Just a follow up to part 5, where did the 60 liters of blood go? Was it contained or was it just spewing all over the floor or something?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3v8xfl?context=5)|It was intra-abdominal surgery (liver transplantation) and it was several arterial bleeders. The surgeons were using suction to try to keep the area dryish while they tried to find and tie off the culprit. It primarily went into suction buckets.
[I dont know why or even how but this reminded me of something that happened at my dentist. They had a traveling anesthesiologist that would come in for certain oral surgeries. On the day i was there rumor had it that the girls throat caught fire due to the gases. Is this even possible?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3v9ces?context=5)|Airway fire is possible. It is not the anesthestic gases that are flammable, but the high concentration of oxygen being administered. The surgeons will use electrocautery and this can cause a spark that could ignite the oxygen. It is rare and usually not a case of fault. Important is how one responds to it.
[Is ketamine still used on humans? What's your opinion on recreational use of ketamine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3v8cwy?context=5)|Ketamine is definitely still used. It has multiple applications. It is often used in the pediatric ER for conscious sedation for orthopedic procedures. This is really only done in kids because they have ""happier"" hallucinations than adults. Adults can take it really badly.  It is also used in pain medicine as a way to ""reset"" the pain receptors and help a chronic pain patient become resensitized to the pain medications making them more efficacious.  It can be used for induction of general anesthesia as it is the most cardio-stable of our induction drugs.  I don't really know much about its recreational use besides what I have heard of ""k-holes"" which sound pretty unpleasant. A lot of the drugs we use in anesthesia are also used recreationally.
[Another question. Some people I know are deathly afraid of waking up in the middle of an operation and being unable to move, but conscious. How frequently does this happen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3v8i2j?context=5)|It is not impossible, although the incidence is low. In low-risk surgeries the incidence is about 1 in 5000. In high risk surgeries (or patients who are either more resistant to anesthesia or in whom deeper anesthesia needs to be avoided because of their co-morbities) the incidence is anywhere from 1 in 1000 to even 1 in 100 in some studies. There is a lot research regarding how to decrease this, and the incidence is definitely decreasing.  In my own practice I regularly try to avoid muscle relaxants when they are not absolutely mandatory for the surgery. That way if the patient is becoming ""light"" they will move and I will be able to do something about it.  Also something to know is that it is not uncommon for patients to move during surgery, however the vast majority of these patients do not remember anything. Some of the drugs we give have amnestic properties, blocking memory formation.
[Now I am kind of interested in the medical profession (I used to detest the thought). I'm still a freshman so I still have a choice. Do you think what you get out of being an anesthesiologist (financially or otherwise) is worth the amount of work you put in to become one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3vaa61?context=5)|To be honest, despite what the general public thinks, if you are interested in money, becoming a doctor is absolutely not the way to go. In America the field of medicine attracts some of the most talented people. These same people would be able to go into other careers and do extremely well financially without having to do the 4 years of medical school and the 3-7 years of residency. Not to mention that coming out of medical school you will likely have about $150,000 in debt. Even after you finish medical school you will have residency during which you will work 60-80 hours a week, including weekends and holidays and get paid about 50,000 a year, which you could have been making more than straight out of college while working less. It should not be a financial decision.  I love what I do, but it is a very hard path and one that you have to be really certain about before you undertake. There were many times in my training that I regretted my decision. Another reason for this is the modern culture where doctors are no longer appreciated for their sacrifices. Throughout your career you will have instances of pure frustration for the way patients treat you despite everything you have sacrificed in your life to train to help them.
[MS2 here, sorry in advance for my incoming flurry of questions! Any tips or suggestions for Step 1?  What made you choose your specialty?  I'm a bit lost as to what I'd like to do.  How difficult was your residency, and what is a normal day like for you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3v98oj?context=5)|Step 1 was the worst experience of my life. It is a challenging test, and unfortunately it matters a lot. I'd say if you have the chance, start studying early. Question banks are a great tool for studying. You may become very disheartened through the process but remember that there is a definitive end to it. I chose anesthesia because I find physiology extremely interesting, and wanted a field that had both procedures as well as being cerebral. I personally was not interested in long term patient care, and anesthesia fit that bill.  Residency is not easy, but anesthesia is not of moderate difficulty. I enjoyed it more than med school, because it is in the field you are interested in and you are actually important in taking care of the patients.  Days usually start around 6AM and depending on case load and call will end anywhere from 5PM to 7AM the next day.
[Could my bad reactions to morphine be related to/caused by my mom's bad reaction the day before I was born by c-section?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3v9gvn?context=5)|Your reaction would not be related to your moms bad reaction, however it could be genetically related.  Also it is important for you to know that because you had a bad reaction to morphine does not mean you will have a bad reaction to all opiods. Dilaudid (hydromorphone) is a long acting opiod that has a better side effect profile than morphine and could be tried.
[If a patient absolutely refuses opiate based pain medicines how will you treat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3v9gvn?context=5)|If a patient refused opiods the course of action would depend on the surgery. If it one amenable to regional or neuraxial block (spinal/epidural) then that would be ideal. If not then would have to work with non-opiods like NSAIDs or local anesthetics. It would be important to discuss with the patient that their pain management would be more challenging due to their refusal, but patient autonomy is important, and if they choose to have pain over receiving opiods that is their right.
[How many hours a week did you work during residency? In 2003 they capped it at 80, do you feel like 80 is still too much? Or perhaps even not enough?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3v981c?context=5)|Anesthesia residency for the most part is a moderately demanding residency, with average work hours of 60-65 hours a week. We do have rotations that go near 80 hours however. Keep in mind the 80 hour rule is averaged over 4 weeks, so I had weeks where I worked over 100 hours.  80 hours a week can definitely be extremely grueling and draining and over a long period of time can really bring a person down. I was lucky to be in a place where I had a lot of friends (both in medicine and outside) and family to help me get through residency.
[How did you cope with the demands of residency?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3v981c?context=5)|There are also specialties (most notably neurosurgery) which very regularly break the 80 hour rule. In these specialties it is an unspoken rule that regardless of what you are working, your work hour logs should indicate only 80 hours.
[2) What advice would you give to a patient who is worried about not being given enough anesthesia (felt everything but couldnt tell anyone) or too much anesthesia?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3v910i?context=5)|2) I commented on the possibility of being awake during surgery in an earlier question. If you have additional questions beyond what I said earlier, please elaborate. As for ""too much anesthesia"" there is no real thing. The biggest concern with too much anesthesia is related to hemodynamics (BP and HR). With an experienced anesthesiolgist there who is paying attention to your vitals, these are pretty easily treated. Anesthesia wears off. The most common form of general anesthesia is inhalational anesthesia, which you will breath off once it is turned off.
[What made you choose anesthesia over any other specialty? Do you ever regret your decision? I ask as a ms3 finishing up wards with a genuine interest in anesthesia, but I can't shake the fear that I will regret not choosing a specialty that practices ""real"" medicine. I know certain other specialties harbor this view of anethesiologists, but do you ever feel like you're not a ""real"" doctor? Thank you so much for doing this AMA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3v9n0y?context=5)|I do not regret my decision at all. I love physiology, I love procedures, and I love my life. I am not sure what you mean by ""real"" medicine. Anesthesiologist know more about how the body works than any other specialty. We deal with diseases of every organ system, because we provide care for surgeries of every specialty. We also staff many intensive care units which deal with the sickest patients in the hospital.   It is a pretty misunderstood specialty and it is not as glamorous as we work behind the scenes. It is said that if an anesthesiologist is doing their job well you wont even know they are there. You should not choose your specialty based on what others think, you should choose it based on what makes you the happiest. It is a hard decision which will determine the course of the rest of your life.
[Everytime I get put under s general anesthetic, I am VIOLENTLY ill for 2-3 days after. The anesthesiologists have all told me it was the pain meds, and I know for a fact it is NOT the pain meds(opiate addict, in recovery, dope hardly ever made me sick). I am having surgery to get my tonsils out soon(grudgingly) and I am terrified of the horrible nausea/vomiting that I know is going to come after being put under. What should I tell the anesthesiologist to get him to believe me that it is indeed the anesthesia?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3vaf87?context=5)|The most common side effect of general anesthesia is nausea and vomiting afterwords. There are prophylactic measure that can be taken to try to limit it. First line is to give a 5HT3 antagonist like ondansetron (zofran) which is given to almost every patient who gets general anesthesia. Metoclopramide (reglan) can also help as does given a dose of steroids (dexamethasone 4-6mg) prior to inducing anesthesia. For someone like you who has a history of severe PONV the best method to try to limit it is to do the above as well as doing a total intravenous anesthetic (TIVA). It is thought that the inhalational gases that we use to maintain anesthesia are the biggest culprit in causing PONV and by doing an IV general anesthetic and eliminating them you can avoid the PONV. This is all pretty common knowledge among anesthesiologists but if you want to be certain, you can say you have a history and would like a TIVA anesthestic.
[Drug abuse?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3v8ian?context=5)|I'm not really sure what you are asking. Do I abuse drugs? No. Is there potential for drug abuse in anesthesia? Yes. There are studies that show anesthesiologist having the highest proportion of drug abuse because we have the most direct access to drugs of abuse. The counter-argument is that because of this we are trained the most in identifying signs of abuse and therefore are simply found out the most often.
[Dman: How did you do on your MCATs? Junior in college here, scheduled to take them on May 21st and apply this cycle. What other schools did you get accepted to?  Also, what major were you in undergrad? While I know probably none of the information benefited your med school education, do you think it had any bearing on how well your ddx'ing developed? My major is biomedical engineering.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3va363?context=5)|I did very well on my MCAT and got accepted a number of schools including Hopkins, Cornell and UPenn. I was a bio and economics major in college and to be honest it had no bearing in school. Some schools actually like to see non-science majors to show they have diversity in their student body.
[Do you have children?  If so, how do you balance a demanding work like and home life?  Also- I've been told by an anaesthesiologist that anaesthesiology residencies have the highest divorce and suicide rates.  Do you know that to be true or just think it is speculation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3vb2tc?context=5)|I do not have children. It is definitely a challenge to balance work and home with a schedule like mine, but you make it work. Basically you get used to life. I do not believe anesthesia to have the highest divorce or suicide rates and see no reason why that would be true.
[Also, what do you have to say about the current health care reform?  Is it for the better or worse?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3vb2tc?context=5)|I believe in universal health care and health care as a right. As for the current reforms we're all in a sort of wait and see place now. Not really sure how it will all work out in the end.
[What do you do to our vulnerable bodies besides surgery?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3v90bx?context=5)|Haha, nothing that isn't necessary for the surgery. We do have to move patients around like puppets to get them in the appropriate position and insert things in places. But it is always a required part of performing the surgery safely.
[I know you've touched on it in previous comments but I have more questions about anesthesiology awareness. A few years ago I had a root canal and whatever they tried to numb me with didn't work. They had to continuously drill into my tooth, stick the needle in the nerve and drill some more and repeat for a good 15 minutes before it finally numbed. Worst pain I've ever felt in my life. So my question is, does this mean I have a higher chance of ""waking up"" during surgery?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3v9kmk?context=5)|No not necessarily. They may have just done a poor job of giving the local anesthesia. You may also be more resistant to local anesthesia, however that does not translate to general anesthesia as the drugs are completely different, in different classes working on different receptors in different parts of the body/brain.
[Do you also perform intubations?     How do you usually go about administering inhalational and IV anesthesia?     Have you ever been in a situation where you patient dies on the table?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3v9az9?context=5)|Yes, for most general anesthestics we intubate patients. The inhalational gases are delivered through the endotracheal tube, or something called a laryngeal mask airway (LMA). IV anesthestics are obviously adminstered through peripheral IV's. To go to sleep its usually a bolus dose, but you can do general anesthesia entirely through an iv, in which case it would be through a continuous infusion.  I have had patients die on the table, but they have been trauma patients. I have also had patients die on the table, but appropriate CPR and resuscitation and a team effort between the surgeons and us, come back to life and eventually leave the hospital.
[Under general anesthesia, do people ""talk in their sleep"" while they're under? Do you recall anything particularly interesting/funny/weird that anyone ever said?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3vaowl?context=5)|You can't talk under general anesthesia, its basically like a coma. Most of the time under GA you have either an ETT or LMA in place also. People can talk during sedation though, and do say some silly things. Can't think of anything in particular but its not uncommon for 50 year old men to be crying for their mommy.
[Im a medical student, and my next internship is going to be anesthesiology. Make me enthusiastic. What is cool about anesthesiology? What should I definitely prepare before starting? What should I definitely learn during my internship? Any practical advices beforehand?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3vbf1h?context=5)|Every day in the operating room for an anesthesiologist is like performing physiology experiments. As opposed to other specialties you see the results of your actions immeidiately. You give an alpha agonist like phenylephrine and within a couple of minutes you see blood pressure rise and a reflex bradycardia.  One thing I tell my medical students when they rotate through anesthesia is that the most important thing they can learn regardless of what specialty they go into is how to properly mask ventilate. If you arrive a code, you can save someones life by doing good mask ventilation. You can keep that up until anesthesia shows up to intubate.   Anesthesia rotations are pretty routinely considered favorites by students because its one of the few times they have one on one time with a resident where they can learn directly from them. We are usually some of the happier residents in the hospital too and its a pretty laid back rotation since you are kind of superfluous and can leave whenever you want.
[Is it true that anesthesiologists have the highest malpractice insurance? Or is that a myth?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3va0ke?context=5)|We do have high malpractice insurance, however not the highest. Obstetrics is often cited as having among the highest.
[As a person who is looking to go to med school, are you in debt? If not, how long did it take you to get rid of it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3vale1?context=5)|Yes, I am in debt. I went to a private medical school and had to take out loans for the entirety of my education there so I came out with about $170k of debt, and schools have gotten more expensive since then. Public schools are obviously cheaper and some state schools are excellent.
[I broke my femur a few years ago and had to be knocked out for the surgery.  I remember the IV and then a shooting feeling go up my arm and then into my jaw.  It felt like a burning sensation.  I remember getting nervous because of the feeling, but then I was knocked out like a champ.  The same occurred a few years earlier when I had a procedure for a lump on my neck.  Was this a normal feeling I was experiencing?  The fire-like sensation going up my body and into my jaw?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3vbnil?context=5)|The burning feeling is probably the propofol which burns on injection. I don't know why it went to your jaw, I have never heard that before but it is very common for people to feel the burning before they go to sleep.
[When I was 14 I had surgery on a re-occurring ganglion cyst on my right wrist. I was told repeatedly that the anesthesia was going to be administered locally, so I would be awake for the entire procedure. However, I passed out before they made the first incision. My grandma said that because they had an anesthesiologist present, I was definitely meant to go under. Is this true? Does the presence of anesthesiologist necessarily mean they intended for me to go under? Or do you think I was to sensitive to the local anesthetic?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3vdfkq?context=5)|Local anesthetic wouldn't make you go under. What was likely going on is that they gave you local, but the presence of the anesthesiologist means that you were probably also getting some sedation through the IV. Its called MAC anesthesia (monitored anesthetic care). You did not go under general anesthesia, but the drugs we give help you not remember and sometimes fall asleep.
[Have you ever seen a patient with malignant hyperthermia? And if so, how much did you crap your scrubs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3vasjk?context=5)|Haha, during my residency I did have a patient with likely MH, and there was definite brown staining. We did manage to give dantrolene earlyish and the patient did well.
[Would a situation in which a patient suffered a severe pneumothorax (month long hospitalization) due to an error in placing a nerve block (in which it was inserted too far and punctured the pleural cavity) be considered malpractice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3v8q3g?context=5)|Well it depends. Pneumothorax is a known complication of certain nerve blocks. I am not sure why it would result in a month long hospitalization as a chest tube would resolve the problem. Really its situational dependent. Did the practitioner follow standard of care? Was the block done by ultrasound or nerve stimulation or landmarks? Was informed consent obtained. I can't give a good answer to this question without knowing all the facts. Sorry.
[Can one become ""immune"" to anesthesiology if they have enough surgeries?  And I think I remember my mom telling me anesthesiology makes you constipated? Any truth?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3vdjuj?context=5)|You cannot really become ""immune"" to general anesthesia. There are drugs we use in anesthesia like opiods and benzodiazepenes that you can develop a tolerance to however. On that note, the general anesthesia is not what causes the constipation, it is the opiods that are given as part of it for pain control.
[Is heroin used medically at all? I know in the UK it is, but do hospitals here in  North America hold it, to the best of your knowledge?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3vbjeq?context=5)|No. We do use methadone. And cocaine will still occasionally be used as a topical anesthestic.
[So it's not even carried anymore? And may I ask, why not? Under what circumstances would cocaine be used, isn't lidocaine the first line of defense?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3vc9jq?context=5)|As far I know it is not carried in the US. Cocaine is rarely used, but I believe it is still FDA approved as a medication. When it is used it would be primarly for ENT procedures for its local anesthetic properties as well as its vasoconstrictive properties. You are right, it is definitely not first line and I have personally never seen it used.
[Do you run codes often, or work on a code team? Any hints for a second year med student interested in code teams?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3vblwy?context=5)|Anesthesia gets called to every code for airway management. If the patient is on a medicine floor they run the code, we just manage the airway. If the patient is in one of our ICUs we run the code.
[Also, I'm signed up to do an anesthesiology elective in a few months- any advice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3vblwy?context=5)|I mentioned earlier that the one thing everyone should get out of an anesthesia elective is to learn to properly mask ventilate. You will be able to save someone life in the future with good mask ventilation.
[What kind of education is required, how hard was it for you, and is the job pleasant or does it have it's boring days? Thanks in advance.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3vciqt?context=5)|Anesthesia in the US requires an undergraduate degree, 4 years of medical school and 4 years of residency. It is definitely not an easy course, involves long hours including weekends and holidays. I enjoy my job but it definitely can have its boring days. The majority of cases, especially in bread and butter cases, will be pretty straight forward. One of the challenges of anesthesia is to be ever vigilant, because when things go wrong they go wrong quickly and you have to be on top of it.
[I have MH and this was found out during surgery. My uncle was an ENT and my brother and I were being operated on simultaneously to remove tonsils. Almost lost both of us. This was in the early 70's and no family history.  Any experience with MH?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3vdzo8?context=5)|I have had one experience with MH in the OR. We managed to diagnose it relatively quickly and give dantrolene and the patient did well. I also had one experience with a patient with diagnosed MH. With today's equipment it is pretty straight forward to perform a ""clean"" technique to avoid any triggering drugs. It is EXTREMELY important that you let your anesthesiologist know in advance of your history of MH before you go in for any type of surgery, even if its not a planned GA.
[Why do you think famous people keep taking and killing themselves with anesthetics as apposed to other drugs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3v9rfh?context=5)|Can you provide an example besides Michael Jackson? He took propofol with is an anesthestic used for provided sedation or general anesthesia. Sure, many celebrities take benzodiazepenes and opiods, but that's because they are legal and they find corrupt doctors who will write them prescriptions for it, and while we do use them in anesthesia they are not exclusive to anesthesia. There are plenty of celebrities who also take illegal drugs and kill themselves.
[Have you ever undertaken or heard of colleagues undertake the Suxamethonium challenge whereby two people are administered a dose of IV sux and then attempt to run the futherest distance before collapsing due to the paralysis. Of course you need a colleague on hand to bag you through until worn off?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3vgne9?context=5)|Haha, I have actually heard rumors of that being done in the past. The Sux olympics. Never personally undertaken, or know of anyone who has though.
[My doctor has diagnosed me with schizophrenia. I have a VERY annoying tingling in my hands and feet that does not go away with medication. I thought it was God, now I think it is Satan/aliens. Would anesthesia be able to numb my feet to get rid of this sensation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3v85tl?context=5)|There are pain procedures that can be done for things like phantom limb pain which are psychosomatic, however I do not have a great deal of experience in treating a condition like yours and would not be able to make a statement in one way or the other. We do perform nerve block procedures but as your sensation is likely derived from your central nervous system I do not know if that will solve your problem.
[Have you ever killed anyone?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3vbk8k?context=5)|No.
[Educate me: as far as I know, anesthesiologists administer drugs to put patients to sleep. What about this requires intense medical training and warrants a high salary?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3v98n1?context=5)|Anesthesia is not only putting a patient to sleep, but maintaining them asleep throughout surgery, while monitoring their cardiopulmonary status, making sure that there bodies are handling the anesthesia and the surgery well, monitoring their fluid status and blood volume status, having them wake up after surgery and control their pain. It is also a technical field in which numerous procedures including intubation, arterial line placement, central venous line placement, peripheral nerve block, transesophageal echocardiography and many others are performed. It is a pretty high stress job because when things go wrong in anesthesia, they go wrong extremely quickly and disastrously and you have to be quick to respond and respond appropriately, otherwise the patient may die. We have to be there to make sure that people are able to make it through the unbelievably physiologically disturbing process of surgery, and to wake up afterwards as if nothing happened. Basically taking a person to the brink of death and then bringing them back with no adverse outcomes.
[I think this is related - does a large part of your training involve multiple-drug interactions and things like using alternate pathways to administer drugs due to the complications of a particular situation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q6uis/iama_anesthesiologist_ama/c3vatb7?context=5)|That is definitely part of the training. Learning to respond to situations that are outside the norm. That's why we need training. If everyone responded the same and there was no unexpected then there would be no need for a human there.

q7pbf,8,2012-02-27,I started my 1st real job out of college at a major consulting company in Sep 2011. I've learned that this job isn't the route that I want to go. I had a 4 month temp job before that. How do I put this on my resume/cover letter without giving off a job-hopper vibe?,JustKeepRedditn010,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/q7pbf/i_started_my_1st_real_job_out_of_college_at_a/,"Long story short, I've had 4 internships/jobs since 2009:

Summer 2009 - internship at unrelated company
Summer 2010 - internship with ABC co (they offered me a FT job starting Sep 2011)
1st part of 2011 - temporary job at unrelated company to hold me over until Sep 2011
Sept 2011 - current - job with ABC co

I liked my internship with ""ABC"", but I've since learned that I don't want to do consulting work. Too much stress, traveling, long hours, etc. Honestly, I'm pretty burned out by the job and the fact that I have no social life because I'm always working 50-80 hours a week.

I've started looking at opportunities elsewhere, but I am afraid that having 4 different positions in 3 years might make people think I am a job hopper when they're skimming my resume. It may look like it on the surface, but when you look at the details, 2 were internships, one of which lead to my current position, and 1 was a temporary job I was doing until the F/T offer became effective. How should I outline my job history so that I don't scare recruiters away?"

I have a few options right now:

A) Graduate in May with my MechE Bachelors and go work where I interned, doing aerospace interiors (seats, lavs, etc.) Not really my area of interest at all but it is aerospace related, so maybe experience there would transfer?

B) Graduate in May and continue my job search with my experience as is, while living at home....really not hoping for this one. I've put in a ton of applications, gotten one interview which went well, but they only had one position, so I am in limbo, not rejected, but no positions to put me in. I had another interview that I am still waiting to hear from, all this from over 50 online applications.

C) Not graduate in May and spend the summer and fall finishing up the 24 or so credits for my Masters in engineering. Then find a job from there, hoping that the Masters + Bachelors + experience will push me higher up on the list for many of the jobs I am applying to.

All of this needs to be decided in the next two weeks or so. I would love to hear from anyone in the industry as to what they think might be the best course of action. One thing I kind of wrote off was applying outside of the industry, as I am very set on working in aerospace but if its a viable option to later then come back in I could look into that. All in all... having a tough time finding an aerospace job, and not sure which direction is best for my future.

Sadly this will be my last entry before my departure; my life on this earth is soon to reach its end. My age has started to cripple me physically but my drive for success and achievement does not heed my physical limits. ‚ÄúTo strive, to seek, to find and not to yield‚Äù to an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. I have yet to witness the fruition of my success, only because I believe success to be a limiting factor in the pursuit of self-fulfillment. Some may view success as a gratifying notion, while I intern refuse to recognize it as such a belief. ‚ÄúHow dull it is to pause, to make an end, To rust unburnish‚Äôd, not to shine in use!‚Äù. I leave my son, my successor, the kingdom I can only hope that he strives to achieve the best he can .‚ÄúNever try to be better than someone else. Learn from others, and try to be the best you can be‚Äù.-John wooden. I cannot say that I myself have reached success, because success is perfection and perfection does not exist, there is always something more to learn, improve, or to master. I have experienced many ways of living, seen many places that which any man or woman would yearn for just a glimpse, yet I am satisfied only briefly, before the reality of my languished life I am living sets in.

q7drr,12,2012-02-26,Life going nowhere...,whydoibotheranymore,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/q7drr/life_going_nowhere/,"I'll just start by saying I'm not a very bright individual at all. Sure I graduated high school with over 4.0 GPA and got into and graduated from college but that is about the extent of my intelligence. In college I had no idea what I wanted to be. Heck, even now I still have no idea. But anyways, I eventually graduated with a bachelor's degree an averagely average cumulative GPA of about 3.0. I graduated from college about two years go now and have been jobless ever since.

Since I had no job lined up after graduation I was basically forced (or strongly encouraged I guess) to move back home which I ended up doing since it made the most financial sense. My dad claimed that he could line up a job for me within three months. Three months go by, lo and behold, still no job. Fast forward to now, still no job. Between then and now though I've essentially been forced to take more classes at a community college and volunteer at an elementary school. Now, I understand that this is a pretty good use of time as that way I won't be seen as just being idle when I apply to jobs but I honestly have no strong desire to do either. I should also mention that of course I have been applying to jobs on my own and have even had a handful of interviews but I never got any of them. I'm convinced it is mostly due to my lack of experience. As I said before, I'm not very bright and as a result, have never worked a single day in my life. Not even retail/fast food during high school or college. Not a very smart move, I know. Now even places like Target and Best Buy won't take me. I'm stuck in that position where nobody will take me because I don't have enough experience or I'm too overqualified. Internships are also usually unpaid and as a result require that you are in school which is kind of problematic. Not to mention I don't live near any major cities so internship opportunities are slim to begin with anyways. I would have to move to a different city but obviously moving for an unpaid internship isn't exactly the greatest idea if I don't want to bleed money.

Additionally, my social interaction has been reduced to a minimum. Everyone I know or used to know is pursuing graduate school or working by now. I was also pretty stupid in not forming more connections during my time in college. In fact, if anything I probably ended up burning a lot of bridges. So I basically haven't hung out with anyone in person for the longest time. I do have interactions with friends online though which keeps me sane.

I'm pretty much at wit's end now. I have contemplated suicide before and even saw a campus counselor during my last year in college but honestly, I have been like this for a few years now. I don't know how I'm still alive but I am, for now.

TL;DR Jobless college graduate with no real goals, life kinda being directed for me now. Pretty much only a few friends left which even then is just online conversations. What is the point of being alive if I have nothing to look forward to? I feel completely and utterly useless since everyone around me is on their way to being independent and successful."

For this reason I wanted to create a post in hopes of finding some solid ideas. I'll provide a little background, and hopefully some of you will have been in the same situation before and can provide some help.

I graduated in December 2009 with a BSBA in Finance (UNCC) and had an internship with a local B/D who just merged with another B/D. I spent the first few months of my post-grad getting my Series 7 &amp; 66 and Insurance licenses. I was under some scummy Insurance salesmen at first, but then was made an admin under a newly recruited advisor. The owners of the B/D could tell I was burning out b/c my ""superiors"" were pieces of shit and my ""leads"" were cold calls to small businesses in the midst of historically low business confidence. The rep I assist has a book which swings around $40mm on any given day, so I have gained a ton of experience assisting him with this (I help in all aspects of operations). We are ""captive"" reps for the time being because we get multiple expenses covered by our B/D and our office hasn't met it's potential due to two ""merger type events"" since March 2010. 

I have a small book of clients, but because of no marketing budget to draw from to generate leads, I have very little hope that I will see any significant growth any time soon. I have busted my ass building a website and general marketing materials using my prior graphic design experience, but all of that is caught up in compliance for the time being.

I was wondering how some of you other young advisors were able to gather a decent asset base with limited resources. I have a phone interview with Vanguard tomorrow, but after reading multiple reviews on GlassDoor, it seems their pay is shit and morale is pretty low. I want to stay an advisor because I truly enjoy interacting with others and helping them with their investments/life decisions. I work for an independent firm, btw, so I am not a victim of ""black &amp; white"" options offered to reps of larger firms like Edward Jones or insurance based broker-dealers.

Would love to hear any response... hopefully my ramble is not too horrible!"
qablw,3,2012-02-28,Completely unrelated questions (unemployed grad),call_me_reggie,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/qablw/completely_unrelated_questions_unemployed_grad/,"Hey Jobbies, just have a few questions I'm hoping you guys and gals might be able to help me straighten out.  

And just some context for these questions - I graduated in May '11 and have been unemployed since.  

1)  If a job has ""2 years experience in Project Management"" or something like that, is it reasonable for me to say that I meet that experience from a mix of internship experience as well as academic projects?  I would apply for the job either way, but sometimes online forms ask you how much experience you have, and as far as I'm concerned, I took a leadership in most group projects I had during school, which I would consider project management to some degree.  

2)  I had an interview at the end of December that went really well, but I didn't get the job.  After thanking the HR person I had met with for the chance to interview, she said ""good luck"" and ""keep in touch"" and all that.  I'm planning on emailing her again in a week or two and asking if any new positions have opened up, but I'mm wondering if it would be appropriate for me to ask her if she knows anyone she could refer me to?  

I should also note that during the rejection phone call, we had a short conversation where she said she knows the market isn't great right now and gave me some suggestions to help pad my resume in the meantime, so it seemed like she was generally interested in helping me find a job.  

3)  I'm thinking about enrolling in an internship program in Singapore.  I've checked it out and it seems like a great deal - you pay a flat fee for plane ticket, housing, insurance, visa, etc. and in the end you'll have made more money than what you paid (though you still have to pay for food, transportation, and such).  I have some friends who are Singapore natives who know the program is respectable/trustworthy, so I'm on board.  However, my parents are very skeptical about it and their apprehension has rubbed off on me a bit and has made me cautious.  Can anyone provide some particularly compelling arguments for or against doing an internship in Singapore?

To me, the pros are obvious - Travel, work, international experience, continue looking for a full-time job while accruing experience, and of course the chance to be hired full-time at the end.  The cons seem like - losing (some, but not too much) money while working, a long-term commitment where I'm available to interview in person, and uncertainty about my position at the end of the internship.  

4)  I just finished part one of an interview process for a position that is completely unrelated to my major/desired field of work.  If I'mm offered the job, I'll take it, but how is this going to help/hurt me as I continue to try to find work in my desired field?

5)  Pertaining to 3 and 4 - Assuming I was offered the job and the internship, would it be better to take a 6 month internship in a field I want to work in, or the full time job in an unrelated field?

Thanks for your input!"

What do I do?",spykid,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/qa3nl/engineer_lacking_experience_not_eligible_for/,"So I changed majors in college, and as a result really packed on the coursework to get my engineering degree in 4 years (which I am now starting to regret). This caused me to overlook finding internships and building my resume, justifying it with the heavy academic workload and not really needing the money. I managed to somewhat get my act together senior year (when i found out my push to finish landed me ahead of most other engineers in the department) and got a couple research positions with my professors. I tried getting internships, but I had zero work experience (never had a job, spoiled kid) and it didn't pan out. So now, I'm graduated and trying to land a legitimate engineering job. I'm working at a manufacturing company as a ""manufacturing engineer,"" but what I do here really doesn't qualify as engineer duties and isn't giving me the experience that I feel engineering employers are looking for. I feel like I'm digging myself a deeper hole at this job. It seems small engineering companies want experienced, senior engineers and large corporations want engineers with more corporate experience - generally corporate internships. Unfortunately, internships almost always require the hire to be currently working towards a degree which I am not. I'm starting to feel like my situation is hopeless and the only thing I can count on is to send out hundreds of applications and cross my fingers that an employer will show some mercy. What can I do to help my situation? Do I need to apply to a company as a janitor or something and somehow rise through the ranks internally? 


TL;DR

-Lack engineering experience

-Not eligible for internships that would help me get this experience

-Currently have an ""engineering"" position with little engineering relevance and sub-engineering salary

-What do I do?

qa3jj,3,2012-02-28,A past acquaintance [true],another-attempt,SlutStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/SlutStories/comments/qa3jj/a_past_acquaintance_true/,"edit- story continued in comments

I posted a similar account of this the other day with a different throwaway account but my comment got buried with downvotes. It was in one of those ""What's your most unbelieveable sex encounter?"" threads. After 20 downvotes, I deleted it. Maybe it'll do better here, especially if I go into more detail.

When I was in college there was a girl named Tammy (not real name) who had a reputation for sleeping with anyone and everyone. She was a party girl for sure, the kind of girl who would flash for 'Girls gone Wild' (she actually did; I used to have the DVD) or make out with a female friend in front of a room full of strangers just for attention. She was totally hot. I jerked off thinking about her all the time but never had the balls to really approach her.

I was a shy loser I admit. I rarely went to parties and I barely knew her but whenever I saw her all I could about was fucking. 

During second year I met my first serious girlfriend. While I still enjoyed hearing the stories of Tammy's sexual exploits, and occasionally catching a glimpse of her on campus, I was more than happy with the love of my life, Rachel. She wasn't in Tammy's league but she was attractive. The sex was nothing crazy but it was good. I was content.

About a year ago I got my first job at a marketing firm in the downtown of a major city. Being the new guy, barely more than an intern, I did all the shit jobs (still do, mostly). Like changing the water cooler or writing the rejection letters to other applicants or attending the meetings that don't matter in any way. Those sorts of things. One of those shit jobs was to go and get coffee for the office each morning.

About three months ago I started my day as usual: texting everyone in my department to ask what kind of drinks they wanted from the Starbucks. The rule was simple: if you didn't reply, you didn't get a drink. So in other words, I always got replies.

When I got to the Starbucks I had a list of nine drinks via text and as I waited in line I tried my best to memorize each one (I hate people who take forever when placing their orders). When it was my turn at the register I looked up from my phone and was stunned to see none other than the infamous Tammy standing behind the counter.

She looked even better than I remembered her, even in that awful looking barista outfit. Long brown hair, large chest, slender body, smooth skin. She graduated a year before me and that year had been kind to her, I though, but there was sweat on her brow and a grimace on her face. Her demeanor had definitely changed, too. Back in college she'd been a queen almost. Here she was just a common worker and she was obviously stressed out and frustrated with the morning rush of customers.

She didn't recognize me at all at first. She just asked what I wanted.

I began listing the drinks. She kept telling me to slow down as she messed with the computer. Realizing she must be new and still learning the ropes I offered her my cell phone and credit card. ""Take your time. I'm in no hurry.""

She smiled for the first time once she realized I'd just made her job a whole lot easier. She gratefully took both and said, ""Thanks! I'll only be a minute.""

About fifteen minutes later she came to my table carrying a paper tray that contained all the steaming cups of coffee. After I signed the credit card receipt and handing it back to her she said, ""Do I know you from somewhere?""

My heart sort of fluttered. All thoughts of Rachel, who was still my girlfriend and actually living with, went out of my head. With shameless excitement I explained to her that we had gone to the same university. I mentioned mutual acquaintences and parties we had been to. One class we had both taken during her last year. When none of that jogged her memory I said my name was Josh Smith (not my real name) and finally she acted like we were long lost best friends.

""Oh my god, Josh! I knew it was you!"" Her lie sounded cheap but I loved it anyway. ""How have you been!?""

We chatted for a few moments and I explained where I worked, which is just down the street from where the Starbucks. She bobbed her pretty head and then told me that she was only working there as a second job. Her REAL job, supposedly, was at an art gallery. I didn't quite buy it but I smiled and nodded as I tried not to stare too much at her chest.

""Here,"" she said after a few minutes. She took my copy of the credit card receipt and wrote a phone number on the back of it. ""We should totally catch up. Give me a call, okay?""

What do we have to catch up on? I wondered. Thankfully all I said was, ""Sure!""

During work that day I realized I couldn't contact her. Doing so would be a betrayal to Rachel. I couldn't get rid of the number though. I entered it into my phone under the name of my Dentist's office instead. Just in case.

Less than a month later I decided that was the wisest thing I ever did.

I am a college student with just over a year until graduation. People are always talking about how hard it is to find a job right out of college and I want to have the best shot of getting one, so for those of you who have been involved with hiring:
What are some of the big no-nos to applying/interviewing?
What qualities do you look for when hiring recent college grads?
Do internships help? 
What about the reputation of the school/degree program? 
Is it true that you just need a degree, regardless of the subject?

However, I'm worried about the merger happening just as I graduate/begin the program... What will happen? Its way harder to be accredited a CA entrance exam waiver. Plus CA requires a bunch more courses that CMA does not. Most are 4th year and it requires overloading. Will the new designation take on the harder accreditation?

[CA accreditation/exam waiver course requirements for my University](http://www.icao.on.ca/Admissions/QualificationProcess/ScheduleofUniversityCoursesforInstituteCredit/1014page1201.aspx) Scroll to the BCom, not the MBA. As you can see it does not even list 2012.

[CMA accreditation/exam waiver for my University](http://docs.cma-ontario.org/post-secondary-courses/u_McMaster%20University_2011-2012-BComm.pdf) This one does list 2012.

I know these documents are difficult to read if you aren't attending this school. Basically CA requires a shitload of difficult 4th year courses that CMA does not. So much so that you need to plan extensively to get them done as it requires more courses than are even necessary for my degree. I was all set in exactly what I was to be taking for the remainder of my degree, what average I needed, etc. to breeze right into the CMA program after meeting with a representative. Now after being on this subreddit I'm super scared of this whole merger thing making it much more difficult for me. I was happy just becoming a CMA.


CMA representatives are still flooding my campus as if nothing big is going down, having table talks and in-class presentations, etc.

&gt;November 04, 2007

&gt;Unpaid Internships - Common but Illegal

&gt;A common, but frequently unreported labor violation is the use of unpaid interns in violation of minimum wage and possibly overtime laws.  The scenario is fairly typical: a company offers an opportunity to ‚Äòbreak into the business‚Äô in exchange for the intern working for free.  You see many examples of this in the entertainment industry.  In fact, despite jobs sites such as Craigslist prohibiting the posting of unpaid ‚Äúinternships,‚Äù you can almost always find one posted.  Some companies try to get around the law by requiring that the internship be part of a college program.  However, there is no exception to the law allowed just because the ‚Äúintern‚Äù may receive college credit.  While it might be possible for a college credit course to require some type of training for a company, the vast majority of these internships are in violation of Federal as well as California labor laws.
&gt;
&gt;In order to qualify as an unpaid internship, the requirement is simple:  no work can be performed that is of any benefit at all to the company.  That is, you can not deliver mail, sort files, file papers, organize a person‚Äôs calendar, conduct market research, write reports, watch television shows and report on them, read scripts, schedule interviews, or any other job that assists the employer in any way in running their business.   
&gt;
&gt;Examples of internships that have been legal are where the job is a ‚Äúdummy‚Äù job.  For example, there was a case of an internship for working on a train.  The company had the interns driving trains from one end of their yard to the other under close supervision.  The moving of the trains was completely unnecessary and was just being done to train the potential employees. As such, no ‚Äúwork‚Äù was being performed, so the internship was legal.  On the other hand, if the workers were moving the trains as part of the regular re-positioning of the trains, but were still performing it under close supervision, they would be required to be paid for the work.
&gt;
&gt;Thus, if in the entertainment industry, you read scripts that have already been read and rejected by the company and the company will not use your input in any way but is simply instructing you on how to read scripts, then they would not need to pay you for your time.  However, if you read the scripts and perform any work that is used by anyone in the company to make any type of decision about that script, then you must be paid for your time.
&gt;
&gt;Another common type of unpaid internship is in martial arts schools that require students to teach classes in order to receive additional belts.  This practice is illegal unless the student is paid for the time.  Because the act of teaching a class is work that benefits the employer, it must be paid for.   
&gt;
&gt;The U.S. Department of Labor has outlined a list of criteria that ALL must be met in order for an internship to be unpaid.
&gt;
&gt; 1. The training, even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employer, is similar to that which would be given in a vocational school;
&gt; 2. The training is for the benefit of the trainee;
&gt; 3. The trainees do not displace regular employees, but work under close observation;
&gt; 4. The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the trainees and on occasion the employer‚Äôs operations may actually be impeded;
&gt; 5. The trainees are not necessarily entitled to a job at the completion of the training period; and
&gt; 6. The employer and the trainee understand that the trainees are not entitled to wages for the time spent in training. 
&gt;
&gt;From the above list, #4 is really the key one ‚Äì all the others will follow from whether the employer derives any immediate benefit from the activities.
&gt;
&gt;The main reason that you do not see more lawsuits regarding unpaid internships is that the interns are very unlikely to sue.  In most cases, they fear being blacklisted, as they will undoubtedly need to use the internship as a reference to get any future work.
&gt;
&gt;This is where California‚Äôs Private Attorney General Act comes in.  Because this law allows anyone at the company to sue for labor violations, even if they themselves are not affected by the violation, it is now possible for these companies to be brought into compliance with the law.  If you work for a company that uses unpaid interns and would like to put an end to this illegal practice, you should consider bringing a Private Attorney General cause of action.
&gt;
&gt;Of course, if the internship is work, not only minimum wage must be paid, but also California overtime (8 in a day / 40 in a week) as well as meal and rest breaks."

It has definitely been a rough time, I got involved with some bad people and ended up relying on substance abuse to take away the pains, or at least try to.

Fast forward to today. I am currently in my last semester of an internship, after which I have a full year of classes before graduation. I want to really make the most of this time and actually enjoy myself, as I have spent the past few years slaving away in class and work(I have been working 20-30 hours a week while taking classes).

Above all, I want to start reconnecting with people again. I used to be a fairly extroverted person, depression definitely made me hide in my shell most of the time. I may not ever be able to return completely to my old sociable self, but I would definitely like to start reaching out to others and connecting to other people. My goal is to eventually start dating again, I have dreamed of a meaningful relationship for years and it's time to finally go out there and follow my dreams. I deserve it, I need to quit holding myself back and being my harshest critic.

That being said, I am not afraid to admit I am really scared. My self-esteem is still pretty low, causing me to fear intimate connections out of fear of rejection. My only experience dating in college was a rather traumatic relationship freshmen year: I was in the beginning stages of depression when I met this girl at a party, as I began falling deeper and deeper into despair she wasted no time using me to her advantage, ultimately cheating on me to get back with her ex-boyfriend. I caught them cheating on me with my own eyes, and she never even apologized. Or thought about warning me that she had herpes.

Since then, I have been damaged goods when it comes to relationships. The few times that someone has shown interest in me, I found it easier to believe that they had mistaken me for someone else, that there was no way anyone could be attracted to me in any way. I wish I could go back in time and smack some sense into myself, but those opportunities are long gone and that is that.

I really want to try and start dating again, but I'm really scared to put myself out there. I don't want my self-esteem to completely shatter again, but I know I have to take risks and put myself out there. Can anyone offer some advice for starting to date after dealing with depression for so long? I'm just not exactly sure who I am or where to go from here.

If you have read down this far, thank you for taking a minute of your time to try and help me, it means a lot. I hope that you all can leave depression in the past and chase your dreams and ambitions, we're all in this together."

So after finishing school a year ago and getting 3 interviews during that time I've decided to say a big fuck you to them stupid assholes of future employers just to see if I will get a reaction.

Here is loosely translated introduction letter I've written for when I send resum√©s.

Dear Mr/Mrs!

I was one of the best in my group during my technical courses to become *****. I was giving my 200% every damn day, working hard and almost became a second teacher in my group because of all the time I took to help the others that had difficulties. I really enjoyed myself while doing that and really developed a passion for it. 

But then my nightmare started.... As I was beginning my internship, in what I now know was one of the worst companies in the field, I tried to find a job somewhere else for a few months with no success... One day, I got fed up with my boss and quit because that company was not interested in to help me gain good experience in the field. I was put in a situation where I had too much responsibilities and I had to teach another intern the job too. So basically I wasn't even finished with my internship that they put me in charge of a team consisting of another intern ( which happen to be an observing internship he was doing ). So I quit  after talking to the boss and realizing that he didn't care about my problems. All he wanted was to make the most profits without paying his employees.

So I continued searching for jobs in the field and nothing was coming my way... But one day at last to my joy I got a job offer in  another field with a good pay but was only seasonal work. So thinking hell I'll take this keep on looking for something in my field its better than nothing? Right? 

Well it seems that ASSHOLES like yourselves think that I should have not taken that job and practically live on the streets with no income in case one of you bastards decided to give me a job!

Well FUCK YOU! I did what at the time was the best choice for me to be able to pay my bills! You think I don't deserve a job in your company because I've not worked in the field in a few months! Well listen to me. Why the fuck do I see your stupid job offer every fucking 3 months looking for new employees you dumb fuck! You keep hiring the stupid ass guy that's going to ask to be paid less. And ends up fucking up all the time on the job so much that you need to fire him/her.

Not the best for the job, not the guy that shows passion for it, noooo not the guy that his willing to give up a more paying job just to work in the field like myself... Noooo, I don't even deserve to be looked at. 

Well I have good news for you! You see, sometime ago, I could have been the perfect employee for you, willing to do any amount of hours, passionate, punctual and that never misses a days work. Every day I give my all into my work. Hell if you would have taken only the chance of hiring me you would have found an employee that wanted to grow in your company. I could have stayed in your company for years because I'm so tired of changing jobs every damn time. All I wanted was to start at the bottom and gain experience and confidence to work my way up. 

But now you twats have just fucked up and are still looking for a new employee every damn 3 months! 

Good luck finding a good employee, I'm going back to school, in a better paying field than this shit hole of a job was, again just to spite all of you fuckers. Oh and yes I will remember your email and will send you another big FUCK YOU when I will finally reach success. No thanks to assholes like yourselves."

Aside from explaining what that is if you don't know, I have to acquire a faculty member of the school. I want to complete my practicum through an internship program, but I am required to have someone from the biology department to overlook my work. 

When people try to get into internships or for faculty members to overlook their internship studies, do they just email a bunch of faculty members to see which ones respond? Do you think professors are willing to do these things? 

Sorry if I'm getting the wrong idea. I'm new at these things. "

* How about my high school credentials? I also have significant programming experience, which I think would probably help‚Äîwould this also go in my r√©sum√©?

* EDIT: Thanks for all the helpful replies. I left out one point in my original post: how important is GPA? I ended up with a 2.6 overall in the fall. Favoritism often didn't have to provide his/her GPA, but if I utilize Callisto, GPA is a requirement."
q8vce,11,2012-02-27,Secured card for travelling abroad,anti-hipster,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/q8vce/secured_card_for_travelling_abroad/,"Hi. I'm a 22 year old student, I'll be in Germany for 5 months doing an internship this year. I figured a good way to avoid having to move my American savings into the Euro would be to get a Capital One (since they have no international transaction fees) for some of my purchases, and pay it off with my US Dollars. I also want to start building credit.

Unfortunately the only thing I can get is the Secured Card, because I have no credit history whatsoever (except for student loans that are still being deferred till after graduation). The initial limit is only $200, and you can increase it by depositing more as collateral (so, pay an extra $300, credit line goes up to 500).

That isn't a huge problem since I will be using this for food, train tickets, some entertainment, etc. that I could pay off day-of or week-of. However, maintaining a good credit utilization ratio would have me spending like $20-$30 before I have to pay it off/stop using it. For such a low limit, would it be ok for me to use $100 (50% CU) every time before paying off, or would I be screwing myself since this is my only credit line?"

I'm clean and professional, but I'm also very easygoing and kind. I'm also an Eagle Scout.

I am looking for a job that would satisfy the following requirement, and this requirement only: I want to be happy that I'm working there.

I want paychecks to be given on time so there's no quarreling and fighting about money. I want to be awake and willing to do my work so that I can do a good job and we can have a good working relationship. I don't care if the job is stressful, hard, boring, low-paid, time-consuming or detrimental to my health - I want to work.

It's on and off because we met in the summer while I was on an internship, dated all summer, and then took a break when we didn't want to do long distance. We never stopped talking so we have been dating officially for about 3 months. We see each other once or twice a month for a weekend.  
  
Anyways, things are great when we're together,  but we end up getting into fights over nothing when we're apart. For example, just deciding when we will see each other next we end up going back and forth and getting super frustrated. He thinks of traveling as a big hassle, but I am a frequent flyer so it doesn't bother me to hop on a plane and come see him. So when I ask him if he thinks I should come for the weekend, he says no because it's too much work for me.  
  
I try to say that it's not too much work and I actually want to know if he wants me to come, but he says stuff like ""I vote no, but it's up to you."" I ask why he votes no, and he says he thinks it's too much work for me, and we get in a big cycle.  
  
I know this probably sounds like he just genuinely doesn't want to see me that weekend, but he swears that's not it - so I find it confusing.  I know we have communication issues and I really want to work through them, but it is tough.  
  
That's just one example, but it happens a lot that we end up with hurt feelings because we aren't hearing what each other is saying.  Has anyone gotten through something like this? "

qbu6x,1,2012-02-29,"Post-college, non-(immediate) grad school career routes? (In Boston metro area, if that matters.)",magmadar,Archaeology,https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/qbu6x/postcollege_nonimmediate_grad_school_career/,"So I've finished my B.A. in archaeology, taken every GIS course available, completed a field school with a huge surveying focus, worked on 3 GIS research projects with a couple professors, volunteered at the archaeology lab at school, and volunteered at an archaeology-adjacent museum for three years (well, summers). I'm also okay at human osteology.


Problem: **I do not want to immediately leap into grad school because I don't have a well-defined research interest, and I'd like to get some actual experience before sinking that much time/money.** I like GIS and linguistics, and I love lab. I've done a little 3-d site modelling and am enamored of the idea of site scanning. But in my wildest idylls, I'd be working in/near an archaeology lab in a museum, building exhibits. This definitely requires grad school. Also, museums don't seem to be hiring minimally-qualified people much these days, for reasons unknown. I really don't care where I end up, as long as I'm moving forward and can reasonably subsist.


In light of this, **the best paths seem to be getting into surveying, doing  part-time GIS lab work, or trying out CRM, which is the default. But is CRM really the best choice?** Most of the postings I've seen (on ArchaeologyFieldwork) are very sporadically scheduled, and request that applicants be locals. (Also, and this is a huge caveat, I don't have a driver's license, but I'm working on it.) I've found a couple paid GIS internships that seem to be more data management than visualization, and those are only for a season &amp; have no archaeological component. **Would it be better to just get a full-time/part-time&amp;family job related to my actual paid experience and volunteer in labs/museums during the weekend/evening? Is there another route that I haven't considered?**


Also: archaeology around Boston. Lots of schools with programs, a couple museums, one big professional organization, GIS pretty much only relating to engineering/urban planning, city archaeology doesn't seem to do much post-Dig. Are these impressions incorrect?"
qbtm8,2,2012-02-29,"Four final interviews since May '11 - three rejects, the remaining one probably going the same way. What am I doing wrong?",nautilu5,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/qbtm8/four_final_interviews_since_may_11_three_rejects/,"Hi Reddit.

Apologies for the textwall below, but I think it's important to convey my situation in full. 

I am an international student in the USA - graduated with a Master's degree in mechanical engineering back in May '11, and have been looking for jobs since. I came to grad school straight out of undergrad, and I know I screwed up by not taking internships during grad school. All I have are two degrees with a number of relevant projects and an undergrad internship back home.

I've lost count of the number of phone interviews I've been through, and I've been to four final on-site interviews. Three of these have ended in rejections, and it's been five weeks since the fourth. The interviewer promised a decision in two weeks, but the recruiter is still responding to follow-up emails saying no decision has been made yet - so I fear the worst. I do realize that my lack of experience might be a turn-off, but I have a few friends in the same situation who have landed pretty good jobs anyway.

I don't want to sound immodest but I know I am intelligent and have excellent communication skills. I have some (non-technical) experience leading and managing very large teams, which may or may not be relevant to a job search now. I always dress well for interviews, have been punctual and am very careful with etiquette. I've even had recruiters on phone interviews tell me that they don't understand how, with my background and apparent abilities, I am still unemployed - but even they don't seem to call back afterwards, so I don't know what to make of that.

To me it seemed like all my f2f interviews seemed to go off without major glitches, but none of them have seemed to go exceptionally well. Anecdotal evidence from friends suggests that for an interview to end in an offer, it generally involves some immediate hitting-off with the interviewer, and a sign-off on the lines of ""expect an offer"". I've never had one of those - my interviews always seem to be vanilla conversations, I always feel like I'm not doing anything wrong but I'm not great either, and I have always had to ask about a decision timeframe; I never seem to get the elusive ""expect an offer"".

What am I missing? Is there anything I can do to distinguish myself? I'm at a dead-end with Monster, CareerBuilder, LinkedIn and friend/family networks - is there something I can try beyond this? I am stuck with significant debt and exchange rates mean I need the $$, so going back home is not an option at the moment. Any suggestions I can get would be appreciated.

**TL; DR:** Dead-end after four final interviews since May. None of the interviews seem to have gone badly, but they haven't gone well either. Don't know what signs I'm missing - help?"

Best way to go about finding one related to my future career goals?,gsufilmstudent,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/qbp1t/film_student_looking_for_internships_best_way_to/,"So, I'm a film student at GSU in Atlanta who's in the process of looking  for a summer internship. This probably sounds cliche, but, my ultimate goal is to become a DP. However, I'd be happy doing anything in the camera department.

I know it's a tough department to get into, so I was wondering if anybody had some advice for finding an internship that is related to my career goal. What I mean by that is, I really don't want to intern in an office where I'm getting people coffee and answering phone calls (however, I'm not above getting people coffee, taking lunch orders, going on runs, etc. - as long as it's on set and near a camera).

For those of you in camera, how did you get to where you are? What steps did you take starting out in order to get into the camera department?
I realize not everybody goes the film school route, but I'd like to hear people's experiences from both sides.

Also, if anybody in the Atlanta area is looking for a good intern, I'm your guy. I'm a hard-worker - I'll do whatever it takes to get the job done - and I'm highly-motivated. I'm a quick learner and a good listener (in other words, I know how to keep quiet and do what I'm told). Also, I've got PA experience working on music videos and commercials, as well as experience working as a camera intern on a music video that was shot on an ARRI Alexa, so I've got a basic understanding of how the camera department works.

Any thoughts, suggestions, or experiences would be appreciated."

I have some questions regarding the best way to get into the Audit side of things. I'm 25 and in the second semester of my Freshman year; I'm going for a degree in Accounting. I've been a bookkeeper for about five years now, and the last job I had for three years was at a CPA firm where I did pretty much everything that a staff accountant would (it was just me and the CPA so it was a learning on the job kind of thing).



I did a little bit of internal auditing while at the CPA firm and I really enjoyed it and would like to continue with that path, but I'm at a loss for how to really get there. I've looked at the classes for my degree and there's one audit class that I'll take in my Senior year. Is that enough to get a certification, or should I also get work experience as well? I don't know if it would look better to continue with the bookkeeping job that I have now (been here for a little over a year now), or start looking for an internship or something else that will give me audit specific work experience.



I'm also at the point in life where I want to find a nice place to put some roots down so to speak. Is it going to look bad on my resume if there are transfer credits (possibly from multiple schools, I'm not sure how long it will take me to find a place I really like), and multiple jobs that have about a year stint at each place?



Since I work full time and go to school full time I really don't have any extra time for service groups or anything like that. Is that going to be a hindrance to me getting an interview? 



I know these types of posts pop up a lot, but I didn't see any prior posts about getting into Audit and having some accounting work experience prior to getting out of school. Perhaps I didn't search well enough though, and if so, I would love to be pointed to those resources that I missed."

Other suggestion's I've been given by various lecturer's have been the Banach-Tarski Paradox, Gaudi's use of geometric surfaces, or even creating some mathematical artwork or poster's for the department. 

This seems to me like an amazing opportunity, and I'd like to use it to do something which will further my mathematical understanding, while being fun and perhaps even being useful in some way. 

I'd love to hear of any suggestions you might have.

qblep,2,2012-02-29,[FOR HIRE] Senior chem/bio student looking for professional laboratory experience.,[deleted],denverjobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/denverjobs/comments/qblep/for_hire_senior_chembio_student_looking_for/,"I moved to the Denver area in July of 2011, transferring from the University of MN to Metro State. I've had full coursework in gen chem, ochem, biochem, gen bio, microbio, cell bio, calculus, etc. I did have a 3 month summer lab assistant internship back in MN around 2006, so I do have a small amount of real world experience. It was one of the most interesting and rewarding jobs I've had to date. 

Currently, I work at a gas station because of its close proximity to my home but I would really like to get a headstart in my field (even as a micro dept dishwasher, I can work my way up). My future goals after graduation are to gain certification as a clinical laboratory scientist so I can work in a medical lab facility, but I am quite flexible given the right circumstances. I'm a very fast learner, accurate, meticulous, and generally very friendly and agreeable. Hopefully someone here needs someone like me! 

Thanks!"

I promoted around 60 Illinois based acts and was given a budget for and bought talent for 6 venues. I founded a music festival featuring over 40 bands on 5 stages I still manage twice annually from over 1,000 miles away. I read a lot and that has guided me to connect my friends (now PT employees) skill sets to build something greater. Although I am always learning new things I have experience with much of the spectrum of the music industry including audio, festival management, band management, the financing, management and distribution of compilation cds. I have profitably run ad-based underground music journals, invested up to 2k in events with an ROI of much much more. I'm 26, I'm proactive and both a leader and team player. I have a Radio/TV degree and I went the extra mile and got the Radio Marketing Professional Certificate.

Relatively pertaining work experience includes:
Audio/camera operator for WEIU Charleston, IL (2 years).
Morning Show Host WLKL Mattoon, IL (2 years).
Radio Talent WEIU Charleston, IL (3 months).
Radio Intern WVLI Bourbonnais, IL (3 months).

What's happening?",Espalier,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/qaz0t/i_thought_it_was_anxiety_but_its_feeling_more_and/,"I'm a senior at university for Design. My classes so far haven't been very challenging and when they have been, I worried about them, yeah, but this semester's different.

I fell behind almost immediately and I have no reason to to think it'll get better.
I don't have a portfolio, I don't have any internships under my belt, I haven't been looking. I'm not going to work in design after school. I just know it. I'm wasting time and money.
My classes are going to shit and I'm not meeting deadline or quality guidelines. At first it was causing panic attacks, but now it's scarier to me because I'm just crying almost daily. I've had since 2 pm today and I've gotten nothing done for my class tomorrow. These classes are making me hate myself, or I've always hated myself and these classes are just showing me how utterly useless I am. I haven't had any suicidal thoughts, but I have been wishing to stay asleep. I keep wasting time trying to calm myself down or cheer myself up enough to get work done, but today's been crippling. I'm useless. I'm a disappointment to my family. They love me, I know, but I know they're not proud. How could they be?

I want some kind of short cut to the way I used to feel just a few months ago. I wasn't the happiest person, but I didn't hate myself so clearly and absolutely.

I'm afraid that if I make an appointment with a councelor at my school that either they won't help and it'll be ANOTHER waste of time or they do, but it's still a huge timesink. I have no life skills. I have no discipline. I'm a 22 year old spoiled infant who's never had a job who can't handle school stress and has no faith in himself to be able to handle ""real world"" stress.

qaxml,29,2012-02-29,Outdoors Adventure,[deleted],LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/qaxml/outdoors_adventure/,"Back in 2008 I was working on my Environmental Science internship in a brand new place.  Where I come from had an extremely low crime rate, lower than the average for the US, so maybe I was a little naive or just not expecting much to go wrong.  

So, for my internship, I worked outdoors banding birds.  My fellow worker and myself had set up a new spot to band birds at this little secluded fishing access area.  You could drive in from the main, somewhat rural route, and head down to the lake.  It also had a picnic area that no one ever seemed to use, so we set up shop there.  We had our banding area up this forested rise that had zero trails and no one had a need to go anywhere near there for anything else other than what we were doing.  

My coworker would park at the bottom of the rise, so the car was pretty visible, which I later realized was rather dumb.  We learned that gay guys used the spot to meet up, so we felt somewhat safe as we saw them regularly and we'd wave to each other.  

One morning, things went as usual, and I was up near the top of the rise by myself.  I have a habit of looking behind me, and on this morning I noticed a car parked at the edge of the woods, right at the base of where we were working, right near our car.  I crouched down and moved around to see if I could see anybody down there, and saw a man leave the car.  I got ready to call out to him to tell him to please leave the area when he began taking off his clothes.  He took off all of them, and left them on the hood of his car.  He then proceeded to take out a gallon jug of water and two of those large rectangular buckets that hold cement mix from his car.  

I had a chuckle at how strange this was while finding a dip near the top of the rise to hide in.  I started panicking though as the man entered our work area and started walking up the rise.  I didn't know exactly where my coworker was and he seemed to be headed right to where she had gone earlier.  I called her on her cell and told her there was a naked man in the woods.  She started screaming to get out of the woods and hung up on me to call the police.  

Problem was, there was no way out of the dip I was in without him seeing me when I got up, so I knew I'd have to book it.  I got up, and he turned right to me, total frontal view and set his buckets and water down and started heading right for me.  I booked it down the rise to the parking lot till I found my coworker.  

The cops came, found the guy, took him in and looked him up.  He had traveled over an hour to this particular spot and never gave his motive as to what he was going to do there, but those cement buckets were both full of porn magazines.  The cops showed us what came up when they searched him in their system: Repeat Violent Sexual Offender.  "

I am currently a junior studying ECE, and I think it might be really awesome to go get my PhD after graduation. I am currently debating whether to take a summer position with an REU program doing HPC research or working with one of the National Labs working with their supercomputing. Is there one that looks better for a graduate school application?

Also, here's my resume if that might help you provide an opinion: http://db.tt/xELv77iq

TL;DR - Which looks better on a grad school application DoE SULI internship or a REU program? "

I initially took a leave of absence, which eventually turned into an official withdrawal. Grades were decent but not spectacular.

TL;DR - LSAT 170, went to a T-14, finished 1L and a paid summer internship (mostly to recoup some costs!), and then quit. Took me about 1 year to get fully situated into another career track, and now I'm happily employed in a highly enjoyable and rewarding job in the tech/new media field.

Just kidding, but it's really close. Seriously though: Ti-83 BASIC in high school (weak to put on here, I know, but I self-learned the language to a point of pride, although I was far from very good), and one semester of MATLAB programming during my third semester at Cal's MechE program. I personally believe that I'm fast at learning computer languages, from my experience, and good at self-teaching myself things. I don't make it to class very often as a MechE student due to unrelated reasons, but have self-taught most of the material and am passing all of my classes. 
Anyway, the internship was offered by a family friend, and I'm assuming it's related to Intel. I asked him for more job specifications, and this is what he replied:

**A Strong knowledge of the Microsoft .NET framework: VB.Net, .NET Framework Class Library**

**Object: oriented programming, Classes, encapsulation, data abstraction and abstract data types, DLL, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Exception Handling, Files and Streams, Regular Expressions, GUI, GDI+, Multithreading, Binary and/or Hexadecimal, Data Structures, Arrays, and Software Debugging**

**Experienced or Familiar with Electronic Signals: Software DSP, Electronic theory, Understanding of Digital Storage Oscilloscopes, Knowledge of PC architecture**

Please let me know if it's possible to learn all this stuff! At least a basic knowledge, where I won't feel overwhelmed by everything going on. I have until early June to learn everything, and can probably allocate between 3-6 hours a week on learning programming. Thanks guys! Let me know if I should post this in any other subreddits as well.

qam9c,1,2012-02-28,What will it take for a for-profit organization to be brought down? I don't know... like ITT Tech?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/qam9c/what_will_it_take_for_a_forprofit_organization_to/,"If any of you remember from late December, I posted about how people [should know that ITT is a scam and yatta yatta:](http://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/nt4ra/you_should_know_that_forprofit_schools_like_itt/)


Many people who have gone through or know people who have gone through for-profit schools  shared their stories. Many tragic, some relatively successful.


Also, many people remind me that I'm RES tagged as the guy who graduated from ITT. 

Since then, I've been some higher education knight, making sure people don't go to for-profit colleges, just doing what I feel like I can as one individual. 

I'm interning at Fidelity Investments in the IT department. I've earned the internship through a program called Year Up. I didn't pay a DIME for Year Up, in fact, they paid ME $300 every two weeks to take classes with them for 6 months. We went over easily 3/4 of what ITT Tech teaches for $48,000 for a 2 year certification that confirms me being an idiot. It's painful to know that I got further through a non-profit organization in SIX MONTHS than I did for 2 agonizing years at ITT.

I have no plans to go back into school, considering that NO SCHOOL WILL EVER TAKE ITT TECH'S CREDITS AND I'D HAVE TO GET *ANOTHER* ASSOCIATES DEGREE TO PROCEED TO MY BACHELOR'S.
(Definitely aiming for certs though)

Now I'm not sure what's going on, maybe it's just me, or maybe Google is specifically targeting me for these advertisements, but I've been seeing ITT Tech advertisements EVERYWHERE! 

Youtube, fighting game forums, gmail, links from reddit and it's driving me crazy! 




I can't stand seeing ITT advertise, I can't stand the fact that people KNOW ITT Tech puts business before education, I can't stand how ITT Tech mostly recruits young adults who probably have on idea what they want to do/where they want to be and probably aren't ready for college yet. I can't stand how successful this business is selling false hopes and dreams.


Is there ANYTHING...I mean ANYTHING that I as an individual, WE as human beings can do to bring these scammers to their knees?

Could I take them to court?

Is there some kind of organization that will actually put their foot down and say enough is enough? 


I'm extrememely busy these days, if there isn't anything I can do RIGHT NOW, I will definitely prepare to do it after I graduate from Year Up in 5 months.

Anything?

These seems like a perfect subreddit to repost this at the moment.

We're a post-production house in Chicago focused mainly on commercial spot work. And we're looking for the perfect intern to work with our engineering/IT department.

We fix things when they break. We install and make everything work together perfectly. Our projects include planning and installing new equipment, computer hardware and software support, maintenance of video and audio gear, IT networking, and general troubleshooting alongside our editors and artists.

If you're interested, you should already have some background in video production and post-production. Knowledge about editing and graphics, and the software and hardware behind it would be nice. Knowledge about video and audio cables...how to make them, crimp, solder, troubleshoot, etc. Ethernet? Yes. Troubleshooting Mac, Windows? Yes. Linux? Oh, that'd be real nice.

If you're dreams are to become an editor, graphics artist, audio engineer, or some other awesome person who sits in the chair and runs the gear...that's great. But don't apply to this internship.
If instead...you think you've got a great mix of potential talent, interests, and desire to rebuild computers, wire networks, climb around ceilings digging in cable trays, and help support a video post-house...well...we should talk. 

We're located in downtown Chicago. Send me a PM with a non-form-letter introduction, and I'll be in touch.
