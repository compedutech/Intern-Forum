lwuys,1,2011-11-01,Can they really force me to finish the internship?,[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/lwuys/can_they_really_force_me_to_finish_the_internship/,"So I'm currently employed as an intern at a large corporation. I received this internship through an organization at my university (but it is not part of my degree). This organization has the membership of dozens of companies where interns might get placed, and they also require interns to finish a 6 month internship at the company that they are placed in. I graduated at the beginning of Summer and then started an internship. I have completed 4.5 months of the internship and I just received (and accepted) a job offer from another company. I put in my 2-weeks notice with my current company.

I recently heard that the internship organization has previously tried to strong-arm students into not ending the internship early. Both companies (call them 'A' and 'B') are members of the internship organization. The student was interning at A and then gets a job offer at B. The internship organization, caught wind of the situation and then threatened to kick company B out of the organization if they hired the intern before his 6 months were completed. Additionally, to get into the organization, I signed a document basically saying, ""I'll fully complete the 6-month internship."" 

Are they overstepping their bounds by trying to strong-arm students in this way? Or is it acceptable because I signed that document? It seems like there's a limit to what they can do to enforce the 6-month requirement (and ruining a job opportunity, seems **way** too far).

I really appreciate some knowledgeable thoughts on this."

Can Anyone Explain?,SpectralCoding,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/lwumb/aspiring_sysadmin_not_understanding_the_windows/,"I currently have an internship working in a Datacenter with a combination of RHEL/Windows Server boxes. I had always learned that Windows is terrible for server-type uses and that Linux was always the way to go. I run my own VPS running Ubuntu and have been very happy with it. I use it for learning, some hosting, and just random projects. I'm 100% comfortable with the command line.

After I started working at my internship which has probably 60/40 Win/RHEL OS spread I don't understand really the hate for Windows Server. I will still 100% agree that Linux takes the cake for Web-based stuff, but I feel like it can't compete with the offerings of Active Directory and other Windows-specific software. I'm sure there is something similar out there for managing Linux clients in the same way you manage Windows workstations, but I haven't heard of one.

Is the ""hate"" specific to Windows Server reliability? Is it the GUI-driven interface? What about Core Server and Powershell? I guess the bottom line is that I understand Windows is better for certain things, but why the (basically) unanimous hate for Windows networks/infrastructure?

Can anyone help me understand?

Edit: So what I'm gathering from this is that people who STRONGLY DISLIKE using Windows server are either biased, using them for the wrong things, or aren't doing it right. I don't have any sources really but I've seen MANY posts about how much people don't like Windows infrastructural solutions, but hardly any where people say they love them. Personally, I'm very happy with our solution at my company. We also have competent admins so that definitely helps."

lw8tg,2,2011-11-01,Just graduated and I feel reluctant to pursue a career related to my studies. What should I do?,dealday,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/lw8tg/just_graduated_and_i_feel_reluctant_to_pursue_a/,"After 5 years as an undergrad, I'm finished with a B.S. - majoring in nutrition &amp; dietetics and minoring in hospitality, food service &amp; hotel management. Typically students go through a one year dietetic internship (DI) and take a licensing test to become a Registered Dietitian (RD) afterward. I've withheld my application to DI's b/c I'm not certain I want to pursue a career as an RD. This is largely due to the fact that RDs aren't paid well b/c it's a female dominated field and still a developing career (I'm at 23 year old male btw). Also, I read that 10% of RDs make more than 58k; personally, that's a very low goal to be working towards.

The reason I chose the major in the first place was b/c the previous courses I took fulfilled many of the pre-reqs. So I said to myself, ""Why not pursue nutrition. It'll help with my father's gout and relatives' bad eating habits."" So I stuck with it and did well till the end. I have decent volunteer experience, leadership experience, and GPA (3.6). Currently my job is a very common position for a student with plans to get into an internship. Although I'm only paid $9.50/r in contrast to better and well-organized hospitals that pay $11+/hr. I've stayed at my job at the hospital as back up. At least I'm still on the path as an aspiring dietitian.

Anyways, I've been out of school since May, and I've been working and being a lazy bum. I've told myself I would take the time to explore other careers but I haven't seriously done that until now. Becoming an RD seems like the ultimate goal with this major but I don't feel passionate about it to call it a vocation. Eh... I need help figuring out what I want to do with my life. Returning to college is definitely an option. Although it would be ideal to use my degree as leverage or at least the courses I took as relevant to what I would want to pursue."

Currently I write FR looking for those thing lol.

HB7:
Met a girl and found out we are the same major and I basically tried to brag about the internship offer I just got making a butt load of money(DHV?) and asked her her plans after college. After talking for a while some girl tried to get people to dance and I suggest the girl suggesting the dancing and the girl I was talking with sandwich me. 

So I'm dancing with two girls but I'm just trying to grind with the one I was talking to so I tell her to turn around, and like that; we're grinding. Luckily my friend was there to take the other girl. So we're dancing pretty intensely, I'm in state, enjoying her ass, even the girl my friend took complained to him saying why cant he be like me cause ""look, hes so into it.""

But after one song it dies down cause she get a serious text about someone she knows being stuck somewhere because of the snowstorm. We talk for a while again and I am bored of our conversation and really just want to feel her ass again so I suggest dancing again but it was a no go cause no one else was dancing and because it was a semi small party it'd be like we are putting on a show for everyone. I mean I was drunk enough that I wouldn't mind, but she wasn't down. Than she excused herself to get some beer.

After that I left the party to go drink some more, and came back and didn't really try to start the convo up again with her for some reason. I think I wanted her to show she was really interested and start the convo back up with me, which I realize is a stupid thing to wait for since she could be easily thinking the same thing. Didn't really interact with her the rest of the night which is stupid after getting to know her as much as I did, could of number closed if I caught her when I eventually left. SMH.

HB8:
Tried to talk to another girl who was just standing/hovering but just asked boring questions to keep conversation going. I realized this and even said ""could I ask you one more boring question"" and ended the convo after that.

She ended up sitting next to me later, which may sound stupid/arrogant but I should of took as a IOI cause she was just sitting there alone staring at the wall when she could of been over by her friends talking. I opened her with [this line(click)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZlZryEKdXE&amp;feature=channel_video_title#t=02m52s) from simplepickup which worked a lot in terms of receptiveness but I again for some reason let the convo end there, I wanted to use that line on someone this whole semester and I finally did and for some reason I took that as an accomplished goal and didn't even try to use the high energy I created with that line to get to keep talking to her or anything. SMH.



TLDR (Lessons for the future);

-keep the conversations more high energy, and at least keep em going!
-don't concentrate on one girl
-keep the conversation going!
-have bigger goals, dancing and opening aren't the end game
-with that said, more kino!...realized easier to do after dancing too"

lw198,53,2011-10-31,Career advice from the other side,djpeef,WeAreTheMusicMakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/lw198/career_advice_from_the_other_side/,"It seems to be a common thread recently to ask for career advice in audio production.  I have an audio degree and have worked in the music technology field.  I think there are a lot of misconceptions about audio engineering, so I hope to dispense a little sage advice for those thinking about it.

* Consider the industry trend for audio engineering - large studios are closing, and more production is moving to the ""pro home studio.""  That means there is much less concentration of work for audio engineers, as it is going towards more specialized gigs.  This means to work with a certain group or for a certain studio, you have to have closer contact with those that are involved.  (Read:  it's harder to get a job without solid relationships with industry insiders.)

* Getting a degree in audio engineering is not a golden ticket to getting some big studio gig.  People who get studio gigs have been working at the studio for years, and are good friends or relatives with the staff.  Most of the people working at the studio probably don't have any formal audio training.  I would go ahead and put those prospects out of your mind right now.  You can always intern or work as the gopher, but you're going to have a hard time paying the bills without a second job.

* Getting a degree in audio engineering doesn't mean you know it all, or are even good at audio.  It means you showed up, took the tests, and learned enough to get a degree.  Keep working and practicing.  Find a mentor that you can ask for help.  You won't get better otherwise.

* If you are going to get a degree in audio, please go for a bachelor's degree from an accredited university.  You'll spend way less money, and it will keep the doors open for future educational opportunities should you want to consider them.  Certificates, technical schools, and vocational schools aren't quite the same, and can sometimes be predatory when it comes to tuition costs.

* The best way to start your way in audio is to do freelance mixing.  This requires working full-time at another position, but mixing in your free time.  As you work for more clients and word of mouth builds, you might eventually work your way in for other audio gigs.

* Most audio work is outside of the studio environment.  The most related work is in live sound, and there is a LOT of work in that field, as more artists are touring longer and more frequently to supplement their recording incomes.  Additionally, there is audio work in broadcast, post-production for films, video games, and other video-related applications.  It wouldn't hurt to study video production in addition to audio.

*  Don't expect audio engineering to pay well.  You'll most likely be disappointed.  Not that it can't ever pay well, but you may have to work a lot longer and a lot harder in the music industry to make the money you could have elsewhere.  Keep in mind that you'll be working for musicians, not businessmen or lawyers, so not everything is clear-cut or fair when it comes to payment.

*  In addition to the last point, you'll most likely have to live two lives and work two jobs - one that brings in enough income to pay bills, and audio.  That doesn't mean you are giving up on your dream, but rather supplementing your dream to make sure you can still get by.

Hope this helps!

EDIT:  Dig into gear as well!  Knowing what equipment or software can help you achieve a particular sound is crucial.  A lot of people are clueless of knowing the particulars here, and thus don't know where to turn when they are searching for a certain sound.  You don't even have to buy gear - you could rent it for a short time just to give something a shot."

I'm not sure if I could technically be called 'suicidal' because the way I feel about death is much more passive: on days that I want to die, I want to get hit by a car or killed by something or someone else, but I don't want to do it myself. But I really do want to die, like I feel like that's the only way it would solve my problems.

I can't really talk to anyone about this IRL because I either feel bad burdening my close friends/relatives or when I do decide to burden them I get the ""stop whining so much"" response because on the surface my life is going fairly well. (Good student, good internship, doing fairly well financially, good family, good relationship, etc.)

But I keep getting weighed down by other things. I'm not sure if I can describe it, but judging from some of the other posts on here, I'm sure some of you have an idea of what I mean--my brain starts going into all of these panicky thoughts and I feel like I'm never going to amount to anything so I should just die and get it over with. Stuff like that. 

I have a (physical) health issue (type 1 diabetes) that I've had since I was really young and it's just depressing having to take care of that and even more depressing knowing that it's never going to go away. I'll spare you the rant on exactly what's so depressing about it but the main points are (a) it's a lot of work, (b) it's a lot of work that none of my peers have to do, (c) everyone else seems to think that ""hurr cake diabeetus"" jokes are hilarious and I'm like okay that's my life you're making really wrong jokes about, and (d) it's expensive to pay for all of the medicine/supplies each month.

I'm seeing a counselor (through my school) and things have been going really well for the past couple of weeks but today this all came slamming back into me and now I just want to curl up into a ball and die rather than deal with everything that I'm anxious and stressed out about. I just feel like such a terrible person and I can't even say why, I just feel terrible. And then I hear things like ""what could you possibly have to complain about"" and read about terrible things happening in the world and feel even worse because it makes me feel like my entire life is firstworldproblems. So then I get guilt on top of my depression.

I guess what I'm looking for is advice. Does anyone have any coping skills that they can recommend? Nothing I already know of/do is helping me out and I hate feeling like I want to just die so that I don't have to deal with everything anymore.

tl;dr I hate my life and sometimes want to run into oncoming traffic and want advice.

So I'm applying for an entry-level consultant job with a fairly large consulting firm, and I'm kinda nervous that my cover letter may be...well, terrible.

I've tried to hit some of the things that they say they're looking for on their website: creativity, analytic skills, problem-solving skills, etc. Since I really have no experience in business matters/finance, I've tried to play all that up instead of focusing on specifics.

I have a few questions:

1) Is this rubbish?
2) Does it make me look like, for lack of a better word, a dick?
3) Any suggestions?

Thanks all! The CL is posted below (changed identifying details).

Dear Hiring Manager;

I am writing to express my interest in an entry-level consultant role with your company.

I graduated from Derp College in 2010 with a double major in Political Science and Gibberish (summa cum laude in Gibberish major) and spent the following year studying Gibberish at Random University on a Random Government scholarship.

Through several internships and jobs, I have had the chance to realize that I work best in a dynamic, results-oriented workplace with a focus on collaborative, creative problem solving. As the only full-time staff member on a campaign for the Random State Legislature, both the candidate and I had to overcome our lack of experience in this field to build an effective, sustainable grassroots campaign. With no party support and a shoestring budget, we used research and trial-and-error to establish a robust volunteer network, fundraising operation and social media outreach framework. In my experience as an educator—both as a Gibberish instructor at a local community college and as an English tutor in Country—I had to overcome my inexperience in pedagogical matters by coming up with creative ways of engaging my students, using a range of teaching methods and multimedia to pass on my own love of language.

While I lack experience in business administration and financial matters, I am a very fast learner, and tend to get almost obsessively interested and absorbed in whatever field I happen to be working in. I also feel that my experience in working at the bottom level of several retail and logistical operations gives me a valuable perspective on the human element of business operations, as well as a fundamental understanding of how companies implement their core competencies.

I am confident that I would thrive at Placeimapplyingto, and have frankly been amazed at what I have learned about your corporate culture. Between the Non-Profit Fellowship Program, in-house learning networks and the many options for even new consultants to take the initiative on improving both themselves and the company, I feel that Placeimapplyingto is exactly what I have been looking for in a company: a place where the importance of creativity, self-improvement, hard work and the sum of human experience is respected.

Thank you for your time, I look forward to your reply.

Sincerely,

So-and-so

Do you have any advice?  Portfolio links at bottom. **

Hi, I'm looking for Austin-based HCI jobs, internships, or research starting in summer 2012, after I get out of UT.  These opportunities could be anything along the lines of interace design at a web design company to mobile development to HCI research.  I suspect HCI research opportunities are very rare, but it would help out should I ultimately apply to an HCI grad program in 1 or 2 years.   My preference is research or a mobile development job.

I'm open to advice.

I'd prefer to stay in Austin to reduce travel/moving costs (college loans!), though I'm open to moving... 

I have a BA in liberal arts; however, I prolonged my stay in college by 3 semester to gather core CS courses.  As far as design, I have extensive background in web design and some experience with designing iPhone user interfaces.  As far as programming, I have about 2 years of CS courses under my belt, and by summer 2012, I should have gone through the list of courses in my resume.   (Sidenote: also have minor background in film, should it be handy...)

I'm open to advice on places to look.  (Silicon Valley?)

I don't think I'm allowed to link my resume...PM me.

Thanks."

(Exchange 2010),nonprofittechy,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/lxy2g/advice_on_permanently_archiving_user_mailboxes/,"We are an Exchange 2010 SP1 shop with about 200 users. We have used EAS in the past as an archiving tool, but did not upgrade it to a version compatible with Exchange 2010 due to licensing fees. A year into our upgrade, we are dealing with enough users running into their quotas that we want to reconsider an archiving solution.

Goals we have for a new archive system:

* Reduce daily incremental backup size
* Reduce size of user inbox to improve performance
* Provide permanent archive of email from interns, short-term employees, and users who have left the organization, and allow the supervisors or successors of those interns to view those messages.

Exchange 2010 SP1's personal archiving with the purchase of the ECAL looks pretty good. As a non-profit, we qualify for good pricing on this. I've been poking around on various websites including technet, and it will do most of what we need. 

However, I'm struggling to determine if goal 3 can be met with Exchange. From what I've read on Technet, a personal archive has to be attached to the primary user mailbox. You can't reattach it to another user's account. Also, a disconnected or disabled user mailbox will eventually be deleted, depending on the retention policy. Anybody have any experience using Exch2010 SP1 to create a permanent archive of user mail, without clogging primary mailbox databases and backups? Any other methods people use to create a permanent archive that a successor can easily be given permission to share? We can't be the only organization that runs into this issue.

This lady I spoke to said they had seen the video and that the DA was looking into it.  Asked if I could talk to the DA, and she gave me the number to his office.

So, I called, and certainly, the office had received numerous calls about this, but the DA wasn't taking calls at this time, so I spoke to his assistant.  The assistant said he had seen the video, and that the DA is aware of it; he was just as appalled as we all are. 

So we talked for a few minutes about it, and he told me a few legal perspectives about this (I don't know what his legal background is - perhaps an intern?  He knew more than I'd expect a secretary to know, so I don't think he's a secretary).  The most interesting thing he stated was the following (a summary):

1) There are some wiretapping restrictions here.  It's in his own house, and nobody has a right to record you in your house and post that video online.  It's true she lived there too, but he didn't give consent, thus she may have actually committed a crime here, since the video wasn't turned over to the police.

2) It's subjective as to whether or not it constitutes abuse.  In his mind, it did, but in a judges mind in Aransas county, it might not.  Since the video is old, it's hard to prove to what extent the physical damage was; were there marks, extensive bruising, lacerations, etc?  Being so old, and being so subjective, it's hard to envision the judge facing any *legal* consequences.

If there are no legal consequences, they can't fire him; they can ask him to step down, but they can't fire him.  

We need to be mindful in our actions here.  The LAST thing we need is for this guy to get his daughter in some legal trouble here.  Judging by his character, he might press legal action himself.  

At any rate, hopefully, we can give them enough hassle so they do indeed convince him to step down.    "
lxjmm,10,2011-11-02,NASA Redditors: I am looking for a college that does research with NASA. Can you help?,FindThisHumerus,nasa,https://www.reddit.com/r/nasa/comments/lxjmm/nasa_redditors_i_am_looking_for_a_college_that/,"Like the title says, I am looking for a college that does research with NASA. I have a B.S. in biology and am looking for a graduate program that is centered around human physiology (preferably) or other biological science related to NASA or spaceflight in general. It is a huge interest of mine and I can't see myself going to graduate school for anything else.

Currently, I only have one school and one NASA program, and that is Penn State. There is a professor there that has conducted physiology research with astronauts. The program is a summer internship in biomedical research. However, my goal is to find a program that directly works with NASA. For right now I am going to say location does not matter. 

I am still spending a decent chunk of my time looking for schools, but I honestly didn't know where to start, aside from nasa.gov and space.com. Thanks for the help guys and gals. 


Edit - Wow, awesome!! Thank you guys so much!! I think you just saved me hours of searching."

I had even LESS motivation in the second half of highschool, when I was genuinely happy with my social situation. I have dreams,  but I don't really have any desire to pursue them. I was raised by two successful parents who championed hard work and success, and have two high-achieving siblings, so I know it's not because of my environment.

I haven't gotten a sense of accomplishment or satisfaction from school since middle school, regardless of whether or not I'm being challenged. I wrote a paper last year my writing professor wants to have published in an academic journal, and even that doesn't really seem all that special to me now. When I choose to write papers, I get A's, so I absolutely know that when I apply myself, I will do well. But I no longer derive satisfaction from that kind of positive reinforcement.

I've been working at an internship with a british newspaper, since writing does still interest me, but after the first week it became routine, and I realize I have no ambition to try to prove myself or excel in the position.

If I really start to fail in something, I simply deny the reality of the situation until it becomes untenable and I'm forced to confront it, then I really feel terrible about it. So I do feel stress and embarrassment when I fail, but that far exceeds the satisfaction I get when I succeed.

To be fair, I do feel satisfaction when I really succeed at something, but it fades quickly , and stress and failure tend to stay with me, so I'd rather just not attempt an activity I might fail at.

Another thing is, for things like papers, where I know I can write a really good paper, I put a lot of pressure on myself and tell myself that because the paper *can* be good, it *has* to be good. And so because I've made it into such a big task in my head and I know it'll be a big ordeal writing it up to my standards, I'd rather just not do it.

**tl;dr: I have no motivation. I don't when I'm happy, and i don't when I'm sad. My family is successful, so I know it's not my environment, I internalize failure more than success. And, I hold myself to standards so high I don't want to meet them, so often times I don't even try.**

I went to Mission Bay High School here in San Diego. I spent my time in High School wrestling and surfing. My major hobby now is surfing and Jiu Jitsu - a brazilian form of submission grappling which is a natural compliment to western folkstyle wrestling. 

I went to Chico State for my undergrad where I majored in Political 
Science with an emphasis in Legal Studies. The curriculum mostly focused on societal changes in American history through civil rights and employment case law. 

After graduating in December of 2009 I took an internship in Sacramento to learn the ins-and- outs of the legislative process with a firm that represents local governments in the state legislature. I also worked in the state assembly for a year helping to analyze and draft legislation. 

I have recently accepted a job in San Diego and am glad to be back in my home town. One of the difficulties of moving home after more than 6 years away is that most of my friends from high school have moved on to live in other cities, so I am looking to rent with good, decent people. 

I don't mind going out and drinking or going to parties but I do have my priorities straight and I like to make sure my work is done before 
anything else. I drink socially and don’t do any drugs. I don’t mind at 
all if you smoke weed. 

I am clean. I pick up after myself. I don't mind being the one to throw out the trash, and I don't begrudge other people not being the tidiestof sorts. As long as someone isn't disgustingly dirty or unkempt or messy I really don't care. I don't mind people borrowing certain thingsas long as they put it back. For example I don't care if you need to borrow my bike as long as I don't need it at the time and you bring it back in one piece.

I work relatively long hours , 9 - 8(ish) and weekends, but I will not be a hermit or someone you feel like you need to avoid while I am home.

We're both 21. We dated from August of 2008 to May of 2011. I was the best thing that happened to him, in my opinion. I was his first girlfriend. We had genuine conversations about getting married and having children. Although I'd had lots of boyfriends, he was the first I could really see myself with for the rest of my life. 

When a summer intern came to his job, he said she was a ""butterface"" and he wasn't interested in her at all. She lived 3 hours away and was only here for the summer. He wanted to hang out with her because she was ""lonely"" and ""had no friends."" Apparently he had already been sleeping with her when he broke up with me at the end of May. They've been in a relationship ever since. He waited about 2 days after the breakup to ""make it official."" 

When do I stop thinking about this? When do I stop dreaming that we're still together? When do I stop getting pissed off when I think of what he did to me? I _know_ I can do better than him, but I'm worried that the way that this all came about will never stop upsetting me. I don't want to have baggage like this anymore."
lxfgv,3,2011-11-02,How can I gracefully decline this job offer?  ,Lovergirl777,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/lxfgv/how_can_i_gracefully_decline_this_job_offer/,"I'm graduating in December and have been doing on-campus interviews for internships/positions starting in January. I interviewed with two firms last week for internship positions and was offered both positions.  I had skipped a second interview with one of the firms a couple weeks ago, but when they called looking for more candidates, my professor convinced them to interview me again (not because I asked him, but because he knew I was still looking).  

I had two internship offers, and I accepted the offer from the firm my professor had hooked me up with because the pay was significantly higher (though the other firm was my first choice).  When I declined the other firm's internship offer, they offered me a full-time position with a nice salary. I decided that I had to take the full-time position over an internship, although it meant I had to make a rough phone call to the firm whose internship offer I had accepted the day before.  

The professor who had recommended me was very upset that I was going to ""renege"" on my word, as was my boss (another professor).  They said it would make them and my school look bad, but I said it's only common sense and looking out for myself.

Anyway, when I called the firm to rescind my acceptance, they offered me a full time job too.  It is ridiculous, I wish someone would please just accept my rejection so we can get on with our lives.  So now, my professors are leaning hard on me to take the job, but my other offer is better, especially because I didn't need anyone's help to get it.  

I'm sorry this is not more succinct, but if you made it this far, do you have any suggestions as to how I should handle this?  I plan to accept the job offer from my top choice (which I first rejected), and decline the one from the firm to which my professor recommended me (which I first accepted, then rejected).  Do I say something to the professors first?

lx4m1,2,2011-11-01,How are your project teams organized?,junkstuff1,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/lx4m1/how_are_your_project_teams_organized/,"During an internship at a very large company, our project teams were structured with a project manager overseeing and coordinating the technical team with the various members of other departments. However, there was typically only one member of any other department on the team, while the technical team had a lead engineer directing two to three other engineers, a designer, and a couple of technicians.

At my current much smaller company, we have awful inter-department communication. We have stakeholders with no particular designation trying to start the relevant non-engineering aspects of the project at the right time (admittedly there aren't many). Within the technical team is an engineer who is designated the ""project manager"" who spends about half his time doing project-management and the rest doing engineering for the project - also on the team are three other engineers. Technicians and designers are a shared resource across teams.

How does your company organize its teams? What do you think works well, and what doesn't? I am in a position to influence how we structure teams in the future and I'm hoping we can do better than we are now."

How can I request more time from company A? They are currently my only offer, and I don't want to end up with no internship at all. They are also my second choice of the few I applied for, so if I don't get company B I really would like to work for them.

If it helps I'm an engineer, and the two companies are very different industries, but both are process engineering. Company B is in the industry I hope to work for after graduation.

I assumed that they would email me back letting me know what time they had chosen (they didn't). The times I chose were today at either 12:30 or 2:40. It is now 12:36.

We are participating in an intellectual revolution of monumental proportions. 

Eons of intelligence outsourcing has lead to the enlightened, manipulating the complacent, and ill-informed. The majority has outsourced the aptitude and capacity for understanding for global/domestic finance, geo/domestic politics, law, science, technology, and most importantly critical thought to a few individuals who have been trained in the same “how-to-make” profit internship we call an educational system from cradle to grave.
This outsourcing has lead the essence of the paradigm in which we think and live, to be compromised and placed into partial control by a few select individuals, who seek to increase their power and ultimately gain absolute control and absolute submission from dissent from their faux-paradigm of life.

They have gradually convinced us to outsource our intelligence into the prison they control (Banks, Congress, MSM, etc. etc. etc.). However, in fairness we have given up partial control voluntarily. Releasing our minds voluntarily to the NFL, NBA, Dancing with the Stars, Casey Anthony, Conrad Murray, and so on. All while releasing our ability to critically navigate complexities into the quicksand of complacency. 

These people I speak of want nothing more than total control, nothing less. 

Greed itself has become an intricate part of the world economy. Reddit is the most intellectually aware online community I have ever seen (yes even /r/circlejerk), so I don’t think its necessary to explain why profit has no sympathy for those who need a job, or empathy for those whose jobs are shipped overseas, or those whom have pensions lost by derivative trading. This greed has a synonym called profit. You know profit, the thing that allows humans to die in presence of treatment, starve in a world with food, or sleep outside shelter. Yes greed, the thing that will allow individuals to hold the financial stability of the world in jeopardy over tax breaks, independently and without merit (critical thought) connected to job creation. I only ask what came first, the tax break, or the job created?  

Greed and profit.  Profit and greed.

The instruments which can allow the US government to not only standby in the face of a 700 billion dollar highway robbery by the corportacracy, but to be willing participate and become accomplishes allowing it to take place without oversight.

Anyway, I’m nearing the point of TL, DR; So, I’ll close. #OCCUPY, Bradley Manning, etc. is only the first crack in manipulation paradigm of the modern glass box out handlers call life. As John Conner would say it, if you’re reading this, you are the resistance. 

First we must take our minds back. Then in the words of the tea-party, “take our country back”. But not only our country, we need take our continent, our hemisphere, our paradigm, our life, our planet.
 
#Occupy every damn thing.

This was not really expressed to us during senior year though. I was encouraged to apply to schools despite wanting to take a gap year, and was told all I would have to do was request a deferral and all would be well.

Well, it turns out a lot of schools don't do deferrals. They want you to reapply. So despite getting into some good schools, I had to settle on a less than great one to secure an option. I didn't, however, pay a deposit or anything, so I was never locked down to this one. They've just put me into the 2012 applicant pool.

At the same time, I thought I wanted a hospitality degree. Do you know how limited the options are in the US for decent colleges with hospitality degrees? Other than Cornell, it is extremely hard to find.

Now, having done internships over my gap year, I no longer want to have anything to do with hotels. This is great, I thought, now I can apply to the colleges that really appealed to me last year, and they'll have my majors! 

But, upon emailing a counselor asking for my transcript and letting him know what had happened, I got an icy email that basically said ""No"" to even considering reapplying, and that my current college would be fine with me changing majors. 

How can they stop me? Why would they in light of my situation? How am I doing any harm by applying again to 3-5 schools? This is really important to me reddit, and this is an important decision.

Can my old highschool really still control me now, and refuse to send transcripts or whatever a college requires if I choose to apply?"

lyjfm,0,2011-11-02,Should I drop out of my school counseling Master's program?,professionalquitter,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/lyjfm/should_i_drop_out_of_my_school_counseling_masters/,"First time poster here.  This is a very difficult decision to make, because friends and family want the ""best"" for me, which is usually the best as they see it.  Right now, I feel the best thing for me to do is take some time off to recenter myself and decide whether or not this career would be right for me.  At the same time, I've worked extremely hard to get to where I am.  My undergraduate degree was in communications with a specialty in TV/video/film production.  Unfortunately, the state school I attended did not have the best program at the time.  In retrospect, I believe that the program was a test for what would happen in the real world.  Because the media production world is so competitive, only the go-getters (or those with connections) get somewhere.  We had to teach ourselves a lot and, while my motivation was partially there, it was not enough for me to become as engrossed in the process as I should have been as an undergraduate student.  So, I interned on a movie, had a brief corporate script writing job, moved to Hollywood to have more opportunities, found few opportunities with little to no pay, went broke, moved back home, and worked at a retail chain throughout all of that.  After recognizing the retail chain was going under and becoming a dreadful place to work, I decided to look into other career paths.  During this time, I had a friend going through rehab and I thought about becoming an addictions counselor.  I researched the job and talked to some people working in similar fields and it seemed way too tolling for the pay.  My friend who is a teacher recommended school counseling to me, so I did some research, received verbal support from my parents, and ultimately decided that it would be a good move for me.  After going through the application/interview process, I was accepted into a few programs and decided on the one that offered an assistantship with free room and board.  Yep, I became a resident director.  I was worried about it being overwhelming, but soon learned my program would take up 90% of my stressful life.  The program I am is a 62 credit, four semester program with practicum and internship included in those semesters.  I was never the most capable student as I struggle with memorization and OCD, but my drive to succeed in something allowed me to do fairly well my first year.  Then came the qualification exam process.  In my program, we are required to take three three-hour essay exams after the first year to show our competency in counseling.  I passed two of the exams, but one of them almost led to my removal from the program.  After failing the first exam, I was asked to do an oral defense which I also failed.  The final step in this process before dismissal was for me to do another written response to a different question.  At that point, I wanted to quit.  I was sick of the process and felt that if I hadn't been able to pass by then, I wouldn't be able to pass at all.  Somehow, through encouragement from my family and friends, I studied my ass off and passed.  It still left me shattered, though, as I have low confidence in myself in general.  

This semester, I have been slacking.  My motivation has diminished a lot.  I have been depressed because I don't care and because I know that I am on the verge of not being able to do this anymore.  I intern at a school twice a week for my program right now and find it incredibly difficult to motivate myself to want to go.  Once I'm there, I do my best to work on tasks and avoid counseling.  I do this, because I do not feel competent in working with students for a number of reasons.  The big one is that I am depressed right now and feel that my internal feelings are leaking into my work with students.  This feeling became validated when my professor met with me today to discuss his meeting with my supervisor at the school.  He told me that my low self-confidence was apparent while working and that my supervisor felt I might appear unapproachable.  I work very hard to be outgoing and friendly at the school to everyone, but I do not come off as someone who is comfortable.  This professor always tells me to fake it til I make it, but when we sat down today, he took a counselor approach and tried to work out some behavioral interventions to help me feel better about myself.  We planned out a few things, but the core issue, which I feel he's on to, is that I don't want to do this.  I don't want to do the class part or the internship part.  I just want to stay in bed all day and stop being forced to work so hard to change myself.  Perhaps I've grown lazy and tired, but I feel that everything I have to do involves work on myself.  How am I supposed to be confident in myself when people keep telling me that I need to change?  Anyway, I am sorry to write so much, but I am just really worried that I am giving up just because it sounds easier.  I have given up on many things in the past.  Am I expecting too much?  Will I ever be happy with one career?  Do I have to change?  So many questions are going through my head.  Another big one is systemic in nature...Will I even be able to get a job?  I'm hearing nothing good about the prospects for school counselors and feel that I might be setting myself up for failure.  Please feel free to help me answer any of these questions.  It'd be much appreciated.  Thanks."

I come to you baring problems and seeking advice.

It is about time I start being more responsible with my finances. I used to be considered a ""saver"" but within the last year, extra expenses have knocked me off course. Here is a low-down of my financial position, currently.

$ to my name today: $1100
Bills Total: $1200 per month. (Rent:600. Utilities:50. Car Insurance:100. Car Payment:200 Gas/Commuting:$150 Groceries: 100)

Debts:
School Loans: approx. $70,000. grad: Fall 2013+6month grace period
Credit Card: $700 (always pay min. monthly, interest just started being applied last month)
Car: $5000

Money Coming In:
Financial Aid:4,500 disbursed in December and again in March
Work: 16.38 an hour w/ approx 20 hrs per week. (I make my own schedule and am able to have more hours) - This is a Professional Internship with a Fortune 100 company that ends in Dec. with the option to extend to June,I also have 5 interviews for other Prof. Internships.

Positives (at least in my financially naive mind): I have the ability to make more money then I currently am. (I believe I will be getting a raise to $20 an hour, but I have not planned expecting this) January 2013, my rent will be decreased to $456 per month. Although it is debt, I will be able to afford to keep my financial aid in savings for after graduation. I will not have trouble getting a salaried position upon graduation. I have access to several personal financial classes and self-advancement classes through my work and just got approval to get paid to take them.

Negatives: I was VERY naive when it came to my school funding and had the ability to pay for everything myself, including living expenses. I took a 6 month break from work after a tragedy in my life and sucked up all of my savings. I am virtually starting from scratch.

My goals:
-Create a monthly and weekly budget
-Form a savings plan that will allow me to have at least 10,000 in -savings upon graduation
-Figure out what Debts are more important to pay off quickly - i.e. credit card and car

Interested in learning:
-Wells Fargo vs. Partners Credit Union./ Where should my money be?
-anything any one has to say

Always similar, though never the same. He'd be standing on his balcony, 20 stories up, in what looked  like his apartment. And then the quake would hit. And it wouldn't feel like a normal earthquake, either, but more like he'd been spinning around for days and then stopped, his inner ear fluid sloshing around, throwing his balance away,  destroying his equilibrium. It was like that, only for the entire world.

The balcony is barely a foot wide, and he always holds onto the railing, wrapping his arms and legs around it, clinging to it, going to his knees and screaming as his heart and limbic system tell him to run, to get out.

But there's nowhere to go during an earthquake. You just have to hang on and hope. 

If the first quake hasn't woken him, the second one always does. The aftershock. The terrible feeling of the aftershock. Both buildings would start to move, swaying back and forth towards each other, moving far beyond the limits of their actual constructs, gaining momentum and increasing their leans to either side, until finally, they crash together, and he falls. Or maybe he doesn't. He's never actually gotten past the balcony in his memory. He only remembers seeing the ground

He dreams this dream almost every night. But not tonight. Tonight he does not sleep instead.

As it turns out, Jeffery James wasn't as special as he thought. On his grad school applications, he'd described how motivated he was, and he ticked off achievements almost absentmindedly: a few science prizes, internships with large, respected software companies, his membership in the exclusive science honors society, Kappa Mu Kappa, his scholarships, his G.P.A.

But then he got into grad school, and he couldn't find the motivation 
to keep his performance up. He'd just... his dad kept insisting that he'd lost it, but it wasn't that. He wasn't sure he had ever had it to lose. His scholarships were gone after the first semester, and he dropped out by the end of the year, and returned home to Los Angeles without any particular plans. The idea being that he'd get a job as a programmer somewhere, and live at home with his mom and dad until he was motivated enough to continue his studies.

That had been several years before, and so he found himself, at 26, living in the room he had lived in since he was 16, working as a freelancer, and generally waiting for something to happen to him. Things happened, sometimes. He occasionally had a girlfriend, though the relationships weren't especially memorable except as a way to mark the time. His parents had long since given up on trying to motivate or encourage him, though they still gave him things that they thought, he guessed, would steer him towards living a more productive life. His mother was fond of giving him Christian self help books whenever she was done with them. It was mildly funny to Jeff that she read so many books, even though she seemed to have things together. He figured that she liked the literature for its disposability, and the eager, smiling faces and encouraging titles: Walk closer with God Today, Jesus walks with you, Finding life through the example of Jesus. There were others, but these stood out to him because of their covers. Walk closer with God Today, for example, had a picture of the author walking along a beach at sunrise or -set, with a pair of footprints in the sand beside her. When he first saw it, he imagined the invisible man stalking this woman, planning on raping her, probably, because that was what the invisible man did. Both were invisible men, when he thought about it. It didn't seem to him like it was possible for Mary to consent before God knocked her up, especially since he sent his friend later to tell her that she was pregnant with his child. He tried to imagine getting Kelly to act as his Gabriel and tell a random girl he'd raped that she was carrying his child, but his thoughts grew muddled, and so he stopped thinking about it. Jesus walks with you had a picture of two people on a beach (the beach again), walking towards the sunset. This was pretty straightforward, and pretty motivational, he had to admit, if you were motivated by walking on beaches during daily solar phenomenon, but it was the author bios that had the good stuff.  *James &amp; Shirley Maxwell have been married for 20 years, but their story begins much earlier. James, a recovered alcoholic and drug addict, met Shirley in a 12 step program, where they both found Jesus and dedicated their lives to Christ. James attended Reformation Seminary in Portland, Maine before receiving the call to move back to Los Angeles with his wife and set up a church which ministered to the lost of Venice Beach...*

This fucking guy, Jeff thinks. This fucking guy going to reform the people on Venice beach. What has he got for the people of Venice beach? It's not like they're a people group anyway, except maybe the weightlifters. And the cops. But there was something that struck him as funny about recovered drug addicts in Venice beach, though it made him a little self conscious and even sad to have no faith in the pastor as anything but a shill of his own experience. Great, motherfucker, you got clean. That was good for you, now leave everyone alone.

Finding life through the example of Jesus had an artistic shot on the cover, a close up of some robes on top of a flat stone, lit by golden light, with a large, circular opening to the outside world that showed a bunch of green-golden foliage. The tomb. Of course, to Jeff, this was funny, since he didn't really believe in the life of Jesus anyway, but the book cover was basically saying, the example of Jesus is that Jesus is not there. Sound advice, Jeff thought. Not to be there. Not to be anywhere.

He' staring at his shelf of self help books when his phone rings. It's Grant.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Grant had decided that he wasn't going to sleep that night when he woke up. He didn't exactly wake up screaming, but instead awoke making the choked scream of the half asleep. More like a low, droning aaaaa sound that scared him when he woke up. He couldn't do it. He was tired of the dream, tired of the earthquake, fuck, just tired. He could afford to skip out on the sleep, though. He didn't have to go to work tomorrow. Tomorrow was Sunday. So he'd  stay up all night and then face the dream on Sunday night. That he could do. It was a shame that alcohol exacerbated the intensity so much, but what can you do? Grant certainly couldn't think of anything. He turned on his computer and logged into his e-mail. 1,389 unread messages. Most of them status updates, and things of that ilk that he never bothered to delete. At almost the almost top, underneath several coupons and network invitations and friend requests that had come early that morning, was an e-mail from her. It was just a subject line. It said “help”.

He didn't know whether or not he should respond, since it had taken him more than a few weeks to get over her, but, eventually, he did. He wrote a short reply: “Hey, what's it you need my help for? -Grant”. And left it at that. And then he waited a few hours, and tried not to only think about the e-mail, but he thought about it obsessively, so he decided to call her.

The phone rang a few times, and then her mom answered the 
phone.

“Sophie?” her mom said. 

“No, this is Grant. Is Sophie there?”

“No, she's not. She left her phone here a few days ago and I haven't gotten in touch with her. Has she contacted you?”

Grant went on impulse. “No,” he said. “I was just calling to see if she wanted to get lunch sometime.”

“Look Grant, I'm sorry about how things ended between you two,” she said. “If you ever need anything, don't hesitate.”

“Thank you. I won't.” But he would prefer never to have to ask them for something, if it could at all be avoided.

lyh96,3,2011-11-02,I'm hiring. Should I use a freelance recruiter or a recruiting firm? And how do I find a good one?,justinvh123,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/lyh96/im_hiring_should_i_use_a_freelance_recruiter_or_a/,"I need to grow out my currently small tech company and make about 7-10 hires in the next 3 months. It will be a mix of  some college interns, some entry level, and some experienced team members across the board (sales, marketing, engineering, customer service).

I'm tight on cash in the sense that I want to be able to offer the best salaries I can to my employees - which any money spent on recruiting would cut into.

Does it make more sense to find a freelance individual recruiter and simply ""offload"" the search process, or should I go with a recruiting firm that will likely charge a lot more? If I go with a freelancer, how do I find a good one, and what types of fees should I expect? Thanks in advance!"
lyg2x,1,2011-11-02,Negotiating help,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/lyg2x/negotiating_help/,"So early in October, I decided I wanted a job, started looking on craigslist. The job I ended up getting was supposed to be a web design internship lasting only a month. But after two interviews they decided I would do web design *and* development, which is perfect for me. In addition to that, after the month is up, they would like to hire me full time, so this is like a probation period.

I'm getting paid $12/hr and I'll be able to negotiate benefits and pay after that month. The thing is, I have no idea what I should be asking for. I've only worked freelance in this area. They said health insurance was an option if I felt so inclined (I could get my own or get on my mom's)

Details: I'm 23, graduated college last year, living at home in NYC. Small company (around 15 people) but with lots of clients."
lychr,11,2011-11-02,farm internship?,[deleted],farming,https://www.reddit.com/r/farming/comments/lychr/farm_internship/,"Hey Reddit,

I've always been interested in farming, animals and nature. It would make me really happy to have a few crops, some milk and meat animals, eggs and honeybees. I'd like some hands on experience. My idea was to intern on a farm for the summer before I go back to college. I have no prior experience (other than with horses and some gardening), but I'd love to spend four months learning how a farm runs and getting down to work. Plus, I'd love living on a farm, and I need some extra cash to pay for school.

Any advice?

m0wfz,1,2011-11-04,"I was a banker during the collapse.  This is my story.  This is why I stand with #Occupy.  It's a long read, thank you in advance for reading the whole thing.  ",[deleted],occupywallstreet,https://www.reddit.com/r/occupywallstreet/comments/m0wfz/i_was_a_banker_during_the_collapse_this_is_my/,"	In November of 2009, I was laid off from the bank that had employed me for almost 3 years.  The banking collapse had finally caught up to us, and we sold out to another company who decided that some of the employees that were coming with the merger were making to much money.  I was making 12 bucks an hour, plus commissions.  However, I had not seen a commission check in 3 months.  Not because I wasn't bringing in business, but nobody that applied for a loan with me was approved.  At 12 dollars an hour, I was making 50% more than people doing the same job with the company that had bought us.  That's right.  The company that bought us wanted to pay personal bankers a pittance of 8 dollars an hour.  
	
	But, they didn't just lay me off.  Had they done that, I could have collected unemployment benefits for a while.  Instead, I had been given a sealed envelope by the treasury service specialist and was told that one of her clients was sending an employee to pick it up, and that it contained a cashiers check.  That afternoon, a young man came to my desk asking about it; I asked him who he worked for and he named a company that was a client of our treasury services department.  I checked his ID, had him sign for the pick up, and he took the envelope and left.  A minute later he came in saying it was the wrong check.  Nobody had the right check for him.  When the treasury service specialist returned, we found out that she had taken the check she meant for me to hold and left me with a check that was for someone else.  I was fired for this offense.  
	
	Had they waited 2 weeks for the merger to complete, and then lay me off, I would have been 100% vested in my retirement plan, been able to be put on my wife's health insurance, and collected unemployment.  However, almost 6 thousand dollars was taken from my retirement account the day I was fired.  I hadn't been contributing long enough.  The near six thousand that was left wasn't enough for the financial firm that handled our accounts to keep mine open.  By the time I found this out, it was past the time I could have put it into another account.  I had to take a check with the IRS getting their cut, plus penalties for early withdrawal of retirement funds.  I used the money that was left, plus my tax return, to pay off my car note.  I had nothing but my wife's income after I did that.   

	I applied at every bank in the county of St. Louis, and it's neighboring counties.  I didn't even get a phone call back.  I did find work as a part time karate instructor.  I made 150 a week after taxes.  I also was able to take work as a personal assistant for a mortician.  For that, I made 250 a week in cash.  My first day on the job, I had to pick up and deliver 3 dead babies amongst other equally gruesome tasks.  The job was only temporary though.  My boss needed an assistant, but was waiting for an intern from a funeral directors college.  I was laid off in May of 2010.  My karate instructor job was only for during the school year, so that month, I was completely out of work again.  

	In June of 2010, I started graduate school.  No loans needed, I had a place to live.  My wife was back in school on a full ride, and I had a job working on my family farm.  My wife and I moved across the country for this opportunity.  I was to work on the farm during the summer, then I was all but assured that I would get a job teaching special education during the day while attending night school, and making a good living.  This was through a program called the “Teach Mississippi Initiative”.  

	That summer, I finished all of my classes with a 3.8 GPA, but the state of Mississippi was laying off more teachers than it was hiring, and laid off teachers were getting emergency certification for special education in order to stay employed.  I had to stay working on the farm.  

	I worked diligently throughout the abnormally cold winter.  We grew pond raised catfish, and more days than not, I was chest deep in freezing cold water before the sun came up.  Some days, ice floated around me while I worked the nets.  This job paid 400 a week before taxes, and no health benefits.  The job was extraordinarily dangerous, and in June of 2011, I was burned by a splash of sulfuric acid while I was mixing algae killing chemicals.  There was no neutralizing agent available, nor was their a wash station.  The only thing that saved me was my basic knowledge of chemistry.  While sprinting to the closest water hose, I spotted a 10 gallon barrel of undiluted truck/tractor soap and yelled to a coworker to grab it and pour it over me while I sprayed myself down.  The concentrated alkaline soap neutralized the burn quickly, and I was left with minimal 1st degree burns and no scarring.  My wife and I decided that this was a bridge to far, as I had come home injured, burned, or cut many times before from the dangerous work conditions that OSHA would have shut the farm down over.  Since it was my family farm, I couldn't bring myself to report them for their lack of basic safety precautions.  

	That afternoon, I called my friends in St. Louis and asked them if there was any work for me.  One man who I had been very close with for years said he had just opened up a restaurant, and was about to open 2 more and that I could come be a shift manager for him at 10 bucks an hour, all the hours I could want.  My wife was offered her old job back, which was a living wage for a single person.  Once we got to St. Louis, I found out that my buddy/boss had hired 2 restaurant's worth of employees to train, and that we were only getting 10-15 hours a week at 8 dollars an hour until we went full time.  My wife was informed that her old company was going into layoffs and that the job she was promised no longer existed.  In order to afford the move, we had sold nearly all of our possessions.  Everything we own now fits in a 10 by 10 room we rent from her parents, and a 5 by 10 storage locker.  
	Once the second restaurant had opened, I was given full time hours, but told I needed more training (which I did, I've only ever waited tables as far as food service goes).  So, I wasn't getting my raise yet.  After 3 weeks of averaging 35ish hours a week, I was told I was being cut back down to 10-15.  “Nothing personal”, said the owner.  The new store just isn't taking off like the first one did, and we're cutting hours on everybody who isn't salaried.  I was also told that I might want to start looking for other work, because it would be months before the restaurant could reasonably be expected to become profitable.  

	I lined up a couple of interviews, and they went great.  I told my boss about it and he was excited.  He told me to feel free to use him as a reference, as he liked me and hated the situation I was in.  He also told me that he would keep me on as long as possible, and that he didn't need 2 weeks notice.  A week later, I was scheduled for second interviews at 2 places.  My boss took me aside after I told him this and said, “Look, I've always been a straight shooter with everybody.  I hate to do this, but the company is losing four grand a month.  A big chunk of that is your pay.  I'll let you work out the rest of this week, and you will always get the employee discount here, but on Friday afternoon, I'll need you to turn in your keys.  I hope you understand, and that I wish you the best.”

	I went to both second interviews, and got offered nothing.  For a month I landed at least 2 interviews a week, but nothing ever came of them.  One job that I was perfect for, mortgage processor, not only didn't hire me, but they reposted the job on Monster.  I emailed HR from a different email address and said that I had seen the first posting after it had been up a little bit and figured they had already accepted their candidates, and was wondering if this was for the same position, or just another position in the same department.  HR confirmed that they had found no suitable applicants, and they reposted the same job.  I have 3 years in banking/mortgages/finance experience along with great references in the industry.  I have no idea what they are looking for if I'm not it.  

	Then, last week, I saw an ad on craigslist for a manager at a storage facility.  450 a week plus bonuses after 90 days, apply in person.  I went down there with my resume in hand, filled out the application, shook hands with everyone, and left.  A few days later I was called for a phone interview, and was scheduled for an in person interview.  The in person interview started with a personality screening, a basic sales test, math skills test, and finally a logic test.  I scored perfect on math and logic, and very well on sales skills.  I interviewed with the CFO, and then the district manager.  The CFO thought very highly of me and was impressed with my references and background.  However, I didn't think the DM shared her opinion.  When the interview was over, he said he would call me the next day if I got the job.  I shook his hand, thanked him, and walked away thinking, “he'll never call”.

m0v3d,1,2011-11-04,bizarre childhood turned me into who i am today. ,canistill,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/m0v3d/bizarre_childhood_turned_me_into_who_i_am_today/,"Hi guys, 22f here. This is going to be long, just a warning!


So, a little backstory on how I got to be the way I am today. When I was growing up I had things I loved to do. I danced, I acted, I rode horses, and I loved art and creating things. I had piles of friends, and always got invited to parties. There was never a dull moment in my life, and even at age eight I was always on the go. I'd get off from school, head straight to the barn to ride, then dance at night. This continued until I was 15, when my parents told me they were getting a divorce. And I was literally told I couldn't dance or ride anymore because of the cost. I was heartbroken. I had to stop riding lessons right when I was about to start pursuing my dream (of being a jockey, haha, I was a silly kid). My days were now filled with going home after school and playing on the computer for hours on end. It was like my life suddenly stopped when I was just figuring out who I was. I became a homebody, because my friends were still at soccer practice, gymnastics and all of their other passions, and I felt out of the loop because if someone asked ""How's riding going?"" I had no way to respond. I'd felt I'd become unworthy, boring, because I no longer had anything to 'do' besides paint with my cheap ass paint set and dance in my room with my door shut and blinds drawn. 

I got my first job at age 16, and that helped me out. It got me out of the house, and made me feel much less withdrawn. However, whenever I got those paychecks, I'd put half of it into my savings like a good girl, but I'd go blow the other half on ridiculous things. From that period of 16-18 in my life, I acquired more useless crap than ever. I taking out my new found worthlessness in material items. Even now when I look around my big girl apartment, I see the remnants of it. The main thing being a huge painting I bought when I wandered into an art gallery that cost about $700. I was 17 and I didn't blink when I handed my card over (it's not useless, and it actually brings me a lot of happiness, but at 17...totally unneeded). It got to the point where I would come home every day with something new, even if it was just a new pair of shoes or a DVD. I kind of alienated myself from a few of my high school friends cause when I said ""Let's go shopping!"" they'd insist on just chilling out and watching a movie, and I'd end up going to the mall. I finally got help with that.

At 18 I made a major move, all by myself for my mental health, and I was never happier. I made a whole new slew of friends, and I was the same old me again. I had an amazing job, and I smiled more than anything else. I was totally okay being in big groups whether it was a party, a chill hang out, or in the break room at work. I was so happy. I lived like that for over a year, when I realized I wanted to go to college. I knew what I wanted to do with my life since I'd graduated high school, but I was so scared to ask my parents, fearing it would be too much money, cause they hadn't even paid off my old sister's school loans. 

At this time, my boyfriend of four years and I broke up, adding to my life confusion, because he has always been there for me. It hurt so bad, and I actually ran back to my happy place for another six months, before returning to a new school.

At 21 I moved to a city which I go to school in now. I have only been at this school for about two semesters now (transfered in as a Junior), and I realized I have fallen back into my ways. I have a few friends (and a boyfriend), yes, but not a 'group', which I miss from my old lifestyle. My boyfriend comes over a lot, and we're happy, but I know he wants to go out and 'do stuff'. However, I don't have the desire to go out and get stupid face drunk with a bunch of random people I don't know/like, and I don't have the money to spend to go out for nice meals or fun activities like bowling or concerts. People question me all the time, about why I never go out on Friday nights, and honestly--it doesn't bother me that I don't. I'm an artist, and I have a little studio set up in my apartment, I cook amazing food for myself, my boy, and friends, and a few friends from home come visit me once in a while. 

I'm not shy, I'm not quiet, I just like being alone. Is that so wrong? 
I actually have a job as a performer, which has rekindled my love of dance. I love theater, art, fashion, animals and music. I have an awesome GPA, a great internship. I'm attractive, I work out, I have an amazing boyfriend, and to the few friends who I still call 'best', they're amazing. I know what's happening in our world, I've got a goofy personality, I'm kind of a big kid.

However, since I don't go out and get drunk every weekend, I'm afraid people have started to think I'm either: boring, stuck up, or mean. What if I don't WANT to talk to some people? I think I am a bit stuck up, I think I deserve the best, and I honestly don't mess with people who aren't worth my time. If you don't interest me, I probably won't talk to you a second time. Is that rude and stuck up? If so, fine, but I want to avoid the 'boring'. I would like to have a group of friends at school that I can mesh with my boyfriend, people who I actually get along with, not just people I go out with cause I'm bored, I just don't know how to make that first step.

....Sorry that was so long.

Main thing is: Messed up childhood that sent me into a downward spiral of feeling unworthy, I was built back up for about two years, and I am back in my spiral again. "
m0unx,1,2011-11-04,Should I list a bad reference in my job application?,nevergoingtogetajob,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/m0unx/should_i_list_a_bad_reference_in_my_job/,"So here's the deal:

I am 22 years old in my last year of college. I just finished an interview, and the company basically told me that they want to hire me ASAP. However, before that can happen, I need to fill out a formal application.

On this application, they want professional references (example: supervisors). I have worked 3 jobs, two of which I am currently employed and can get glowing reviews, and a summer internship from 3 years ago that I WILL get a HORRIBLE reference from.

What happened: 6 months before that internship, my single mother died from cancer. My father (whom I hadn't seen since I was 8 or 9) ""came back"" into my life, but then abruptly left in the summer of '08 during which I had this internship.

I moved to a relative's home for the summer, but I was extremely distraught and basically stopped showing up to my internship without warning. 

If the company I want to work for now called the company where I interned, I'm sure they would release information about my termination by absence, which would not look favorably on me at all.

I listed the internship because I did end up learning a lot for the time that I was there. And ironically, this internship is the most closely aligned to what I will be doing at this new company.

My life has since settled down, and I have a lot of references (such as coworkers) who can vouch for my work ethic, but I'm afraid to list this one internship.

What should I do?

edit: tl;dr I have a bad reference, should I list it in my application?"

It seems to me like I will have more time when I get out of school than I do now, but I a haven't really experienced a full time job for more than two months. So I turn to you, O wise masters of engineering, do you have more free time now that you have careers than you did in college, or is college life the easiest it is going to be for me from here on out.

I think the content here is my favorite out of all of the subs I have on all of Reddit. There is one thing that has been bothering me though, the negativity towards traditional education; and even pursuits towards professional certifications.

The one that really set this thread in motion was the thread about a Master's in Cyber Security (www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/lxqxq/im_currently_pursuing_a_degree_in_cyber_security/). Now, I understand that a degree with that title sounds cheesy, generalized, and even shallow. But the fact of the matter is that no one in that thread knew the institution or what the program looked like. Instead of asking those questions the flames began to burn, and people start throwing this snarky comments onto the thread about how people pursuing education don't actually know anything, don't have a clue to begin with, or simply don't know as much as poster ""x"". 

To me this is total bullshit. I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Information Systems, and I was exposed to a lot more in pursuit of an ultimate goal than I ever would have on my own. I was taught by one of Sun's former educators (the guys that used to write the white papers) in Solaris / Unix administration, a 20 year I.T. vet from TD Ameritrade, a former NSA computer scientist, an M.I.T. graduate who designed a large portion of software that Maryland's state institutions utilize, a lead network engineer at DISA, etc... I was exposed to a wealth of knowledge that no one person possesses. Also, on top of that, my pursuit of a degree is what got me in the door at a Fortune 500 company as an intern that upon completion turned into my current job. 

My point now is that I decided to continue onto my Master's because I know that I will not be willing to go back when I have a family of my own. I opted to go to UMBC's Cybersecurity program under the direction of Dr. Richard Forno (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Forno). In my first semester alone I have been able to meet General Hayden, been taught by the Director of Defense Cyber Security Capabilities at HP, and a current CISSP - ISSEP at NSA. 

This program, while being in it's infancy, has offered me access to two things that General Hayden said are not in place for the defense of the United States; policy and law in regards to cyberspace as a domain (think air, land, sea). 

So here's my question Reddit, if all of these people are endorsing programs like this, as well as government agencies, contractors, etc... what gives you the right to shit on educational programs like that? I'm not coming out of this expecting a six figure salary, and a management position. I'm not coming out looking to command people with no formal education. I'm trying to get my foot in the door and I'm trying to be effective when I get inside.

Also, prior to this, I've coded, used snort, aircrack, nmap, nessus, etc... all on my own. So to those that say ""you went to make money, not because you're passionate"" as someone so politely PM'd me after a recent post of mine, no, I went because I'm passionate, I went because I love this shit and I wanted to learn more.

So what is the big anti-education shit about?

TL;DR
My academics have gotten me exposed to high level thinkers, current working professionals, an internship that turned into a job, and acceptance into a master's degree program that I feel will keep me progressing. I see nothing wrong with trying to better myself, so why the cynical attitude?

EDIT:

I'd like to thank all of you participating in this thread. I think for the first time I've actually seen legitimate arguments in on both sides of the coin. I for one have decided that I would like to get out of the high level aspect of things and pursue another avenue more geared towards the Master's in Information Systems that is heavily based around programming / database development, and the security related to that.

Thanks all again for keeping it civil and keeping the trolls out."

I'm not sure if I should've dropped this into /r/medicine as well, but this seems a little bit more appropriate!
Hopefully some people with knowledge on the matter will read this...

I'm a third year medicine student from Amsterdam with a growing love for and in Scandinavia.
So much so that I want to be there for more than just a short vacation stay.

I would love to do a (research) internship somewhere in Norway (or Sweden, though I've only been in and around the south of Norway).
Does anyone know if this is hard to arrange, and more importantly where and how I should begin?

Further down the road I would love to work up there as a doctor (possibly/hopefully neurologist or orthopedic surgeon if that's of importance) - has anyone got any experience with the prospects for foreigners when it comes to migration?
In terms of when I should go, before or after specializing... Those kinds of things.

I haven't written a text submission before, so excuse me if it comes across as random scribbles!

m04tx,24,2011-11-04,Not feeling like I get any closer to my boyfriend...,forgotyourname,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/m04tx/not_feeling_like_i_get_any_closer_to_my_boyfriend/,"I apologize beforehand for this post being freakishly long. TL;DR below.




I'm a 22 yr old female and my boyfriend is 26. We've been together for 10 months and known each other for about a year. So far, at least on the surface, it's a excellent relationship considering we've (literally) never fought. Actually the closest we have come to ""fighting"" was over a misunderstanding, over text mind you, that wasn't even completely serious. I didn't even know it was a fight until he mentioned it a day later when we actually got to speak face-to-face, if that gives any perspective. 




Anyway, I understand that 10 months might still be a little soon for ""i love you's"" and other sweet nothings, but I'm getting to the point where I'm becoming concerened about the length of time we've been together not presenting any sort of ""sign"" that we have created some kind of emotional bond or attachment. Clearly, saying ""I love you"" is an obvious statement of that bond, right? So what gives? I feel so silly with being concerened with time...it just seems unsual to me. Should I just let it be?





Before anyone tells me that it isn't his responsibility to say it first or anything like that, I completely understand. I would tell him that I loved him if I truly felt it. So why haven't I? Well, this is where the real problem begins...





I have my suspicions that he has a crush on another girl whom he has spoken of several times in the past. Fortunately, for me, this girl lives over 1k miles, several states, away from us, so whatever ""crush"" he may or may not have will continue to remain just that. :) 

He is an atheist, and he refers to her as his ""crazy christian friend."" At one point while he spoke of her, (I'm not entirely sure this statment is relevant because I may not have been dating him at the time), he was rambling about her and mentioned that the only reason he wouldn't date her was because of her beliefs. Then, under his breath, mentioned he'd go Christian for her. Heh. Yeah, what? He also has a picture of her on his phone. They talk from time to time. She wrote on his wall, on his birthday, that she ""wish[es] you were here!"" I'll admit, I did a bit of facebook investigating (stalking). She's attractive, she studies the same thing he does, and they have plenty in common from what I see. Why wouldn't he have a crush on her?





Bottom line: My suspicions about this crush are holding me back from wanting to get close to him because my past relationships have consisted of ex-boyfriends who were still hung up about a girl they couldn't be with, (it's like I'm always a secondary choice.) And of course, I would be devastated if it came down to that. I don't know how upset I would be with him, but I know for a fact that I would be torn up at allowing a thing like this happen to me again. 





Needless to say, this all makes me uncomfortable, and I understand that some of it is a bit irrational, but I can't help if I feel upset. I haven't confronted him about this for several reasons: 

* I keep telling myself it may not be *that* bad/legitimate. 

* I'm not really known for bringing up drama, and I don't want to bring up drama at such a critical point in the semester. It's not the right time. 

* I wanted to get a (hopefully) unbiased opinion from a close friend, and you guys FIRST to  organize my thoughts, somewhat, and not blow up on him and just start saying everything that's on my mind. I realized that would be a terrible idea.





I like this guy, a lot. Perhaps even love him if I can get past the things that bother me. He's a nice guy, and I trust him enough not to hurt me willingly. I have a tendency to tell him what's on my mind, but I've been incapable of telling him about this because of the aforementioned reasons. Overall, I would be sad to let him go. I'm just wondering  how to approach this, or if I really am taking some things out of context. Or maybe even suggestions on how to make a clean break, if it boils down to that. Thanks everyone.




**TL;DR: Possible crush getting in the way of emotionally bonding between boyfriend and I.**

**Edit:** formatting

**Edit:** I should mention the length of their friendship isn't that much longer than than the length of time he's known me. They met in the summer at an internship that took place in her state just prior to the semester when I would meet him upon his return home. Logically, he's known her, in real life terms, for about a month or less. So any friendship that they continue to have remains strictly on an online/phone basis. Just thought this piece of information might be useful..."
lzzwv,1,2011-11-04,"I (f/20) am falling for my friend (m/20). I don't want to mess up our friendship, but I don't want to miss out on the possibility of something great.",countclouds,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/lzzwv/i_f20_am_falling_for_my_friend_m20_i_dont_want_to/,"I'm sure you guys get this kind of crap all the time but my searches brought up nothing helpful. So if there is somewhere you can direct me, that would be great if because I don't want to bore the crap out of you guys.

So my friend and I are in the same program, a film program. I have kind of liked him on and off for the past couple years. (We are in the third of a fourth year program.) I get the sense that he has liked me on and off in the past too. For example, I was the first person he called after getting his dream internship. There are other things that stand out but as it is 2am I have trouble recalling them.

However, lately I feel like my feelings for him have really solidified. However, he is actively pursuing another girl (who has a boyfriend who he has convinced her to break up with apparently.) They seemingly talk all the time, but from what I sense when he talks about her, she kinda seems like she is using him as a bridge and a rebound so she wont be alone when she breaks up with her current boyfriend.

I am also worried about telling him about my feelings as our program is very collaborative and I don't want to ruin our friendship because I enjoy working with him on projects as a creative team.

I also had the utterly brilliant thought of professing my feelings when I am drunk (ever so classy, I know) but my friend convinced me this was a really bad idea. She then had no suggestion of how to accomplish this task sober. So I am a little stumped in this regard. (Yes, I am aware the drunk thing is stupid, it just provides an easy option to brush it off if it doesn't go well.)

I feel kind of silly because I know I risk fucking up everything regardless. I either don't tell him to preserve our friendship, or I tell him and risk ruining our friendship. Just curious if there are any other routes to deal with this.

TL;DR - I really like my good friend, don't want to fuck up our friendship."

A couple of years ago I would have told you that I loved math. I enjoyed my discrete math and advanced calculus (aka intermediate analysis) courses tremendously and was convinced that this was the subject I wanted to study. Last year I applied to a ton of applied math REUs. I was 100% set on participating in one of them until I got a non-math related internship offer in a location that I thought was too sweet to pass up. It was a tough decision at the time though and I was disappointed that I'd be giving up the opportunity to spend a summer doing math research.

Now here I am, doing this math homework and bored to death. After taking advanced calculus, I couldn't wait to take elementary real analysis. Well I've finally gotten my chance to take it, and I couldn't care less about connected sets and open covers. Even the more applied classes like Numerical Analysis and Fourier Series bore me to tears. 

It seems like the older and more exposed to the real world I get, the less I care about pushing symbols around to prove abstract theorems. The stuff I'm learning now is so abstract to where I don't understand why I'm bothering to learn it. Even if there is some practical application, I feel as though my time would be better spent working on things that actually interest me. My finance and artificial intelligence classes interest me 1000x more than any of the math classes I'm taking at the moment.

I used to think that learning math makes you smarter. So even if proving some esoteric calculus theorem or learning about the Gauss-Siedel iterative method is boring, it's making me smarter right? Now I don't even think so. Recently I started studying for the general GRE and realized how horrible my reading comprehension is. I've been bashing the liberal arts since high school, but now I feel as though learning history/philosophy/whatever would not only be more interesting than what I'm learning now, but it'd probably even be more beneficial. 

To be fair, I'm not exactly the brightest math student (also I'm tired of school in general, but that's the subject for another post). Maybe I was just never destined to be a math major. I still don't regret majoring in it though because it does give you a lot of opportunities. But there's no way in hell I'm going to grad school for math. I'm looking more towards statistics, computer science, and finance. 

I'm trying to understand what kind of person actually enjoys this stuff. I've talked to a few grad students (very small sample size I know), and even they seemed bored of their theoretical math courses. "

I took that naivety into college and remember thinking that upon simply graduating my CIS program, I'd jump into a 6 figure job as a VP and my gf and I would live happily ever after.  Maybe someday I'd fulfill my dream of being on the cover of Wired magazine (again, this was around 98-99)!

[This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/lydb8/value_of_a_college_degree/c2wlwd8) reminded me of that glorious innocence.  I got lucky and a month or so before the end of my first year, my dad suggested putting my html hacking skills to work and looking through the want ads.  I ended up finding a part-time internship for $10/hr at a .com where I'd be working with real life web developers and programmers.

That put a wet finger over my newly lit flame and I realized where the money was (those java guys were making close to 100k!) and how difficult it was to become a VP and get into that kind of money.

Point being, I hadn't done ANYTHING other than drink the kook-aid in college and if it wasn't for my dad's off-hand comment, I would have neck-deep in a Stafford loan with nothing but a couple of intro programming classes under my belt.

The path to becoming a web developer or programmer is pretty straight-forward and I know some of you have more complicated paths to get to where the money is.  What work have you done so far?  What were your findings?  Met anyone else like me who was sorely in over their head as far as expectations went?"
lzv9u,1,2011-11-03,Girlfriend can't orgasm.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/lzv9u/girlfriend_cant_orgasm/,"Is it stupid to want to end my 5 year relationship because my girlfriend absolutely is incapable of having an orgasm?  I'm 32. She is 26. I have tried everything and she just can't cum. It completely ruins it for me. I don't even want to have sex with her because it's like ""what's the point?""
It's like having a supercar that doesn't run right.  She is super hot and I am pretty sure damn near every guy would want to have sex with her. But I don't even want to any more because she can't climax. It's just not sexy when she can't get into it.

Ok before you go off on me and my ""terrible"" skills you need to know: We have tried everything...even vibrators while fucking and she still can't cum.  

I have been with other girls and they were all very pleased in bed. Every girl I have been with has had multiple orgasms with me. Don't go off about ""how do you know they weren't lying?""  They weren't. 

The biggest thing for me is that it was very easy to get all of these other girls off. They let you know what they like. All I had to do was pay a little attention to their bodies reactions and it was easy. My girlfriend can't even communicate with words, much less communicate with body language.  

We lived in the same town for two and a half years then I moved to go to grad school and she moved to do her internship.  She couldn't cum then either...but she drank and smoked a lot so I figured it was that.  Now we live together and she is sober and she still can't cum. I can't picture spending my life with a woman who can't do something as simple as having an orgasm.  What do you think? Is this fucked up? I'm also kinda mad because I feel like I used to be good in bed and now I don't even try. It's useless.  I could give you details.  I mean I have done marathon foreplay, oral and fuck sessions with no results. I feel like sex is just pointless if it's with her.

She is somewhere around 6 years old. She is very well house trained and is great with people. Age and number does not matter. However, she would need to be the only pet in the house.

She is my first dog, and has been the greatest first dog I can imagine. She is very quiet. I got her when she was about 3-4 and it was 3 months until I even knew she could bark.

She loves to play tug of war and cuddle on the couch.

All food, toys, and various supplied will be provided. She has been spayed and has all shots up to date until well into 2013.

She has no problems during the day, and as long as she is fed and walked in the morning, she is good for 8-12 hours. I typically only walk her twice a day. If she does have to go out she will start doing tricks to let you know.

## Quick Note

Hey guys I just want to apologize for missing some threads and not updating others. While I do this for the NASL, it's not a job I get paid for or anything, just something I do as an intern.

So, on some days, papers, midterms and my job take over and I can't always update these threads in time. So while I can do something like update the winner, I can't put the information about hero picks and bans in because I don't have access to that unless I watch it.

So if you see a thread that hasn't been updated, I didn't forget about it, I just have to attend to things in my real life.

Have a great weeked! Enjoy the matches :D"

I've taken 3 statistics courses and have a decent comp sci background. No research experience. Interested in a terminal MS programs in statistics. Where can I get in?**

I'm a math major at Virginia Tech graduating in Spring 2012. I recently decided that I'm tired of math, so I've been looking into Masters programs (I don't want a PHD) in statistics because it seems like a great field to get into. I have absolutely no idea as to what schools I have a shot at getting into though, so I'll describe my background and hopefully someone that's knows a little bit about the application process can give me an idea.

* *Grades*: I have around a 3.7/4.0 GPA overall and a 3.99/4.00 over the past 2 years (all A's and an A-). But I'm pretty burned out right now so this semester will see a slight decline. I'll probably get a B in Real Analysis (if I worked my ass off I could prob pull a B+ or A- but I'm so tired of theoretical math right now and am not convinced that it's worth the effort, if I'm wrong then convince me otherwise). Everything else should be A and maybe a A- or two though.

* *Courses (outside math)*: I've taken 2 ""Probability &amp; Statistics"" courses and a Bayesian statistics course. Next semester I'm taking time series. I have a decent computer science background and have taken ""Data Structures &amp; Algorithms"" along with ""Artificial Intelligence"". 

* *Research Experience*: None, although I plan to do machine learning research next semester. Since most grad school application deadlines seem to be in Jan/Feb, I guess I won't be able to say much about that in my application though.

* *Work Experience*: IT internship at a large bank. Programming job before that.

* *GRE*: Haven't gotten my scores back yet. The ranges I got were Quant: 750-800 (I know that doesn't say much), Verbal: 570-670, and I prob got like a 4 on the writing (I'm sure I could def boost this up to at least a 4.5, but I'm not convinced it's worth the effort unless I get a shitty quant score and have to retake the GRE anyways). I'm not taking the math subject GRE.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So where can I get in? A friend of mine told me that I could probably get into Columbia. Does he have any idea what he's talking about?

Ideally I'd like to go to a school in a fun location like Columbia or UCLA rather than a college town in the middle of nowhere. I like big cities and/or warm weather. At the same time, I'm not exactly rich, so if I can't get funding then I'll have to pay for school through student loans. So I can't afford to go to an expensive program on the other side of the country if it won't provide me the job opportunities to make up for the tuition/plane ticket costs.

I'm def applying to UVA (in-state tuition for me, although I really want to gtfo of Virginia if I can), UCLA, and Columbia. Anybody have any idea as to what my chances are of getting into any of these programs? Where else should I be looking? I'm thinking GWU, UIUC, and UFlorida too.

Is it possible to get funding if you're not planning to do a PHD, or is it extremely difficult/unlikely?

Also, how important is school reputation for grad school in statistics? To put this into perspective, I'm also applying for Masters in Financial Engineering programs, and school reputation is extremely important in that field. They're also very expensive, so I've been told that it's probably not worth paying the $55k tuition or whatever for a tier 2  school. 

But I figure that since statistics jobs aren't as competitive as Wall Street quant jobs, it's not nearly as big a deal how well-known your school is. And statistics is pretty meritocratic rather than pedigree-based. Right?"

His response stuck with me for a very long time, and to this day it is probably still one of the most sensible things I have heard a religious person say (even if it's just a TV character).

""There is no conflict between Allah and Science. Allah created the wonders of the world, and science for the most part struggles to explain it. But the search for truth is an honourable cause, and I honour allah through my search for the truth.""

I want to know what Christians think on the subject. To raise a simple example, how do you work around the fact that Genesis directly contradicts the Big Bang? How does it affect the way you accept (or reject) the Big Bang as a hypothesis?

Why not the place where laws are actually made? A lot of people here have been saying we need to change our target, and this would be an amazing way to have our voices heard. 

There have been some protesters in various congress buildings off and on, but they have been extremely uncoordinated, and overpowered quite easily.

m1h39,16,2011-11-05,Daily musings: does the LDS church *really* have a lay ministry in the post correlation world? ,curious_mormon,exmormon,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/m1h39/daily_musings_does_the_lds_church_really_have_a/,"First off, let's what decide what a lay ministry is.  There are lots of variations, and the term usually changes slightly based on who is using it.  So, for sake of argument, let's define lay ministry as someone who is called as a religious worker for the church (directly or indirectly), but is not paid for their service.   This drops both the full-time requirement and the unordained (aka: not set apart requirement) 

-----

Secondly, let's list off the ecclesiastical positions of the church:

1. **Apostles**, including the top 3, 12, the 8 groups of 70, and relief society/primary presidencies.

2. **Other publicaly prominent positions**, Mission Presidents, temple presidents, and missionaries

3. **Ecclesiastical Church office (COB) employees**, including non-apostle correlation committee members, ecclesiastical review boards, speech writers, manual authors, and other full-time religious positions.

4. **Church level teachers**, CES educators, including all university teaching positions, paid seminary teachers, and paid historians.

5. **Local leadership**, Stake Presidents, bishops, elder's quorum presidents, and relief society presidents.

6. **Local teachers**, including unpaid seminary teachers, adult class teachers, young men and young women teachers, choir directors (they decide the ""doctrine"" taught in the choir songs), possibly choir members, and temple workers

7. **Other axillary**, scout leaders, janitorial staff, administrative/support positions in a local ward and non-religious COB employees (ie: web master, printing officer)

8. **Membership speakers**, I include fireside talks, sacrament talks, other impromptu speeches, and the occasional prayer

-----

Now, let's review each position

1. **Apostles**, A generous ""living stipend"" across the board.  The higher levels receive expense accounts, free travel, security, benefits, and paid housing.  Many of the upper levels, [including relief society leaders](http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=30970868&amp;privcapId=4333313&amp;previousCapId=4333313&amp;previousTitle=Deseret%20Book%20Company), are placed on the boards of the many church owned corporations.  The leader of the church [has many of these corporations in his name](http://www.exmormon.org/mormon/mormon410.htm). **Result**: Paid Ministry

2. **Other publicly prominent positions**, Missionaries and mission presidents receive a monthly stipend and free housing in their mission.  My  mission was very clear that the 400$ paid by a missionaries or their family is a donation to the church.  The church then doles this out to the missionary at a rate they seem fit. (see also rule #7 of the financial section in the missionary handbook)  Thus, the church pays their missionaries out of donations they receive to the mission fund.  According to John Delin, [Temple presidents also receive a small stipend](http://mormondiscussions.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=19806&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a)**Result**: Paid Minstery

3. **Ecclesiastical Church office (COB) employees**,  The COB employees responsible for the manuals and ecclesiastical teachings of the entire church.  This group may include members from #1, but it's not exclusive to that group.  They, like all COB employees, receive a salary and benefits.**Result**: Paid Minestery

4. **Church level teachers**, All BYU professors are instructed to include religious principles in their teaching, even those not specifically a part of the religion department.  Most, (if not all) full time CES employees are also paid. **Result**: Paid Minestry

5. **Local leadership**,  Lowest levels of the leadership positions in the church.  I know of no instance where this group is paid.**Result**: *unpaid* Minestry

6. **Local teachers**, I'm having a hard time with this group.  They are not real ecclesiastical teachers in that they don't design their own lesson plans.  The church has given specific instruction for these members to follow the manual provided by group #3 and not to deviate outside of the approved material.  They are even force fed ""discussion"" questions designed to make the membership repeat parts of the manual that were just read.  Choir directors are probably closer to an ecclesiastical position than anyone else in this group. They at least get to pick the hymns; although maybe they should be included in group #8.**Result**: Unpaid, but should not be considered part of the ministry due to their [lack of freedom](http://seminary.lds.org/manuals/doctrine-and-covenants-and-church-history-seminary-teacher-resource-manual/dc-trm-7-pres-dc138.asp). (Edit: I've softened my stance, they are ordained to teach, so they count as part of the ministry as much as a COB employee). 

7. **Other axillary**, but should not be considered part of the ministry due to their lack of freedom. In reality, these people are human microphones for group #3.  **Result**: Unpaid, like #6.

8. **Membership speakers**, I'll mark this as a ministry.  These people are authorized to speak on behalf of their religion. The audience is often the believing, but includes non-believers or uninitiated as well. They are given a topic, but often provided free reign with rare correction at the end.**Result**: *Unpaid* Minestery


-----

**TL;DR: Summary** - The bottom of the pyramid is unpaid, the middle and top are definitely paid. 

**TL;DR, but would read a little** The church  most definitely has a paid ministry.  In fact, I would argue that all religious educators are either reciting, verbatim, the words of a part of the paid ministry; or fall into one of these three groups: Bishops, Stake Presidents, EQ/RS presidents.   Bishops and Stake presidents could be argued as stepping stones (ie: unpaid internships) to the paid positions. Regardless, Bishops and Stake presidents have autonomy but even they have a private set of rules (handbook #1) and instructions (letters from the first presidency) designed to prevent variance or much deviation.

m1elm,0,2011-11-05,"Alright Reddit, I need some advice, I got my first underage last weekend at partying at Ohio State and my court date is coming up",m_c_peach,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/m1elm/alright_reddit_i_need_some_advice_i_got_my_first/,"Here's what happened:

I was playing beer pong with a few friends outside on his porch.  An
undercover cop came up on to his porch and asked how old I was.  I was thrown off guard, acted stupidly and, without thinking I told him I was 21. He asked for my ID, I told him I was not 21 and he told me to go over with him.  He looked at my license information and said he didn't know I was 20 days away form turning 21, or he would of let me go, but now there was to much evidence and he had to take me in.  They took the cup I was drinking, and took a sample from it.  They took picture of the whole scene and a picture of me as well.  The whole time I was with them I was very complaint, did not resist in anyway and did what I was told to do. They charged me with underage possession and in Ohio that is a 1st degree misdemeanor. I obviously do not have a background in law, but I know that they get underage possession so often that they probably got enough evidence on me. It was not a big party, just a few friends outside.  No one was holding a beer, all they saw was red cups in the beer pong formation and us drinking them.  I assume that's enough cause for them to come up, but I don't really know.  I have never in my life been caught doing anything wrong, that was the first time I have ever spoken to a police officer.  I do have good grades as a student, and I am very close to being 21 so I figured those would all be in my favor.  I was hoping because of my current finical situation, ( I am student working a full time internship, that pays nothing) they would knock down the charges, or
maybe throw it out all together.  I cannot contact my school for legal service either( I waived the fee at the beginning of the year, didn't think I would get arrested) so that was kind of a buzz kill.  I contacted a friend of mine who's a lawyer, he told me to plead not guilty and have a court assign me a lawyer.  He said he would come down and represent me, but even after cutting his rate in half it he would still run me 800$.  I know a lot of people that have got an underage at OSU before and they told me all I would have to do pay a fine and do some community service.  I'm just terrified that they can throw me in jail if they wanted to make an example out me.

Do you guys think I should just sack up and pay the fee for the lawyer?  Or just plead no contest and gamble a little bit.  "
m1bmq,3,2011-11-05,"She's lost her self image, and I feel solely responsible. What do you think?",throwowowowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/m1bmq/shes_lost_her_self_image_and_i_feel_solely/,"I'[m] 21, as is she. Been going out nine months, LDR the whole time (two hour plane), and I'm considering moving in with her once my internship is over.

Our relationship is something that came out of the blue for a lot of people, but we were tight as can be for a good while. She has the exact same interests as me, she has the same childish brain, and I think the absolute world of her. Always have, always will, regardless of what could reasonably happen.

I'm a man that believes in his morals - I have a pretty big aversion to lying, and I always feel better knowing that I've answered a question honestly. I'm from a student town, where me, my circle of friends, and their boyfriends/girlfriends are very open about sex, checking out members of the opposite sex, etc. This is a pretty stark contrast to my SO (let's call her Sarah), who has been with a social group where this seems reasonably taboo, at least when they're being serious. She's had two exes - one of which she went out with for seven years, and both of which cheated on her.

Fast forward a few months. Everything's awesome, we fly up and down to see each other every few weeks or so. One night when she's at mine, Sarah asks me if I check out other girls. I, being honest, give her the honest answer. I know it's not right to make assumptions based on other relationships, but every ex I've had had been accepting of the fact, since it's such a common thing, regardless of relationship status. I figured it wouldn't be a biggie to say so. Turns out I was very wrong.

Sarah burst into tears. Needless to say, it wasn't pretty. From here on out, when I've said something that might allude to this subject, even if I'm just joking around with buddies, she goes quiet, sometimes leaves the conversation, and it gets hard to communicate with her. Things start to fluctuate between being all good and being not so good.

Now, things seem to be taking a turn for the worst. I was up to see her last weekend, and she seemed a lot more distant than normal, and it still feels like that's the case now. I don't like saying negative things about her, but she has been a lot more critical about my flaws lately - generally to do with my more laid-back attitude to things, whereas she's a lot more planned out. She says that her self-image has been shattered because of what I said, and that she enjoyed the lie that she was being fed. Now, she feels unattractive, to the point where she is incredibly insecure whenever we go somewhere together, or even when we're with my friends. She's less inclined to cuddle at night, and she says her mind won't accept it when I tell her what I think about her (all positive, of course).

I feel like I'm at wit's end. I really don't know what to do or say. Regardless, I feel responsible. I feel like I've taken one of the things that mean most in life, and driven my boot right through it. A lot of people say that honesty is key, but have I been *too* honest?

**tl;dr - Had an awesome thing going with a girl, she seems shattered at the fact that I check out other girls (guys, I hope you understand what I mean by this.) Relationship has deteriorated, and I feel responsible. Am I right to feel this way?**"
m17gf,5,2011-11-05,Can't I just die? Anyone have ANY insight?,n7831,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m17gf/cant_i_just_die_anyone_have_any_insight/,"Move/delete this if this isn't the right place.

I don't want this to be massive story, so ask me details as needed...

Bottom line—I want to die. I currently lack the means to do so rightfully. I have time, so perhaps someone can change my mind. Give me something I haven't yet done. Teach me something I don't know. Any insight, anything useful. Anything.

**As it stands:**
I have an eating disorder—more than an eating disorder. Depression. Minimal self-esteem. Constant anxiety. Apathy is rampant. Mood swings, cravings, perpetual thoughts of suicide. Getting lost in my own mind for hours on end. I feel insane, but that it's my ability to make sense of what's happening that makes me feel that way.

**Necessary History:**
My life was great until I was 15.5 years old. I was arrested late one night with my best friend en route to lighting off a molotov cocktail for fun and video taping it. At the time it turned my life upside down, as I was a good, bright kid. Mentally and emotionally I got over it as it was resolved over time. But I emerged with a changing sense of self. I wanted to change who I was because of the mistake I made. Though I forgave myself, I wanted to consciously become ""my best."" My intelligence told me that was perfection. Somewhere in this time the root causes of my current situation began.

I was already a straight-A student. I was already an athlete. Through the latter half of high school I became more successful because of that quest for perfection. I became obsessed with nutrition, sports performance, task efficiency, and other ways of being better pragmatically and proactively. I worked harder in school, I learned more, I became fitter, I became faster. Eagle Scout. Team Captain. More than a dozen first place finishes. Two-time state qualifier in cross country. Accepted in college of my choice. Good girlfriend, decent family, close, reliable friends. Etc, etc.

Somewhere in that line of achievement there arose a dark side of me. Not just a fear of failure, but some kind of compulsion that drove me to overeat (binge) on unhealthy, sugary food. I can't pinpoint the first exact incident, only the first I can remember. 

Binges are mysterious and monthly at first. During senior year of HS binges become more and more frequent, but generally doesn't escalate to severely effect my quality of life, activities, etc. Though personal guilt, shame, etc was present as a result. 

Between HS and college, binges cease for a bit but come back larger and worse than ever as a college freshman. Binges are weekly and begin to affect mental health, academic and athletic performance. Obsession with the problem and overall anxiety grows. Try to get help through friends and weekly therapy, no changes. Girlfriend leaves me, grandpa dies, I feel nostalgia for the past constantly. Academics and athletics continue to hold me together.

Between freshman and sophomore year, mental health and quality of life deteriorate a little more. Weight gain occurs for the first time (~10 pounds). Sophomore year, suicidal thoughts begin because I get sports injury that keeps me from my favorite passion indefinitely. Grades plummet. November of sophomore year, suicide attempt number one. Too afraid/unsure to do it. December of sophomore year, attempt number two, don't do it for the same reasons.

Winter holidays of sophomore year of college. Rediscover some sources of motivation to 'fix' all the problems. Resolve to tell parents a little and do everything possible to get back to normal. I lose 15 pounds, get really fit, work very hard to get a 4.0. Binges reduced to weekly or less. Then I got an internship back home, binges resurface due to lack of willpower and post weight-loss fallout, etc. Gain weight. Become apathetic with suicidal thoughts again. Just kind of float for a while. I re-enter therapy, it doesn't really do anything for me. Continue to float for a bit as I gain weight and lose more fitness.

Junior year of college, age 21. Resolve again to make serious attempt to mitigate overeating, fix running injury, etc. I couldn't conquer the binges. One step forward, two steps back. Mental/emotional condition deteriorates further...

**Necessary details for help/analysis:**

*I'm gonna be as clear as I can, because I want whoever decides to read all this to know what I know and help me make some kind of practical decision, if possible...*

I know what's wrong with me. I know what I want in life, I know what (I think) makes me happy. The biggest, most mysterious problem is that I have this visceral, insatiable desire to eat all the time. I think about food and my disorder and all that anxiety as long as I am awake. My eating disorder and it's surrounding problems *prevent* me from doing what I love and self-actualizing.

I have tried absolutely everything I can think of to get back to eating normally, healthfully. I have tried to control my eating, to get myself to stop overeating, but at some point I fail every time. A powerful drug addiction is the best way I can describe it. 

When I overeat these days, pretty much all I do walk around campus eating whatever the fuck I want, when I want, because I am infected with apathy and I have so little willpower left anymore to stop myself. I can't get myself to do school work, to exercise, to do anything productive (or even fun). It's like all I want is to eat. This goes on until I somehow my willpower recharges, I tap into my motivational reserves, and try to turn my life around. Either in 3 days or a week or some short period of time, I fail and binge again. And so after a few more days of constant overeating, I try again. And again. And again. 

This is what I refer to as ""the soul destroying cycle."" Every time it happens I care less and want to die more. So here's the conclusion I've reached, the help/advice that I need:

If my eating disorder, etc. will always exist, if it's something that honestly will never go away and never get better, if it's a behavior that will only push me to keep eating until no one cares about me, all my progress in life is gone, I have no friends and my family rejects me, and I'll die from it, what's the point of trying to fight to live? 

Like, I doubt now that recovery is possible. It's like I always want more food no matter what... I can't enjoy life because of this. I'm always afraid, always anxious, and I'm not just making this up. I used to be so successful and happy with myself. I mean, I sometimes see a tiny bit of a bright side to things, I have a friend or two, I have some sort of fun things to look forward to, but they can't cure me of this eating disorder. If  I do feel happy, I just feel like I should be eating to further that happiness. 

Here's what I'm left with—where I *really* want to hear from anyone—I believe I have two choices: 

A) Let go completely of everything that I'm trying to control in my life. Fuck grades, fuck fitness, fuck working hard for any of my dreams and goals. Just do whatever I want, whether it's food or not, and see where I end up in like a month or so. To see if my desire for food ever goes away, like a passing fad. This would be the expense of *literally* everything: what my friends think, what my family thinks; I'd be creating career sabotage, college sabotage, doing a complete U-turn and saying ""fuck you, world!"" It'd be like committing suicide, only not dying. I feel that in this choice everyone would hate me, but my family and friends wouldn't ""suffer"" because I'm dead. They can just be forever angry or whatever with me instead. Maybe I could try and explain everything. Not sure. 

B) Kill myself. Looking like the better option. Since the rest of world beyond the small amount of people I know won't care. Society won't miss me, I already know of a dozen people that are better than me with less arrogance and selfishness that can make my former communities better. In short, I'm replaceable by others for any standard of value or accomplishment. ... Yeah, my friends and family will mourn and miss me. But what's worse? Asking them to suffer a little for a few weeks until they forget and move on, or suffer myself from all this soul destroying shit for the rest of my life, forever disappointing anyone who may have actually cared about me? Because let's face it, since very, very few of those people close to me know about these problems of mine, if I'm dead it'll just be easier for them to accept. But if they see me deteriorate into societal/cultural worthlessness because I decide not to die so they can be ""happy"" with me alive... that just doesn't make sense to me. 

So what do I do? What *can* I do? I'm fucking tired of this shit.

**TL;DR: Fairly certain I want to die. Used to be successful, happy person. Now, multiple mental health issues, including ""perceived incurable"" eating disorder. Can't decide if it's better to live or die. I'll answer any questions you have.**"

I'll be needing to sleep early and wake up early, but my large family will not. I know I COULD just use ear plugs or ask them to be quiet, but those wont work in my situation.

I'm down for a not so expensive project to block my upstairs room off from the noise coming from the kitchen and living room, not really noises from outside. What should I do? I'm no professional, so all I can think of is stuffing shirts/towels under my door and in the vents, then buying a fan. Any better, more professional suggestions? I'm guessing a good amount of noise is coming through the floor?"

I'm a Mechanical Engineering Student and I'd like to do an internship in Germany next year... One of the companies I'm looking to apply to makes gliders (Segelflugzeug) and they wrote this on their website:

""DG kann allerdings nur Plätze für ein Fachpraktikum anbieten. Die Praktikumsinhalte, die für ein Vor- bzw. Grundpraktikum gefordert werden, können nicht von uns vermittelt werden. Das betrifft insbesondere die ""Grundlagen der Metallverarbeitung"".""

What does this actually mean? I don't understand my own translation... I'm looking for a mechanical engineering internship.. it would involve mostly working in the offices helping to design and work on the **technical side** of the business. When I read the paragraph above I was worried maybe this internship is just manual work (Handarbeit) in their factory...

For my video internship yesterday I visited a horse farm to film a 4-H Horse Care Workshop. 

It was actually a lot more interesting than I thought it was going to be and I learned a lot of interesting facts about real-life horses that made me appreciate the animated versions that much more. 

I loved watching the horses and picking up on their individual personalities, there was totally a silly 'Pinkie Pie' horse and a bully 'Trixie' horse!

[](/c14 ""Hmmm...I wonder..."") So that got me thinking, do any of the 10,000+ Bronies around here work with horses on a regular basis? If so, do your interactions with real-life horses affect how you watch the show, or vice versa?"

7th grade to 2nd yr high school: I enjoyed being the weird kid. I had one friend who went to another HS, but I enjoyed being an eccentric and retarded acting kid among my peers. I wore rave pants during this period, which says a lot

3rd yr high school to senior yr in high school: I discovered that I really enjoyed studying and that I wanted to be a chemical engineer, so my idea of fun was to go to the bookstore every weekend, sip on coffee, look through car magazines and dream about what exotic supercars I could buy being chemical engineer (lol I was so naive back then)

1st year college to third year college: Everytime I talked to people, I was always arrogant and aloof, though I realized this all in retrospect during my senior year, and I looked for the bad things in people to build up my self esteem. I honestly thought this was how I should talk to and interact with people, that this was what confidence was all about. Of course, this drove everyone I came across away from me, from my two dorms freshman and sophomore year to my fraternity I joined during junior year. everyone in my freshman year dorm made fun of me one night while there were in one room, everyone in my sophomore year dorm gave me signals that they didnt want to talk to me, and the president of my fraternity personally told me that I freak people out. These things didnt hurt me however, I just brushed them off with blind confidence and it only convinced me further that I was on a different level from everyone else. Unsurprisingly, I spent a lot of time during this period alone, whether at coffee shops, riding my bike, or surfing the internet. Everyone I talked to was just an acquaintance

Senior yr of college: My ego comes crashing down. Due to me taking 5 engineering courses, overcaffeination from working at starbucks, and my complete lack of close friends, the overbearing stress brought me to the realization that I really needed to start connecting with people. I spent this year being as social as possible, but while being personable, and trying to be nice and understanding of what the other person had to say. And defintely not being so damn critical and judgemental about other people. Still, I spent this whole year questioning everything about myself and my past, why it didnt occur to me to be accepted by people and to relate to them earlier in my life. I had very shaky confidence.

---

fast forward to today, one year since senior year. I now have a devoted best friend who I met shortly after graduating from college, a car, an internship at an engineering firm that I love working in, dating experience, good social skills / social life, good looks etc. But the question remains in my head: WHY DID IT TAKE ME UNTIL MY LAST YEAR OF COLLEGE TO INTERACT WITH PEOPLE NORMALLY??? Ive spent  so much time looking through online forums seeing if there could be something neurochemically wrong with me, extreme introversion, avoidant / schizoid personality disorder, asperger's syndrom, shitty upbringing etc. Ironically, i never spent a year with shaky confidence and mild depression up until this past year that I spent improving the way I socialize with people, Ive made a huge change and now have a steady social life yet I spend so much mental energy thinking about why it happened so late and what could have been different.

Im still improving, all I need to do is let go of the past and then Ill be a happy man. anyway, this is what's been bothering me"

Additional Info:
My husband and I moved from Denver to a smaller community (around 10,000-15,000 people) in South Dakota for a new job for him back in May. Ever since we decided to move, I have been constantly looking for a position since April. I have a degree in industrial engineering (but have never used it), and there really are not available jobs in this field here. While in Denver I had worked retail, office management, receptionist and administrative assistant. 

So I am applying for mostly office type jobs, retail, bank teller, etc. My issue is that I get any time I get an interview, employers tell me I have an impressive resume which makes me think I have good shot at the job. They do always ask if I plan on using my degree and I tell them the truth which is NO. I had an internship my summer before my last year of school and absolutely hated it and have never worked in any sort of engineering. 

I feel like any employer would be lucky to have me as I am a fast learner, detail oriented and professional. And another thing, a company that had around 300+ employees closed right after we moved here so I guess I am also competing with those 300+ people for a job. Its not that I'm not getting interviews, I am just not getting the job! Not sure what I'm doing wrong...

**TL;DR: Moved to a new place in May and been looking for a job ever since.**

I do have a rule (and she had the same) that we don't date co-workers, I kept this up for the whole year and during that time I found out that she was going back to the same university that I was…result!

The year went by and we became very close and we were often very flirty with each other and going for drinks and having lunch together every week.

We're both back at university now and we been out on a few proper dates, and we've gotten intimate with each other. 

Recently she found out that she's gotten a cold sore, and her doctor has diagnosed her with type 2 herpes. I don't think that I have herpes (we've always practiced safe sex bit I will get tested this week just in case)

She's gotten very distant from me (could be all to do with the coldsore) and i'm quite concerned that she's losing the interest that she's managed to have for the past year.

What do you think Reddit?

Edit: We spoke about it and it wasnt the herp. She wasnt sure that she felt the 'spark' of a potential relationship so it's over.

My lesson learnt is that it's always better to just go for it and talking does help."
m402o,3,2011-11-07,I need advice regarding classes!,Zileto,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/m402o/i_need_advice_regarding_classes/,"So, after two years of basic math and physics and stuff, I finally got to take the basic engineering courses for ChE's this fall. I love my current ChE courses, and the other basic engineering courses are good too, but the workload is harsh. I'm supposed to have a job to support myself, but I didn't end up getting one because I wanted to have enough time for school and extracurriculars. Right now, I'm living off my savings and fin aid with no ""fun"" money.

Now, I'm supposed to signing up for spring courses. I'm already signed up for 9 credit hours of classes that are nonnegotiable (ChE Thermo, Transport phenomena, and an Organic 1 lab). I need to pick up one more class. I went and spoke to the ChE academic adviser, and learned that the plan I had for classes can't actually work because of fall/spring class scheduling. He laid out two possible plans, one for graduating as quickly as possible (that most people take) and a slower one that he highly recommends instead.

The faster plan has me graduating in fall '13 (spring '13 would be a perfect four-year degree), but has only room for one internship, and it only works if I can get elective credit for that internship. The semesters would be more difficult because I'd be taking more credit hours as well. There is no way I could hold a job and still be active in everything I want to do.

The second plan has me graduate in spring '14 with two summers open for internships. It hovers around 13 credit hours per semester, so I could probably hold an outside part-time job and still be active in AIChE and things.

I know the difference between the two is realistically only one semester, but my family is really expecting me to be able to do it all ASAP. I already tried to talk to my dad about not graduating in four years and he wouldn't hear of it and basically got really angry. My parents are also the ones who expect me to hold a part time job. I don't think they'd contribute financially toward anything more than summer '13. I don't expect them to help me forever, but I want them to understand that I can't do it all, so to speak. If I have to work my way through college, it will take longer and that is that and that is not equal to failure.

So... basically, I need help. Do you think one plan is better than the other? Why? How do I get my parents to understand that it's not me who is failing by taking longer than four years? Sorry this is kinda long..."

I'm in my early 30s, just moved to a new city, have a developer IT job, and am totally, utterly isolated at my 9-5 job. My specific job has me isolated in weird division due to political feuds between the head of the Departments. There's no other fellow techies here where I'm at. The other division with the developers are full of guys in their late 40s, wives and children, commutes and family time. None of them are into happy hours, bars, or even group lunches. Every single last one of them are extreme introverts and can always be found eating alone in their cars or hidden away in their cubes. I've lost count of how many times I've tried to reach out to go hang with them or organize a get together that ended up nowhere.

I've also tried going outside my division for human interaction but I'm either too old for the younger early 20s interns or too technical for the others. It's hard enough meeting people in a new city but not even having reliable coworkers you can hang with for a simple lunch is terrifying. I like the work that I do and don't want to quit, but spending each day zoned out with my headphones on and having no human interaction for 8 hours (other than with my boss) is utterly depressing the holy fuck out of me.

* He's obsessed with Dexter and wants to watch him work.
* He's creating a video game about homocide.
* He's shown himself to be morally flexible, with the help he gave Matsuka (wiping the internet clean, and all that nonsense).
* This week he was shoehorned into a scene giving him (otherwise) needless exposition about himself. 

Is it me, or is it pretty obvious this guy is gonna be a killer, or a big deal of some kind later in this season or next? In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if he has something to do with Matsuka's old intern, Blonde perv lady. Especially since the first thing he did upon arrival was erase mostly everything about the evidence she stole. 

Also, he's dressed/described/treated as just a harmless nerdy nobody...so on this show, of course he'll be a big somebody."

Help me out?",throwaway_guy_person,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/m3b2s/im_sixteen_but_i_feel_like_ive_already_screwed_up/,"I doubt many people are gonna read this, but it's a good place to vent, and it's helping me realize a lot of things on my own. I'm aware that most of this sounds like ranting, but maybe some of you can help.

I know this may not be the ideal place to be looking for help, but I do know that Reddit is a fairly diverse community and the accumulative life experience all of you have could really help someone like me. So here's the deal..

I am enrolled in a dual credit high school. I've technically graduated from high school already. All I have left is a third year of Spanish and a class called ""Business and Marketing."" Once I graduate I'll have an associates of my choice (I'm probably just going to choose General Studies). I like video games, sometimes too much, and they can turn into a great place to dump valuable time. Most girls my age are irritating, vapid shit-heads, but they say I'm good-looking. I have an IQ of 137, and I even have an internship at an established medical center this Spring, but my grades are shit. 

I have a C-D average. On top of that I don't have any volunteer hours, or extracurricular crap. I have no idea what college I want to go to, but I don't think it matters since I won't be able to get into much with the grades I have. School isn't difficult, in fact it's rather easy (I should take the time here to mention that I'm an American attending an American school, in case that offers any insight as to what I'm dealing with), but I pull terrible grades. 

I guess I just don't want to do it, I feel like I can depend on my smarts or my ability to deal with people, but recently I've realized that's not how most people get by in this world. I want to just say ""Fuck school!"" and go make it big on my own, but I know that isn't very probable. I want to do well, but I just fucking hate school. I hate the wasted hours watching the teacher stumble around at the front of the room ""teaching."" I hate the pointless homework assignments. I hate how it's about standardized test scores and competition and not about *learning.* 

I'm approaching the second semester mark of my Junior year, and my high school grades are pretty bad. I'm doing well in my college classes, since most of the focus is on reading the textbook and taking a test, and not coloring a periodic table, smothering it in glitter, and stitching my lips to the teachers' ass.

It doesn't seem like a difficult situation to fix, but I'm scrambled. I live with my father, and he's not much help. I'm intelligent, but I need a bit of guidance. So, what the fuck do I do to get myself on track?

**TL;DR** - I killed my two closest friends, and set fire to the church I did it in. The police have a suspicion it might be me, and this private detective has me pinned, so I might have to kill him too. How do I rid myself of these crimes?"

So I'm a student teacher who is currently applying for a permanent teaching gig.  During my internship as a student teacher I was gifted with an inordinate amount of control of my class, and allowed to run and prepare both lessons and curriculum.

When I finished my tenure as a student teacher and subsequently went to finish my masters (the following semester) I was contacted by many of my former students via email to add them as friends on facebook and return to class the following semester.

I agreed with the seniors (those who were going to graduate of which there was only one who wasn't) that I would add them, and came back to visit twice the following semester.  When their graduation completed last May I went on an adding spree adding dozens and dozens of students to my facebook.  

The reason I'm posting this is a student of mine posted a thing on her wall about the adam's rib bit. This to be more precise:

 Woman was created from man's rib.
Not from his head to rule over him; not from his foot to be trodden by him; but from his rib to be protected by his arm, to be close to his heart, and to be part of his very breathing. 

I responded with posting the text of Timtothy 2:12 and that started getting a few likes from her friends feed.  Later this evening I checked and she had defriended me.  

It's not a big deal at all, what bothers me is that I had a student who's response to disagreement was this kind of close-minded passive aggression.  I just thought share with you all my frustrations as a teacher who isn't trying to impress upon my students a world view but wants them to be able to defend their views in the public square, and when they can't, to accept those failings not close their minds."

m39u0,1,2011-11-07,Is a master's degree in Music Engineering a good idea?,[deleted],audioengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/m39u0/is_a_masters_degree_in_music_engineering_a_good/,"I'm a sophomore electrical engineering major right now, and while looking what to specialize in for grad school, audio engineering really piqued my interest.  I'm not extremely passionate about too many thing in life, but two things I love are technology and music.  I really like how audio engineering combines science and the arts, and I'm sure it's a much better culture than these boring engineers I am surrounded by now.  I'm a novice musician; I took piano lessons for five years and also played French horn for six years and excelled at both, but I have little understanding of the theory and composition of music right now.

I have no idea how I can get experience for internships and grad school since my school does not offer an audio engineering program.  Should I be taking music courses or learning how to play new instruments?  Should I look for some kind of software out there for mastering/mixing/working with audio and try to learn how to use it?  Should I be learning how to use and tinker with audio equipment?  Any books I should be reading?

Also, I figure since I will have a bachelor's in EE, I can always fall back on that if the job market is too competitive for audio engineering.

Does any of this sound like a good idea?

m39ri,5,2011-11-07,Advice or just someone to hear my story,Millarose,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/m39ri/advice_or_just_someone_to_hear_my_story/,"I have stage 4 terminal cancer. I got diagnosed almost 2 years ago. According to my Doctors it's a miracle that I'm still alive and doing as well as I am doing.

I met my boyfriend literally the day I got diagnosed. Which was also the day my former boyfriend (of 2 years) broke up with me because he couldn't deal with all the attention I needed. (The Hospital called him after I was brought in because of a seizure then my cancer was uncovered). 

Ever since that day we hung out just about every day. We became best friends. It was clear that he was in love with me, everyone knew that including me. I will admit that I friend zoned him extremely fast. The break up didn't really phase me much since after I realized what a complete douche bag he had always been to me. It didn't take long to get over him and I wasn't really ""hurt"". I laughed at his misfortune of knocking up a teenage intern from work that he cheated on me with before when he always made it clear that he never ever wanted to have children. A seizure was too much for him to handle but he ended up with a child.

I can't tell you why but after this break up I closed myself up. A lot. I built a giant wall around me and I had my limits of how close I let people get. New guy wanted to be together, really bad. I gave him excuses and said I wasn't over ex yet. When deep inside I knew I was I just really didn't want to be in a relationship. I was perfectly fine being alone. Now that I'm typing this out I'm realizing that it probably wasn't the shitty break up that made me close myself up. Could of been the fact that I have terminal cancer.

Anyway, months go past and I figured this guy has been my best friend for a long time. He's stuck with me through a lot of crap. He treats me like I'm his. He's clearly in love with me. I still feel okay being alone but I figured he deserved a shot. 

We've been together for a while now and I guess what I need advice on is how to tell him I don't want to do a lot of stuff he wants to. 

He wants to get married. I question why he would want to marry someone that will only be around for another year possibly less. But I'm fine with it. It's a wedding that I don't want. I'm not the type of girl that's always dreamed of a big wedding. In fact I would absolutely hate if I had to have a wedding. I guess I don't want any attention being drawn to me. Don't want him or my parents to spend money on a wedding that I know I would hate no matter how it turned out. I understand how calling me his dead wife sounds more serious than his dead girlfriend. I'm fine with going to court and getting married I just really don't want a wedding. Even if I weren't dying. I don't do weddings. I have told him this, I would marry him but I don't want a wedding. He brushes it off quickly and says ""but every girl has that dream wedding they want"". Well, I'm not like every girl. I don't. 

He wants to move to a different country so we can ""start our life together and a family"" etc. He's a few years younger than me and he's just finishing up his degree. He was promised a job right after but that requires him to move to a different country. While I understand all of this I simply don't want to move. Which has brought me to the question should I break up with him so he can pursue his career? He wont go unless I go and I really don't want to go and the family party. I already decided from a very young age that I never wanted to bring life into this world. If I ever wanted to have children I would adopt. I've tried explaining this to him. I wouldn't be able to live with myself knowing I willingly and purposely brought more life into this world when thousands of children all around the world are homeless and orphaned. Again he brushes it off quickly and still makes comments like ""When we have kids"" etc. 

Everyone I met that finds out I'm terminal always jumps up and says ""Oh my gosh you must have one of those really long list of things you want to do before you die right?!"" Actually no, I don't. I've had a good life, I've traveled lots. I've met many amazing people all over the world. I've experienced many different foods and cultures and on top of that I've photographed every good memory and got my fame from those photographs. I don't want to spend the next year or so checking things off from a list and ""making sure I get to do that before I die"". 

I want to be right here, with my family, doing what I would normally do, doing what I do every day. I realize that sounds cynical and emo like I'm rotting away playing video games until I die. I don't want to be away from my parents. My mom and dad have been so incredibly amazing to me. Given me everything all my life, payed for rent when douche bag kicked me out. Let me move into their guest house when I lost my job. Paid thousands of dollars in treatment. I don't want my mom to be in a different country when she gets the call. I want her to be there. 

It's been really bad lately. For a couple of months I've just been in bed. It's impossible for me to eat or even go anywhere. I'm not sure how he sees that moving to a different country is even a good idea. I feel like he's the one with a list and trying to check things off. I've told him all of this. I feel like he doesn't listen.

I went to a career fair and talked to a recruiter and when he looked at my resume, all he saw was a bunch of impressive items from completely different parts of life. When you look at my resume you see that I've made an online business that does SEO services, I'm VP of my fraternity, I've been a quality engineer for a manufacturing company, and I automated a testing system for a LED display company.  The two company internships I had were beyond my control so I didn't really want to do those things and found they sucked majorly.

I certainly enjoy the basics of Mechanical Engineering such as prototyping, building stuff, hands on stuff.  I hate the analysis, I hate programming, I hate the idea of being stuck in a cubical for 5 years only to be pushed to a bigger cubical to manager smaller ones.  That scares the shit out of me.

I am a philosophy student at UCLA and I just recently got into programming. I cannot express how much I enjoy coding. It is an amazing practical outlet for the analytical and explanatory skills I have picked up in philosophy. The intellectual high I get when I compile a challenging C++ program and it runs is addicting, to say the least. I am currently taking an introduction to programming class, which uses C++ as the example language, and I am teaching myself JavaScript on the side. Through this, I am learning the fundamentals of programming. In addition to programming, I spend pretty much all of my free time on educational websites learning as much as I can about computer science in general (I love recursive algorithms, and logic gates). It goes without saying, I feel as if I have found my calling. 

TL;DR: I LOVE PROGRAMMING!

Basically, what I would like to know is what are some real world skills that I should begin to develop that would benefit me when I try to get an internship or a job. For example, I remember reading a topic the other day where someone was discussing the importance of revision control, and using git. This is the type of stuff I am talking about. 

A small list or a single suggestion would be greatly appreciated.

About a lot of stuff.

He's got some kind of problem, I suppose. He's lied about random stuff such as being in a top 10 WoW guild or whatever. He's done this for as long as I can remember. Only recently has it gotten out of hand and potentially life-affecting.

Back in May or so, he said he was getting an internship with a very, very large/awesome tech company, whose offices are roughly 60 miles from his home. He told his wife this, after which he traded in his ~10 year old SUV for a brand new hybrid. After a month or so of this ""internship,"" ""the government pulled the project's funding"" and he lost the internship. He then popped back up at his previous job.

Months later, he gets in contact with a guy he ""met at the internship"" and gets a ""job"" with this other well-off tech company, making nearly six figures. He has a ""company phone"" shipped to his home, but after seeing it two or three times, I haven't seen it since.

This brings me to the last week or so. He's since gotten back into heavy online gaming, and he's lost his job where I know he's worked (as in, I've seen his badge, check stubs, etc). He's supposedly gotten a new job with a new company, but on the days he's saying he's working, my girlfriend and I have caught him playing certain online games.

I want to help him. I don't know how. Thoughts?

tl;dr: My brother quit his job, doesn't have a new one, and is telling everyone he does, while he sits at home playing video games all day. What do?"

I've been looking around at some of the other resumes floating around this subreddit and found that they mostly belong to people who have been in the industry for a while so when I'm having a hard time getting my resume in order.  I'm currently a junior in CS trying to apply for some summer internships and am really struggling with how to classify my programming experiences (ie which languages I've worked with on which OS's and on which IDE's).

So here is the relevant chunk as it stands now:



Special Skills
	Programming Languages
	Experience with: Java, C, C++, VB.Net, and ASP.Net
	
	Programming Environments
	Experience with: Eclipse, Visual Studio 2010 and Emacs 
	
	Operating Systems
	Experience with: Linux/Unix, Android and Windows Mobile 


I understand that the operating systems bullet may be sort of trivial but I wanted to convey that I've been doing things outside of class like trying some android apps and such.

Anyway, any tips on wording or formatting would be greatly appreciated. One final question though, should I be putting relevant courses on my resume as well?  For example I've taken Intro to Data Structures, Intro to AI, Intro to OS, and a number of other courses that could potentially look good on a resume so let me know what you think!

Again, thanks for reading / comments.

He is a loner and introvert and I have no one to talk to about what is going on in my life.  so its all building up.  mostly I feel like I am talking to a wall.

He just finished his BA in Criminal Justice, and also finished an internship for one of his local sheriff's departments. 

He has NEVER touched a drug in his life, and has NEVER drank alcohol until the day before his 21st birthday, and has only occasionally drank since then. He specifically mentioned that he never even tried alcohol before just so that he could strengthen his chances for employment. He had solid grades in his University, and has never stolen, bullied, etc. He is literally your perfect candidate. Not an asshole, not close minded, judgmental, etc. 

He recently had a polygram done for his sherrif's office and passed it flawlessly with the exception of one question. He had a bad (or negative?) reaction to ""Have you ever been attracted to a child"" or something along those lines. Basically, the polygram made him out to be a pervert or child stalker or something, which i can ASSURE you without even a shred of a doubt is simply **UNTRUE**!! He must have gotten nervous or **something**. I mean, people have failed polygrams before, right? It just boggles my mind that they basically rejected him for that. To my knowledge, they also had the polygraph results sent in to a third party for review instead of one of the local officers/person doing the polygraph. In fact, he even mentioned that either the officer doing the polygraph or one of the officers there (cannot remember which) told him not to worry about that negative reaction.

Now, he must also notify any future employer (police station) about these results..so who knows how that will affect him in the future.

Everyday on reddit i see stories about crooked cops, thieves, cops that use excessive force, abuse, etc etc. So many of these stories that it enrages me knowing that scum like them can get in and stay in even after blatantly breaking the rules while he was denied. 

I just wanted to share this story with Reddit since i literally could have never in a hundred years imagine this to be his outcome. 

edit: fixed some grammar
edit2: polygraph. sorry for the mistake. Furthermore, it's funny how so many people are so quick to assume that he must be a closet pedo so quickly. If that were the case, then why are polygraphs inadmissible in court? Oh, maybe because they can..you know....make errors? "

He is severely physically disabled, though mentally just fine. He basically can only move his face and his hand a tiny bit, which he uses to operate his computer. It seemed to go pretty well - some of our staff taught him about programming and I had some short chats with him. He's nice but very shy. During that time he had a pro caregiver with him all the time.
Now he's coming back for a longer internship, but without the caregiver so he can try gaining some independence. He's told us that as long as people are around to help him out if he needs something (such as scratching his head or moving his leg) that he can go without the caregiver (this is also a plus for his family financially).

Everyone in the office is happy to help. But we have no experience with this kind of thing. Personally, I think it will be as good for us as it will be for him and we're happy to have him. But I want to know what I can do to make his time with us as good as possible for everyone (I'm kind of the office manager). I mean, obviously I am going to talk to him and try to make him feel welcome, but not sure what else I need to be thinking of. All the really basic stuff like getting in the building and setting his computer up is already taken care of.

One thing I'm worried about is people tend to get really absorbed in their own work and wear headphones. I don't wear headphones but I can't be there every minute. It's a totally open plan office where we sit around big tables, so if he spoke up someone would probably take notice, but he can't even wave at us so I'm worried he'll need something and no one will notice him. Also, he's very quiet and shy so he's going to have to be a bit louder... I think it will be good for him to gain a little confidence speaking out as well. Should I just ask him to, like, email us if we're being oblivious?? Seems silly to email someone sitting right near you....

We are a medium sized business of about 110 people in two locations. We keep our servers current with patches and updates. 

Last year we started to have problems with our Exchange server at work and one of my projects as an Intern at my current job before I was hired as a temp was to upgrade our SMSME (Symantec Mail Security for Microsoft Exchange). 

Which went off without a hitch but 2 months after the upgrade we got a call from the United Nations Network Security saying they where getting DDOS'd from an IP on our network, turned out it was our second network card in our exchange box. We disabled the card and did a security audit on the server and found nothing suspicious on it but I still had a feeling something was wrong with it. It was back up and running, and my boss issued me a new task to work on. 

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, we move one of our warehouses back to the main production facility and over that weekend of setting up the computers and re-joining them to the domain the banwidth of our T1 takes off like a rocket maxing it out completely. We worked with our ISP and did some tests on our circuit to find that it was our system and nothing from the ISP we thought it was the load of the systems and servers from the warehouse. 

Nope we tracked it to our exchange box once again using TCPview found that it had multiple connections to an internal computer, and this morning when I logged in the local backup account we had created was logged in through a remote connection, at the time I thought it was my boss (who is on vacation at the moment) doing info store backup or something. A quick text to him and I found out that it wasn't him. 

So I locked down all but the local administrator account, and disabled the rest. 

**tl;dr** *Believe our exchange server was hacked and I'm asking what can I do to fix it while my boss is out of the country.*

So my questions are one, do/did we have a breach of security? (seems pretty obvious we did). Two what steps should we take to insure this doesn't happen again? Three what software do you run on your exchange boxes to prevent stuff like this from happening? Is the TCPview image below normal? The only things that run on this server is mail, exchange security and our blackberry enterprise. I realize that multiple connections to the store may be necessary but that many?

EDIT: Wow! I have never had a post blow up like this (I know, I know, obligatory front page edit hahah). Thank you to everyone who took the time to comment! 

Just to clear a couple things up: We are not located in the US, so many of the legal issues or help organizations mentioned don't really apply. There is a disability charity involved in getting money for his transport and supporting his work experience in various ways. The representative from there was present at the meeting where we discussed if he needed a full time caregive, and they seemed to support his independence. I will be looking into our insurance and liability, etc, but I just don't think the whole suing issue will come up as like I said we're not in the US.

His major needs like food and the bathroom will be taken care of by his family. The plan is for him to come in a couple hours in the morning, then have his dad come in and feed him lunch and take care of anything he needs, then he'll stay a couple more hours in the afternoon. So not full days. This is why I think what he's asking us to do is just little things like moving his leg.

Of course I asked him about these questions first and made sure he knew we're happy to help but it's up to him to communicate clearly with us. He can use a computer fairly well, and his voice works normally. He's just a young shy 16 year old kid trying his first job, so I think we'll need to ease his transition as much as possible.

The most common suggestion here is setting up IM/Skype for him in case he's not able to get our attention. We'll definitely do that. We have an open plan office with no wall or cubicles so I think he'll be able to reach us one way or another.

Lastly, no one will be forced to help him. People are saying it's not right to be obligated to help him int he workplace. We're a small forward thinking company with no hierarchy, bosses, set working hours or days - no one is forced to do anything here. So it's totally optional. However, luckily everyone at my work is very keen to help and no one is there to just do a job and go home.

Thanks again everyone! Sorry I couldn't reply to every comment... never expected so many. Hope I answered all your questions."

Hello Daily Show Team,

I really enjoy your programming, and I always look forward to watching a new episode and getting my Daily dose of news! However, I have a quick question: Why aren't you doing more pieces on the Occupy protests? I understand that there is substantially more humor in Black Walnut's sex scandals. I also know that it's a clusterfuck in the republican party at the moment, and that's like shooting fish in a barrel of comedic glory. Also, as New Yorkers you're probably sick to death of having your morning coffee run interrupted by Occupiers. 

However, there is history being made in these protests, just as there was history being made in the Tea Party protests. The difference has become that one was increasingly covered by the mainstream media, including the Daily Show, and has become a national  force, while the other--while just as large-- is being shunned by the news networks and is not being given the same chance at publicity. There is something huge happening in cities all around America, and as a viewer I would like to know why these people, who seem to be average, middle class Americans, are flocking to their streets day after day in what appears to be an increasingly unrecognized effort to change the status quo.

When former U.S. Marine Scott Olsen suffered a major head wound in the protests I figured the video of him laying injured on the ground while police kept his would-be-rescuers at bay with projectiles would be all over the Daily Show. Police firing on unarmed protesters, some of whom are ex-Military members, who are advocating a change in a corrupt system seemed like Daily Show gold. However, I was disappointed to see that your team did not have any stories about the protesters, instead focusing on stories like ""Hotdogs are 20% more likely to give you colon cancer, says wack-a-doodle group."" Not that your work is not funny, but in times like these it is disappointing to see your lack of interest in what has been the biggest liberal political movement in my lifetime. 

I suppose what I'm asking is that if you're going to talk the liberal ""we need a change in the system"" talk, Daily Show, you should walk the ""we need a change in the system"" walk. If you advocate a change, if you believe that money shouldn't be the only reason someone's opinion matters, and if you truly think that the financial situation in America today is something that desperately needs changing you should be at least giving coverage to the only people who are willing to sacrifice their time and energy to bring these issues to the center stage. 

I've watched several times as the Daily Show brought light to things that needed to be changed. I was extremely proud of my support of your show when I watched John Stewart and Steven Colbert take the stage at the Rally to Restore Sanity/ Fear (admittedly I watched from in between the porter potties, but I was still proud, even if it was a smelly pride). I was with you even more when you fought to bring attention to the injustices of the Nine Eleven First Responders. You proved that a ""fake news show"" had the power to not only bring attention to very important issues, but to directly effect the success or failure of their needs. Well, the American people need some attention brought to the OWS protesters. Even if you don't agree with their message it is still important to give people the information about the movement so they can make an informed choice over whether or not they to believe the protest to be valid. It seems odd to me that you've covered a group you're opposed to more than the movement who's views seem to line up with your own. It also seems odd to me that I'm appealing to a comedy show to bring me my news, but I suppose that's what kind of world I'm living in. In the end, my appeal is probably not going to be read,  but I like to thing that maybe, just maybe, this will end up in the hands of some intern who will pass it down the line, and I'll turn on my TV one night this week to seem some accurate, intelligent reporting on what the OWS protesters want, instead of a picture of a guy shitting on a cop car, with no other context about the protests. 

Thank you very much for your time, and, as always, I look forward to your next show!

After completing a major in music production, I applied for an internship at a local recording studio.  The interview setup was strange to begin with: The two studio owners told me to take a seat in the center of a medium sized room, and they sat about 15-20 feet away.  There were the usual niceties: The offer of water, the small talk, etc. Without warning, one of them produced a large bong, loaded a fat bud, and asked me to smoke it.  This was clearly a weed-friendly recording studio.

I got the job."

I want to take REG during the first week of January and need to start preparing (as I think REG will be most challenging for me). I was thinking I should just get the 2011 REG materials for now and wait until after my internship to get the others.  At that point if everything works out I will have passed REG and secured a full-time position.  That way I could hopefully get the REG materials reimbursed and the 2012 books for the remaining parts paid for by the firm.  Does this sound like a good plan? I know there is a discount for buying all 4 at the same time, but you need to use them within 12 months.  Doesn't make sense to me to buy all 4 books when I won't use 3 of them for over 4 months.  I know all the big 4 include Becker as a benefit when signing full-time, but has anyone had experience getting reimbursed for preparation they did before a full-time offer?"

He's good with computers, so he could easily use the station's to find out where the family was relocated.
Obviously this would lead to him being crazy and he would end up on Dexter's table saying something like ""I was only trying to help you.""

I am a full time intern at a high school (I am there every single day and know many students and have pretty good rapport with them) and will be a teacher there when I complete my certification.

A big part of my internship is substitute teaching.  Today I had to give out a test for the teacher, which I've done many times.  At the school cheating is taken VERY seriously and I let the students know ahead of time if I hear ONE word I will take their test away and they will get a zero (normally I'm pretty chill but tests are serious).

I made a rookie error on this next part, I admit it, just an FYI.  In order to give the students more time on the test I let them start it and then I took attendance while they were taking it.  As I was taking attendance and each student was calling out ""here"" I saw one student (sophomore) turn around in his seat (remember he already has the test) and start chatting with the guy directly behind him.

I say ""Herp!  Eyes forward, please... Herp!  Forward... thank you"" and when he turns back around he says, ""Sorry Mr. Derp, I was cheating.""  I then say, ""Are you serious... fine""  I didn't even let him respond.  I said it quick like that.  I walked over and took his test away.  He kept just saying ""are you serious?  are you serious?"" to me again and again.  I just replied ""yep, you can talk about it with Ms. Derpina tomorrow"" he continues, ""ok.... can I have my test back now?"" I said, ""nope, but you can start on the homework (I handed him the packet)""  He then says, ""I'm not doing this and I'm not staying here""  He gathered his things and walked out of the class.

Now, since he walked out of the class, I have no choice but to write a discipline report.

Do you think I overreacted?  The decision I made was a split second decision but this is why I made it: 1) He shouldn't have been talking in the first place and 2) He literally told me he was cheating.  Honestly when I told him to turn around and he just turned around and said nothing or said sorry or said ANYTHING ELSE I would not have taken the test away.  It was just because he said that he was cheating was the reason why I took it.

At this point, I figure by him telling me that he was cheating there are two possibilities.  He was being honest about cheating and was implying I am not in a position of authority, or he was just kidding around.  Either way, I think he was disrespectful.

What do you guys think?  I wasn't angry and I showed almost no emotion doing this.  It was very matter of fact."

It's been a while since I posted any updates on my building project. Sadly I'm not as far as I would like (I would like to be done!) But being a full time student with a part time job while hunting for a place to do an internship doesn't give me much time. 

To start off I had to clear out my messy game room to make room for me to put the furniture together. Here are a few pictures before and after I cleared the room out a bit. [Pic1](http://i.imgur.com/2RIrl.jpg), [Pic2](http://i.imgur.com/TSaTW.jpg), [Pic3](http://i.imgur.com/UgHhR.jpg).

The first shelves I built were the ones for my games. [Here is a picture once one was built](http://i.imgur.com/NEFnr.jpg) and [one once it was finished](http://i.imgur.com/Y0dzB.jpg)

I built those pretty much right after I got all my wood cut but then sadly I started getting busy and having to do other things. This weekend however I got back into it and build the two big units for my consoles and the box for my TV. [So here is where I'm at so far.](http://i.imgur.com/DODPM.jpg) And some closeups [Pic1](http://i.imgur.com/XMCVL.jpg), [Pic2](http://i.imgur.com/V4sO2.jpg),

Anyways that's it for now. My next post will be once I am done everything. I'm hoping it won't take more than one or two weeks but it just depends how heavy my work load is. If I don't have time in November I will definitely be done before Christmas! (though I really hope it doesn't take THAT long)

What upsets me the most is how this school has such control over us, how can they do this? I know it was a contract, but there MUST be something we can do, right??


Here's the part of the contract that states ways to be released from it:


1) Non-admission, withdrawal, dismissal or graduation from the University.


2) Serious medical or health problem which impedes Resident's ability to fulfill the terms of the Residence Hall Contract.


3) Marriage during the Contract term.


4) Affilitation with (said) University programs that are away from the campus, i.e. internships, practica.




*If resident is reinstated or re-enrolled after release for non-admission, withdrawal or dismissal during the term of this Contract, Resident agrees to fulfill the balance of the Contract.

Seeking advice from other students.,throwawaylowaway,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/m6l27/what_next_seeking_advice_from_other_students/,"Alright I'm a junior EE. A portion of my mind is already wanting to think of the possibilities that lie ahead post-grad. Right now, I've got a 3.77GPA and am participating in undergraduate research. I expect my GPA to go up before I graduate (even if you don't trust me, play along). Thus, by the time I graduate I will have a 3.8+GPA, four semesters of research experience, two internships, and about ~$5k in student loans. Have **not** taken the GRE yet.

I figure there are two main paths to go down right now: Continue education or enter work force. I sort of have an idea of what kind of jobs I could expect to receive, but part of me is seriously considering graduate school. Of course I will go to my professors for advice, but I also wanted to get some student input. Any advice on what kind of schools I could expect to get into? What kind of financial assistance there is for graduate students (I'll be on my lonesome again financially)? 

I know the institution I'm attending is pretty important, but I'm lame and don't want to give away the exact school. Some characteristics that may be relevant: Public university, member of AAU, EE program around for 100+ years. Not really sure what else.

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

I graduated in 2008 with a degree in Graphic Design in Atlanta. I worked as an unpaid, and then paid intern for 2 years at a magazine for 11 bucks an hour but only for a couple hours a week. I then found a full-time design job a a small company where I currently make 12.25 an hour. The company is family owned and they hold all the top positions so I know I will never really work my way up. I work along side someone who has worked here for 25+ years and someone who has something like 30+ years experience designing, yet we all do the same job. I don't see myself ""moving up"" anytime soon especially if these seasoned vets are doing exactly what I'm doing now.

However, the job is comfortable and easy, I listen to music all day long and can easily surf the internet pretty much whenever I want to. I can easily say I have 4 or 5 years of full-time designer experience now and I live in a city that has a lot of large company headquarters. Should I take the leap and try and find a job that offers me more? But at the risk of comfort and ""security"" of my current job? I'm terrified to take that jump with the market the way it is, and It took me 2 years after graduating college to actually get a full-time job. And my g/f and two of my closest friends were all laid-off last month from their jobs.

Has anyone else had expierience doing anything like this? I don't have many leads now but I want to ask what you guys think before I brush up my resume and start looking. I mostly just want to find something where I can possibly make more money.

(I know I'm probably already extremely lucky to have a job at all, but I definitely don't want to settle)

On the night of the All-Ireland final (GMT+8 here), I was in an Irish pub watching the match and got chatting to the guy standing beside me. Turned out he's from a town near my hometown and he knows my father and uncle. Crazy.

I just had this impulse just now on wanting to down a bunch of sleeping pills but the stash I had is gone now...Don't know what happened to them.


I'm a recent college grad and it's been really hard for me to get a job in my field of engineering. Almost 6 months now and despite my constant applying and showing 'assertiveness' by calling back, I've only gotten one interview which did not land me any kind of offer. 


Future plan fail: My parents constantly nag me about my future plans which I have been constantly working on. I'm still applying for jobs and I've applied to graduate schools (to ones that by some fluke I'll have a chance to get in due to low GPA and GRE scores). Though they KNOW this, they keep asking me if I've been applying, heard back from schools yet, etc...things to remind me of my failures and how useless I am. They add salt to the wound by asking about my schoolmates (same major); what they have been up to or if they have jobs. They all have good jobs, and some are in grad school as well. It constantly reminds me of how we all put in the same effort; we all applied for internships, studied together to get high grades, everything it took to be successful post-graduation. They got what they aimed for, I did not. Even a schoolmate that did worse than me in school got a good job (I'm genuinely happy for him but I'm just baffled that after all this time, I can't get a job. I had the mentality of 'if he can do it then I can,' I guess I'm just unlucky).


Social life fail: I've never had a girlfriend, and when I was young my parents never let me out, so I grew up having in-school friends. Things did get a bit better in college but my parents would always yell at me to put my time into studying if I ever went out more than once every two weeks.  I would argue with them to let me out, but whenever we got in a confrontation, they yell and say ""Just leave, I don't care about you anymore."" It makes me guilt-ridden because I know how much they've sacrificed to get to where we as a family are now, and how they want me to be safe from any danger...but it pisses me off that they won't give me any freedom to learn about it for myself and how to deal with it. I end up with the attitude of 'ok fine you don't want me to go anywhere I won't ever leave the house' (my mom has this stubborn personality) and spend the rest of the day/week not talking to them. I guess it also led to me not being very social...I end up very quiet no matter how well I know a person.

Makes me hate myself: My parents always point out my flaws--how overweight and inactive I am or how I don't know how to think for myself when I'm told to do a task. I believe that it's their fault- They always told me what to do and never let me out to do anything in worries that I'd hurt myself. I never thought about rebelling because of the respect I have for them. My dad came to US making a living for himself from scratch; dirt poor. I felt that I should obey my parents to make them happy, to let them know that throughout their troubles, it all paid off in the end to have such a close and loving family (which is very important to them). 

All of this has taken a big toll on me. I feel so moronic. I don't know anything outside of my family's routine...inexperienced about the world outside. I can't do shit and am completely useless; no friends, no job to help my family out, no ambitions, no real-world experience...nothing to look forward to in life no matter how hard I try...no hope. 
I tried to get out of this suicidal depression through help from some 'friends' but in the end they don't give a shit. I've spoken to a counselor about this at my university when I tried to seek help, but I just broke down and I hate that feeling so no therapist or anything for me...plus I can't afford it.

I just want to die...I mean, the only people that would care is my family, and honestly...as close as I am to them, just writing all this makes me realize how I'm so sick of it all. I'd happily switch the life of my own for a person that actually wants to live a life but cannot (cancer or something) but sadly I can't. So I'll finally be happy if I die not by my own hands but by some unlucky event, so my family will never know of how depressed I am. G'night to you all for now.

**TL;DR** Hoping to die soon."

Pertaining to the summer job I want to get, I also need some way of getting a car, although I am confident my parents for help in this matter, even though they are short on money as well. That being said, I am planning on using the remaining money to buy a stable, dependable desktop computer for use at home. 

Looking back at my childhood, I have come to the realization that my cousin repeatedly stuck my family with crappy built computers. The parts were cheap, the OS was pirated, and the gaming never felt satisfactory. I have decided to spend part of my loan money to build a desktop (it came out to about $600) that I will be content with. It is not close to anything fancy, but just closing in on acceptable modern technology in my opinion. 

The problem is, however, with the recent flooding in Thailand and its effects on the prices of Internal Hard Drives. I am now much deterred from purchasing a Hard Drive after the recent prices sky-rocketing. I am sort of conflicted now since I am hesitating, because at the same time I know that the prices will only go higher as suppliers run out of stock. I was wondering if anyone stockpiles these things; I've heard of people buying multiple 1 TB hard drives periodically as a habit. If anyone can spare a 500GB -1 TB, 7200 RPM, 3-6 SATA Hard Drive, I would most appreciatively pay for a generous price. Thanks! I hope this did not sound too greedy."

My friends who majored in things they were interested in, but didn't lead into large job markets (art history, anthropology) are unemployed.  So basically my question is if your are unemployed right now, what job do you wish you had, and why are you not the best candidate for the position?"

I'm doing well so I've been told, and have gotten a couple bonuses that were not across the board.  I'm fairly sure I'm in good standing, and I've recently applied for my CPA in my state after obtaining the necessary hours.

One of my friends works at a private online startup in California looking for an Account Manager, to manage A/P, maintain contractor programs and manage relationships with them.  The job is looking for 1+ years of experience in business, an analytical mind and strong communicator.  I'm fairly interested in this position, as I think I'd really enjoy working in a more laidback, casual atmosphere.  Additionally, I'd like to move at some point, California is somewhere I have been thinking about, and I've heard it's easier younger.

Basically, what should I consider, from those of you who have been in my position?  I really think this change would be great, but I'd love some advice/input.

I am currently deciding between two universities for engineering. One has a very good technical education with world-class labs. It has a very good co-op program and a small classroom size. Unfortunately, it does not have a very well-known name. On the other hand, is a very well known university. It does not have as many lab hours per semester and focuses on theory over practice, having more lectures. It does not have a co-op, only internship program that is not as good as the other schools co-op. I would most likely need to do side projects on my own in order to make up for the difference in practical knowledge at the more well-known school. I would like to hear r/engineeringstudents take. Is a program with more labs and a better co-op worth it? Can I not get the same experience with an internship and get the benefit of the better name?

Had some initial concerns that since she's going to study abroad for 6 mo. starting in January that maybe dating was a bad idea, but any amazing first month and a half more or less overcame those . . . turned out to be as compatible in bed as in every other respect, and had a great time together whenever we went out.

**Problem:** about a month ago, had a shit week and felt really angry with myself for stupid choices I've made as a student. Angry me is scary, somewhat, and I tried to shoo gf away, but of course she was concerned so we have a not-fight in which I mostly feel guilty for being a lousy bf and getting so angry with myself and try to apologize for the next week more than I really should have (would have been better to let it go). Next weekend gf has a almost equally bad day and I again end up feeling shitty for not making her feel better. We spend the next week apologizing more and in the end nearly have an argument because neither of us wants to say anything is the other person's fault (stupid, I know).

Ever since then she has gotten busier and busier and I can't help but feel that she is drifting away. There isn't any time for us to be together except the small holes in her 10am-10pm schedule, she's usually gone on the weekends for family or events or internship hunting. She no longer wants me to be around when she tries to do work after class is done because during the week when we couldn't stop apologizing she got fed up with me being there and hasn't changed her mind. Sex stopped. Once in the last three weeks, once the week before. Down from . . . well, anytime we were together, basically. Mostly because she's too tired, I think. 

She's keeping secrets, too. She went to the doctor last week and accidentally mentioned it to me. I asked if she was feeling alright and she said it turned out to be nothing, but ""nothing"" doesn't usually end up with a prescription that she didn't mean to mention either until she accidentally dropped the bottle from her purse when looking for her credit card a week later and admitted was from the doctor visit. Still don't know what it's for or if she's ok or not, she was evasive and I don't actually care what it is as long as she's fine - it's the evasion that worries me . . . 

There are whole topics she won't discuss; certain activities and groups she's a member of that she thinks I don't like or ideas that we'd fight over. She thinks I have a negative outlook on life and the future for myself personally and people generally (I'm a pragmatist, I admit, but not a gloom and doom sort) and I swear it's all from that week I felt shitty. **Basically I feel like she lost all but the absolute minimum level of trust in me - trust that I care and trust that she can talk to me; and like somehow I went from seeing her semi-daily six months ago to hours and hours a day when we started dating to 3-4 hours a week now - if I ""bother"" her. That's less time than she spends in certain classes or even at some group meetings in a week. I'm not part of her life, I just suddenly became filler.**

The irl friends I talked to have basically said that even if I'm crazy and overreacting like a boss about some of this stuff, she definitely has stopped interacting with not just me but everyone, and they can tell we aren't as happy anymore, the few times they've seen us together. Their advice - tell her the paragraph above this and list the things from 2 paragraphs up as evidence of weirdness and either she'll change or I go. Any other words of wisdom how to handle this mess reddit? Because I like this girl. A lot. I started to fall in the lower-case kind of love with her - I will fight for her attention if there's a chance I can win that fight. If there is."

I am starting my Senior year for a BS in Software Engineering.  Ever since I started my core classes, I have been dissatisfied with the education I was getting.  Staying patient and trusting the higher-education machine, I stuck through to where I am now.  Currently I am looking for an Internship to satisfy my degree, but come up with work that is hardly relevant. 

The corny: I am so very excited to get into the software development industry.  I feel as I progress to graduation, I become less prepared for this dream.  I feel I learned so much doing this stuff on my own since 14, and this curriculum has made me rusty.  I am very humble and just wish to be given a chance at an Internship that will sharpen me up.  Even better would be an employment opportunity.

A quick fix to satisfy my Internship is doing a couple web coding jobs for some business owners I know.  But it seems more of the same in going solo and not getting any experience in the development process.  I am humble in knowing that I have much to learn.  I am 29 years old and have made a living all across the US as a Gymnastics Coach and Sports Performance Trainer since graduating high school.  This isn't my first rodeo.  But this career switch is proving to be difficult.

In my emotionally charged state, I have made this plan: **decide to continue with my schooling or not, and whore myself out to anyone in the United States that is willing to give me a shot as an intern (figured I'd post it on Craigslist?).  I will offer up to 30 hours a week unpaid (so I can use 10 somewhere else to pay the bills) and will be there in a few days if something blows my skirt up.  Just me and my dog. Let me get my hands dirty and I will work my ass off.** 

I am a clean cut farm boy that enjoys skiing, surfing, bodybuilding, and rock n' roll.  Any advice or questions, have at it.

Fun fact: I once took a chainsaw to the face.

I've gotten offers to work, but none of them have been in field that I am remotely interested in. (Mostly call centers, sales, or customer service positions with high turnover rates) 

I went to my state's Employment Development Department (EDD) center A program offered in California that gets people back in school to give them more access to ""hard skills"", but they said that my resume was too privileged and turned me away from benefits that they normally extend to their ""average"" patron. Which I assume at this point to be high school dropouts or delinquents who have barely acquired a GED and want to get into cosmetology or truck driving school. 

I can't help but feel like I've fallen through the cracks with my potential and willingness to work hard but no real job prospects coming along my way. 

Rest assured, that during this time I haven't been letting myself get comfortable sitting on my hands while waiting for an oppurtinity to hit me on the head. I am actually proactive in either learning a programming languages or doing freelance work in my areas of interest which are IT, web and graphic design. I do this to build up my portfolio and also to hedge my bets on what future work prospects might require me to do.

If any recruiter is interested in inquiring more about me with a **legitimate** offer to work in a mid-entry level position, I will send you a link to my LinkedIn profile. However you must tell me about your company and the position requirement first so that I know you're not just blowing smoke. 

I am ALWAYS willing to put everything I have into my work, BUT I am not a paper pusher or coffee making intern. I have entirely too much creativity and talent to be wasting it on a low skilled OR underpaid position. 

I hope this is clear on what I am looking for. That being said, I am looking forward to being faced with many great new opportunities. Thank you for reading, I hope to hear from you soon!! "

My interests are in planetary astronomy &amp; optics, and right now I'm leaning towards programs (MS &amp; PhD) in imaging science and astronomical instrumentation. I graduated in spring 2011.

My cumulative GPA is 2.96 - I double majored in English (3.3 GPA) and Astrophysics (2.58 GPA). I blame my poor performance in Astro on two factors: double majoring (even though it took me 5 years) and working multiple jobs simultaneously throughout undergrad (the money had to come from somewhere...).


I've done some research:

* Thesis on CCD detectors for imaging (presented an 8-minute talk at my tiny college's campuswide science colloquium)
* Thesis in astronomy (presented a poster at same colloquium - same year, in fact.)
* Talk at Really Big Important Optics Conference's Symposium on Undergraduate Research (imaging)
* Poster on laser-based data transmission system (project in Optics class, presented at campus colloquium)
* mini-poster of visible light images created w/ remote telescope (very elementary telescope use exercise, presented at campus colloquium)
* Thesis in English lit  (I wrote about Nietzschean philosophy in Watchmen! This is totally irrelevant to my science, but I'm proud of it anyway and it proves that I can write.)
* Summer REU in astronomy (no publications resulted, unfortunately)
* Summer REU that turned into yearlong internship in optics &amp; imaging (this is where the FiO presentation came from)

I also worked for 2 years as a TA for intro astronomy lab classes and have a mile-long resume of science outreach work and activity coordination I've done. I'm still technically a student member of 2 professional societies in physics &amp; optics, but those memberships are about to lapse.

I'm confident that the 3 profs who advised my research projects will give strong letters of rec. 

I took the GRE &amp; PGRE last year, but came down with the flu, got HORRIBLE scores, and didn't think to cancel them. Obvs I will retake those tests.

SO, I need some advice. Should I be looking into taking remedial classes before I apply anywhere? If so, what should I take? Or is my research background strong enough to compensate for that (3 self-designed projects and 1 professional presentation on a professor's research). Should I apply for MS programs, PhD programs, or both? 

I'm 75% certain I know exactly what I want to do research in, and found the groups at 2 universities and a NASA center that collaborated on a project that absolutely fascinated me at FiO. Would it be in my interest to contact the researchers at those universities now, or next fall when I actually apply? What should I say besides, ""Your research is super neat, will you take me even though my grades stink?"""

Context: I have had a really rough semester. My beloved uncle died within the first week of school, I've had to go through a slew of unpleaseant medical tests on top of getting strep throat and a 2nd degree burn, I crushed hard on a guy who turned out to be nothing but bad news for me, and my financial aid got reduced by $3k and I don't have rent money for next month. I've had to drop my favorite class and I've been starting to wonder if I'll ever get my shit together and really make something of my life. I've been desperately needing me some good Autumn days to center myself but our indian summer lasted through all of October, and it leaves me feeling so off-kilter. I feel like I've had nothing but tough days for a long time now.

It almost seems like my bad luck was a by-product of that summer overstaying its welcome. As soon as the weather finally tipped into fall, things changed completely. 

Totally out of the blue, I got a phone call from the director of a research group that's doing *crazy cool*, state-of-the-art work in immunogenetics and donor matching. My resume had been kicking around their email servers for a while and she thought I'd be a good fit for a position in her lab. We talked for a while and everything clicked - I was quite literally exactly what she was looking for. I just went in for an interview today, and the more she talked about the work they're doing the more excited I got. Within a couple of hours she called me back and asked me if I'd come on board as an intern, to be upgraded to salaried employee once this project was done. This is literally the job I figured I'd start looking for *after* I finished my master's two years from now. I'm so beyond excited and completely shocked. (Of course, I said yes!)

I told a few people in my program about it, and by mid-day people I hadn't talked to in ages were coming by my office to congratulate me on my new position. People were commenting all over my facebook wall about it. It was unbelievable. I felt so on top of the world. I even promised my 40 algebra students music and donuts on Monday, I was so happy. (what have I *done*?!)

And just to add to all of that, I am in the midst of a beautiful blossoming romance with a wonderful ent who supports and dotes on me something fierce and cooks fresh veggies with me and makes me smile constantly. Hell, I was basking in twitterpation the moment I got the phone call.

I just feel so blessed right now. Life had been so rocky for so long, and I almost feel as if the universe put me through all that just so I could really appreciate it when things were really, really great. It's very deeply humbling.

Sisters, always remember that when you make room for blessings in your life, they have a funny way of showing up. I feel like I'm practically glowing with good vibes and I'm sending it your way, entwives. This toke's for you &lt;3

Edit: Thank you everyone for your kind words! I'm trying to focus on cruising on the ""I can do fucking ANYTHING"" feeling while bringing good energy to those around me, I'm glad I got to dish it out to you first!"
m79fg,0,2011-11-10,Sometimes it feels like I'm doing all the work and accommodation in my long distance relationship.,is_it_worth_it,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/m79fg/sometimes_it_feels_like_im_doing_all_the_work_and/,"(Wow, this ended up a lot longer than I expected, apologies.)

Me: 21, male, Chinese for background reasons (see below)

Her: 23, female. Vietnamese.

It's a long-distance relationship in almost the longest sense possible. I'm in America, and she's all the way around the world. We met each other during my study abroad. I fell in love with her instantly: she was cute, happy, and kind. I confessed to her, and she reciprocated. We were in love. I felt giddy. We kissed, I stayed over at her house, we did everything except have sex since she was a virgin and she didn't feel that she was ready.

We kept a long-distance relationship after I returned to America. I was an only child, and so my parents probably doted on me more so than your average parent. It was my first relationship but they are already seeing this as something with marriage potential, which of course, gave my girlfriend and I something to fret about because that meant we had to think about the future. We didn't want to think about the future particularly: probably because the future is so uncertain. We talked about the possibility of her moving to America, but it's in so vague terms that we both didn't believe in it. I don't even have U.S. citizenship yet, so before that can happen she has to be here on a visa if she wants to stay in America for the long term.

She will graduate from college soon, but she does not know her future upon graduation. My parents doesn't want me to leave them very far away at all: they are Chinese, and Chinese children are supposed to be fairly filial. Her parents probably think so as well, but I think they would have no problem with her coming to America.

We try to work through that. 

My parents, in the meantime, have already asked me about the pros and cons about being with the girl. They like the fact that she's nice and kind, but they don't like the fact that she once collapsed due to exhaustion combined with a heart problem (I think it's irregular/fast beating) that I may have to spend a ton of money treating her if we are ever married. They even threw a hypothetical that if we got married and she died when I was still relatively young. She was pretty sad and disappointed when she heard they had said that. 

She is stressed about the future and the prospects my parents and I make about coming to America. Because truthfully, I would prefer America to Vietnam as well. Mostly because of the job and green card thing.

We are 4 months into our relationship and 3 months into the long-distance relationship. We try to talk every single day, and Skype frequently (maybe a little bit every other day). But lately, she seems to be more stressed out and depressed. I told her that I would visit her in Japan (which is where she goes to university despite her family in Vietnam) during the winter if I found an internship before then to finance my travel, and she is somehow scared of the idea. Maybe it's because of the prospect and the pressure my parents place on her, I don't know.

A couple of days ago, she wanted to message each other less. I understand that it's the 3-month period of a long-distance relationship and have tried to actually talk more. But she said that it's the commitment of talking (maybe about the same things and fretting over the same things without conclusion) every single day that she doesn't find appealing. We actually just talked about it, and I've suggested giving her some space and time by herself, but she waffles on my question of what I could do so that we eventually talk more in the future.

Thirdly, she does not want intimate chats. I know that we did everything short of having sex while studying abroad, but for some reason she's against the idea. I feel that intimate and sexy talks make us like each other more and usually try to bring it up. Also, I'm sexually attracted to her, figures. But she doesn't want to.

What should I do? I still love her, and I know that she still loves me. But it seems like I'm the one doing all the accommodating in the relationship. From perhaps talking to being affectionate to comforting her to finding out what's on her mind. If we continue as I've suggested, giving her space and maybe talking to her less, would it be beneficial to the relationship from her perspective?

m78nk,17,2011-11-10,PA needs advice.,Probably_Unemployed,FilmIndustryLA,https://www.reddit.com/r/FilmIndustryLA/comments/m78nk/pa_needs_advice/,"So, I'm 22 years old and I've been out here in LA about 6 months, from New York.  I graduated college, but not from a fancy film school.  I have edited a high quality documentary which has won a ton of awards (accepted to Harlem Intl. Film Fest) and got its own segment on the CBS Early Show.  I wasn't the smartest kid in school, but I have a lot of common sense and a lot of knowledge of film.  I've done 2 internships which proved useless (when I'm the one showing my ""boss"" how to key out a green screen, it's safe to say I'm learning nothing), one of them didn't even know it was my last day at the internship; I assume they expected me to just stay forever.  Neither of them offered jobs.

I have 8 years of editing experience and 4 years of camera operation experience, professional cameras, DSLRs, crappy handhelds, etc.  I had my own television series in college with a zero dollar budget.

I work my ass off all the time whenever I can find work.  People wonder why I'm a PA and wonder why I haven't been asked to do something more meaningful.  I've done the whole work for free, build my network thing off of craigslist/mandy/entertainmentcareers/etc.  The only problem is that these people that I work for SAY they're going to call me back for more work or SAY that it'll be worth my time to work on their project.  Being the stupid, hopeful kid that I am, I continue to work on these projects and nothing has come of them.  In fact, in the 6 months I've been here and the 20-30 projects that I've worked on, only 1 person has called me back and it was for one job.  I'm really sick of these people.

People keep telling me ""Oh, you're only 22, you have plenty of time.""  I might only be 22, but I'm sure there are people who have the fancy film school degrees and have awesome film reels.  They're 5 steps ahead of me, how the hell am I supposed to compete with that?

No one in my family works in the industry, so that's out the window.  Any connections I've made have been meaningless.  No one seems to like to return my phone calls, emails or hand written letters, regardless of how many I've made.  I apply to internships and office PA jobs everyday and have yet to land anything.  The only words my father (an oral surgeon) has for me are, ""You do that everyday?  Man, that really sucks.""

Now, I realize it's only been 6 months, but it's just starting to feel hopeless.  That, and I'm sort of running out of money; minimum wage jobs aren't cutting it since I live by myself and don't really know anyone.  I've had my resume looked at by others and they say it looks great.  I have 7 professional references.

I'm not looking for sympathy.  I'm looking for advice.  What can I do to find more paying work?  To find more non-garbage work?  An office PA job?  Anything worth my while?  Any websites I don't know about?  I'm not here to fuck around with worthless short-films that will go nowhere or spec commercials.  No, I can't work deferred.  Does that IMDb credit pay my rent this month?  No?  I can't work for that either then.  My end-game is wide open (except editing) (edit: I say wide open because right now, I'll do anything that pays.  My ideal is to get into producing television / showrunning / UPM / any other synonymous terms). 

I don't want to have to give up and go into something boring like IT or programming. "

I come to you from a place of desperation. I have no idea what to do with my hair. [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/ON1Hp.jpg) what it looks like currently. It's too long for my tastes. If I don't shower in the morning I'm basically required to wear a hat until I do. I do take great care of my hair though (Paul Mitchell tea tree products, condition and shampoo every day) and it's always soft and quite thick. 

I'm going on Co-Op (paid internship through my school) soon, so I'm looking for something easy, yet professional. I'm also 19, so I think I outgrew the fauxhawk that I used to do when my hair was shorter. I usually don't have time in the morning to do more than shower and brush my hair, but I do have a basic grasp of styling. I've been told I look a lot like a lesbian at times, and while I'm fine with that, I think a slightly manlier haircut would help me get the guys.

I am currently a secondary certified history teacher that cannot find a job in the state of Alabama. On top of this, the education department at my college lost my portfolio which included sample student work from my internship, letters of recommendation, and sample lesson plans. All of this took me a while to compose in order to put together a nice looking portfolio/resume which I was relying on to get my foot in the door for my first ""real"" job. Most of the stuff in the portfolio was easy to replace, except for the letters of recommendation. I called the man who was the head of the education department while I was at the college to ask if he would mind rewriting my letter of recommendation. He responded by saying that he would not write a letter for me, but rather call the principals personally and recommend that they hire me. He then stated that if I was unlucky in the job hunt that he would be honored to hire me as a teacher in his school. This man had retired as head of the education department and moved to Georgia to take on the roll as principal at a public school in order to be closer to his family. I was ecstatic at the job offer because this man was one of my favorite professors and is a phenomenal leader. My only problem is, the school would require me to move about 8 hours away from my family and friends, not to mention my loving girl friend of 2 and a half years. 

So my question is, what should I do? Should I stay closer to home with my family and loved ones, play it safe and hope for the best, or should I say to hell with it, move away, and start over at a job in a place I have never been to at a school that I have no idea what to expect at. 

Personal:  I would like to add that I have had some personal problems lately (i.e. best friend getting deployed in a a short little bit to Afghanistan and questioning my faith to some level). I believe that moving away would be a great realization to me and would give me some time think and straighten my life out, but at the same time, I would have to sacrifice my girl friend, who I would not be able to stay with if I moved away, and time with my family, who I am very close to and love dearly (Dad with severe diabetes, 2 nephews, and 3 nieces, all of which I love very much).

TL;DR:  Should I move 8 hours away and leave everyone behind for a while to have some alone time and think for myself while pursuing a new job opportunity, or should I play it safe, stay home, and spend time with family and loved ones??"

My roommate Dan wants to eat edibles with my other ent roommate and I. But, here's the catch: he has just gotten an internship for a company and they are making him do a pre-employment drug test. Now, he hasn't done edibles with us in about 50 days because he was applying for this internship and he is still weary about doing THIS drug test even after 50 days. I've tried to calm his fears to no avail and I was actually very excited to hear that he had gotten this internship.

So, after I heard that he was taking his drug test this Friday, I suggested that he do edibles again. Basically, when all of us get high we will listen to music and just have an enjoyable time. However, he is afraid that he will be continually drug tested throughout this internship (it is only a summer internship) so he is unsure about doing edibles with us again. I just want to enjoy a good time with my friends and I know that Dan enjoys it as well, so is there anyway I can help calm his fears? Anybody go through a similar situation?

My CS classes are all in C++ and all I have gotten down so far is basic data structures and some linux programming but I know the language really well. The linux programming experience I had was just a shell program that needed to fork and thats it. I started programming last year, did not have any experience prior. I am pretty good at C++ if I know what it is I am programming.

I do not want to graduate and not get a job right away. What are some things I can do, other than learn another language, that I can do to be a better C++ programmer?

I have been doing a lot of research, I was looking into SDL, QT, GTK+, and the Boost and STL libraries. I was also reading up on a tutorial I found on this website about sockets, think it was called Beej's guide to sockets. And on top of that, I was getting some of my friends together to implement a pokemon game using SDL in C++.

Anyways, I made a github account and began to browse some C++ programs source code, looked at the bitcoin one and a mmorpg game server engine and I realized I do not have the skill to construct programs like those. I honestly would not know where to begin.

So I ask, when you were starting out what did you do? What would you recommend I do now? What is something every C++ programmer should know and be able to do?

Also, I tried searching for this but could not find anything on it, what book, if any, should I read to teach me the process of developing software like the bitcoin one? For example, how to lay everything out (source code wise), how it should be distributed etc.

So far, I have been reading effective c++ by Scott Meyers., and I have been networking, I talk to my professors all the time, know some on a personal basis but no luck with internships or whatever an I am a great public speaker from what I have heard and I'm super social. I guess you guys are all right, I should get started on my project were we emulate a Pokemon game. Thing is we don't know where to start. Especially if it was to emulate google docs or something. Because again software construction, especially with multiple developers, could use a crash course in that."

Any advice from you guys in industry, or students who have had internships before, on how to land an internship would be greatly appreciated by me and many others I'm sure!
Advice like: what technical skills employers want to see, what software I should know how to use, and anything else you deem important. Thanks!

Edit 1: I'm a 4th year (Junior status) Mechanical Engineering major, and I'm not to picky about what I field I would like to go into, but robotics seems very interesting as well as automotive design."
m953h,5,2011-11-11,Big speeding ticket. My dumb fault. What should I do?,instantresponse,Denver,https://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/m953h/big_speeding_ticket_my_dumb_fault_what_should_i_do/,"Howdy - I was in westbound traffic through the Eisenhower tunnel today, and when I finally got free of the stop and go, I didn't even look down at my speedometer as the grade steepened. By the time I could check myself, the cop clocked me rolling at 89 in a 60. I was summoned to Breckenridge courthouse at the beginning of January. I can pay a fine (the cop estimated that if I just went and plead guilty and said nothing, it'd be about $300). I'm totally capable of paying that, but I'm wondering what I could do to reduce the 'point' reduction on my license. My father graciously pays my insurance, and I'd rather pay more and limit the point reduction to keep my premiums down.

Knowing that I'll definitely show up to court (I got a summons, not a ticket) - what should I do/say? The cop was very nice and polite, and we talked about how I'm new to the area and the steep changes in roads (I'm from the upper midwest - flat as all hell). I just started driving out to the mountains from Denver in the past few weeks for an internship.

Anyway, I'm contacting a lawyer friend from back home for advice, but I'm wondering if you kindly locals knew what type of punishment I could realistically face (and how to minimize it)?"

She just got an internship across the country and I still had to finish up my last semester (3 weeks to go WOOOOOO) as a BSEE. Ive spent the last year and a half networking with people from Texas Instruments to try and land my dream job.  
  
All of that finally paid off today, I was flown out to Dallas to interview last week and got a call at 9:45 this morning saying I had landed the job as well as going over the offer. It will be a short and relatively cheap plane flight away from my love, and will shave about 11 hours off the driving trip. The job pays very well to the point where it will be a non-issue to fly out to see her or have her fly in to see me monthly at the least. It will still be nearly a year before we can move in together but my future is no longer nebulous and scary but rather exactly what I had wanted. It has been a long tough road to get this far but all of my hard work is paying off and I cannot wait to see what else the future holds.  
  
Also she is flying in for thanksgiving next week so I will get to see and celebrate with her very very soon, after months of work and stress I still cant fathom everything working out as well as it has. Thank you so much for your support, I will still be here for awhile but the distance just got so much shorter, and the time apart so much more bearable. This is the best day I have had in a very long time. I know many of you have much more difficult situations than even our worst case could have been and I hope everything works out for you and yours."

Currently I am only a contractor but I am hoping that my dedication and skill will lead to an employee position with full benefits. I used to lurk this subreddit obsessively last year so I want to give back.

When I first saw the posting that MLG was looking for interns, I sent in my resume with a bold cover letter because, to be perfectly honest, I didn't expect to hear back at all. I have sent nearly half a hundred resumes just for internships and did not hear a word back from any of them.

Well, they called me back. I was barely able to speak, but even if I was it wouldn't have helped since I was shopping at the time and surrounded by noise. They said they'd call me back on Monday.

I heard nothing back on Monday. My anxiety eventually turned into anger and frustration. Yet another pipe dream flushed down the toilet. My girlfriend suggested that I follow up with another e-mail or try to call the office.

""I know what it's like on Mondays,"" she said, ""It's nothing personal. Sometimes it's just hard to keep track of everything and you forget.""

By the Tuesday of the following week, I got the internship. At the end of my internship, I got an interview with the editorial team. I was supposed to hear something back by next Thursday.

Again, Thursday came and went. Again my girlfriend pushed me to keep trying, to hound the editorial team and the Editor in Chief. After nearly a month of back and forth contact, I am starting my first day as a full-time contractor this coming Monday. It is not exactly what I wanted but I am extremely grateful, and if this process has taught me anything, it's to not give up.

Guys, it's really, really, really hard out there. I am so incredibly grateful to be given this opportunity to work in an industry I am extremely passionate about. I look back on my long period of working dead-end part-time jobs and being unemployed as a blessing now. There is an overwhelming desire in my heart to give intelligent, driven people good jobs. It has taught me how important it is to invest in people, not profit margins.

I know what it's like. I've been there, but please don't ever give up. Don't think things are hopeless. Good things will happen, I promise you. In a few months, I hope to be transitioned into the Content Editor position. If I do and our editorial team is hiring, I promise I will be checking this subreddit for candidates. I promise to be quick, professional and honest with my replies and follow-ups.

I urge all of you to keep that mindset. You know what it's to agonize over when you're getting a call back or fear if you're being led on. In the future when you are employed, it means you will be that much more understanding and loving to those who will be in your position now.

Don't give up. You can make it."

A friend of mine was working at an internship this semester and the company revoked the offer, immediately firing her because she went to Penn State. Other people have said they accepted full time job offers only to have them revoked. It is unclear whether they are related to the Sandusky case or the rioting, but some have given direct reasons of the students currently attending Penn State.

As a graduating senior, this is terrifying. Not only do we have to fight to find jobs, now we have to overcome our school's controversy. Best of luck to everyone."

A friend with similar qualifications who is in CE with me had an internship at Qualcomm as a sophomore and was paid $25/hour + housing.

So, Reddit, did you intern at one of these places or a similar tech company? Do you work at a tech company? How much were/are you paid? Were housing and other expenses covered? Did you enjoy your internship?

How much were you paid at various tech companies as interns (or as ""real"" employees)?"

We've always got along really well and been really close for the entire time of our friendship;however, we were both in serious longterm relationships for the first 1.5 years for me and 2 years for her. So our friendship was platonic and we we're both friends with each other's exes. 

Earlier this year my relationship ended and it was messy and I spent some time getting over it. Also I'm in college and spent the Summer away from my friends for an internship. While I was gone for the Summer my friend broke up with her boyfriend. When I came back we both started hanging out a lot and became even closer. We avoided doing anything together for a long time because we both really treasured each other's friendship, but finally we couldn't stop and started basically dating. 

Things were going really well. We really liked each other and loved spending time together. It seemed very natural and didn't seem awkward even though we had been friends for so long. That ended up being the problem we fell for each other really fast and even though it had been a while since the end of my relationship it had been less for her. Even though she mentioned that she was worried about going from one serious relationship into another one but it was too hard for us to not see each other.

About a week ago she got really afraid that she was just going to let that doubt grow and end up resenting me. So she said that she thought it would be a good idea for us to tone things back for a while. She basically was saying that there was not enough time in between me and her last boyfriend and she thinks she needs to wait some time before she can start another relationship.

So basically we're back to being friends for now. We still see each other definitely less than before and we're not hooking up anymore. She says she wants to not be with anyone for a while and settle down and then when she's comfortable be with me completely without having to worry about it being too soon.

I really care about her and I am definitely not ready to move on and I don't want to. We we're working really well and we didn't stop seeing each other because it was incompatible but because of circumstances. Also I know this isn't some excuse for her to see other guys or w/e (which I know is going to be reddit's first response lol). I'm smarter than to let myself wait for that. She was very sincere and had been honest with me the whole time and truly seems like she just wants circumstances to be right. 

What should I do to help her get clarity about us while still not losing my connection to her? Do any other redditors think this will just be a short term thing before she realizes that the timing isn't something she can control. Or am I being naive waiting?

[for those of you who like to watch documentaries, here's a new documentary on the school available to watch in full for free on imdb.com](http://www.imdb.com/video/wab/vi947100953/)

this is basically a highschool for refugee teenage girls.  the girls are from very diverse backgrounds and countries.  it's set up a bit like a montessori school (in the loose sense) that students have some freedom regarding their goals.  sometimes they want to get GEDs. sometimes they want to go on to regular american highschools. sometimes they want to get GEDs and go to college, too.

i had to share with 2x, because i'm so sad that my internship is about to end.  it was such a life changing experience for me, and i wish that more schools like this existed.  the girls are fantastic and seem to love the learning environment.  ask me any questions about the school if you have any.

m9w7x,0,2011-11-12,could anyone please spell-check my cover letter ?,roudizz,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/m9w7x/could_anyone_please_spellcheck_my_cover_letter/,"Hi,
Since I dont speak english as a native, I'd like to get some feedback on my spelling/phrasing/wording/anything you can say on this:

Dear Sir/Madam:

Please accept this letter as an expression of my interest in an internship within your organization.

I am a fourth-year student at The Derp School of mechanical and industrial engineering, from which I expect to graduate with a Master’s degree in Mechanical and Industrial engineering in June 2013.

I would like to join an engineering team where I could bring my skills and be able to complete a project of value to your organization, to learn first hand about your company’s culture, and to give you a chance to evaluate my capabilities as a potential full time employee after I graduate.

Although my engineering experience is not extensive, I have completed two internships (as you will see in my resume) during which I gained hands-on experience especially in mechanical design, manufacturing, fluid mechanics and hydraulic pumps.

Practicing soaring for the last 2 years (as a licensed glider pilot) has allowed me to hone strong rigor and communication skills, completed with leadership and organization skills acquired via various scouting projects and through living as the eldest of five children.

I believe that you may be interested by my skills and qualities, and I stand ready to answer any of your questions or be interviewed.

Thank you for your consideration. 

Yours sincerely."

m9o5s,0,2011-11-12,This season is so lazy. [Spoilers],[deleted],Dexter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/m9o5s/this_season_is_so_lazy_spoilers/,"It's been totally obvious that Geller is Harry to Travis (or more accurately, Travis' Tyler Durden), as in he is probably dead and a figment of Travis' imagination. Notice how no one (the victims, people in public, etc.) ever have any interaction with Geller whatsoever, or even acknowledge that he's there? The reason no one's seen him in 3 years is because he's already dead. This whole season has been really lazy and is really progressing into the same kind of rut that 24 fell into after about season 5...and by that I mean the plot devices are just becoming more and more farfetched and require so much more suspension of disbelief than is reasonable. I can just see the writers now: 

""Wait, what if the villain had a Harry-like figure making him do bad things? LIKE DEXTER?"" 

""Hey, let's make the hand sold on the internet subplot go away by having the computer whiz intern delete all evidence of the transaction from the internet like magic because he's a nerd and therefore has super e-bay hacking powers! The audience will buy that!""

""Hey, you know the high-point of this season, Mos Def? Let's kill off his character! The ridiculous rom-dram Miami Metro subplots that we've been reusing for all 6 seasons so far can pick up the slack, right?!?"" I mean really, does ANYONE remotely give a fuck about Deb and Quinn's relationship? Also, why the hell does this show ALWAYS kill off or get rid of every interesting new secondary character (Lundy, Doakes, Brother Sam, Lumen, etc.)? WHY?

""Hey, let's have Dexter take the totally fucking obvious cut-out Bible numbers and page he took from Travis' house back to the lab to run tests to see if they match up because that will be so dramatic!"" Yeah, the world's premier crime scene wizard needed to freaking line up the cut out page numbers with the rectangle missing in the Bible page in order to figure that out for sure. Pleeeeaase. 

""Newspapers totally call out individuals for being de facto serial killers before the police do, right? And run front page stories with their picture (Geller) accusing them of it?"" Oh wait, they don't because that's unethical journalism that no big-time editor would ever allow. That scene was retarded. 

""Oh shit, we're only halfway through the season and Dexter already knows who the Doomsday Killer(s) is/are, and the season feels like it should be about 2 or 3 episodes away from ending because of it. Let's bring back Dexter's brother and the Trinity killings to conveniently distract Dexter with a moral dilemma for a few episodes before he inevitably comes back and saves the day!""

So. fucking. lazy. Oh, and apparently Travis the art history major who works at an art history museum gluing old books back together has the same advanced engineering skills and sadistic imagination of Jigsaw from the Saw movies, what with that ridiculous angel of death contraption and all. Are you kidding me?"
m9mta,8,2011-11-12,"Dear r/rapecounseling, I am planning to file suit against my rapist. I want your input and advice!",[deleted],rapecounseling,https://www.reddit.com/r/rapecounseling/comments/m9mta/dear_rrapecounseling_i_am_planning_to_file_suit/,"Hi, and thanks for taking the time to look at my post.

I'm a 17-year-old male living in Washington state. This summer, I was a camper and unpaid intern at YMCA Camp Orkila on Orcas Island. During my time in August as an intern, I was raped at night in an open-air cabin by a paid staff member of the camp; a cabin counselor. It was an absolutely horrific experience, and it was made much worse by the fact that there were more than a dozen sleeping children around age 11 within eyesight and earshot of us, which prevented me from screaming or calling for help. I mean, I could've, but... I couldn't allow myself to make that memory a part of their lives.

I avoided contact with him the following morning, and as soon as possible, I told my supervisor. She went to her supervisor. The San Juan County Sheriff police were called. They collected testimony from both of us, and interviewed the children in the cabin. Thankfully, none of them awoke in the night. I was taken to a local clinic for a medical examination, and there was no evidence found on me (penetration was with fingers...) besides a highly-visible hickey on my neck. In my testimony, I said that I had said ""no"" (I had), but that most of it had been coercion and fear of falling out of the bunk if I had resisted (it was ~8 feet off the ground) and waking the children. The guy in question testified that it was consensual.

We were both fired by the camp. No charges were filed by the county prosecutor's office (amazing to me, and not in a good way). I have tried a few times to get in touch with the camp; they blow me off, likely at the advice of their legal team. I have gone to Camp Orkila for 5 years, and their cold shoulder caught me off guard. My fellow interns (a little over 40 of them) now speculate that what I did was consensual, and I don't want to tell them the whole story. I'm disgusted with them.

I can count the hours that I knew this man on the fingers of my hands. What he did to me was opportunistic and disgusting, and it leads me to believe that I am not his only victim. When he applies for work in the future, he will not have to acknowledge any charges indicating him to be the horrible individual he is.

I feel many emotions about this, and it's difficult for me to articulate them entirely. Anger towards him, for raping me. Anger towards the camp, for allowing a situation to exist in which it was so easy for me to be raped. Angry at the fact that he escaped scrutiny; when I got back home and saw him on Facebook (suggested friends, oh joy!) he had told his friends that he ""got hurt at camp"" and had to come back early. Angry that I probably won't be his last victim if I don't stop him. Many other feelings.

3 months later, I'm ready to seek justice. I sent my letter to the SJCS office at Friday Harbor to request a copy of my case file. I haven't seen its' contents, but I'm confident that there will be sufficient information to level charges against the camp and him, separately. I'm going to be talking to a prominent Seattle-area sexual abuse lawyer about where I can go from here once I get the case file.

All that said, whatever advice or input you can spare would be greatly appreciated. What should I know about the legal system in my situation? Is it likely that I won't find justice? Should I tell the school that my rapist goes to? (He goes to UW... I'm applying there, because I want to go...)

Again, much thanks. You're all awesome for being here."

m9dd9,0,2011-11-11,[Spoilers] My theory on the interns,[deleted],Dexter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/m9dd9/spoilers_my_theory_on_the_interns/,"Masuka's current intern is making a game about the ice truck killer. They figured out he was related to Dexter and have been 'infiltrating' the department in order to learn things about the ice truck killer's brother's daily life as well as steal stuff related to the ice truck killer.


Or another way I think it could play out:

The interns are making a game about homicide in general and are currently investigating the ice truck killer. 

Jonah kills his family and Dexter goes to kill him. The interns also end up going hoping to get an interview with the victim of one of the most famous serial killers ever. They end up catching Dexter in the act of killing Jonah and, instead of turning him, try learning more about him to use as a twist in their game. Dexter finds out and kills them too. 

Travis ends up turning away from his hallucinated Gellar and the murders stop. Knowing that the police will never find Travis, Dexter is faced with a choice of killing Travis or forgiving him. 

To a hallucinated Rudy's dismay, Dexter chooses to forgive Travis. They then show a brightly colored scene with the song [Astor's Birthday Party](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSsOnShqhw4) playing in the background and Dexter's inner monologue reflecting on the events in the series. The season ends."

Seriously if you dont like a candidate then do what you do with every other candidate, express your opinion (which is all you do instead of report on the news). Now I already dont watch your news, I cant stand it, you are a disgrace to America and in the future when people document this time they will use you as a prime example of manipulating the public for your self interests. Stop. What you are doing is wrong. How can you not see that? Criminalizing the Occupy movement? Those people are dying out there... for everyones rights... including yours... how can you be so cruel... and to top it all off, a man who is running for Republican nominee who is the only candidate with any sense of morality, justice, and true American/Republican values, is having to be given a handicap by you just because you dont want him as president. You are unfair to him in the amount of time you give him and how you blatantly ignore his successes, when he wins the republican  nominee you wil be sorry, you will look dumb and childish (which a majority of the population already thinks about you). Honestly how do you live with yourselves, if this many people are against so much of what you do, shouldn't you reconsider? Oh wait, thats what rational, good at heart, real people do. You are not this. You are scum. I hope one day I will see you pained by the guilt that should be there. 

Now I dont expect this to be read, I know this is probably some intern reading this so you big honchos can keep plotting more ways to make Ron Paul look as bad, or not be seen, as much as possible. Well at least you are not the only ones to blame, hell the debate last night gave Ron Paul 90 seconds out of the 3600 seconds total. Thats a fraction of everyone else's, what is the reasoning behind all of this? It cant be a coincidence that all of you media hosts, newspapers, the hosts for the debate, and even high up officials are ignoring him. I dont see what you have to be afraid of, just stop it, change your agenda to just PRESENTING THE FUCKING NEWS, you know, what should be expected of you, its not hard. So intern now that my rant is over and you can go back to bringing these fuckwads coffee and hope that this leads you to a good career, did you learn anything from this? No, because you are just as bad, you may not be doing these acts of injustice, but you are watching them from the sidelines not doing anything about it, and to me that is just as bad for all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing. 

If you want to do something that will help but keep you safe little intern, piss in their coffee, rub their dounuts in your butt crack. Gather as much proof as possible, then leave and report it, write a book, go to another news orginization and help them report it and most likely get a way better job their. BAM! Now you are famous, you have a better job (most likely with intern working for you) and I wont call you scum of the earth. WIN! 

OK. I am done. Fuck off Fox News. My only aspiration in life is to see the day you die"

I am currently a Junior in undergrad majoring in biology and minoring in anthropology. I want to go to graduate school for physical anthropology. My ideal career would be studying the human evolution using comparative anatomy - essentially digging up bones and studying the evolutionary pathway. 

I have been wondering lately if I should continue my undergrad the way I'm currently doing so, or if I should switch to minoring in biology and majoring in sociology with a concentration in anthropology (we don't have just an anthro major). I am doing decently (I have a 3.0) right now, but I know that I can do better GPA wise if I switch to majoring in sociology/anthro. However, I don't want to be under prepared for the biology aspect of graduate school, and I've also gone through taking courses like organic chemistry and physics, which are not necessary to the bio minor and are GPA killers. 

Does anyone have any advice? I'm at the point where I can switch majors now and not have to worry about staying in school for an extra semester. I just want to do whatever will give me a higher chance for getting into graduate school. I know GPA isn't the only requirement (I am doing some field work this winter break in Belize, and I'm also going to try to get an internship with the Smithsonian Institute this summer), but I can't figure out if it would look better if I have a lower GPA with much harder classes, or a higher GPA with classes that don't necessarily relate to the field I'm going into.

Thanks for your help!"
mausi,6,2011-11-13,"Need advice after breakup. She cheated, but we're still in love.",helpmeout_throwaway,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/mausi/need_advice_after_breakup_she_cheated_but_were/,"It has been about 1.5 months since I (22m) broke up with my girlfriend (21) of over two years. We were perfect for each other. We have the same interests and humor, we like the same music and movies, etc. She was my best friend and I was hers. I loved her more than my family. I thought she was the one for me. We even talked about marriage often. I thought I would marry her. So, here’s what happened...

This probably started about 7 months ago, right before spring break. We are both in college. She was a junior and I was a senior, in my last semester. We are poor college students and both decide to spend the break at home. Out of no where on the second day, she breaks up with me over the phone. She didn’t intend to tell me over the phone, but I knew something was up and prodded her to tell me. This was a huge blow to me, because I didn’t think anything was wrong and we were both in love with each other. But in reality, I hadn’t been taking the relationship serious at that point. She had been asking what I thought of our future. I had been ignoring these questions (dumb by me). She also said that she wanted to be independent and grow in her early 20s. And that she didn’t want to hinder her career path by being in a relationship that she thought I wasn’t serious about. But she said that she still loved me. Over the break I thought a lot and realized that I had been foolish in neglecting to think about the future of our relationship. I had been treating this very serious relationship as if nothing was going to come from it. I realized how much I was in love with this woman and how great of a friendship I was loosing. And that I wanted to marry this girl. After the break, we talked and I found out she felt the same. She said she saw us getting back together later in life and that I was the one, but that she needed to be independent at the moment. By the way, I’m taking this horribly at the time (no appetite, trouble sleeping/concentrating on school). We hang out often over the next couple weeks, even have sex a couple of times. Around the 3rd week, she tells me she had sex with a guy (her “friend”) from her hometown. I was pretty upset over this and thought everything was over with us. But, she told me it was a huge mistake and regretted everything. A week later she wants to get back together. Another week later, I take her back. I also obviously tell her I don’t want her to hang out with the “friend” again. She agrees. Everything is wonderful again. Months pass and our relationship is better than ever.

She goes to spend a couple summer months in DC for an internship. We had a LDR the previous summer for my internship, so no big deal. School starts again. She is starting her senior year and I’m beginning graduate school at the same college. We celebrate our 2 year anniversary and things seem wonderful. A few months pass and we start to have the occasional argument, usually after we have had some drinks. One of these times, I am especially drunk and blackout. From what she tells me, I verbally abused her and tried to swing at her (all in front of a few of her friends). I remember nothing. This is so unlike my character and I am appalled at myself. I apologize many times and express my utter remorse. She says she wants space, but after a couple days she says she can't be distant from me. Things go back to normal, but start to get a little rocky.

The following weekend, I stay in to study and she goes out to the bars. I pick her up. She’s more drunk than I have ever seen her. I put her to bed at my house and then her phone lights up with a text. I normally respect her privacy, but it was from a guy that I had been suspicious of for most of our relationship. They had briefly dated before us and had remained good friends. They hang out often when she is home, usually in a group setting (he’s part of her group of ‘home’ friends). I know the guy has tried to do stuff with her, but I trust her so I’m cool with them hanging out. Anyway, I read the conversation...they are talking about wanting to fuck and she asks him how to break up with me. I can’t believe it. I ask her about it in the morning. She says she doesn’t remember sending it and is extremely apologetic. I try to justify the texts as a drunken mistake like i had made the previous weekend. Things are very shaky at this point but I think we can still work it out.

Next is when the shit hits the fan. The following weekend she confesses she had sex with the guy from the texts when she got home from DC over the summer. She also tells me that she lied about the identity of the guy she slept with over our break up and that it was the same guy. The same suspicious guy that I was okay with her hanging out with because I didn't think she had slept with him but one of his friends. So she had been lying to me for 6 months and was also hiding that she cheated on me for 2 months. I was in shock, I never dreamed she could do this. I broke up with her.

I was not only losing my love but my companion in life, my best friend. I told her we shouldn't talk because I didn’t know how I could get over her otherwise. I deleted facebook and removed everything of her memory out of my life. I’m getting along okay now. I’m just trying to immerse myself in school to occupy my mind. But she is ALWAYS on it. I miss her so much. I am definitely still in love with her. We had coffee a couple weeks ago and that has been our only conversation. She says it has been very hard for her. She says she doesn’t know herself anymore. She’s not focusing in school and is going out drinking often. She says she is still very much in love with me and misses me a lot.

Looking at this logically, I’m trying to transfer to another grad school (the original plan was for her to come with me when she graduates) and she is applying for jobs all over the country. Trying to rebuild this relationship when we’ll probably have a giant LDR soon doesn’t look promising. Last week, we had a text conversation, mostly just BS but then our relationship was inevitably brought up. She wants to meet up sometime soon to talk about us. I told her we should. We are clearly both still very much in love with each other. But we’ve both made some big mistakes and we have crossroads and opportunities that will probably be dividing our lives soon.

People of reddit, have you experienced a similar situation? What should I do? I don’t see us getting back together anytime soon. But can we get back together? Can we still be friends? If not, how can I get her off my mind?

tl;dr: I broke up w/ my GF of 2 yrs (she cheated on me). She was my bestfriend, soulmate, etc. We are still in love with each other. We want to meet up to talk about our relationship. What do I do?"

OK, about 1 year ago my father got a job working abroad this didn't phase me much at the time i'd think we would talk most days and Skype eathother regularly. now a 3 months from his moving away the depression and sadness has kicked in, ive started to realize how much we don't talk because of the place we works with little to no internet connection and how much i relied on him in my life; i went to him whatever my problem was, he was the person who did everything for me, i had sporting events around the country (UK) which he drove me to even if a lift was offered, we would stand by me and take away the nervousness in my head.
 Not only that but i have 2 other brothers 1 of which make poor decisions around the house and stresses out my mother which intern makes me stressed out and remember all the bad things.
 And to top things off the girl who i have liked for a long time now, the girl i have just recently started going out with is having second thoughts about our relationship and i don't think i can take much more.
 I haven't seen a doctor, GP or school nurse about this problem the only person i have told is my girlfriend. i am having thoughts on suicide and have planned to kill myself on a few occasions in the last 2 weeks but never had the balls to fully commit.

The only catch is that I will have to take a hair test in order to keep the offer. I read through all of the legal documents that they sent and it says that my test will be ""within 2 months of employment"" which I take to mean sometime between March 20th and May 20th. This means I have approximately 4 months to prepare for this test. Everything I have read says after 90 days I should be good, but I want to take extra precautions just in case. What strategies should I use? e.g. shapmpoos that promote hair growth, cleansing shampoos. Also I am obviously not going to be smoking until after this test.

EDIT: before yesterday I was a fairly regular smoker. 2-3 times a week for the past 2 years or so.

TLDR; I have a hair test in 4 months and need advice on how to pass it."

We get to see each other once a month, and during school breaks. I am a 21yo guy who is completely in love with her.

Two weeks ago she came here to spend Halloween weekend with me. We had been having some awkward conversations for a week or two, but when I would ask what was wrong, she would just say she was tired or stressed. To be honest we both had a rough October with school and our various activities. So she comes in and everything is alright, but I can tell something is off. Saturday comes and we start to fool around, but she's having problems getting going. I stop and try to get to the bottom of it and turns out she was planning on breaking up with me. She brought all of my stuff and was waiting until Sunday when she left.

I tried to be cool about it for a while, but eventually I broke down and started crying. After I got that out of my system, I told her what she did wasn't right and I wouldn't let her leave until we talked about it. So we did, and she brought a whole ton of shit to the table. She's concerned about my future because I've never gone for research opportunities or an internship (she has a fear she will marry her dad, who has never had a stable job). She feels like over that month she just stopped loving me like she used to, and feels like we're best friends now. So I said why don't we give it some time because I never got a chance to say my peace and I didn't feel like we should end what I thought was a happy relationship in the middle of the semester at a very trying time for both of us.

So now we are looking to kind of reaccess everything at winter break. I feel sad every single day, and I'm really broken up about the whole thing to the point of losing sleep every night. When we talk at night though like we normally would everything is great. I've been trying to do little extra things to show her that I love her, like I made her a playlist, and I sent her a love letter which she should get on Tuesday.

I'm having a really hard time coping with the situation though, even though I feel like it's worth it in the end regardless of the outcome because at least I tried. Any advice/tips/really anything is welcome. Talking about it helps me a lot.

Edit: I'm going to see her next weekend as well and I'm afraid I might push her into making a decision because I'm having a hard time."

**THE STORY:**  
I graduated from college last spring with a BFA in fine arts, majoring Illustration and minoring in design. Through my school's ""career-search database"", I was able to find a small company who was looking for a graphic designer. I was lucky enough to get the job, starting out as an intern. I got paid $12 an hour and was told from the interview that this is only because it was an internship. Fair enough. After three months, I got hired but was told from my boss that: ""I cannot pay you *much more* than what you are already getting paid and we don't offer benefits."" Now I'm thinking, ok, that sucks... but at least there will be a slight raise from intern to full time, right? Wrong. Now I have been working full time for about two months with no pay raise.  
I'm the only graphic designer there and EVERY job from a client has to go through me... so I feel like I am a VERY essential part of their team. I'm also the only one who works there NOT on salary(there are 4 others that work there as accountants, etc...all of whom I know where newly hired about 10ish months ago).  
I know there aren't many jobs out there in design and I know I'm right out of school, but I feel like I'm seriously being taken advantage of.  

**THE COMPANY:**  
It's a small promotional product company. They basically receive jobs from clients, fix them up(my job) and send them off to be printed. Shirts, water bottles, lanyards, track pants, pens, etc.

**WHAT MY JOB ENTAILS:**  
Vectorizing logos/images that clients send in      
Designing shirts  
Designing products(mostly shirts) for the YMCA  
Designing logos
I designed the company's new website and a few smaller ones  
Illustrating a catalog of images (a step above clip art basically X_X )
And other various design things they need 


  
**TL;DR:** I got hired fresh out of college at a small promotional company as a graphic designer. After a 3 month internship of getting paid $12, I was hired full time and wasn't given any sort of pay raise. Are they totally screwing me over?
 
EDIT: [Here is my work if anyone is curious.](http://chelseyholeman.com/index.html) (Mostly Illustration is there at the moment)"

So now I'm in full-scale damage control mode and searching for temporary jobs and internships that will keep me working (and potentially improve my application) for a year. The thing is, after an hour and a half of frustrated searching, all of the openings I've found are for current undergrads or grad students. I know that taking time off before grad school is fairly common though. What sort of research options are available for people who aren't in college but haven't yet enrolled in grad school? Is there some resource or internship database for people in this weird in-between time?

If it helps to direct your advice, I want to study physical chemistry or materials science in grad school and ideally whatever work I do next year would be in those fields (though I suppose beggars can't be choosers). My thesis work and past employment consisted of polymer chemistry research, so I have a lot of experience with that field of research, if that helps."

I am 17 years old, born in 1994. I am a Junior in High School. I live in MA. and have grown up in a liberal family. I've always loved knowledge, and growing up with unrestricted internet access, I've grown into something...different. I love animation and film, and hold a lead writing gig with a successful indie film company (yes, it's a paid job, not an internship.) I also work for a major animation studio as a media consultant and will be pitching my first show to them soon. They tell me they're ""eager to hear what you bring to the table"" and have ""nothing but the utmost respect for you and your work so far.""  I'm guaranteed a well-payed job out of High School, and plan on going to LA. Cool.

I'm a hard worker and enjoy what I do. I love history and the world around me, and military history and international relations are something I thoroughly enjoy from an armchair understanding. Things like the Russian Revolution, Japanese feudal history, the effect of the Treaty of Versailles on the rise of the Third Reich, they all fascinate me. I enjoy general history as well. 

I've always had a somewhat muted sense of empathy, if need be, as my close friends and psychiatrist have told me. I'm friendly, empathetic, trustworthy, and an all around good dude. However, I wouldn't hesitate to kill should the need arise, and believe there's no problem with committing evil if it benefits the greater good. There are always going to be sacrifices, it's up to us to make sure they're for the right cause.

We live in a different world, a world of globalization and international affairs like we've never seen before. I want to be a part of this. I feel I haven't done my duty to not only my country, but myself, until I've somehow benefited ""the cause."" 

I feel like I have it in me to be more than just a grunt, that I'm capable for great things. Given the skills I currently have, and the bright non-military career ahead of me, I'm trying to find a way to use my skills to benefit the military and the country. 

My biggest fear is throwing it all away. I don't want to give up on film and video, it's what I love to do, but I feel like I can be more than just a filmmaker.

I don't know how, but I feel like there's some way I can do my part. What do you think?"

My girlfriend of almost 3 years dumped me after this last summer vacation ended (she took a 3 week trip back to her home after her internship ended). I know some people will throw around the phrase ""out of the blue,"" but I can't imagine a more apt description. She started the conversation by saying ""so, do you want to talk about our relationship."" There wasn't a fight, it was how I imagine being laid off from a job would be. Other memorable quotes are ""I just don't see the point of having sex with only you knowing it's going to end in a year,"" and ""well I haven't been with that many people."" I don't remember exactly how it was worded but she said she wanted to still be friends with benefits with me. I refused.

It's been a crappy time trying to get over her, I was totally depressed and wasn't eating, every time I saw her it felt like my guts shifted and I wanted to vomit. My friends have commented on her outfits going to parties on Facebook (so I end up seeing it inadvertently), and it's very obvious what she's been looking to do, and that has made me feel worse.

So fast forward to 2 nights ago. I don't know what got into me but I took her up on her offer. I thought maybe just a one-nighter kind of thing would help me feel better, maybe add some physical closure to the situation so I stop having guttural reactions when I see her (or maybe just desperate to get laid). It actually worked, I don't feel nearly as crappy as I did, but now I'm completely confused. The sex we had wasn't the semi-callous doing whatever turned us on sex that I thought it'd be, it was insanely passionate love-making, ranked among the best we've ever had (I'm one of the romantics that distinguishes between sex and making love), during which I could tell from the feel that she hadn't been getting laid either. But, she didn't want me to leave afterwards, she tried to get me to cuddle and was kissing me non-stop, more so that she did when we were together (to the point where it could be called clingy).

So here's the source of my confusion. We're both new to the concept of sex-buddies but I'm pretty damn sure that's now how things are supposed to go. She tries to treat me like a friend in public (the 2 times we've seen each other in public), and behind closed doors and under the covers she's treating me like her boyfriend again. I have no idea what to think of this. Does it mean she still has feelings for me? Does she want to be a swinger or something? Should I set up emotional boundaries to prevent getting hurt (again)?

For me, the sex is relieving, I've made more progress towards getting over her in the last 2 days than I have in the last 2 months because of it, and because of that I don't want to stop, but I don't think it's a good idea to keep going along with the emotional things she wants to do in addition, like cuddle or hang out afterwards.

**tl;dr** Dumped by ex out of nowhere, felt like crap. She wanted to be sex buds, I tried it. It was awesome, I felt loads better but there's no way what we did was what sex buds do. Confused about what to make of it."

mc8n6,8,2011-11-14,Nonprofits that teach cooking?,theinevitable,nonprofit,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonprofit/comments/mc8n6/nonprofits_that_teach_cooking/,"I am an (unpaid) intern at a big nonprofit in the midwest, and I've been brainstorming lately about new projects I could work on.

My paid job is at a grocery store, as a cashier. A thing I see time and time again is people having to make tough choices about their grocery orders when they run out of money-- whether food stamps, limited cash for a large family, whatever. These people are frequently buying frozen, pre-made food, no fresh veggies or fruits.

Personally, I am on a moderately tight food budget, and the way I try to stretch my budget is by cooking as much as possible. I eat lots of beans and rice, cook in bulk and freeze it for the future, etc. It seems that this knowledge is something that has been lost in some segments of our society. If it weren't for reddit (/food, /frugal, /cheapfood, etc) and the fact that many of my friends cook, I could very well be eating canned soup for every meal. On the other hand, I definitely see people at the store coming through who clearly DO know how to shop/cook on a budget. I can't stand thinking about people missing out on delicious food because they think frozen food is all they can afford.

So basically, I want to find a way to hold cooking classes, where members of the community can share their knowledge. Not everyone has a grandma to teach them how to cook-- but every block has at least one grandma who is cooking up delicious stuff in her kitchen.

Are there groups that do this kind of thing? I can immediately see tons of problems with organizing this kind of program-- finding a space where students can cook, liability issues, cooking supplies, etc."

First the slides. The fuck happened with that? Is there no emphasis on how Dexter didn't get a blood slide from the farmer? I know Brian said, ""I hope you got a trophy"" but it didn't show if Dexter did. 

Who the fuck cares about the intern and the babysitter? What's with the game? Any ideas?

Did the actor who played the slutty intern get arrested or something? What happened with her? Is she coming back? Hurry up writers. 

Why is Batista suddenly not important anymore? It felt like he was going to be a strong character in the start of the season. I don't give a shit about Quinn and Deb. Kill Quinn since it's set up so nicely. And while you're at it, take care of LaGeurta. 

While we're on the topic of Quinn. It's okay that you screwed a material witness. 

.........................................................................................................

**Brian here, brian gone.** 

It happened too quickly. This season is doing a its job keeping the viewers entertained, but there's way too many things going on at once. Keeping Brian around for a little longer while Dexter fights his way out would strengthen the point the writers were trying to make and also clean the subplots more. If that makes sense. Dexter truly having to choose between light vs dark in that way would be more emotional. They could've made his dark side more intense to contrast the Dexter we're used to seeing. In the end, I'm content with him keeping the code as always. That is, after all, why Brian is dead and Dexter is still surviving.

**Jonas gone.**

Extremely disappointing that Jonas isn't Trinity Jr. I understand the 'forgiveness' theme that this season is leading towards, but are you serious? There was so much potential. 

I don't really believe that. Something will happen later in the season. My theory is that Jonas keeps killing and Dexter finds out. He'll break, kill Jonas, and maybe Brian will even come back. Even though that's sloppy writing and predictable. 

.........................................................................................................

**End of Dexter?**

There was a lot of emphasis on Dexter leaving a lot of evidence around. From the lady outside of Jonas' house, to the pen, car tracks, being in the store and fucking the girl, yada yada. Deb will link it somehow.

My questions are:  **What kinds of things have employers expected you to be able to do at your intership or co-op?**

**Can I expect to have enough knowledge to be an effective engineer at that point in my education?**

In case it might help you answer my questions, these are some classes I will be taking next year:

* Aerospace Vehicle Performance
* Aerodynamics I
* Thermodynamics
* Mechanics of Materials
* Intro to Aerospace Design
* Aerodynamics II
* Aerospace Structures
* Methods in Aerospace Engineering I

Also, I will have taken C++ by then.

Note:  I don't know if the word ""co-op"" is common outside of this area, so just to clarify, a co-op is similar to an internship except you usually get paid and *usually* about six months in duration, so yes, it will push my graduation date back.

I'm trying to find a free solution to server monitoring.  I need something to centrally monitor system statistics and manage services over multiple servers.

You'd think Microsoft would include something like this in their server package.

Any ideas?

Edit:

Things I probably should have specified before:

* At first, my supervisor wanted no linux anything in the environment.  He doesn't trust it and doesn't know how to troubleshoot it.  I'm really the only one and we're not sure on how long I'll be there, right now it's indefinite.  I did, however, convince him to allow one or two on there strictly for these monitoring purposes.
* That brings me to my next point, I'm just an intern.  Right now I'm going to stay with them upon completion of the internship if they ask me to.  I'm learning quite a bit about being a system admin, which makes me a little more dangerous down the road.  I work from anywhere an active internet connection exists, so it's convenient, and I get paid.  My major is actually in Computer Information Systems to be a network engineer, but doubling as a systems admin makes me look better.
* While I do know quite a bit about computers, that knowledge extends primarily into home use or networking (Cisco), not far into anything else.  I'm learning quite a bit here and hope to learn more.

I also want to thank you immensely for all the help.  We've been trying to find a monitoring solution as cheap as possible (not a huge company) and these are all great suggestions.  I just need time to sit down and try a few out on our networks."

I'm from Canada and my girlfriend is from Europe. We're currently in a long distance relationship and hoping to bring that distance together next year after she finishes her studies. I work in IT and will have around 3 years experience as a software developer by then, including my internships. She will have a Masters degree in Economics, and as of yet no relevant work experience.

My main concern right now is jobs - everything else (weather, culture, language) we can filter down after we have a list of practical possibilities. Like most LDR couples, we're quite different in skills, citizenship, and experience.

Myself, my options look like: Canada, US, UK, Ireland. Reading some of the posts here, it sounds like I may have a shot in the Netherlands or Germany. Is that true? How about the Scandinavian countries?

My girlfriend has EU citizenship, so at least her options in terms of being able to live in any EU country is much greater than mine. The question would be finding a decent job and career path, while speaking only English. Note, we excluded her country from possible options because it would be extremely difficult for me to get a decent job without speaking the language there. I think the best options for her are the same as mine.

Other options we ruled out were Canada (feeling in a European mood, but this is not 100% out), US (various reasons, nothing political or anything like that), Australia (too far), New Zealand (too far and no jobs), and Asia (hard to find jobs that don't involve teaching English, as it's just not for us).

We'll have at least 20k saved up in total, not including a healthily sized emergency fund if needed. We're planning to use this for a couple months of travel, airfare, and general ""start up"" costs which is a bit of an X factor. I think this should last us at least six months for this travel/start up kind of lifestyle. Is that reasonable?
    
    





EDIT: Wow, that came out much longer than expected.

**TLDR** What countries have jobs for two people who speak English, one in IT and a Canadian citizen, and one EU citizen who will be a recent graduate of a Master's in Economics?"

We both work from home and he's about a 40 minute drive from me so I hate driving out there to simply get a piece of paper signed.  Also, we're pretty busy right now and I hate bugging him for shit like this, but it needs to be done.  In an effort to brighten his day, I sent him this email.  What do you guys think?


""I apologize but I need to bug you for another thing.  We have to fill out an hours sheet for the last half of the semester as well.  This means you get to sign again.  Now I was thinking of just copying and pasting your signature from the other one, but then I thought about getting the date on there and that would have been like, weeks of work trying to learn your handwriting so I could carve it in there myself, thus not bugging you.  In the end I scrapped that idea, strapped on my thinking cap, and came up with a new idea.  I've come into ownership of a DeLorean.  Now I know this guy who is really great with fixing sinks, toilets, and bathtubs and he says one time he got amazing reception on his television by moving the antennae around quite a bit.  I think that makes him really good with electronics, maybe math, and possibly quantum physics.  I'm employing him to build a time machine on this car.  Once it's completed (I'm predicting completion in roughly nine days) I will go back in time and ensure that your parents birth twins, one becoming you and the other becoming...I don't know, Barry or something.  Since you're both twins you'll obviously have the exact same handwriting.  I will then return this time, asking Barry instead of you to sign this...only Barry would sign your name...and date  This way I have to bother you half as much.


That's my game plan right now.  Plan B is a little over the top and unnecessary, but here it goes.  I've attached the file to this email.  At your leisure, would you be able to work whatever kind of Wiccan black magic you did before to sign it, date it, and get it back to me?  I have I think a few weeks to do this, but the sooner it's off of my list of things to do, the sooner it's off yours."""

I'd never been the most outgoing or popular person, and I knew I'd be locked in my shell forever if I didn't do something drastic. I was sick of feeling wholly dependent upon my parents too.  
I wish everyday I'd waited until after school to make the dramatic move.
I turned my life around twice (once for each of my boyfriends) and ended up getting a degree that I really don't care about. (Nutrition &amp; Dietetics)
While my degree is worth something I think, it won't get me a job in the field (I didn't do the requisite internship that would allow me to take the registration exam). It seems niche enough to not even be good for a crummy lab tech position, no matter how many I apply to. I've only worked mindless jobs since graduation.  The best was as part of the receiving crew at grocery store XD I had a *closer* to living wage and health insurance at least. 
It wasn't enough though, since I fell prey to credit cards while in school and needed to pay those, along with living expenses.

I've moved back into my parents house because of my financial situation and the hope of returning to school here. I do have a job, but it's enough to help me get out of debt with a little savings on the side. I'm still depending on my parents for room and board. I even need their help with my asthma medicine. XD

I know my situation isn't as bad as many others out there, but it still feels pathetic to be in it. All of that added to the fact I still have trouble making friends makes me feel sometimes like I just don't deserve my place in the world.

My feelings are furthered by the things my parents say at times or their attitudes towards things, though I think they may not always be aware of how they come across. If my mom's in a bad mood she'll say things to me about ""Well if you hadn't F'd up in school..."" despite my having completed a degree. My dad now seems to think there is little to no value in education. I know it's because he spent a lot of money on mine and my degree wasn't ""Scroll of Good Job"". I'm beating myself up enough about it and struggling to plan to make sure I can fix it. It just adds to my shame and self loathing XD.

My only consolation for all of this is that I've never been called a loser by anyone and people who meet me or that I know casually (work/class etc.) somehow get the idea I have a wonderful and fulfilled life.

I don't know if I posted this looking for advice or something, it just helped me feel a little better to do it. I don't feel like there's anyone in my daily life I can talk to so I let it out on Reddit.

I am trying to find part time work on Indeed.com, but keep getting baby sitting and nursing jobs and call center jobs; using search modifiers like -nursing -sitter, etc doesn't give me great results.

Also, this is my first post, so please forgive me if I am not following protocol.


So here's my story:


I'm a computer science major (love web dev) going to a public school. For the first year and a half of college, I went to a private school. My first semester after the transfer, I thought of a great idea. I wrote a prototype using my old school's information since the data was easier to capture than the school I am at now. After thinking about it and realizing there is no way I could compete with other sites that have many school's data in their database and offer other features, I figured I would email one of the popular websites I fell in love with and see if we could work together somehow. Here are the summarized emails conversed between me and the 
website:

Me: I have an idea that'll make the website better. I have a prototype and would love to talk to a webmaster about teaming up.

Site: Can you be more specific about your website?

Me: [Explains what the site does].

Site: Says they have already been working on and it gave reason as to why the release was delayed. Also asks if I want to be part of a beta crew to help with features, etc.

Me: I'd love to be on the crew. Also asked if they had any internships available.

Site: Can I see your resume? 

Me: I become a welcome email to the crew.


That's the last I've heard of them since.


Now my questions is, while I know it's a very long shot: Do you think they actually just stole the idea and made it up that they had been working on it? The email received about it leads me to believe they might have been working on it, but that may have been their goal.

When hurricane Irene struck the region I didn't hear much nationally about the flooding there and when I arrived that weekend the only visible changes were road closures and detours. It wasn't until the next trip up when I was able to take those original routes to the farm that I saw sagging buildings, houses turned lopsided on their foundations and almost impassable roads.

As you can expect insurance and government funding has been slow. Yes these people will rebuild and they will be ok eventually but right now many small businesses and families are still struggling to get their lives back together.

I just donated $5 to their paypal account. If only a fraction of a percent of Reddit users could do likewise you would be altering the lives of a small community forever.

I hate appealing to people for charity but if you watch the interviews on their main page it's heartbreaking. If it takes playing to your vanity then so be it. Everyone is probably tired of hearing about Reddit as a pedophile haven, why don't we change that perception and create an image of a community that lends itself to the needs of other communities?

TLDR: A small community in upstate N.Y. was literally washed away. They've only been able to raise an exceedingly small portion of money to begin rebuilding, I think we can change that."

I have been assigned a project for my internship. I am an intern on a political campaign. My candidate has spent the past 8 years travelling my state in an elected position and she is now running for a higher position. 

My task is to go through her schedule over the past 8 years and track where she has been (locations within the state), and who she met with when she was there.

I currently have a spreadsheet with each of her meetings (several a day) divided into the following categories:

date, time, meeting with?, location, attendees from?, description, organizer phone, organizer email. 

does anyone have any suggestions on software I can use to make this excel spreadsheet more presentable? I'm imagining a map of the state that shows the info when you scan it or run your cursor over it?

all constructive suggestions highly appreciated."
mddzq,5,2011-11-15,It's over. I don't regret a thing.,omgarm,wemetonline,https://www.reddit.com/r/wemetonline/comments/mddzq/its_over_i_dont_regret_a_thing/,"Going to try to keep this short. I am not a regular here, but I need to vent this. 

A bit over 4 years ago I met her in a random chat session; I was 17, she was 14.  Nothing happened then, we just talked from time to time. 2 years later (me halfway through college, her just starting... some sort of high school, I don't remember much about the British education system) we talk more often, eventually grow out to be best friends. Eventually feelings were admitted to during February of this year. After this things got serious.

We shared everything. Her being far away from her friends made her home a lot so we had plenty of time. During summer things were more intense, she was scared of college and due to vacations we missed each other for 3 weeks straight. 

We had talked about when we would meet and how things would go. I started my graduation internship in September but promised her I would visit after, in February. 

First week of college (in October) she had all her partying + introduction stuff and told me after a few days that things don't feel the same. She was realizing she wanted more, somebody who was there for her to hold. I told her to take her time and figure out what she wanted.

The day after she told me this wasn't fair. She was doubting and unsure of her feelings. We decided to end things then.

The three weeks after that were... weird. We would still talk, but less. We'd both mention how moving on was gonna take a while and she even jokingly told me she was gonna be the creepy ex type. Two weeks ago she was emotional and kept sending me messages in which she told me she loved me.

Last week everything changed. She wasn't emotional anymore and texting/talking slowed down. Then on Thursday I got the dreaded message ""just to let you know I've moved on"".

I asked her what she did, even though I told her before I didn't want to. Sort of relieved things stayed at making out + a little more. I remember that entire (short convo) that ended with us telling each other to be happy.

I'm turning 22 in less than a week and I'm feeling like shit. My internship is going ""ok"" on a good day and ""....meh"" on a bad day. I have lost the first and only girl I have loved and my goddamn troll brain keeps thinking of her doing stuff with another guy. 

But.... that will all pass. Eventually I'll learn to live with it and then just remember the good times. I was so happy for nearly an entire year, something I hadn't had since childhood. I don't regret anything we've done, we've shared and we've dreamt of. Our time is over and it's time for me to move on.

Just needed a place to vent. Trying to deal with feelings and had to let things out. This seemed like the perfect place since.... well... she introduced me to reddit and this is the place I first posted. Things can change so quickly.

That was and shall be my only online relationship. I wish all of you people here a happy and good time during yours. I hope you'll consider it an addition to your life if things don't work out. "

In which field should I get my degree?",[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/mdduf/i_bet_this_question_gets_asked_a_lot_but_im_going/,"I did a quick search and couldn't find a discussion on the topic. I apologize if this isn't the right place to post such a question, and if so where should I go?

A little background about myself: I graduated from UCLA in 2009 with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. Since then I have not been working in the field. I don't have ANY experience, no internships, nothing. I know that's my fault, but that's where I am. I started a small tutoring business with my friends since then, and also work at a hospital as an EMT on the weekends (I considered for a short while becoming a firefighter.)

I recently took the GRE as I want to go back to school as a jumping off point for getting back into the field. I believe I scored around 700 on the verbal section and 800 in math. For the essay I would guess a 4.5 or 5, but it's hard to tell. My GPA is 3.07.

Okay, enough with the background. Like the title suggests I want to figure out what you all think would be good specializations within Mechanical Engineering field. What do YOU think is interesting and why? What about the current job climate? I have read that mechanical engineering jobs have been in decline, but I'm sure some fields would have been hit harder than others. What is the safe bet with the most jobs right now? 

 To be honest I don't really have much direction and any suggestions would be greatly helpful and appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

I moved to New York three months ago, hoping to get involved in film making and it sort of worked. I got an internship with a film and equipment rental studio and I've made a lot of friends.

One is a coffee shop, which isn't so bad, except I get paid under the table and sometimes I don't get paid for weeks, and the other is with a political organization that pays less than minimum wage to do door-to-door fundraising in Long Island. In short, I'm dying from the amount of work I do and get paid peanuts (less than 300 a week).

**Things you should know:** 

* It's unpaid. We provide college credit for it, though.

* It's early in the morning. Like ""get here by 5am"" early.

* We're usually done by 11am. 

* It's really fun, despite the hours.

* It's usually 3 days a week, but can be more or less - and the internship usually runs 3 months or one semester. 

* You actually get to do audio production, show prep, creative writing, guest-bookings... you don't have to fetch coffee or answer phones. 

* We're in Brighton. We have free parking. 


**Requirements:** 

* It HAS to be for college credit. No exceptions, unfortunately. 

* A car is extremely helpful, since the T doesn't run that early, and I don't want kids walking here in the pitch-black icy night through Allston or Brighton.

I thought you guys might be more well-versed in the tricks of the trade, as it were.

I have been [0] for three months now while I was job hunting. I've just accepted a sweet job that I can do from home, but they don't want me to start until after Thanksgiving. Now the company is out in San Francisco, so they want me to fly out for a couple weeks to get started (I live on the east coast). I think given their location and the size of the company (&lt;100 people), they probably don't drug test, but I definitely don't want to toke up in celebration, get all the way out there, and then have them spring one on me.

So my question to you guys is, do you know of a way that I can find out if the company drug tests without just straight-up asking ""hey can I smoke weed, is that cool""? Unfortunately I don't know anyone else at the company, which is how I used to do it when I was getting internships in college.

- coaching youth sports for a few seasons

- an office assistant job that I have just to fulfill Federal Work Study

How would I go about doing this though? I will admit that the business side would take a bit getting used to (Art school doesn't really teach you economics that well), but I will say that I have the part down where it comes towards understanding talent and understanding Illustrators and Photographers (Art school also has it's perks). 

From what I recall I don't believe most major agencies have internships for Art Buying, and at least from what I read from the [4A's](http://www.aaaa.org/agency/compensation/resources/jobs/Print/Pages/ArtBuyer.aspx) it says that I need at least one year experience, which I could bullshit but I feel that only doing two internships doesn't count as industry experience. Would it make more sense to get a job initially as a Creative and then try to transfer over to Production?

Another question I have is how would I go about presenting myself if I was to somehow get an interview. I mean I am an Art Director with an Art History background and have experience with working with photographers and illustrators, but how else do you prove that you have an eye for talent? "

I will be graduating college with a BS in Physics this winter (minor in math), and I am trying my best to get into aerospace but it seems to not be going so well. I had always thought that an undergraduate physics degree would be a good foundation before making the transition, but going up against aerospace engineering undergrads for grad school admission and jobs really has me worried.

Here is my plan: While I have a strong background in experimental research (solid state physics), I am really interested in aerospace applications (particularly plasma science and more specifically I really am interested in the research going on into plasma propulsion). I live in the Seattle area, and am applying to the University of Washington's Aeronautics and Astronautics graduate program (plasma science division), and I am also applying to as many aerospace engineering internships as I can (so far have hit Boeing and Aerojet). I am also applying to Aeronautic scholarships and fellowships because I think it'll make me more attractive of a candidate to UW. It seems more likely, because I have a strong academic and research background, that I will get into UW than get a permanent Aerospace job, but I am trying to apply to those as well, with poor results.

Now I come to you for help, /r/aerospace. Any advice that you have at all would help me out. Advice on how to transition from physics, advice on how to make an appealing resume to big aerospace companies, where to look for good internship opportunities, or where to go to ask these questions if this isn't the right place. I am all ears for any help you care to offer.


Thanks so much for your time!

Last summer, I had a job at a fortune 250 company working that produces valves... I wasn't really doing anything related to my major at all (and I also worked at corporate headquarters). Now, I have to pay for school and all, my parents have given me nothing but a cell phone plan once I left home which means having money for rent and whatnot is very important. I have been applying for internships left and right this semester and had interviews with five companies (Kraft, p and g, shell, reckitt benckiser, and air products). I'm still waiting on three companies to get back to me about interviews I had in September. I'm going to be talking on the phone tomorrow with someone from another division of the company I already worked for. The job is pretty much mine if I want it, because at corporate I interned for an executive, so I essentially have a ticket to anywhere in the company. The problem is, I don't want to work somewhere where I will probably get very little experience in chemE, but I need to make money so desperately over the summer that I am afraid to sit around and apply for more jobs or wait on the other companies to get back to me. What should I do? Keep on trucking for my dream job and risk not having one at all? Or take the less-desired one with the financial security?

I love each and every one of you that take the time to read over this. I've cried too much being in such a crappy situation. I feel like I have to choose money over happiness, but I guess sometimes life is like that.

mchk7,4,2011-11-14,Religion Strikes Back,msk_501,exmormon,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/mchk7/religion_strikes_back/,"Probably not the best title, but it definitely fits how my day was yesterday. I was too busy to type it up last night, so here's my wacky as hell Sunday for you now. 

I'll start with earlier in the week. My roommate who didn't give a shit about the church, got a job. A really nice internship with his friends that he didn't expect. So, he told me the day he got it, 
""I'm going back to church. It's been a long time since I've been, and I think it'd be good."" 
 ""Wait, didn't you say the only time you'd be caught in a church was if someone is dead or getting married?"" 
""Yeah, well, I have the human mindset where I'll change when I think it's good to change."" 

I simply shrugged it off and left it at that. I couldn't change his mind, but I was assuming he'd go back to normal. 

Sunday came and I had to go to church as well as him. It was two of my really good friend's mission farewell speeches and I promised him I'd be there. The first one, this kid I've known for a long time. He had an attitude, he hated the church, and he was the last person I would have guessed to go on a mission. Between me and him, the roles have reversed. He became the good church guy and I became the anti-church guy. I told him afterwards that he'd changed a lot and that I'd miss him. The second talk was of my awesome friend who I'm really going to miss. His ward is possibly the friendliest group of people I've met in the church and I knew a great deal of them. My friend gave his talk not as a professional talk, but as a real farewell should go: *I learned so much from everyone here, my family, my leaders, and my friends. I really appreciate it and will carry this all with me in the next two years.* I'm happy for him. I really am. He's such a great guy, even if he is super Mormon. I'll miss him a ton. 

Then there was his luncheon after church. I helped along with his family set up for it and this is where I sort of started to crack a little. I don't believe in the church much anymore. But the people here were...not mean in any way at all. In fact, his family is filled with tons of great people, most of which are strong members in the church. I hadn't felt this welcome at a gathering in months and I wasn't even a family member! I'm sure several people here have been to these sort of things before. I've heard plenty of mission farewell's but none of them really mattered to me. But these two guys I know very well. One of them is a very close friend. 

When I got home, my roommate was talking to the other one about religion. At about this time I was worn out and planning on hitting up r/exmormon to shake off the grasp church was getting on me. Yet, my non-Mormon roommate was talking to my relatively strong Mormon roommate. They weren't debating anything, they were just discussing. I have the feeling that my non-Mormon roommate might change. I mean, he even said, ""I love the culture. Imagine if the whole world were Mormon, then it'd be perfect."" I can't agree with that. Diversity is wonderful, despite the problems it brings up. And the church is all about authority. I can't do that either. I wonder how much of an influence it had on him yesterday. 

The people might be good, but I still think that many of them are blind to reality. I can't slip back into that. I just can't.

**TL;DR: Went to two mission farewell's yesterday. Going to miss both of them like Hell. And now the church is trying to become prevalent in my house. I refuse to give in, even if it feels ""good.""**

It has always been my dream to become a director/screenwriter however as it is now, it doesn't seem like I can even get my foot into the door let alone reach my goal.

I've done a few internships but most with small local production companies that seem to lead nowhere. I wouldn't mind doing another internship if it wasn't for the fact that most legitimate internships at big studios require college credit and the fact that most are unpaid. I am broke and can't afford to go on without a job for much longer.

That leads me to try finding very low level entry jobs, such as PA positions or assistant positions. However, these positions seem very hard to get as they are usually filled through connections. 

I understand that as an aspiring Screenwriter/Director I should be doing exactly that writing and directing. Thing is that I am doing that, but having a job that can support me while I try to get noticed and having a job that not only is within my field but also garners networking opportunities I believe is essential.

FAQ",Rye22,ems,https://www.reddit.com/r/ems/comments/mcfqi/how_do_i_become_an_emt_faq/,"I noticed a lot of people coming on here and asking how to become EMTs, so I typed up this FAQ. Im posting it here so that anybody can do with it as they like, so please feel free to add to or edit any part of it.

**What are the different levels of EMT?**

This varies depending on the state that you live in, but to speak very generally, there are three levels of EMT licensure. EMT-basic, EMT- Intermediate, and EMT- Paramedic. Each level requires a different level of education, and each level has a different scope of practice.

EMT Basics are trained in basic patent assessment and care. They can perform skills like CPR and defibrillation, oxygen administration and mechanical ventilation, use of airway adjuncts, splinting of injured extremities, and limited medication administration. They are taught to determine the severity of a patents illness or injury through basic assessment techniques, and to make decisions about transport or additional resources. Becoming a basic generally takes 3-6 months.

EMT Intermediate is the next level up from a basic. The major difference between the two is that Intermediates are trained to set IV lines, and they have more medications that they can administer. In some places, intermediates may perform more advanced skills, like intubation.  Becoming an intermediate usually takes 6 months to a year.

EMT Paramedics are the highest level of pre hospital care provider currently in the united states. Beyond the basic and intermediate skills already mentioned, they are trained in skills like intubation, cardiac monitoring and pacing, cricothyrotomy, and other advanced procedures. Paramedics have a fairly wide scope of medications that they can administer. They also have a more comprehensive education in emergency medicine, and have completed a more in depth internship.  Becoming a paramedic can take anywhere from 1 year, to a full 4 year batchlers degree.

Your state may or may not have other variations on these levels. There may be Intermediate 85 or Intermediate 99, there may be critical care paramedics, or CCEMT-Ps. Flight paramedics or tactical medics may have their own certifications as well. All of these levels may have differences in scope of practice. It is worth mentioning that in the next few years, the levels of EMT will be changed by the national registry. You can read about the new levels [here](http://nremt.org/nremt/downloads/Newsletter_2009.pdf) on page four. My understanding is that the new levels will be in effect by 2014

**Where do I start?**

All EMTs must start as basics. Becoming an intermediate is not required, and it is common for paramedic students to ""skip"" the intermediate level. But to enter into EMS, you generally must begin as a basic. Basic classes are offered in many different places. Community collages often have them, fire departments will have them, specialized and tech schools will have them. Do some looking around, and you will certainly find a class being offered in your area. Once you complete your class you will have to test with either the state EMS bureau or the national registry to receive an EMT license.

**What is the difference between a certification, a state license and a national license?**

Every state will have different credentials that they require you to have to practice as an EMT in their state. In practical terms, there is little difference between a cert and a license, so let me explain the difference between state and national. State licenses and national license are separate, and you will have to pass two separate licensing exams for each. Some states will require you to have a state license to practice, and some a national. Again, this completely depends on where you are in the country. You will have to research on your own the licensing requirements of your particular state.

**How do I get a job?**

It is common for EMTs for work for fire departments, private ambulance services, or emergency departments, but there are many other jobs you can do as an EMT as well. If you want to work on an ambulance, be aware that many services require you to be 21 or older, due to insurance requirements. Like any other field, the best way to find a job in EMS is to be proactive, make connections, and apply for many positions. having experience is often a requirement, so you could consider volunteering some place to get your foot in the door. Again, there may or may not be volunteer fire departments in your area

**How do I… What if… What about…**

Most of this stuff, you're going to have to figure out on your own. EMS systems differ greatly depending on where you live. You will have to figure out how things work in your area. Working as an EMT is a job that will often require you to think and act independently, so take the first step now and figure some things out for yourself. Many people have walked this path before you, but ultimately its up to you to find your own way. With that in mind, good luck!

Because either course is a prereq for the majority of the Journalism courses I almost feel like I'm behind and won't graduate on time because I've had to wait so damn long.

I've emailed professors and talked to an advisor about special permission numbers. None of the professors emailed me back and the advisor said that there's no waiting list and I'd just have to wait and see if someone will drop one of the sections.. **WHO'S GOING TO DROP IT THOUGH?!** It's a core requirement!

It makes sense that they all closed out; there's 8 sections in total and 20 kids per each class because they're in computer labs. That's 160 students. I tend to believe there are a lot more students trying to get a spot in the course than 160. 

Are any of you guys in the same situation as me? I'm just really frustrated and wish the department would get their shit together. I'm interested to hear your thoughts.

EDIT: I should add that I had a similar situation with News Reporting and Writing last year. I ended up taking it over the summer because I got closed out. I don't want to take a summer course though -- I need to get a job and do internships.

Also I apologize if I come across as incredibly whiny. I don't mean to be."

Then I got the Nintendo DS, DS lite, Gamecube, Wii, DSi, Xbox 360 Elite, PS3, and 360 Slim respectively. I created a Steam Account about a year ago.

I did not want to apply using the Jobs tab on their website because they are most likely looking for programmer and professional game developers (or so I think), but instead I though that it would be better if I just emailed Gabe Newell instead because it seemed less of an official job application and more of an internship opportunity where I could help around the office and what not.

I need some advice on how to teach something new to a youngster.

It's a bit of a tradition, that my company has interns from different schools this time of the year. Normally my department don't really deal with those, but one of them has asked if he could spend friday morning by the programmers. I volounteered because everybody else seemed to skip out on having to teach a youngster to program, and I really wanted the challenge.

Now, I haven't exactly laid a plan yet, but I assume that he doesn't know anything about programming. I know that he spend most of last week setting up servers and poking around in a rack, setting up a few VM's for the programmers and changing dead disks. He's around 13-15 years old, I think (Just saw him once).

We normally do Java and PHP in our shop, and that's the tools I know well enough to teach. Although Javascript could do, but my ideas mainly focus on our primary tools of the trade. 

* My original thought was to put him down and make some simple HelloWorld scripts in Java, added with some Employee objects and different ways of making them print lines. Maybe, just maybe I'll make some socket-programming, but I'll probably help him out and make the server-side.

* My next thought was probably to let him play around with PHP and a WAMP server. Again, simple HelloWorld scripts and maybe spice it up with a MySQL insertion/extraction.

* Lastly, one of my coworkers suggested that I used Jetty and Eclipse to make some simple Java website, so he could learn a bit of both worlds. It seems like a bit more of a hassle to get going, but maybe I should just prepare a project for him. He doesn't have much time with us that day, so a bit of speed is essential.

But I'm not sure if it should be one of those routes, or if I should go a different way all in all. 

I've asked him to bring his own labtop, so we could keep him going when he comes home. Although he has a perfectly fine company supplied computer. 

What do you guys think?

Don't know why I didn't think to ask you guys before.  Be quick, I'll try and get all of your questions answered.

Edit: This is a recruitment info session.  Not sure exactly who will be there.  I'll ask questions about the game but questions about riot and their projects are probably more relevant to the discussion.

Edit: Done with the info session.  I'll start answering questions when I'm done with class in 30 minutes.

Edit: Sorry, I took a bit longer to get settled than I thought.  Here are some of the answers I got to the questions you guys asked.

1. Q: What are the plans for the company going into the future?
A: Right now they want to focus on the massive growth in league of legends and hire a staff that can maintain that.  (Good news for anyone looking to get hired.)  That said, the company is called Riot *Games* (plural).  There are plans to develop more titles, probably in the same universe.  Exactly what those ideas are, is confidential so I couldn't get that out.

2. Q: What happened to project shiny?

A: It's still coming along.  Models are being remade.  As Pissix said, they're pretty much implementing them as they come out.  (See: Kayle and Tryndamere changes)  Other than that, things will be coming out Soon^TM

3. Q: What's going on with Asian markets?

A: The servers in China are in Beta.  We'll have to wait and see where those go.

4. Q: What happened to Mac support?

A: The beta was canceled.  No plans to restart.  The guy I asked these questions of showed me his Mac that he uses for work and expressed his disappointment.

5: Q: How do you get hired?

A: By being awesome.  Riot wants smart motivated people.  Show them that you've got initiative and enthusiasm.  Any little pet projects you have in computer science, art, design or anything else remotely related to the game will help you out.  If you have something interesting to offer to the Riot team, they want you.  There's a lot of work to be done.  There current staff of about 400 has a hard time handling all of it.

5. Q: Where was this info session?

A: Northwestern University.  I'm an undergrad here in the school of engineering.  Apparently Riot is starting to do more of these visits to schools so look out for opportunities.  The company has expanded from LA and now has offices in St. Louis, Dublin, and Seoul, and they're looking for new employees to work there.  (Interns too!)

6. Q: Why do they still use Adobe Air?

A: It's a matter of resources.  There's a ton of work to be done.  Changing away from Adobe air would detract from all of the other stuff that's going on.  They make changes every two weeks!  That's a ridiculous turn over.  Until they have a bunch of free time, this probably isn't going to change.

Well, that's it.  The other questions you guys asked were a lot about the live part of the game, i.e. champions, masteries, runes, balance, etc.  The people I spoke with were an office manager (PR and that stuff as well) and a platform engineer (Everything that isn't the game itself).  They were both awesome.  They both seemed to love their jobs.  I can't tell you how great of an opportunity it would be to work at Riot.

me9h3,1,2011-11-16,"Writing is a big weakness for me. What careers don't require it, but won't limit my earning potential?",CantWriteGood,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/me9h3/writing_is_a_big_weakness_for_me_what_careers/,"This a throway for the topic.

Here's the background. (tl;dr at the bottom)

I got a job as a technical analyst in a gov't department about 6 months ago. The work mostly consists of writing documents. This could be things like an assessment of current data handling processes, proposals for a programme of work, etc. It's pretty laid back and low stress, the problem is that writing has always been difficult for me. Whenever I have to write any document like that I just lock up and have a really hard time getting anything out on the page. It also seems to take me forever to actually get anything produced. This has been an issue since as far back as I can remember. I've gotten better  in general, but I still don't think that I would ever be any good at a job that is focused on writing.

There are things that I'm good at though.

- Data analysis &amp; reporting - I started writing business/accounting reports as a freshman in college. My most recent job was doing sales analysis for the local office of a large multinational. 
- Database/system design - I designed a freight tracking system after having one database class. Recently designed a tool to calculate ACV and retention rates (disclaimer: this was all done in excel/access. I know this is not exactly state of the art, but it's the skills and the tools I had at the time)
- Research - I can usually find good sources of obscure info online and IRL and have a decent understanding of them even if I'm not familiar with the subject area. (Maybe this is pretty common, but I have noticed not everyone is comfortable doing this)

On the education side:

- I have an MBA with a focus in strategy and one class short of a focus in finance (Yes, probably confirms some stereotypes for the folks out there)
- My undergrad is in Int'l Business and I studied abroad in Germany

Work experience has been mostly the data analysis type things. I've tried internships in business consulting and those never went anywhere. I probably got a decent understanding of the issues but had an insanely hard time producing documentation. I have never had the supervisor talk to me about performance, I left these kinds of jobs voluntarily.

So where does that leave me?

I'm likely to leave my current job in max 6 months. The question is what direction to go next. 

I would prefer a career that would allow me to be flexible with time and  location. Something where I can pick up a 3-6 month contract in most big cities.

These are a couple directions I've been thinking.

- DW/BI developer
- Customer insight analyst
- Financial analyst
- Software developer

I'm sure there are other interesting high potential careers out there I just come up with any more at the moment.

Any advice or ideas would be awesome.

-----
tl;dr 

- Have an MBA
- Most experience in reporting and data analysis in smaller not-finance fims
- Have a very hard time writing documentation
- Looking for high potential career with much less writing and location/time flexible. "
me6d1,2,2011-11-16,Is it fair to expect my bf to help around the house? ,ihazprollems,ask,https://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/me6d1/is_it_fair_to_expect_my_bf_to_help_around_the/,"First off, I love my boyfriend, so before I bring this up with him (and probably starting an argument) I want some validation that what I'm asking for is okay. We just moved into a really small studio apartment that gets dirty/messy very easily. I work 40 hours a week, go to school, and have an internship; needless to say I'm very busy. When I get home I just want to go to bed or rest or do my homework. My boyfriend goes to school and owns his own business (website) and gets help money-wise from his parents. He makes/has a lot more money than me, and he is home most of the week. He still feels as though it is fair to hold me responsible for the things around the house I did before I got so busy, and I'm not sure what to think. It feels unfair, but I'm not sure anymore. I know I don't contribute as much to rent or groceries, utilities, etc, but I feel like the cleanliness of the house still depends completely on me despite the fact I'm almost never home. Is it fair to ask him to help out more, like doing the dishes (which he has never done) making the bed, cleaning up in general even though I don't contribute as much financially? I'm on the fence about this myself, because I do feel guilty for what I can't give. I know ideally it should be my responsibility to clean but I honestly just don't have the time or energy lately. I would also say the mess is about 50/50. 

TL;DR: I'm always at work, school, or my internship. My boyfriend is mostly always home. He makes more money than me and expects me to keep the apartment clean, when I don't have the time or energy. Is it ok to ask him to help out more? "

",PUStarvingA,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/mdz2k/over_the_span_of_2_years_studying_this_material_i/,"...the life of a hermit is now more appealing to me. Firstly, I'm not here to bash on this community. Some of the things I've learned here have helped me tremendously. The inner game material comes to mind. Hopefully someone out there can relate to my experience. Maybe someone out there has been in this place before. And they have found a way out. 

I've read almost every book out there. I've listened to the podcasts. Repeatedly. I broke out of the self defeating mindsets I grew up with. I have no AA, at least when I'm running solo. I've acquired the gift of gab. If my friends and family are around, I can't let them see how I approach women for they will judge me. I have no car. I have no money. I dropped out of school. I've become more extroverted but I fear I've alienated friends who were close to me because I've become a different person. I've gone out hundreds of times. I've seen progress. I've pulled girls into my bedroom. But for the life of me I can't get laid. And I feel hollow and numb and dead at this point. In fact I've been reading up on how to cope with suicide. I'm not trying to get all emo on you, but nothing else really makes me suicidal except this wall of countless rejection I keep running into. It's like my body is telling me on a cellular level that I'm useless...I can't spread my own genes, the one thing I was put here on this fucking earth to do. 

Guys I know who don't read any of this material do better than me. In fact, my 'wing' usually fucks all the female friends I've had for years. I've learned to deal with rejection, but I've come to the point where it's hopeless. To top if off I'm a good looking guy. But I've always been oblivious about women. In the past they would come to me, but now I find that when I want it and go after them, they run away.  

I might be moving back in with my folks soon due to me being broke. I dropped out of art school. My friends are all graduating college and looking at internships and grad school, and some marriage.  I'm young, 23, my grandfather just died, and I've been horribly introspective. I feel like I've dragged my soul through mud and slime by going out countless times only to fail everytime. Or learn something new. But I still come home alone. And feel empty. Again. 

I think I'll put this stuff on hold. I want to shut off the outside world on focus on my music and art again. I've put in hours of work into various girls and nothing has panned out. I think I do really well with a girl but she doesn't respond to my texts. I reject a girl only to have her blow up my phone like crazy. I never get what my heart desires, I'm a social outcast where I live, I'm an atheist in a christian town, I love books in a place that loves football, I'm a person that has let my artistic and musical capabilities fall to the way side because I wanted the immediate gratification of sex. And I've never gotten it. 

The last time I felt the warmth of real human female energy in front of me and we were bonding in a sexual manner was 2 years ago. I've had makeouts since then, but I hopelessly chase girls away. I can't do nothing but everytime I do something I shoot myself in the foot. I've come to the conclusion that this world is not made for me. I do not function correctly in this world. I harm myself more than I help myself. The earth may be pure and natural and beautiful and vibrant and full of life, but this society I was born into was not made for humans. It was made for machines. Humans are torn apart and destroyed from the core, and something as simple as connecting sexually with another human is so frustratingly and depressingly hard to find. I see the matrix for what it is, I see the social control, But I am currently powerless to manipulate it or navigate through it to my advantage. This is a new low point for me, usually I keep my chin up, but I feel broken. I'm bored with porn. I'm bored with the superficial games. Where are the real people at? I'm in my prime, why can I not function correctly in this 21st century environment. 

I don't know what to expect by posting this, but maybe if someone who has been in this space before can share some insights into how they got through it, I'd be all ears. "

Also, how would Hochelaga-Maisonneuve be for a neighbourhood, if we're looking for music/nightlife?

Edit: So looks like $10 is more reasonable for jobs I could get, still doable if I do 40-45 hours per week. Issue then is getting consistent work (although I could busk with friends to hopefully make up for any lost hours each day)."

What the hell do I do?",ingredient_mosteroid,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/mfxme/im_almost_about_to_leave_university_and_i_dont/,"So I'm currently in my final year of university, and I'm 20. I do a social sciences degree at a top-20 UK university (chose it because it was interesting, not for the ensuing job prospects). I'm heading for a 2.1, which I suppose is roughly equivalent to a B+ or ~3.2 GPA in the American system?

People left and right of me are talking about and applying for careers and internships, and to be brutally honest, I feel like a child amongst adults. I've done plenty of volunteering, so I'm not completely helpless, but have never had a job either. But this goes deeper than just careers. I don't feel at all... developed. I know I shouldn't expect to feel 'developed' at just 20, but I'm sure most people have some kind of identity by this point. I'm good at music (had my first gig a couple of weeks ago), have built my own [website](http://www.shufflemylife.com/beta2.html), am embroiled in university work, yet all this stuff's just making me feel even more lost. I'd never drop out (what a waste of two years and all the effort), but I've kind of realised just how much I don't know, and am clueless about. Of course there's others in my position, but ... 

My dream is to actually be proactive, to go and do things for myself, and not just drift along (even the first gig wasn't even arranged by me, but by the guy who wanted to do a live set with me). University work does not count as being proactive, because it is simply something I'm doing for a degree at the end of it (which is next to worthless now anyway because so many people have one, unemployment etc, etc). If there were no consequences, I wouldn't think twice about dropping out this second and pursuing music technology. I think that's the problem, being in the wrong place and commendably doing well enough to be averaging the grade I have been, but by no means in a place I feel satisfied  with. This makes me feel insecure, vulnerable and all these other endless adjectives. 

Obviously, with no formal qualifications in music technology, and the music industry being witness to some of the worst human beings imaginable (probably equivalent to financial institutions), I am also wary of making this my goal. 

I know all I can do is my best, and if I do badly, I do badly and university wasn't for me. But what then? 

Endless questions. Any advice, reassurance, stark wake-up calls, or anything would be hugely appreciated. No TL;DR because that will always be interpreted differently.

I happen to be french, living in France and everything...

How is my french-ness gonna look when facing the UK recruitors?

And is it possible to search/find something while being actually available only 3 months later (since I have a 3 months notice in my french job and would not want to resign before having something else to cling on to)?

However I just keep on getting negative responses, rude responses, and the one time I gathered all my guts to call, the conversation ended within 10 seconds without even having the time to thank her for her time because she just hung up on me. Most of the people don't ever respond to my request.
Do you guys know any way I could try to approach a company to ask to do my internship within their company? What would be the best way to ask them? It's getting a bit depressed to be turned down at least 20 times already. I even tried to convince them by telling I also would like to do a research for them, specially setup for their company so it wouldn't only be giving instead of also receiving something.
Thanks in advance; every little bit of info would help!"

After lurking on reddit for a few months, my first post ends up being here.

Hello all!

Alright, so.  Little brief introduction before I get to the meat of the post.  

Did a 12 month Network Admin course with a 3 month internship.   Got A+, CCNA, MCTS in AD and aiming for the server admin certs.  

I just recently got past the 3 month hump at my current place of work, flexing my fingers and such. My current project is to upgrade our virtual infrastructure. 2 Esxi hosts going to version 5, vcenter being taken off physical and a new one (version 5) being created virtually, and the database associated. 

I spent a good while researching and documenting the steps and procedures I need to follow to make this as smooth of an upgrade as possible. All the back-end stuff has been done, (Creation of the VM, Database on separate SQL server)  and I'm coming in on Sunday to complete it. 

This isn't really a question post, more of a... I'm pretty nervous, I don't want to fuck stuff up. This is all new territory for me and I hope I can pull it off.  

Edit: I'm home now - I'll get the information for you guys tomorrow. Keep an eye out then :D 


Edit #2.  Alrighty, back at work. Time to go over these various options, experiment, document, and prepare myself for sunday.

mfn4h,1,2011-11-17,"Stunned After Social Failure. Lost, depressed, and dunno what to do. ",Neolightl,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/mfn4h/stunned_after_social_failure_lost_depressed_and/,"Hey reddit. This is a long one.

I feel like a douche. 


This summer I took an art internship at a studio that I have oggled over since childhood, and I feel like I socially failed it. Getting this job was a lifetime achievement that I really busted my ass for. I had created the chance to meet and work with a bunch of people that were (and still are) idols to me. The production work they laid out was truly a fanboy's dream. I was lucky to be there, and felt very confident on the first day. I couldn't wait to immerse myself and be a part of the team - to show them that I had the creativity and drive to be as badass as they were. 


The trouble started on the second day. I woke up feeling emotionally out of it, and my first assignment (a REALLY simple task) took a while to get started. Then shit started to get bad. The two lead artists took me out for lunch. These guys are a huge inspiration to me, and alot of my more recent personal growth strides have come from simply checking out their work from time to time. The moment we walked out of the studio, a flip switched inside of me. I became extremely quiet, and very self concious. It felt like I was having some kind of heart pounding panic attack, and I proceded to make the worst first impression I have ever made in my life. I was unable to express myself and unable to get a sentence out without tripping over my words. On our way back to the studio, I felt so dissapointed. The lead arists seemed concerned...


So was I.


My awkward behavior persisted, and in some cases worsened. The culture of the studio was prett frat-housey and there was alot of joking and people making fun of each other going around. Very honest environment, but jokes that came by my way I would fail to see as jokes. I took everything personally, and couldnt relax. When I opened my mouth my voice would sometimes come out way too loud. I'd start to laugh for no reason at all. I would uncontrollably talk behind my hands that seemed to just force out strange gesticulations. Every lunch with the art team was a disaster. They were hillariously creative people, and I felt like any contribution to the conversation I could make was stupid. I truly felt dumb sitting next to these guys, and I felt ashamed of the fact that I had nothing to say. Sometimes I would get myself into some really retarded shit, like accidentally microwaving a soup for so long that it exploaded in the kitchen, speaking out of turn in a few small meetings, sulking about graduation/job insecurities infront of one of the lead artists in an effort to try to reach out to him - only to see it backfire in my face when he took it as me trying to beg to get hired. (This by far was the worst.) I started to hear more shit about me, like ""22 years old and not even the least bit interesting!"" or ""He wont talk to me because he likes my art too much"". I was hearing the results of my fear connecting with them - my isolation casuing their frustration. I hated hearing all of this because I've never screwed up like this before. I have plenty of friends back in college and I knew none of this had to happen. 


I felt like I was failing them - letting them down. They could have taken any other kid, and instead they had to deal with my emotional garbage that was some how disguising itself as a social disorder. Sometimes i'd hear backlash about it behind my back, and that got me really fucking mad at myself. The self-hate shrouded over my entire internship as potently as it does now. It drove me crazy, and for the first half of the four month job I was simply a nervous wreck.


Work, throughout the internship, was my one refuge. I took to isolating myself into working because if I couldn't at least churn out some awesome work then all would be lost. Fortunately, I believe I succeeded here. I have allways been confident about  my work ethic and ability to grow my art... That is because I have realized that creating stuff is an escape for me. I have run from many social situations to simply sit and create all day. I totally love it, but frustratingly I feel like it has allowed me to ignore the insecurities that plagued me at the job. I didn't hang out with the other intern much and everyone else was about 7 + years older so I was kind of alone. This kind of life is not sustainable. I want to be a fun guy to work with, and I want to be an awesome person. 


Nearing the conclusion of the internship I began to break out of it. I wanted them to know that I was aware of how awkward I've been - and that I didn't mean it. I made direct efforts to reach out to a few people I came to not stammer infront of, and also indulged in some public self-deprication. (Not greatest idea, but I found some comfort in taking jokes and laughing at myself). I realized that alot of my anxieties were coming from the fact that I was very self-absorbed. I wanted to be a badass at this studio, I wanted to befriend everyone, and that was my problem. I was only out for what I wanted, and wasn't thinking about anyone else. Sometimes I feel like this summer was supposed to teach me how I've been kind of selfish in that way - and sometimes afraid of connecting emotionally with people. Eventually I started to get open, voluntarily picked up coffee for people, and tried to become more sensitive to when others needed help. I tried to pick up my attitude, but I had and still feel so much dissapointment. Every now and then I would still feel terrible and fall into an awkward moment with someone.


At the end of the internship I said my good bye's to everyone. I left the art team for last. When I got around to them I felt a swell of emotion I couldn't handle, a swell that exploaded when the lead artists I had so much trouble connecting with gave me a hug that was so tight it lifted me up to the cieling. I bawled my eyes out like a fucking baby. The potential humiliation of it was washed away by this giant feeling of relief that I was at last able to reveal my emotions to these guys in a very real way. 


It's two months later now,


and I feel like a douche. 


My boss asked me to send him an email when I graduate, but I am very aprehensive about contacting them again. The more painful memories seem to control my life, and I have come back to college kind of forlorn, burnt out, and lifeless. I havn't painted anything decent in two months and have wasted alot of time playing games and forcing myself out to a few parties. 


I am not so sure what this summer was supposed to mean. I am looking for the next step in my life, but feel restraint. Sometimes I feel like I need to take some time to broaden myself and take some extra classes, be a student instead of living the work obsessed life I used to have. Sometimes I feel like that's a mistake, and that I should just graduate and get myself in a studio - forget about what happened this summer and keep moving forward. 


Most of all I want to know what the people I worked with think. I used to not care about what people thought of me, how I presented, the things I did and said, but now I do more than ever. 


Writing and posting this got a bunch off my chest, which I guess is what this reddit is about. If anyone did me the favor of reading it all, thanks alot, and do you happen to know: 


How I should move on from this?

I really don't know what to do about my professional life, and I'm quite upset about it.

The longest I've ever held a job was around 9 months. Of the 4 jobs I've had, I got fired from two, but under-performed at all of them. As in, had serious talks with bosses about poor performance. It's not that I am not capable, I just... seize up. Performance anxiety or stage fright or something. I lose focus, I get anxious, I ease my anxiety by distracting myself with procrastination, and then the work piles up higher and my anxiety gets worse. 

I actually got fired from my first job as a high school freshman. It was manual labor, and I got fired for not working fast enough. I was pretty upset about it at the time because I felt like I was working as fast as I could. 

I quit a few more jobs quickly in high school and college after just a few months. After graduating college, I had a ton of performance-based anxiety about my first job and quit it after a couple months. I started working as a para-professional in a public school, and that was okay, but I felt under-challenged. I got another job after that, which went well at first, but I got fired when my very nurturing boss was replaced with a boss who had more demands and my performance dropped as my anxiety rose. 

The only type of work I would say that I am ""good"" at is appointment or meeting-driven work, but pretty much every professional job has some sort of written work product.

I'm in professional school now, in the middle of a for-credit internship. My intern boss has had two serious ""performance"" talks with me. After the first, I was scared into action and thought I was back on track, but I neglected some instructions and then I got a second ""talk."" Now I am terrified, paralyzed and feeling so depressed and upset. After the meeting, I went home and slept all day. 

Please TwoX, help me figure out what I need to do to stay on track, be productive, and be a good employee. I have a job lined up for after graduation, and I really, really, really want to not fuck up for once. "
mfhd3,9,2011-11-17,What do I even do?,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/mfhd3/what_do_i_even_do/,"So, to begin, I feel like nobody is going to take me seriously because I just created an account.  I've been lurking for years, and never felt the need to say anything because...well, I don't know why.  I just didn't.  But if you have something to say, some advice that might dig me out of this hole, I would love to hear it.  Please.
I'm gonna start from the beginning of my troubles.
I was a ""popular"" kid until I started middle school.  Then, for whatever reason, I was suddenly ostracized.  I think it may have been because I was a smaller kid at that point, and everyone who was trying to claw their way up the social ladder saw me as an easy target.  I hadn't always been this way (small, I mean)- in third grade, I was the third tallest kid in school, and in seventh, among the ten shortest.  Even my supposed ""friends"" were assholes.  They didn't resort to any physical abuse, for the most part, but were constantly verbally assaulting me about my size, goading me to fight them because they knew I wouldn't fight because I couldn't win.  I started having a lot of suicidal thoughts by the end of eighth grade, literally not being able to think of anything else when I was falling asleep except killing myself.
One night I woke my mom up at three in the morning, telling her ""I'm afraid because I don't want to kill myself.""  She had me see a psychologist, which did not help anything.  I'm not going to get into specifics, but, to simplify, I can talk about how my week went with my best friend (not that I had one at this time).  
Anyways, high school was a little better.  I had always been a good student, and was enjoying every chance I got to display my intelligence and make someone else look dumb.  Looking back, it was kind of my ""revenge,"" if you can call it that.  I had a new group of ""friends,"" but was somewhat embarrassed to hang out with them; I was used to being in the ""cool"" clique.  We never really meshed- well, except for one guy.  But, as it turns out, he ended up being gay.  This is not and never was an issue for me in and of itself, it just hurt me that he never told me this until college.  I mean, I sat downstairs by myself senior year at his girlfriend's house while he fucked her.
I did grow in high school, and thanks to the aforementioned gay friend, ended up joining the wrestling team with him (save the jokes).  I started out at 103 my sophomore year, then started to grow: 135 junior year, and 162 my senior year.  To be honest, I was never very good, but somehow managed to place third in conference.  My complete and utter fear of failure probably motivated me.
As I said, I had always been good in school.  I got a 1400 on the SAT (when it was out of 1600) and a 33 on the ACT (out of 36).  I got into every college I applied to.  The last week of senior year, a kid I knew from class and myself decided to skip the AP physics test because we didn't think we'd do well.  Sidebar: good choice, everyone I talked to got a 1 or a 2, scored 5s on the three other AP tests I took.  While this may seem like a bad choice, it was an important twist.  This kid, who I barely knew at the time, is my best friend in the world to this very day.
Skip to college.
I left the state and went to school 2000 miles away.  I started smoking a lot of pot.  I had smoked before, but it was maybe twice a month.  I started drinking and doing coke.  This didn't affect my grades, I was still pulling a 3.6, despite rarely attending class.  Then, my sophomore year, during winter break, my parents dropped a bomb.  They were getting divorced.  I was getting pulled out of school.  I had $24k in scholarships, but that still left $12k a year out of pocket/loans, and we could no longer afford it.  I moved home.
I worked some jobs I hated while I was back, and ended up dating a girl I really, truly loved.  During this time, I hung out with one of her friends who was a lesbian, Caitlin.  Eventually, this girl and I broke up- she cheated on me, and I was shattered.  We had been living together with a couple of my friends, and I had been working two jobs and going to school (for only one semester) to pay both her rent and my own.  
I was heartbroken.  It had never hurt so badly.  I ended up hanging out with Caitlin again one evening shortly after the breakup, and she shot heroin.  She offered me some, and I did it.  This was the beginning of the end.  I brought another friend into the opiate game, and he ended up with a prescription for oxycontin.  We were getting fucked up every night.
The friend (who was also very smart) and I ended up moving to Las Vegas for a very well-paid internship.  I quit both of my jobs with no notice.  While in Vegas, we went doctor-shopping on the weekends so we both had a full bottle of pills for the week.  It was fucked up.
Anyways, the internship ended, and I moved home.  Ended up kicking opiates cold turkey because his RX ran out.  I got a job, and ended up dating a very cute girl who was totally clean, which led to me even quitting smoking pot.
After a few months, I started smoking again, and got her to smoke.  She liked it, so we did it pretty much nightly.  This girl also happened to have very rich parents, so I had access to a bunch of money.  I broke my wrist and was not able to work for two months, and in this time, got into heroin.  Like REALLY into heroin.   Previously it had mostly been pills, but this time I was spending a lot of time in the hood every single day, just trying to score.  Eventually I came clean to both my girlfriend and my parents about this, and got into treatment.  Shortly after, she dumped me.
So, I successfully completed treatment and had been working as a server.  Relapse.  Came clean again to the parents about what had happened, but couldn't afford treatment this time around, money was tight.  So, I've been getting my Subutex on ""the street"" from a friend of mine who is a doctor.  Ended up getting fired for a bullshit reason (I gave a 20 year old coworker a beer out of my pitcher after work, even though the owners had let her drink at the bar countless times before), and am currently on unemployment.  It runs out in a month.
I have been desperately looking for a job, and am signed on with an IT recruiter (got 95th percentile on their skills test, largest IT recruiter in the nation).  Nothing has worked out.  I am literally four weeks away from living in my car, and like eighth grade, when I lay down to sleep, all I can think about is killing myself.  This week I have started to look for jobs that I consider ""below"" me.  I am two months away from getting off of the Subutex- I wanted to do it December 1st, but am just not ready.  I haven't slipped on the drugs at all, which I am very proud of (and even quit smoking pot for the first ever, which has now been six months clean), but feel more hopeless than ever.  All I can think about is that if I don't have a job by the time I get my last unemployment check, I am going to spend that entire check on heroin, shoot it all at once, and check out.
I need something to hold on to."
mfg8k,0,2011-11-17,My Thoughts on Law School,Me_Ranting,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/mfg8k/my_thoughts_on_law_school/,"
Hey everyone.  I don’t know if I just need to write this out for cathartic reasons or maybe I’m looking for someone to renew my spirits about the whole thing or warn others thinking about going to law school, but this is my rant about law school.

	
I’m a 3L in a part time program, so I have one more year after this.  I have slightly above average grades in a second tier law school.  I was working full time before starting law school and switched to part time and then was laid off.  I worked part time my first year and then got laid off and have just been going to school part time since then.

	
The only reason I decided to attend law school was to make more money.  I never had and still don’t have any particular interest or motivation in any part of the law. 

	
I’m sitting here figuring it out and it is doubtful that it will have been worth it for me to have gone to law school even 10 years after I’m out.  I projected what I believe I would have made in my old career over 10 years and compared it to what I can expect to make once I graduate and then subtracted the amount of my loans.  I know that entire calculation is a lot of guess work, but it’s the only thing to go on.  I can adjust the projections to make it better or worse, but it’s disheartening knowing what I could have been making and instead I’m taking useless classes (more on that to come).  

	
That’s my main gripe.  I know in the grand scheme of things it is a first world problem and that I’m not going to starve, but for the amount of time, effort and money that school is costing me, it is just depressing that it could end up maybe not being worth it.  I feel like my family and friends don’t grasp this and think “Oh, you’ll make a ton of money as a lawyer.”  I hope that is true, but as you can tell from the tone of this, I am not optimistic.     

	
My next complaint is the overall uselessness of the entire process.  The only things I have learned that are useful are how to do legal research (using Westlaw and LexisNexis) and then some of the overall legal process and the way to analyze a legal problem.  I have had some pretty poor teachers, which is my schools’ fault, but even in the classes with good teachers, you learn the information for the test and just forget it right after.  That’s not a problem with only law school though, as I have felt that way since middle school.  I feel like you learn everything you need to know in the first semester and anything that you are going to become really knowledgeable about you will learn while actually being out in practice.  
	

All of the substantive law classes that I’ve had are just learn it for the final and move on.  I’ve had two of my worst professors in my procedural classes, so what I understand of civil procedure and evidence has been from Barbri.  While I’m on the topic of teachers, I did have one that was like the guy from the Paper Chase, with the Socratic Method and randomly calling on you and giving you are hard time if you don’t know the answer.  I found it to be annoying and him to be an asshole.  Berating someone for getting the facts or the reasoning of the court confused wasn’t an effective use of my time.  Luckily I can make my own schedule and avoid the teachers like him from now on. 
	  

Then there are the other people in my classes.  I feel like for the most part everyone has swallowed the Kool-Aid and loves everything about law school.  Even the people that I talk to that do complain somewhat don’t seems to have the disdain for it that I do.  During my first year when I was working part time and only going to school at night, everyone seemed to be getting involved in all the clubs and activities and everything else going on.  I was just trying to get the stupid cases read in case I got called on that night.  For what it’s worth, I feel like being in the part time evening program the first year meant I missed out on the bonding and friend making process that full time people had.  People were coming to class after work and just wanted to get home when class was over.  I have friends in my classes, but I take day classes now and people seem to just be closer than at night.  

	
As of right now, I just take regular classes.  People that I know write on or edit journals, are involved in clinics, or have internships or externships.  The journals seem to be a massive waste of time.  I know they look good on your resume and that is why people do them, but it just doesn’t seem to be worth the work.  I have heard that journal experience is pretty much mandatory for the federal judiciary, academia, and big law firms, but I have no interest in working in those areas, which is why I picked up the writing competition to get on the journals and didn’t bother to do it.  I’m hoping to get a summer internship, so that I will finally have some sort of legal experience.  Without going into it, my prior work experience relates to what I will likely do as a lawyer, so it’s not like I will have no relevant experience on my resume.

	
Thanks for reading if you’re still with me.  Let me address a point that I’m sure some of you have thought by now: that I am lazy.  I see people in my classes that work full time and then come to school part time.  I don’t have it in me at this point in my life and my circumstances don’t necessitate it.  I worked full time and went to school full time for most of undergrad and I felt like the reward for that was just getting to work more full time when I got out.  The only real benefit that I feel law school has given me is that I have not needed to work full time.  As much as I dislike law school, I disliked working full time at my last job even more.  Switching to part time at that job was good and then getting laid off has been even better.  The time I have spent laid off has shown me what I think is really important, and it isn’t school right now or going to be my job when I go back to work.  All I want is to make a decent amount of money and have time and money to spend on things that I actually enjoy.    
	

So that’s what I have to say on the subject.  Let me know what you think or maybe take my perspective into consideration if you are deciding whether or not to go, but I just felt like I needed to write this all out and get some sort of feedback.  Thanks.

The problem is a TON of people (hundreds) are pre-pharmacy majors and drop it due to the insane coursework (the class of pharmacy students admitted last year was well under 200, and was probably around 150ish).  Right now I am doing fine in my classes (have a 4.0 or something around it in chem, despite not paying much attention in the lectures) and have around a 2.7 to 3.0 in biology (not my strongest subject).  I am very good at math, and seem to be doing well in chem.  So my questions:

* How hard is it to keep up with the work in upper levels of undergrad (organic chem, physiology, cell bio etc), and how much harder is the work when in pharmacy school?

* Despite being guaranteed a spot in pharmacy school, if when I apply for pharmacy school my grades are below a 3.5 or if I withdrawal from a class (there's a list of qualifiers) I can't get a guaranteed spot, but I can still get in.  What would give me an edge over the other students applying?  I did an internship at a hospital my senior year of high school and had an amazing experience that confirmed to me that I wanted to go into pharmacy, but what else should I have?  Should I look into getting a job as a pham tech? (Also worth noting, a lot of the people that I know that want to go into pharmacy are obviously doing it for the money.  I am one of the people that doesn't mind how much it pays, though after 7 years of college this might change, I am really interested in this stuff.  I genuinely want to know how the stuff works, why it works and all that stuff.  How can I convey this to somebody that would potentially be interviewing me?)

* What advice (if any) do you have for me?"

Got quite a few compliments from people on my resume based some of the advice given to me and others on /r/resumes. Thanks!

That said I'm currently in my senior year and applying for a *full time* position.  I've done some resume updating/restructuring.  Any and all criticisms or advice would be greatly appreciated!

mf7fu,3,2011-11-16,"Reddit, I need some professional advice.",[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/mf7fu/reddit_i_need_some_professional_advice/,"Dear reddit community,

I'm sort of new here. I've been browsing reddit for just a few months, but I've seen the valuable input that this selfless community will give to others in need. My situation isn't particularly dire, but I feel that after being peer pressured into believing that I made the wrong decision, I need to know if I made the right choice or not so that I can better handle myself in the future. Furthermore, I just want to make it clear that I'm not gloating about anything. I just need some professional advice regarding the situation below.

So a little background. I'm a recent college graduate with a degree in environmental engineering. Like many of us living in this country, I've had terrible luck trying to find a job. I decided to take on a different approach to my job search by calling in to my county office regarding potential internships related to my field, instead of applying on internet job boards and craigslist. About a month later, I get a call back from the county expressing their interest in taking me on and that I should follow up with someone. I call this person, exchange a few phone calls and a couple of emails, and after another couple of weeks I was offered an internship (unpaid) at the county. The person I've been communicating with tells me to think about it for a day, and I accept the position the next day.

Now here's the real kicker. The next day after accepting the position, I get a call from one of the other agencies that I had applied to about a month and a half ago. They asked me to come over for an interview. I politely declined because I had already accepted the internship. This was a paid position. I told some of my friends about what I did and they felt that I should have said yes to the interview. I felt that if I had said yes, I would be disrespecting the individual that had been taking time out of their own work schedule to assist me with a project idea for the internship. The biggest reason that I said no was that I had already accepted the internship. Furthermore, the internship is more geared towards a field that interests me and has more potential to advance the skills that I want for my future career. I understand that I could have at least said yes for interview experience, but in my mind I knew that I didn't want to waste anyone's time if I felt like I was going to decline the position anyway. Was this the right choice?

**TL;DR:** I was offered an interview for a paid position a day after accepting a position for an unpaid internship. Is it wrong to pursue a potential opportunity to risk jeopardizing a guaranteed one?"
mf1ly,8,2011-11-16,NSA Co-op?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mf1ly/nsa_coop/,"Hi all, I am currently a sophomore pursuing a CS degree and am looking into internships for this summer, but I am also open to doing a co-op. NSA has given me a conditional offer assuming I pass the background checks and all that for their CS co-op program which is 52 weeks long, although broken up into multiple segments of various lengths. Now my question is that I am much more interested in writing software that is used outside of the organization I write it for and open source software. Government work is all classified and I'm not sure how much software I would work on would be used outside of the NSA.

I am also told that 95% of co-op's stay on to become full time employees and I'm really not sure if I'm ready for such a big commitment. Does anyone have an experience with the NSA (that they can talk about), or know if they sound like a place I would fit in given my interest in open source software? Anything I'm being naive about?

I'm a 1L, just beginning the internship search. As such, I've been going over all the essentials, and couldn't help but notice that I have just about nothing to put on my resumé towards job experience.

The explanations for why mostly revolves around being picky, somehow getting into my head that a retail job wouldn't be useful career-wise, and the economy (once I disabused myself of the former notion).

I've got academic activities and honors out the wazoo, but that still leaves a very sad half page of whiteness. The only thing I could really put there is two years of being a camp counselor, but that was during my early high-school years, and I get the feeling putting *just* that down could look worse than nothing.

It might not be as big a deal as I'm thinking, but all the same, wat do?"

Yesterday I finally cut it off with a girl who I've kept around for way too long, who has been a leech on my energy and a sinkhole of emotional well-being. I give partial credit to NoFap, for helping me clear my head and giving me the motivation to make my situation better.

But now that I don't have a reliable fuckbuddy, I have no idea how long I'll be going without sex. Previously in the challenge, I would just make a booty call if my urge to release got too excruciating. Now I'm in the big leagues.

I'm starting a new internship on Monday at my dream company. I plan to take that company by STORM, learn my duties quickly, and get recognized as a force within my department. NoFap is going to help me along that path by giving me some more of that FIRE.

My life is on an upwards trajectory. I've cut ties that were holding me back, and I'm undertaking a major opportunity. I'm young, so although I don't have experience and wisdom on my side, what I do have is energy. That's what I have to offer this world: energy. It would be selfish and self-defeating of me to squander that energy masturbating to porn. Instead I'm going use that energy to build myself the best possible life I can now. It would be stupid for me not to. I'm only this young once.

No regrets.

mgzw0,0,2011-11-18,How do I breakup with her?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/mgzw0/how_do_i_breakup_with_her/,"I posted yesterday about whether or not I should break up with my girlfriend, but it didnt make it through the spam filter.

A little back story. I'm 19, she's 20. We met eachother through work with our local NASA high school activities. We both had an internship there as well and worked in the same building. This was the summer before our freshmen year (We are both sophomores now). This is when I started to develop a serious crush on her. I learned that she was going to the same university as me, but that she had a boyfriend. I figured it wouldnt last one college began and decided to wait it out. For some reason, I was really attracted to her cutesy-ness. Like she was very innocent and bubbly. Oh, and she's smarter than me. Which is really big, cause if a girl knows what a valence electron is, she becomes instantly 5x hotter to me.

So Freshmen year rolls around and she breaks up with her boyfriend. We started a small fling. Nothing major, just hung out alot and occasionally made out. She was really uncomfortable with me drinking and smoking, so I stopped hanging out with her, cause its college. I'm going to be drinking and smoking. There were some other reasons as well, which I forgot about until recently.

We still texted a lot and she actually smoked weed with me for her first time in the spring. I didn't think much of it at the time.

Fast forward to about two months ago and sophomore year is beginning. I figured I'd ask her out on a date because she seemed to be more lax toward drinking and smoking. After dinner and a movie, we were at her place and were drinking with her roommate. We ended up making out and I spent the night. No sex, just light touching. About where we left off a year ago.

I start seeing her more and more and we both came to the realization we were boyfriend and girlfriend. I became more open with her. This was my first real relationship.

The thing is, she is starting to annoy the fuck out of me. The bubbly and cute personality seems to be some sort of coping mechanism from her mom being bat shit insane when she was growing up. She acts like a 7 year old for the first half hour I see her, and intermittently for the rest of the time. At first it was cute, but now its fucking annoying. Like I can't have a conversation with her cause she will literally go ""Wheeeeeeeee, I like puppies. Did you know I liked puppies?"" She actually told me that last night after I asked her something. 

Theres a multitude of other reasons I don't want to be with her anymore. She actually isn't cool with me smoking, though she puts up a front like she is. something along the lines of ""I'm alright with you smoking weed everyonce in a while, but I don't see why someone would do it everyday."" I dont think she realizes I smoke everyday. 

Also, she thinks her handjobs are the best. Which they aren't. They're fine foreplay, but it shouldn't be what an hour of making out ends with. I understand that she isn't ready for the next level of intimacy (she blew me once, but thats been it) because we've talked about it. Our conversation ended with if you're not ready to blow me, please don't bring my penis out. Which she still does. 

A little info about myself is that I am almost a polar opposite of her. She was raised in a small farm town as a daddy's little princes. Grew up on Disney. I am from the inner city and am a huge metal head. I despise Disney. Usually that wouldn't matter, but this girl fucking loves disney. I know remember that this is also part of the reason I stopped hanging out with her a year ago. We have nothing in common besides both of us being smart.

TL;DR: I started dating a girl because she was smart and cute. Had a fling a year ago, but stopped talking to her cause she was too cutesy and we had nothing in common. Started dating her again this year, thinking she mightve matured, but hasn't. Realize I want to breakup with her for the same reasons we stopped hanging out a year ago. Want to let her off easy and without hurting her feelings. Since this is my first real relationship, I have know idea how to do this. 

EDIT: Wont do it, like her too damn much"

I am making the decision to drop out of my university right now in North Carolina and pursue my dream to act. I have been doing theatre since I was a kid, and was in a few commercials. I know this isn't ideal at all. But I am not happy where I am and this dream/desire will not go away. I have a chance to shack up with my friend in brooklynn and I have about $3,500 going into this. How fast do you think I'd be able to find a job? Here is my experience:

I have worked in 3 different restaurants, all high volume, each restaurant I have over 6 months experience in.

I have managed a coffee shop for a year in the downtown of the collegetown I currently live in.

As of right now I am an intern in the HR department of a huge manufacturer or off shore fishing boats.

I don't really care what I do up there as long as it pays me enough for rent($600 month) and food (I'll eat cheap I always do.)

What are my options people. Is this unattainable or is this something I can legitimately do. Let me know if you have personal experience to help out with. Thanks guys.

EDIT: I am going to transfer to a community college back home (where my life is) and try to transfer to the local university over the summer. I will eventually make it up to NYC one day, whether its just to live or to make it. Thanks for all the support and info guys!"

I am an atheist, I've been an atheist since 14 yr old. I'm  20 now. I'm in a rather prestigious university in Canada with a great internship program, which almost guarantees future employment with high pay.
Ever since I've entered this university, I've never tried my best or work hard. I'm really lazy, although I know how hard I work now will affect my future employment opportunities.
Especially in the past few month I've been extremely lazy to the point that I don't even care if I fail a course. It started when I'm separated apart from one of my close friend. Aside from him, I've got no one else to speak my mind out to. I've been treating this friend as close as family before, replacing my parents which I have a very poor relationship to. I have some other friends, but none of them feels close, nor truly care about me. I've been to this kind of situation before, it was back when I was 12, back then my only friend was God, and I would speak my mind out to God. As a gradually got a real friend who I can speak my mind with, I've stopped praying to God, and as I grew older I realized God doesn't exist. Now I'm back to the same situation again, this time absolutely no support from anyone. It is also hard to make new friends because it seems at university, only thing these people care about are grades. 
I really have 0 motivation to do anything, assignment, eating, sleeping, going to class and etc. (surpringly I'm not feeling depressed, I was depressed before, but now I just feel empty of emotion) The only thing I do is surf reddit, read comments occasionally post something. Chat with friends or strangers online. Call them and hope to get a hint that they care about me.
I know that what I'm doing now would affect greatly of my future, and I feel that my future self would regret what I'm doing now. Even with all this, I'm just too lazy to push myself. 
The only thing I can think of is to maybe pray to God again, but now I just know he doesn't exist and it just wouldn't have the same healing effect as  before.
So now, I'm just wondering what motivates other atheist to do what they have to do.
I know this post probably wouldn't get much attention, but please if you read this, reply with a comment to let me know what you feel and what motivates you. Maybe your reply would somehow help me in making myself motivated."

I have started performing, singing, playing piano for people as a way to learn how to manage anxiety and it has been helping some but I have not fucking clue how to trust people or make friends.  I also can't afford therapy anymore because I have no money.  I really don't have anything in my life figure figured out and I am still dealing with mental health issues from sexual abuse as a child.  I am truly the forever alone type, I have no friends, have never dated, ect, but I am trying to get my shit together because I am going to get evicted if i don't make money. 


I am not really proud of this but part of the reason my grades were decent is that I have cheated in a number of classes.  Not on tests, just homework assignments.  The other thing is that many of my senior level classes had group projects.  Because of the depression and anxiety I was usually the one who slacks in a group project setting.  I hate being that guy because before I was super depressed I was able to work in groups and tried my best to contribute.  Because of this I can't really say I have learned all that much in those classes that required group work because I let the other group members do the work.  I feel like a terrible person for this, i really do and it has ended up fucking me over because I feel like I don't have programming skills.  I am only now just starting to work on some open source projects in my free time.


I am at a point though were if i don't make money I can't afford to pay rent.  So i applied for a job and while I don't think i was dishonest on my resume, exaggerated my abilities a little.  I did have two interviews and I was able to make a good impression i guess because they asked me a lot of questions and I did my best to explain myself and ask questions.  I feel like a worthless lying piece of shit for exaggerating some things though.  I just don't know what to do anymore.   I have like 3 weeks before the job starts so I am gonna work hard to get my skills up to par.  I don't like CS all that much but that is what my degree is in.  At this point i have no choice but to get a job in CS until i figure out what i really want to do




tl;dr
Sorry for the rant.  I am just looking for advice from anyone who dealt with a similar situation.  Because of the abuse i suffered, among other difficult things in my life, I am broken in a way but I have no choice but do get a job because I can't live of my savings anymore."

I've cut off all contact with my ex. I go to the gym, hang out with friends, go to school and intern with the ASPCA. My days are busy, eventful, and full. 

I haven't talked to my ex in 3 months. In the 3 months we have been broken up, I starting dating his brothers best friend. He turned out to be a jerk.. and now I'm single again. 

Throughout my whole relationship with this new guy, I couldnt get over my ex. I met new friends, new people, had full days.. and still.. by the end of the night.. it was ALWAYS him that was on my mind. 

Even after a new boyfriend, new friends, a new job and no contact, AND the blatant obviousness of why we will never work out... I still lay awake at night, replaying his goodbye over and over again. 

I've come to the conclusion that there is a psychological reason humans can't seem to move on, like some sort of evolutionary adaption.. and I'm going to stick with it until I can think of another reason to make me feel better about this situation.

Can anyone tell me how I can stop these thoughts for good? Sometimes it feels like time won't..."

I am 24f, and my boyfriend is 22. We have been dating for ~9 months. He has a really active life (exercises almost every day, has a couple of hobbies, refuses to miss any football/hockey/basketball games) whereas I am having a lot less fun living two hours from family and friends, finishing up a degree and working both a job and an internship. The time I do spend with him is pretty much the only good part of my life right now.

Anyways, a week and a half ago, I was lucky enough to get a gnarly UTI, which I tried to treat myself with cranberry pills and lots of liquids. Well, the delightful pissing fire turned into gnawing pain in my lower back that kept me up even more than the constant urination did. Things weren't getting better, so I finally went to a clinic, and found out the infection spread to my kidneys.

Sent a text to boyfriend about the situation, and that if I was unable to keep down liquids and if my fever got worse, I was advised to go to the hospital. In response, I got a ""wow, sorry. feel better"" reply. Am I a moron for expecting a bit more concern? The awesome part is that he's supposed to go to visit a friend out of state tomorrow. There's no way I would try to guilt him into not going, but I just feel that if my boyfriend was sick, I might second guess my weekend plans, and ask him if he would like me to cancel the trip. I should mention that over the summer, I had an allergic reaction and went into anaphylaxis (I know, my body's a lemon), requiring an overnight hospital stay in the ICU. This also happened to coincide with him going out of town with friends. He didn't offer to stay, which bummed me out, but since I wasn't horribly ill, I let it slide. This time though, I find myself upset. The icing on the shit cake is that he was supposed to spend the night tonight, but apparently he wasn't able to get to the gym earlier, so he can't even come by for the night. I told him it made me sad that he didn't seem all that concerned about my well-being. He told me there was no point for him to stick around. He doesn't seem to feel that my being ill and wanting support is valid. RA, I'm sick and selfish me would just love a backrub and some spooning.

Trying to process this, it just seems to me that he has no desire to make me a priority. Our relationship seems almost completely on his terms. If I didn't have a shitload of responsibility in my life, I think I would've probably noticed it sooner. I don't want to overreact, so I am wondering, RA, is something so simple enough of a sign that this relationship isn't sticking? Is this guy a dick, or am I expecting too much? Please be nice :/ . I peruse this subreddit quite often, and some people can be downright mean."

I feel terrible and empty without them and I feel myself always feeling like I'm missing something. as someone who combats anxiety daily now going to work is even more of a challenge. Since this is only an internship I decided to abide by their silly rules for the time being.

If anyone knows an online retailer that sells hinged lip jewelry I would really appreciate it. I cant seem to find any retailers that sell them and I need something I can take out and put back in with no pain and no fuss. I like the look of a seamless ring for my Medusa/septum piercings.

My fiance and I are adopting our very first cat, and it's one that needs love! A friend of a friend interns at a program that provides people with mental disabilities with housing or help to maintain the housing they have.  One of their clients dropped off for a bit and when they went to do a home visit, his or her cat was found starving and the cat was taken away.  The cat needs a home and our home needs a cat, so my friend hooked us up with the person fostering.

This being my first cat, I was wondering about the basics. So far, we're getting a litter box, food and water dishes, and an alpine scratcher (all of my friends' cats loooove these) and I'm sticking all of my knitting yarn in a closet with a closed door.  Is there anything we're forgetting?

Furthermore, I was wondering if anybody knows about the special care that a cat that has been starving in the recent past needs?  Is there a special food that we can buy to help this cat put on weight now, without him become a fat cat?  Does anybody know any online resources about getting your home cat-ready?

The cat was originally from a shelter, so he has been vaccinated and neutered.  I think we should take him for a check-up anyway, considering the health crisis he's had recently.  Thanks!

What sort of out of classroom activities related to engineering are there? Are there lots of opportunities to intern in Houston? How's Houston (I'm from Boston) ? What's your favorite thing about Rice? Lastly, the other schools I'm also applying to are: Northwestern, Cornell, Duke, Brown, Michigan, UVA, GeorgiaTech and MIT. How does Rice compare to these schools (on engineering academics and overall atmosphere/student life)?

I know these are a lot of questions, but any input would be really helpful.

mi6yr,10,2011-11-19,Internship and GPA frustration,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/mi6yr/internship_and_gpa_frustration/,"Hello Everyone,

I'm a Senior studying Environmental Engineering and going to grad school next year for my Masters in Environmental Engineering. This is the last opportunity for me to get an internship over the summer. So far I haven't gotten anything besides a denial from companies. My frustration level is going through the roof because companies always write me off from my GPA. I get it my GPA sucks and its not what companies are looking for. Well my GPA doesn't reflect how much time and effort I put into my classes. I'm dyslexic and have to bust my ass to keep up with people who make ""A's"" without trying, but can't say I'm dyslexic to companies because they dont want ""idiots"". By no means am I an idiot and my professors really took the time to notice that this semester too. Even though I may have one of the worst GPA in the program, professors still see me as one of the smartest. I'm just a student to them who is a horrible test taker and writer, but a great engineers who puts in the most work and is always looking for ways to improve and learn. 

What I'm trying to say is companies never take the time to look past my GPA and look at everything else on my resume. Haven't even gotten an interview yet because I can't even pass that first hurdle of GPA requirement. Though, somehow I keep applying thinking something will change, but nothing ever does and never get an interview. 

I'm just glad that my professors can final see me being a good engineering student. Like just recently the head chancellor of Environmental Engineering offered me the first TA position for intro to Environmental Engineering. She told me, ""I wouldn't be offering you the job if I didn't think you were the most qualified."" However, she can't offer me a job outside of my college experience. 

So I'm asking you redditors, does anyone know where I can get good advice on resume building? Such as examples of good resumes. Also does anyone know any companies that are looking for interns for environmental engineering? I have no problem traveling across the world if its needed. Metting and making new friends has never been a problem for me. "

What I'd like to know is whether the standard of athletes and organised competition is broadly comparable or not, e.g. are scholarship opportunities similar for potential student athletes, are facilities similar, crowds, general following etc. I have read that the U of british columbia has considered joining the NCAA div II, is that correct?

Provided I survive the finals of this semester, this spring I will only need to finish my thesis to receive my Master's (yay!)

Most recently as well I went to a conference for a portion of my industry and did a presentation on the research, programming, and NUI design I had done this past summer. It went over well, everyone loved it, I have people fighting over me for who gets me as a spring intern. Awesome, right?

On top of the stress of figuring out all the logistics because every single opportunity is out of state, the other thing is I'm totally pre-everything MTF. A counselor I talked to is helping me to get on a publicly offered university health care plan for people like me with no money so I can find a specialist and sort out where on the continuum I land. At first, I thought this was great timing, as I might be able to start transitioning (if necessary) before career hunting, so I'd get to introduce myself to the professional world under the proper identity.

However, because of this conference I'm being pressured to pick an internship somewhere, and I keep citing ""personal reasons"" as why I can't make a decision at the moment, because all these internships are out of state and part-time which means no insurance, which means no therapist, which means I get to stay just where I am now because I couldn't afford anything else all for the sake of getting paid barely anything but ""lots of awesome experience"".

The attention I got at this conference though (which totally loads the ""coming out"" gun with some potentially explosive rounds down the road) has put a lot of pressure on me to make a decision. I don't know how to keep explaining to my professors why I need to stay in state. I'm in an arts + comp. sci. program, so they're very understanding. I was thinking of coming out to my thesis chair (conveniently also the department head) to say I need to stay around in state to get the help available for some severe gender identity issues, but I don't know if it's the best idea. I just need to get the pressure off and get people to realize that I'm dealing with something rather serious to my long-term happiness."

The past four months or so have been a bit...well...fucked. My girlfriend's depression returned. My OCD flared up at the same time, and, well, we ended up splitting a couple of months ago. We still talked, which could have made it harder, I mean, I still liked her at the time and wanted it to work out. A couple of weeks ago, we met up and had a chat. We both seemed fine around each other, I mean, we'd both started getting our lives back on track again. Afterwards, I asked if we could try it all again, but got a bit of a confusing answer along the lines of ""yes, but I need a little more time to sort something out"". Turns out she'd gotten close to someone else, but had then decided to cut that off.

Sadly though, that never came around, despite me trying to ask if she wanted to do anything. Finally, this all came up and ended up with her saying she'd gotten close to someone else (different to the first one) and couldn't deny she was close, and that she likes me as a friend. Of course, this was a bit soul crushing (especially given the person, but it's not apt to go down that route here). I was annoyed at something, I don't know if it was her, me, or the person she had gotten with.
Which brings us to a couple of days ago. Four months of trying to understand her depression, trying to hold a relationship together, trying to hold my job down (which, if it wasn't an internship at the university, I'd have probably been fired from by not putting enough hours in), trying to keep myself together, trying to hold down my PhD, and finally trying to understand what the hell was going on. I had no drive or energy, my OCD flared up and I had to keep it under control, and I just generally felt crap. Then finally, albeit after a good session of sorrow drowning with spirits and Mario Kart with a close friend, it was as if a weight had been lifted. I woke up on Thursday with a little hangover, but more importantly, I just didn't, well, care any more. I opened the curtains, went out into a lovely sunny day, put Foo Fighters on on my phone, turned it up, and just said ""fuck it, I'm going to make this day amazing"".

I went to see a bunch of friends, went on a semi-date, and had an amazing day. I have no idea how, but any worry from before had just, gone. In a sadistic sort of way, it seemed like closure. Only a week or so before, I was on the edge of taking a leave of absence from university. Now I see opportunity again. I feel better, I feel like I have drive. I feel like I want to live again. The intrusive thoughts of suicide have gone, and I feel like I have my OCD in better control than I did a year ago. Hell, I don't even know what is going on from the semi-date, yet, I seem fine about it, which would normally have me being paranoid and worried before. Of course, this isn't over. I'll never escape my issues fully, but at least for now, I hope I can get a few more years like this in before I come crashing again.

Again, I don't really know why I wrote this. I think I just needed to get it down. Get some final closure on my thoughts and get them out there. That said, thanks to the people in /r/OCD, /r/depression, /r/offmychest and /r/relationships. I don't think I could have got through this in my current state without those, and my close friends. To anyone else struggling with relationship issues or post-breakup issues, it gets better. It takes time, and sometimes something awful turns out to be one of the best things ever, but it gets better with time. Good luck to you all."

I think I need to get this off my chest, even though it's something great. I guess you could also take it as a story of hope though.

The past four months or so have been a bit...well...fucked. My girlfriend's depression returned. My OCD flared up at the same time, and, well, we ended up splitting a couple of months ago. We still talked, which could have made it harder, I mean, I still liked her at the time and wanted it to work out. A couple of weeks ago, we met up and had a chat. We both seemed fine around each other, I mean, we'd both started getting our lives back on track again. Afterwards, I asked if we could try it all again, but got a bit of a confusing answer along the lines of ""yes, but I need a little more time to sort something out"". Turns out she'd gotten close to someone else, but had then decided to cut that off.

Sadly though, that never came around, despite me trying to ask if she wanted to do anything. Finally, this all came up and ended up with her saying she'd gotten close to someone else (different to the first one) and couldn't deny she was close, and that she likes me as a friend.

mjcn9,12,2011-11-20,How can I turn my life around and get somewhere I'm happy with,mississippiTaoist,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/mjcn9/how_can_i_turn_my_life_around_and_get_somewhere/,"Please don't think I'm about to go on a long rant about how my life sucks and yours is soooo much better.  I need some advice on advancing from where I am now.  I spent 6 years trying to attain a degree from Ole Miss and all I got was debt and no degree.  I went the music route, first mistake, then religion, second mistake.  I have a serious passion for food.  My dream would be to go to culinary school and hopefully open a place of my own in the future.  I need advice on how I can get there.  I've amassed quiet a debt from student loans and I honestly haven't begun paying any of them off.  I come from a poor family, and I've had to work my ass off just to get to where I am now.  I currently hold 2 kitchen jobs and barely make ends meet, but in general I'm happy and healthy.  I just have no idea how to advance and make my dreams a reality.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated and thank you for taking the time to read my post.

edit:  I can't believe people have already responded.  I agree the industry is unstable as eeph stated, but it's what I love.  I will pick up the Bourdain book, i love his shows.  New Orleans would be great, I dig the town and the great food.  My problem with that is I have a girlfriend who I absolutely adore, we met at Ole Miss, but she had to move back to California where she's from to finish her internship.  I'm trying to figure how to marry her one day, but first I need to live at least in the same state.

edit 2:  I know first hand about how tough the market is for new restaurants.  A former manager of mine hired me at his restaurant he opened in June 2011, yesterday we closed our doors.  I have a ton of things I could say as to why we failed, but it doesn't matter, we failed.  I would be happy just having a good job at a great place with great food.  I had a job literally fall in my lap at national chain restaurant, I won't say which one.  It's not cooking though, it's literally microwaving pre portioned pre cooked crap.  Also I know this isn't a quick fix, I'm just looking for tips on slowly building my way.  Again I thank you all for the comments."
mj732,2,2011-11-20,"Regarding the ""The Self-Entitled Whining of Newbies in the Workforce"".",Eurynom0s,Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/mj732/regarding_the_the_selfentitled_whining_of_newbies/,"I posted this in that thread too but really think it's worth repeating. The tl;dr version is that while I'm not going to agree with the OWS people about needing government intervention on this, it's absolutely unreasonable to assume that if you can't get a job right now it's because you have a completely useless degree. In many regards young people are considered unemployable right now because they haven't done the jobs they're applying to for at least three years because we've gone directly from high school to college (and maybe even to grad school):

I'm pursuing a master's in applied physics right now. I'm certainly not going to say that the government needs to step in, but so many jobs I see want you to have a BA or MS in science/math/engineering...and fucking 3 year's work experience. I seriously have seen very few jobs that say no experience required, and the ones that do state a minimum GPA.

Before you tell me to suck it up my bad grades are my fault, I got stuck with a professor during my first semester of grad school who literally no matter how much you prepared for the exams it didn't matter it because the material would be well beyond anything we'd covered; she curved to a C; and we had two guys in the class who totally raped the curve--one of them told me he'd taken that sort of class FIVE TIMES as an undergrad. Her class is what's holding me at a 2.9 (vs the 3.0 I'd have with a B in her class) and I've gotten several rejections which I'm convinced are auto-rejections because there was actually a box on the application to type in your GPA and mine was below the stated minimum (oh and getting rejected in 3 hours too).

Another B was from a professor who literally *did not teach us anything the entire semester*. He'd spend all lecture telling stupid jokes and showing you New York Times articles on all the cool things you could do with various numerical math techniques...but if he covered anything in class it was shit you'd learned in some 200 level undergrad class. Me getting credit in that class amounts to Columbia putting it's seal of approval on me watching Youtube videos all semester. Oh, and of course my B reflects the fact that I couldn't find good Youtube videos on one of the questions on the final...that, and the final had you writing **THREE PROGRAMS IN THREE HOURS**. If you don't have a coding background--let's leave it at the fact that you would NEVER be asked to write three working programs in three hours in any real business or lab setting. EVER.

So you've got a C that easily could have been a B, and a B that I think would have been an A if the professor had actually fucking taught anything...and no shit I've got a sub-par GPA.

So again I'm not going to agree that the government needs to step in but it's not reasonable to just assume that if you're disaffected right now it's because you stupidly chose to get a degree in Medieval English Poetry.

I have serious research experience, a very solid summer internship from this past summer, and a trail of good recommendation letters from college, that internship, and grad school. But so many jobs won't even bother to look at me because my GPA doesn't meet their magic number or, even worse, **because I'm 23 years old and went straight from high school to college to grad school but I'm unemployable because I haven't done the job I'm applying to for three years**. And oh, BTW, the internship rec letter amounts to ""Eurynom0s is a very quick study--he entered this internship not knowing what he needed to to do the project, but very quickly picked that all up and got to work applying it."" But they never even see that because somehow I'm supposed to have sat behind a trading desk for three years (or whatever the relevant background is)."

I'm a senior design student whose graduation is a mere three weeks away. I've been persistent and fortunate these past few years and have had oppourtunities to work in small signage/web shops, small tech start ups as a UI designer and most recently I was fortunate enough to intern for an amazing creative agency. They're mid-sized, a great client/project list and over all very fun easy going people.

I plan on making a formal proposal in the next few weeks to push for my employment. I'm not the type of student who believes he has the job simply because I interned, so I want to do something special. My plan was to create a pitch of sorts--that details and thanks them for the things Ive learned over the course of my internship and the parts I've enjoyed. Following this will be the ""Why I could be of value to you"", which details some of my skills they might have not seen such as my versatility as a designer who knows a bit about development. I thought of developing these as a series of cheeky infographics and nice blocks of beautiful typography. Thoughts?

I am considering either sending it out as a PDF to the important names at the agency, as I would prefer to present it in person--things are quite busy lately and dragging people off various tasks into a 10-15 minute meeting run by the intern might not be possible (though I'll certainly try).

Has anyone had success attempting an angle like this? If not, what did you do to turn that internship into the job you love?"
mj2e4,6,2011-11-20,"Not sure if I did right, but here's my letter to my representatives.",Amartincelt,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/mj2e4/not_sure_if_i_did_right_but_heres_my_letter_to_my/,"My name is ......[insert name here]....... I am currently attending [name of college] in [city name, state name]. I am in the honors program, make good grades, I worked as an R.A., and I try hard to make life better for my brothers and sisters in humanity. I graduated high school with honors, and was an honors student in high school. I am also a criminal. I have used cannabis for a few years now, recently chronically, as in more than once a day. I still make the same grades, I still am an honors student, and I am still the same person I was, if not a better person. I liked to use cannabis. This past Thursday, the police came and asked if I had any illegal substances in my room. I cooperated, I was polite, and I understand they are doing their job. I now face misdemeanor charges, I can no longer live in university housing, i lost my job and i have nowhere to stay because my home is 3 hours away. I may end up with a criminal record that could keep me from being employed among other things. I also face the prospect of losing all of my scholarships, loans and grants, and possible expulsion from school. My question to you is this- what did I do to deserve such sever consequences? I smoked, yes that does carry health risks, but not as bad as alcohol or tobacco, and only to myself. I liked to smoke and play video games, hang out with friends, go for a walk, meditate, read a book... Nothing that harmed anyone. I am facing life changing consequences that could keep me from being a member of my very community or society for consuming a plant that has never caused any deaths from overdose, has possible medical uses, and is safer than tobacco or alcohol. This  ""crime"" in no way harms anyone. Gang violence hurts people and, because of the legal status of this plant, gangs are who profit from marijuana sales. But what if those gang members did not have control over the cannabis market? What if we put the market into the people's hands? What if people did not have to risk their future just for a bit of relaxing? What if we did not have to worry about laced cannabis because we grew our own? 

Alcohol prohibition required a constitutional amendment to be put into place, and we see how that turned out. Why is there no amendment for marijuana prohibition? How is this drug war legally justifiable? According to the tenth amendment of our U.S. constitution, any powers/responsibilities not explicitly delegated to the federal government are assigned to the states to decide, and I find nowhere in the constitution that leaves it up to the federal government to dictate what we the people can and cannot put into our bodies, and definitely no mention of cannabis prohibition. In fact, when we were still colonies of Great Britain, farmers were REQUIRED to grow hemp due to it's usefulness. 

Speaking of choosing what to put into our bodies, does every person not have the right to decide what is acceptable to put in their body? When did the government acquire the power to control what I do, so long as I am not infringing on anyone else's rights or causing harm to others? 

Next up is the economics of it all. We spend millions of dollars paying for prisoners. Imagine, we pass a legalization bill, those inmates who were NON-VIOLENT offenders whose only crime was possession or ""intent to sell"" could be released. Not only would we not be paying for those inmates, but it would free up space in our overpopulated prison system. No marijuana arrests means not clogging up the judicial system with people who did nothing worse than possessing/consuming this plant, which in reality is no worse than having a drink to relax. Then we have the possible tax income on the sale of cannabis. 

The drug war is obviously helping nothing. We have been fighting this ""war on drugs"" for far too long, and nothing has changed except for more and more otherwise law abiding citizens becoming ""casualties"" because of the legal status of a plant. The purpose of this message may be a bit unclear, so I will sum it up- The war on drugs is not a war between ""good"" and ""evil"", but between our government and the people it governs and is supposed to protect. How many more people must go to jail? How many people will be killed this year in raids by over-zealous ""drug warriors""? Support for legalization is at an all time high in America. You as REPRESENTATIVES have a responsibility to your constituents to at least pay attention to their opinions. I realize I will probably receive a condescending and vague reply that some secretary or intern typed up, and no one of any importance will ever read this, but if anyone does, I would be fine with no response to anything but my final question- a serious question that I would really appreciate if it were answered-

Besides breaking the (unjust) law, what was wrong with me having plant matter that just so happens helps me get through tough times, that makes the good times better, breaks down cultural, religious, racial, and social barriers, and just overall makes me feel good?

My plea to you today is to seriously sit and consider how locking people up for cannabis is helping our society, and then consider how you would feel if someone told you you would go to jail for smoking your cigarettes, or drinking your alcohol, or even drinking your soda/eating your favorite food. Just think about how it would feel to have your life turned upside down for eating pizza, or whatever your favorite food is. 

Would you not support the legalization of pizza, when the only reason ever given to you for why it is illegal is that it will make you fat? Think about this- why is cannabis illegal? Because it produces a ""high""?- but that can't be right because so does alcohol(Which is a drug). Because the smoke is ""dangerous"" for your health?- that can't be it either, because so is tobacco smoke(Which contains nicotine, also a drug). So what is it that makes cannabis so ""dangerous""?

Please, take this seriously. I may not have worded this ""professionally"", but  this is something I am passionate about, and our government was founded on the beliefs that the people have their voices heard. That the government should answer to its people. That our representative, our ELECTED officials should answer to the people the represent. I may have said that my earlier question was my last, but it seems that was a mistake for I have one more, and this is all- 

I realize that this is a controversial topic, and you risk re-election by supporting legalization, but I ask you, what is truly more meaningful- helping out thousands that have their lives ruined because they like to enjoy partaking in a plant, or another term? "

I am staying with a friend temporarily until a new job starts. Her niece is attending a christian school near here so she has come for the weekend to apply for an internship. As part of one of her assignments for school she was asked to interview a person from another religion or an atheist about the bible being the written word of god. I told her I would be willing to do it. I feel like I am a very opinionated atheist and I welcomed the debate.

She asked me a few questions and I went into my shpeel about all the gods of ancient religions that pre-date christianity that tell the same story, e.g. Horus, Mithra, Zoroaster, Attis, etc. Her response was ""We live in the realm of the devil and he does whatever it takes to lead us astray from god.""

I was absolutely dumbfounded after that and I had no idea on how to respond. What would you have said?

edit: I feel like I know the bible fairly well and another point she stumped me on was ""How do you explain the 330 prophecies in the bible about Jesus that came true about him?""

miui9,12,2011-11-20,Is there anybody else in my shoes?,BounceHouseOfPain,architecture,https://www.reddit.com/r/architecture/comments/miui9/is_there_anybody_else_in_my_shoes/,"I graduated with a Bachelors of Environmental Design (Architectural Studies) in 2008. I did well in school, and enjoyed it enough... but I never really felt like I was truly in my element... but does anyone really feel that way when they're so green and there's still so much to learn?

Anyway, I was able to have a job lined up for myself before I graduated, and I got 9 months of professional experience in a mid-size firm... before I was laid-off with 3 other interns. This happened in February 2009.

After that, I never found work in architecture again. I was unemployed for over a year, and my confidence took a huge beating. I was finally able to get a job that I was completely over-qualified for and it had nothing to do with my background/education/interests... but I needed the money, so I took it.

And I'm still in said job, over a year and a half later. It's coming up on 3 years since I have been in the architectural profession. I feel that even if I wanted to get back in, I would not be able to because I'm a.) rusty and b.) obsolete (I don't know revit, etc.)

My professional experience in the field was not very enticing. Interns are often stuck with the mundane work that nobody really wants to do, I understand that. But I just didn't click with the firm, and even looking at the higher ups, I didn't see what they did and think ""wow... what a great career."" 

Anyway, I just don't know how to proceed. I don't know if I'm bitter about how things played out and I've written architecture off because I feel rejected myself... or if it's just not meant to be and it's time to move on to a different career path. I would want more professional experience in architecture before deciding to pursue a masters degree, but I don't know if I can get that professional experience...without a masters degree. Does that make sense?



TLDR; I graduated in 2008, worked in architecture for 9 months, got laid off, felt rejected, fell into a job that has nothing to do with architecture or my interests, wish I could get more experience in architecture but feel pretty hopeless about ever getting back in.

Does anyone else have a similar story?"

Long time reader of the subject matter here but this is my first post.
A little back story before I get to my request.

I am a hard worker, I progress anywhere I am put as far as work goes because I like to take a sense of pride in what I do. A quick glance at my resume and you will notice that not only have I been working (though school) since the age of 15, but I have mainly acquired jobs in the food industry (Cook, Griller, line, Expo, and other odd jobs around restaurants). The amount of work hours per week does not present a problem because I have done full time and over time while taking classes and still maintaining at least a 3.0 GPA. I'm currently out of work due to relocation back to this side of my town. I'm not in major need of a job because I have managed my money wisely and have some put away for times like this. My problem is not finding a job, I have a few places that have told me they would be more then happy to put me back to work for them. My problem is finding a job that I can apply my working knowledge in my ME degree to, or at least finding a job that would actually look good on a resume for another job that deals with ME type work. Because I am out of a job at the moment I figured today is just as good as any other day to get a start on my career. So I ask you (anyone who feels like they might have some good advice), where does someone like me go to obtain skills that are attractive for future employers and skills that I will need when applying for that ""real job"" when I'm done with my degree. All of the places that I have attempted to aply at have all responded with around the same answer of, ""We need someone with experience in this area"" and the jobs were for student part time positions or student internships. So how can I get experience is I have none and I can't  get hired to gain experience because I have no experience...

TL;DR Have plenty of work experience but no engineering type work experience, where do I look for my first engr type job at?

Any advice is helpful, thanks in advanced guys.

WIRED magazine seeks four editorial fellows for its San Francisco office. The full-time fellowships will run from January 3, 2012 to June 29, 2012 and focus on the Play section, gadgets research, fact-checking, and the Start section. All four positions involve working closely with senior editors. We do not offer summer internships, and since our fellowships are full-time, they are not appropriate for matriculated students.

Applicants must be pursuing journalism as a career and have experience working in a deadline-oriented environment. You should also be enthusiastic, highly organized, and have a demonstrable interest in technology. A passion for great reporting and writing is essential.

Because these fellowships are full-time, they are not appropriate for matriculated undergraduate or graduate students. We do not offer summer internships.

WIRED PLAY EDITORIAL FELLOW
This position is best suited to a college graduate with entry-level reporting and writing experience in the field of journalism. Responsibilities include pitching ideas to Play section editors and assisting them with research and special projects. Geek-savvy pop culture knowledge is a must; the ideal candidate has a favorite band that we’ve never heard of, a favorite comic book that we’ve never read, and a long rant on why Ender’s Game was better than the Harry Potter books (or vice versa). The job also involves fielding email, mail, faxes, and phone submissions received by the editorial department as well as mailing issues to authors. Facility with multimedia and podcasting equipment, especially ProTools and GarageBand, are a plus.

WIRED REVIEWS EDITORIAL FELLOW 
This position is best suited to a college graduate with entry-level reporting and writing experience plus a strong interest in consumer electronics, design, and technology. Responsibilities include reviewing products and assisting with editorial production for both WIRED magazine and Wired.com. Interns also assist with research for features and packages. This is a great opportunity for bylined writing as well as for getting your hands on the latest tech before everyone else does. There are light clerical duties as well, such as responding to story and product pitches and ordering products for review.

WIRED RESEARCH EDITORIAL FELLOW
This position is for someone with great reporting skills and a supreme attention to detail — ideally a college graduate with prior fact-checking or professional reporting experience. The primary duty is checking the accuracy of magazine content. In this capacity, the research intern works closely with senior editors, copy editors, designers, photo editors, and writers, primarily on the magazine’s Play section, so an affinity for geeky pop culture is a must. Other responsibilities include Nexis searches and some administrative duties.

WIRED START EDITORIAL FELLOW 
This position is best suited to a college graduate with journalism experience; preferably reporting and writing experience about science, technology, and business. Humor writing experience also a plus. The ideal candidate is creative, curious, eager, and interested in news and technology. Responsibilities include pitching story ideas to Start section editors, writing items, and assisting editors with research and special projects. The reporting intern is involved in idea generation for recurring Start items such as Q&amp;A, Alpha Geek, Best lists, Datastreams, etc. There are administrative duties as well, such as mailing, updating databases, and preparing for section meetings. Experience with Garage Band/ProTools, video editing, and podcasting preferred, but not necessary.

The pay: $12 per hour. The hours: 9 am to 5 pm, Monday through Friday.

To apply: Send a cover letter, resume, and links to three clips within the body of an email message to internships@wiredmag.com. DO NOT SEND EMAIL ATTACHMENTS – WE WON’T READ THEM IF YOU DO. Please put your name and which internship you’re applying for in the subject line of the email. You may only apply for one position; however, you will be considered for others as we deem appropriate.

Applications are due Wednesday, November 23, 2011. Absolutely no phone calls, please.

Am not sure if this a vent of a futile attempt to seek out advice but hear me out. I know there are alot of people out there that know alot more then me, so who knows .. right ?

*Anyway here is the deal:*

Am a student in holland ( yes big shocker here ) 20 years old and I suffer from certain medical issues wich most likely will grow to become more of a problem in the future. ( especially with my beloved gene pool )
The problem is : i cant finish my school in my last year because of this. not because i am dying, but my medical conditions make me lose alot of hours.

And its not that i am not learning anything or am not doing a good job, at my internship they love me (most likely because I am good at what I do, wich is editing and filming. and the fact I basically fill a full time job for no money, curse you internships ) but I also lose alot of hours but they dont mind and they are very supportive aswell.

Wich makes me feel bad sinds i dont want to let them down but yeah.
My College is basicly kicking me out purely and only because of the lack of hours. My grades are good, my boss @ my internship tells me and them i am doing a great job, its purely about the lack of hours.
Here is the kicker, if got an offical medical certificate that states that my medical condition is forcing me to fall out once then.
And because I cant make it, I will have to pay back the scholarship and so forth.

Is there anyone that knows what I can do right now?
I have talked to the people at school and they claim to be forced by law.. is there anything I can do, i would drag them to court if i could but I am only a student.

Any Advice is welcome, and if my spelling and or grammar is beyond shit ( wich it is ) blame it on my poor spelling and grammar skills, (Dyslexia)

TL;DR : Medical condition fucks me over on hours, schools being a bitch, anything I can do about it? Medical certificate present."
mkhn5,0,2011-11-21,What is the one life lesson you wish that you didn't have to learn the hard way?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/mkhn5/what_is_the_one_life_lesson_you_wish_that_you/,"For me it was how to not get friendzoned.

When I was 19 I was head over heels for this girl that I had met in college. She was pretty much everything that I could ever want in a girl. She was smart, pretty, good kisser, we loved hooking up with each other, the works. Kinda tomboyish, shared my political/religious views, etc. The only problem was that I met her early on in college and she still had some partying to do. No biggie, I figured that I could wait it out and hook up with other girls in the meantime. I just asked that she didn't hook up with anyone who I lived with or at my house, which I thought was fair.

Caught her blowing some guy in the bathroom the same night I asked her to make that promise. It hurt WAY more than I thought it was going to. I wasn't able to trust her completely after that, but I was still *really* into her. I tried way too hard to force myself to get over it because I was convinced that she was perfect for me (stupid, I know). We would spend tons of time together, and we'd hook up, but then she'd tell me after every single time that she wanted to just be friends. I eventually got frustrated and asked her, ""Who are you trying to convince here?!"" Anyway, we argued back and forth about it and I said that I couldn't trust her even though I cared so much about her.

A couple years passed and we didn't speak once. I had dated other girls, traveled Europe, visited Japan, made money, got really good at boxing/MMA, learned how to play the piano and guitar, campaigned for Obama, got into a really good law school, etc. We then ran into each other on campus and made some small talk. It wasn't bad. We met up for coffee a few weeks later and we had a nice conversation. She had a new boyfriend, which thrilled me (surprisingly enough) because he seemed to really honestly care about her.

She left for Argentina to study abroad for a year. We kept up correspondence via skype and it was always bland pleasantries, but it was always nice. When she returned she broke up with her boyfriend and we hit it off like old times and we ended up sleeping with each other. I went into my stupid place again and wanted a relationship. She was at a point in her life where she just wanted to hook up with random guys (her idol is Kim Cattrall). 

I couldn't stand this. I found myself wishing she'd go out with me or at least go out with her old boyfriend because he kind of guys she'd sleep with were always bullshit artists who attracted girls because they had that tribal tattoo thing going or they owned some motorcycle they could barely ride. I guess that part of it bothered me because I've worked *really* hard my entire life to be a man of substance with skills and experiences that were geared toward being meaningful and I felt like I was competing with guys who were all flash and no substance. On top of that I hated the way I would hear that they would talk about her. They'd never say it to me because I was friends with her, but while she thought she was being a ""sexually empowered woman"" I had never seen someone looked down upon so much in my life. Ate me up inside to see her viewed that way because I knew she deserved to be treated better no matter her sexual history.

I guess that's why I'd never outright shame a girl for sleeping with a bunch of guys since it's not really my business, but I just cannot stand when a girl acts like she accomplished something for it because I see it as lazy claim to feminism that seems to get you nowhere.

My bitterness over the issue began to fester really quickly in a bad way. We tried to hang out but we knew that there was a huge rift between us. It made me really unpleasant to be around and we stopped hanging out again. I didn't know what to do with myself besides move on, or at the very least make a valiant effort to. 

I started honing my skills again, started kicking ass at work, and ended up getting a couple of really kick ass internships in the entertainment industry. Suffice it to say I could be on track to make nearly seven figures by the time I am 35 years old (25 now). I started hanging out with new friends and cultivating really great relationships with girls. Most importantly I developed really good relationships with lots of good looking girls without falling in love with every single one of them. I still hang out with them all of the time, and weirdly enough it's helped me build confidence to date girls I would have never given myself a chance to before. The more I honed my skills, worked at my job, maintained my health, and kept good friendships around me, the happier I became. I am far happier than I was when I stopped hanging out with the girl mentioned before. All this time spent on myself and devoted to being a good friend attributed to that.

Before this gets too tangential, I wanted to point out that I learned the lesson the second time she and I stopped seeing each other. You can't bring emotional bitterness into a relationship with a girl you're trying to go out with. You'll get empathy, maybe, but you won't be anyone's boyfriend anytime soon. I'm not bitter anymore, and I still think that she's an exceptional person who was unfortunate to run into me when I was going through a lower point in my life. I'm really happy now, and even though I have my sports, music, and money, I am 100% certain that my most attractive feature to girls is that I'm a happy person to be around. My only regret is that I can't really share how happy I am now with the girl from before, but them's the breaks, and it's a price of learning things the hard way.

tl;dr: Fell in love with a promiscuous girl, I couldn't handle it and got all bitter and unpleasant to hang out with. Learned how to be happy by developing myself and learning to cultivate healthier relationships with women.

Still, kudos to anyone who actually read the whole thing."

Will I feasibly be able to learn and gain experience in this working professionally, or am I essentially dead in the water until I supplement this degree I've worked years to get and years of experience with various boot camps and certs?  

I am a bit biased, because where I live, all the tech jobs are government contracts.  Due to that, there really are few Jr. Sysadmins.  If a company wants a Jr. Sysadmin, what they really want is a Sr that they can pay less.  Can I practically expect to be able to learn and grow with support, or do I basically have to ""fake it 'till I make it, and just do my best to learn on the fly?""  I did not inflate my resume at all.  I have all the experience I put on there, but there are a lot of critical sysadmin type areas where I could improve.  One is networking in general.  The others I outlined.  As the elite, how much do y'all expect a Junior to know coming in the door?


Thanks!"

Now that she is seeing Lewis, Batista seems to be playing the classic older brother role of ""intimidate the boyfriend"".

But what if Batista senses something ""off"" about Lewis the way the audience does? If he starts investigating Lewis, maybe he'll uncover some subplot that the interns seem to be involved in, making him actually relevant this season?

Of course, this is assuming the hooker is Batista's doing."

The pay is way more then I was expecting to make out of school (plus I get a big raise after my rotations are done), so I obviously don't want to fuck it up and make a good impression at the start.  I have a couple of months to kill before I start which I would like to use to study for something.

* CFA for June 
* Math (I'm reallllllllllly rusty - haven't really done much after first year...)

*Anyway here is the deal:*

Am a student in holland ( yes big shocker here ) 20 years old and I suffer from certain medical issues wich most likely will grow to become more of a problem in the future. ( especially with my beloved gene pool )
The problem is : i cant finish my school in my last year because of this. not because i am dying, but my medical conditions make me lose alot of hours.

And its not that i am not learning anything or am not doing a good job, at my internship they love me (most likely because I am good at what I do, wich is editing and filming. and the fact I basically fill a full time job for no money, curse you internships ) but I also lose alot of hours but they dont mind and they are very supportive aswell.

Wich makes me feel bad sinds i dont want to let them down but yeah.
My College is basicly kicking me out purely and only because of the lack of hours. My grades are good, my boss @ my internship tells me and them i am doing a great job, its purely about the lack of hours.
Here is the kicker, if got an offical medical certificate that states that my medical condition is forcing me to fall out once then.
And because I cant make it, I will have to pay back the scholarship and so forth.

Is there anyone that knows what I can do right now?

While in college my girlfriend at the time (wife now) made me get on anti depressants and have been on them since I was about 20. Had a few med changes since then mainly due to sexual side effects and now I'm on effexor and lamtic (or something like that). When I was a teenager I began to self mutilate with more emphasis on just feeling pain rather than trying to kill myself. Never got along with my dad and by the time I was a senior in high school I was pretty much isolated from my family because I couldn't get along with any of them. I stopped cutting until January of last year. I was feeling overwhelmed and just wanted to feel pain again because I thought I deserved it. By mid spring I was drinking more and more, cheated on my wife, drove far more wreckless, and was beginning to consider drugs. Towards the end of may my wife found out I cheated on her and later that morning I attempted suicide because of the guilt I felt about it and I just didn't want to live anymore. Got hospitalized for a few days and since then have seen a therapist and just recently started seeing a psychiatrist. I am still pretty miserable. The meds I'm on now seem to work better than previous meds but I still am not happy with myself at all. I have been busy with work and an internship and have recently rejoined a band that I took a break from so I don't have alot of idle time which helps. However I am started to isolate myself from other people other than my wife. I think about killing myself alot anymore (more so when I forget a dose of my meds) and all I can say is maybe I should. If my brain is that adamant about wanting to die than maybe I should just end it. Right now the only thing really stopping me is the holidays being so close. That's really about all I got.

I'm currently a junior at Cornell University, and I will be working a 28-week full time internship starting Jan. 9th with Johnson &amp; Johnson at Spring House, PA. I'm looking for a place to live in the Philly area during this time, and it's been tough because I don't know the area at all and I only know one person in the area.

I was originally thinking I would get a studio apartment, but I've been becoming more open to the idea of having a roommate or two. However, I'm still reluctant to just room with any random person. I've been browsing Craigslist, but I'm getting tired of terribly-written ads and sketchy offers, and someone recommended reddit to me as a nicer community to appeal to.

Some info about me for potential roommates: I'm a 20-year-old male bioengineering major, currently living in a dormitory here at Cornell working as a resident assistant. I'm very good about not leaving common space messy, and I tend to be very quiet as a roommate (I only ever listen to music or watch videos with headphones on). I'm a pretty introverted person and have a lot of nerdy interests (classical music, math, video games, and Doctor Who to name a few), but I'm pretty friendly and enjoy hanging out with other laid-back people. I plan on getting a cat when I move in because this will be the first time that I have the privilege, time, and money to do so. I also would prefer a furnished place if possible. My maximum budget is something like $700 per month, though of course cheaper is quite welcome.

So, if I sound like someone you would be willing to sublet a room to, or if you know someone who would be interested, or if you know of any other good opportunities, please let me know! We can also talk through e-mail if you shoot me a message with your contact info.

I'm quite busy this semester and I don't really have the money or a car to spare right now to come visit beforehand, which I understand can be off-putting. However, my identity is easily verifiable by searching my e-mail on the Cornell website, and I can get both Cornell and Johnson &amp; Johnson to contact you and confirm that my story is legitimate, and I would be willing to do a videochat or something with a potential renter or subleaser to talk about stuff, so that we can remove as much anxiety as possible about not being able to meet in person. Trying to find a good apartment over the internet is really tough, so I would be extremely appreciative of any advice or offers you all could give. Thanks a bunch!"

We are disproportionately hit with unemployment. We're lining up for unpaid internships to get experience. We're told we need to ""grow up"" and that we're ""entitled"" because we are willing to work to achieve modest means.

But at some point, you have to wonder why you are trying so desperately to fit into a broken system that will ultimately break you too (i.e., get a job, work unpaid overtime, retire eventually). The people who actually followed through with this are not happy--just look at them! 

There are options that exist now that did not exist 10 years ago during the so-called ""boom."" You can work for yourself, set up your own jobs and find contacts, and create your own experience all without even leaving your computer in your parent's house. Everyone is waiting for a break, but isn't trying to make one happen.

Why are you trying so hard to win the approval of people who want to milk you for all you're worth or those who simply do not care? You do not need them to succeed. What do you gain if you do what they want? A pat on the back if you're lucky.

The fact that the status-quo does not appear to be a good choice anymore is a blessing in disguise: you are free to try to do better. Unfortunately, 99% of our generation is so captivated by the broken ideas of the past, that they will not even consider that they are free to do otherwise. I expect immediate negative responses saying how I'm unrealistic or how ""my situation is different."" I also expect people to argue semantics with me and tell me how I can't actually live outside the system.

**Edit**: I think many people misunderstand what I meant by going your own way. Perhaps thinking of as anything other than applying for jobs and internships is a better way to put it. 

I would summarize these ways as (1) pure entrepreneurship via the internet, (2) freelancing or going out and making contracts with other businesses (all done remotely), and (3) creating your own experience by creating your own content (e.g., websites, articles, artwork, etc.) to be used for future sale, as part of a portfolio, or to simply practice and gain experience.

The idea is to not rely on someone else to hand you a living and become trapped as an office drone; it is to go out and get what you want. Thus, you largely avoid the ""system.""

mlz9z,3,2011-11-22,Undergraduate Field Camp or Internship?,brenng,geology,https://www.reddit.com/r/geology/comments/mlz9z/undergraduate_field_camp_or_internship/,"Hey guys,

I have been debating back and forth about whether I should apply for a field camp at a university or an internship.  The summer I plan on doing either of these options is next summer (before Junior year).  Currently, I am leaning towards pursuing a Masters degree in the Geosciences/related discipline, and do not plan on job searching immediately after I graduate.

So, in terms of experience, enhancing my knowledge about the geosciences, and being prepared for graduate studies, which option have you felt is more beneficial?

I know there are many different field camps focusing on different areas of the geosciences, but I'm focusing this question on field camps as a whole.
Additionally, are there many opportunities for financial assistance for the field camp?

Lastly, if I were to pursue an internship, it would most likely be at an environmental remediation firm, dealing with geotechnical work primarily related to hydrogeology.

Thanks for your input!

I turned 22 yesterday (yay?), first girl in this story is 20 atm. Second girl is 18.

I have been raised to do what I love. My parents aren't racists and have always told me and siblings to love, not be judgmental and not be a fucking ass. Generally nice, they wouldn't care if any of their kids admitted to being gay or bisexual. Also not religious, supportive of everything. The only thing they were wary of was my sister dating older guys.

Anyways, I have never been socially successful (you know because I'm on Reddit, zing), so relationships haven't come easy. Actually, in my grand total of 5 attempts of actual relationships only two ever came anywhere near actual intimacy.

First one was with a (then, not anymore) Muslim girl. Met on the internet, we had fun, talked a lot etc. etc. We met up a few times and we kissed. Things were fun, but eventually didn't work out because the Islam is kind of a bitch. We part, don't talk much besides a few random conversations on MSN. Eventually, 3 months later, we start talking due to my internship being close to her college. Being the curious ass that I am I eventually ask her how things are going with her boyfriend. She says they have done oral and....

I was fucking sick. I felt like I could throw up right then. I couldn't even get turned on for a week after that. Up until that point I thought I was over her...
Skip ahead 2 years (holy shit that's today!) and here I am, the same feeling. Now it's because I have lost a girl I honestly loved.
This time it was a friend I also met on the internet years ago. She lives in the UK though, so I can't just randomly go over and meet her. We admitted feelings, did naughty stuff on cam and admitted we loved each other. I said this when I felt there was no way that what I felt wasn't love, she said it a bit sooner.

She had rather low self esteem and barely any friends in high school. I'm nearly done with college so I told her I would meet her when my internship is over and I got my Bachelor's. She agrees and we make plans for stuff when she's in Uni.
The dreaded moment comes and she leaves. It's early October of this year and she starts out shy in her dorms. Things progress and during her first week she tells me she got drunk and engaged in dancing close to a guy (club style, you know). I tell her that I don't like it but that it's not the end of the world, just that I would prefer it she didn't do that while we're together. The day after she goes home for a bit and says that things don't feel the same anymore. She has been thinking of having a relationship with a guy who can be there for her. I tell her she knows what I can offer her and that I can't change that until I at least finish school.

She decides it's not fair this way and we break up. The first few weeks we both have trouble to stop talking, but things do slow down. It seems we both have trouble getting over each other and we even finish watching Firefly together. I try to be determined, save for one weak moment, and whenever either of us say we want to get back together we say it's better this way.
Almost two weeks ago I get a text where she informs me she has moved on. She made out with a guy and did more... Exactly one week after that (day before new Zelda, easy to remember) she texts me again. She thought it was funny how I was right that she found a new boyfriend in no-time and also friendzoned somebody.

I asked her if she had sex (nope) and if she had done oral... She asks what good knowing would do and I admitted it wouldn't. She says she has both given and received oral sex. I feel like shit again, but not as much as with the other girl.

Then last Sunday, about an hour before I decide to break off all contact, I had another stupid moment and asked her about... blowjobs....

She says it was what she wanted and that she doesn't regret anything. I can see that and I assume it's normal, we talked about doing much dirtier stuff than that and I don't think of sex as wrong.
But when girls I like have had sex? Especially when I'm not over them by a long shot? God I get sick. It's all wrong. I can only imagine them having sex. It haunts my mind. It distracts me from everything. I can't even think of her without thinking of that.

**tl;dr: I feel sick when a girl I like(d) does things with somebody else. Oral sex more than anything.**

Does anybody else have this and know how to deal with it? Any suggestions from people who don't have the same problem? How do I stop seeing girls like that? What the fuck is wrong with me? (Besides being an idiot and actually asking them for details about their sex life. I believe I only got answers because both wanted to be friends with me)"

mlbeu,3,2011-11-22,"[FR] Suit up for a mini date, or so I thought.",starfoxisdown,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/mlbeu/fr_suit_up_for_a_mini_date_or_so_i_thought/,"Ok fellas time to contribute. But first a bit of background so we understand what I'm working with. I'm a professional student in my mid 20s, just got out of a 6 year relationship that I had been in, with some off and on, since freshman year in college. Nothing messy or dramatic spurring me to this subreddit, just long distance sucks. In fact I did a lot of my personal development from shy nerd to gregarious nerd within the parameters of this relationship. In any case, I gotta get back into it sometime, might as well be now. 

The report:
On a sunny (for Seattle) afternoon I was sitting on the bus, heading back to my school after a meeting downtown. I'd had an internship interview that morning so I was wearing my best suit and tie. The interview had gone well, and I was also pretty stoked from the meeting planning a legislative campaign to end the death penalty. All in all an excellent afternoon, and it probably showed.

Sitting on the bus with an empty seat next to me, an Asian girl walks on, looks at me briefly, and asks if she can sit down. I don't have much experience using the scale here, but I'd say HB8; very pretty face and nice body. She sits down and introduces herself, and we exchange pleasantries. Now I'm not used to people randomly introducing themselves on public transportation, though I try to chat up people who seem receptive whenever possible. I'm so thrown by this I almost let the interaction die right there, but then I remember 1) she's hot and 2) I'm single. 

**note: she later told me that because she is shy, she only sits next to people she thinks look nice or who she'll be comfortable with. I'm no expert, but I think this illustrates that first impressions are huge, and they happen before you ever open your mouth. I attribute this interaction solely to my good attitude and dress.**

We mostly talk about her, with me asking question about her major and future career aspirations and dreams. Social kino on the shoulders and arms throughout. We get of the bus and she tells me she's going to the library. I suddenly remember that I too have to pick up books from the library. This is perfect because I actually do need to pick up some books, and there's this really cool cafe on the way there.

As we walk and talk I kino a bit more on the small of her back, but not much more after this. When we pass the cafe I point it out and talk up how great it is. When we near the library a couple minutes later, I tell her we should grab some food at the cafe sometime when she's on campus (she commutes), and to facilitate said food grabbing we should exchange numbers. Now I was expecting this to be some time in the indeterminate future, but after I get her number she suggests we get lunch right then! Well hellz yeah! We split up while I get my book, and when we reconvene (easy since we have each other's number) we head to the cafe.

This whole time the conversation has been mostly on her, though I have shared when prompted; like when she asks what my ethnicity is (Chinese). This gives us some common ground and moves the conversation forward comfortably. 

We each get our food (paid separately) and sit down. We're sitting on adjacent sides of a small square table, but even so it's kinda awkward to kino. Plus I was really hungry and kind of intent on my sandwich. At one point she got out her computer to show me a project, which necessitated leaning in to see. In retrospect I should have capitalized on this, but didn't. 

Anyways, part way into our lunch she drops the boyfriend bomb. They've been together since high school (she's now a senior) and it sounds pretty serious. However, she complains that his department is housed on a far part of campus which is 'hard.' 

**Having just gotten out of a trans-state long distance relationship I find this absurd. But when I told a female friend about this she concluded the fact that HB8 complained about it to me means she wants to break up. Thoughts?**

Anyhow, I can feel things going stale, mostly because I can't wolf down my sandwich and hold charming conversation at the same time. I tell her I have to go and wish her good luck on her project after walking her out of the cafe. Probably should have gone for a hug or something, but oh well. A few hours later I text her telling her I had a good time and state that we should get together again. She writes back but is silent on meeting again. 

Reflections:
I don't really plan on pursuing this any further because of the boyfriend, so I saw this as a way to get my feet wet again. It's just my own ethics, but I don't want to be an asshole, and if she wants to break up with her boyfriend she should do it for her own reasons. But maybe it was all a big shit test. 

I think my kino was pretty good at first, especially given that she's a self-described introvert and it was during the day, but it tapered off toward the end. It definitely had a more friendly feel once we were in the cafe. What do you think? Anything you would have done differently? Escalate faster, stick with the date? I felt like I was kind of high energy the whole time, and in my limited experience in the past I've done better with a more low key approach. I was no dancing monkey, but I certainly could have been more seductive with my energy and tone of voice. Any feedback or further clarifying questions are welcome. 

*edit for typos
**Update: She texted me this morning asking if I was free for lunch. I told her I had a meeting (which was true) and that I am usually more available in the evening. Not very girlfriendly behavior, but then again some girls are just oblivious. That or I friend zoned myself just that quickly."

I have a summer internship lined up with... is it frowned upon to drop names? Let's just say the smallest of the big 4 in the U.S. I can't help myself from getting jealous of my two best friends, who landed internships with the two biggest firms, and in NYC no less (mine is not in the city).

Really, is this just me looking way too much into it? Reading too much goingconcern.com and paying too much attention to the names? Should I truly be happy with what I've got? I know I haven't experienced working there yet, but I aim for the best, and reading about this firm as if it were the joke of the big 4 isn't making me feel too great about it.

So, tell me, perhaps from the perspective of someone already in the accounting profession, if my feelings are way off. I'm pretty sure they are, but I can't help but let the nonsense talk from accounting websites and even what other students say affect my opinions. Really, I know I should be happy with what I have, and I am very grateful for the opportunity, but something about my personality causes me to think about this too much and I just got a little bummed out hearing my friends got internships with the firms that I've began to regard as the best and most selective.

Bonus question: Say, hypothetically, after my internship, I receive a full time job offer. Roughly when would the deadline for my decision be, compared to fall semester recruiting on campus. Would I have the opportunity to interview for full time positions at other firms before having to accept or reject the full time offer? On one hand I don't want to limit myself to this one firm, but on the other hand I don't want to reject a sure offer before getting to interview anywhere else."

The person in front of me runs a stop sign, and suddenly, the lights on the cop car behind me turn on. I was expecting him to pass me, so I pulled over. He just sat in the middle of the road, not pulling over and not passing me. I had never been pulled over before, so you can imagine my confusion. I continued to try to pull over more, incase he was in fact trying to pass me. Eventually, he got out of his car and did the stereotypical cop waddle-walk up to my window. Turns out, my plates were expired and they weren't showing up in the system. He either called for back-up or a bored cop just showed up for assistance. As they were conversing by their cars, I was frantically trying to get their attention to inform them that my parents had just renewed my plate online. They would NOT listen, so naturally I got out of my car to join them in conversation and inform them of the good news. The second cop pulls her gun on me, screaming profanities and telling me to get the f back in my car. She then follows me home and acts entirely too sweet to my parents, who won't believe my end of the story because the cop was so nice. I know I shouldn't have gotten out of the car, but damn. I just wanted to get home!"

I am currently employed at The Community Builders, Inc., one of the largest and most accomplished non-profit development corporations in the United States, as an Administrative Assistant.  I currently only work on weekends due to my class schedule, but I typically worked full-time.  My duties included entering work orders into multiple company databases, answering and directing phone calls, and being a liaison between residents, maintenance, and management.  I was also responsible for office operations when my boss was either on vacation or unavailable.  I was in charge of making tough decisions and communicating them effectively to all parties.

ml0tz,4,2011-11-21,Advice on career vs. grad school,dietcar,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/ml0tz/advice_on_career_vs_grad_school/,"I am graduating with my BSME in SP2012, and I was originally planning on completing my school's combined BS/MS program in SP2013. The rationale was that for only a one year investment, it made a lot of sense to just spring for the MS right away, rather than (unrealistically) go back full time or part time after working.

However, due to changes in personal circumstances, I will most likely end up in Toronto after next summer for at least 2 years. I have a 3.9+ GPA, 3 different internships, and some research experience, so I am pretty confident I could make either of the two options work:

A. Find a full-time position

**Pros:**

* Make money, especially considering higher cost of living + significant other
* Prefer industry environment
* Tired of school, ready to do real work

**Cons:**

* However, two of my internships have been in aerospace, an industry which I realized I am not passionate about and would not be particularly excited to work in. My mentors have a pretty good network there, but unfortunately, it's just not in the industry that interests me (versus something like mobile computing or product design).
* I have no other network in Toronto area
* Little success so far even finding entry-level positions to apply for in the region
* Work visa and tax implications?

B. Grad school at University of Toronto (MS in ME or more likely, ISE)

**Pros:**

* Could focus more on areas that truly interest me (I realize now that, while I am capable of ME classes, it's not intrinsically extremely interesting. I should have done CSE or CE in retrospect since I love technology, computers, gadgets, etc.)
* Could lead to connections at e.g. IBM, Apple, Amazon, etc., which are places/industries I think I would prefer to work in
* More relaxed and interesting than undergrad?


**Cons:**

* I am getting very tired of the stress of school
* Stipend is minimum $15K/year :c
* Fellowship options are limited for international students

I guess I'm just looking for some experiences on career vs grad school. Thanks for reading, and I look forward to your help."

For an essay that I'm writing on Computer Science in a Freshman Writing Course at Michigan State University I need to have some questions answered by someone working in a Computer Science (my intended major) related career. The person that I was set up to interview fell through due to something coming up in the family, so now I turn to Reddit in last minute desperation.

For the sake of citing and setting up your answer in my paper I will need know your full name and the company where you work and I'd assume that you don't want to put those freely floating around on the internet so you can PM them to me (You can just include your linked In or similar page if you have one assuming it's updated). 

I also don't care if you use short sound bite style answers to the questions in order to move through the questions more quickly and you can just answer a few if you want to.
 
The answers to the stared questions are more important to me in the sake of my paper than the others.
1. How long have you been working in Computer Science?

2. What made you want to go into a Computer Science?

3. Where did you attend school at?

4. *What is your Job Title now?
-What was your title in past jobs if you've had any past jobs? 

5. What do still find most interesting about your current job?
-Past jobs?
-How about working in the field in general?

6. *How often do you travel for your job? 
-*How long at a time do you travel if you do? 
-. How much did you travel in some of your past titles?

7. How did you come to acquire your current job? How about a few of your other jobs if you've had any?

8. *What sort of perks have you had at your various jobs? Work at Home? Benefits?

9. *Did you get your masters degree? If so how has it benefited you in your career? Do you recommended recommend other people getting one if you have one?
-*If you don't have yours do you still recommend people entering the field to get one, why or why not?
-Was there a point in your career in which your education didn't matter due to it being outweighed by experience? If so what point and why?

10. *Did you do any internships prior to entering the field? Were they beneficial to you, if so why? 

11. *What technical skills (ex: programming languages) would you call the most universal and essential in the pathway for computer science?
-*What about career related skills?

12. Why do you think certain types of people are drawn into Computer Science?
-What qualities would you say that this person holds? (You can be stereo-typical)

13. *What are some personal qualities that you would say are the most beneficial for someone wanting to enter the computer science field? 
-*How about the least beneficial? 

14. How much has Computer Science changed since you entered?
-What do you think the future of Computer Science will be like for entering students like me on the technological side? 
-What have you done to keep up with these changes?

15. Do you like what you do? Why?
-What part of your job do you wish you could change if any?

16. On the path to your current job is there anything that you wish you could have done differently?

17. *How do you communicate with other people in the field?

18. *What are some varying approaches to Computer Science?
-*Is there any conflicts caused from these varying approaches?

19. Are there shortcuts that would help me or a similar student excel forward more quickly in Computer Science?

20. Any lasting things that a person entering computer science should know about the field or about your path?

mnaic,10,2011-11-23,I just accepted an offer to a great job. Here is how I did it.,vikhound,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/mnaic/i_just_accepted_an_offer_to_a_great_job_here_is/,"** This is based entirely on one man's experience, and while it cannot be entirely generalized to your experiences, some of it may be applicable

* My university was my greatest resource; almost all of my interviews were found either via postings through a relevant list serve, networking with professors and of course your fellow students may know about jobs that they are looking at and not interested, but you might be interested in. 

* Attend any and all university driven networking opportunities. Dress well, print 5 to 10 generic resumes on resume paper and bring your A-game to chat up reps from companies. GATHER BUSINESS CARDS AT THESE EVENTS!

DO NOT WAIT UNTIL AFTER YOU GRADUATE TO START LOOKING

Keep after it while your leads and school contacts are still hot.

* *Traditional* head hunters (indeed, monster, etc...) and job engines have never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, worked for me. They are seldom looking for entry level experience so dont waste your time. 

* That being said, there are *targeted* head hunters that you can post your resume on, that for me, did result in phone interviews. For example, i am in the environmental health and safety field and I used EHScareers.com. This is a particularly robust engine that can really narrow your search based on a variety of parameters. But Im sure with enough googling you can find one that suits your specific career.

* Build an excellent resume and include all of your relevant experience. Be sure it contains no grammatical errors, is targeted to the company you are applying to, and is very easy to read. When describing jobs and tasks, do not focus on fluffy acronyms, UNLESS they describe a positive result of your involvement. TRY TO INCLUDE CLEAR MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE. For example; 

Intern at X engineering company for however long

Designed Y system that saved company Z dollars. 

* Be specific, never lie and be sure to have a reference handy that can back up your claims. While it is technically illegal for a reference to indicate any preferences or performance measures (they legally can only indicate that worked at that company for however many months or years), they may answer more than that so be sure to keep that reference clear on what you put down on your resume. 

Thats all I got folks, I hope this helps some of you. 

TL/DR: Read the fucking thing.

I graduated from a great state school with a degree in Finance and minor in philosophy.  I worked a variety of non career jobs, most of which paid me cash for the last few months to make it by.  

I volunteered until june, which I then quit due to time constraints.  

I recently decided upon going back to school in order to get a Masters in Accounting, so that I can sit for the CPA.  The degree also requires that I secure an internship, so I at least know that I can't graduate without some form of work experience.  

I'm really leaning towards the CPA route because I know it will be a somewhat secure route in the future.  I have already taken the GMAT and talked to several professors, I look like I'm set to begin in January.  In comparison to the Accounting route, the financial industry seems really unstable at this point in time.  I've talked to friends in the field and it seems a decent number are getting laid off left and right.  

On the other hand, I have some family members who are claiming that they can set me up with a job in the finance area.  Granted I don't know what it is yet, and I will discuss it with them over Thanksgiving, but I'm really curious as to what the best route would be for me if it turns out to be a good opportunity.  

As of right now I'm unemployed and I know that you shouldn't really pour your heart into anything or assume anything until things are said and done

But if you had the choice what would be the superior choice?  Grad school for a year, pass the CPA, go into a stable field

or follow an offer from a family member or a family friend and gain some work experience

Sorry.",[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/mn3j7/hey_sorry_i_just_need_a_little_support_to_get/,"Hey. Sorry. But I really need to get this off my chest. Even if it's the internet. 

My boyfriend/best friend and I split up last night over skype/phone and I've felt really sick and haven't stopped crying. I know it's cliche to say, but it hurts so much. I guess I'm hoping if I share it I'll be able to take the first steps in moving on. 

I met him when I was 17 in high school, and we had had a same group of friends really, but had never really gotten to know each other. I spent the first three years of high school being terrified of people and trying to do very well in school. I was a tomboy and had controversial views (still do, still am) on pretty much everything. By senior year I was really comfortable with myself, proud of my views and ability to learn and succeed. And I had lost about 30 pounds after always being a chubby teenager- mostly through not eating- so I was confident and happy. 

When we first started to get to know each other, I was amazed by how similar we were and forced myself not be shy and get to know him. It was incredible how similar we were when it came to views on society, general philosophy, and what we wanted to do with our lives. A lot of it had to do with offensive political views and environmentalism and an idea of what is truly awesome in this life- science, wilderness, everything natural, adventuring, living simply and with little, not wanting money, and preventing waste in society. It's hard to explain, but I don't think I'll ever meet someone as similar to me as him, and I can't really be attracted to someone unless I admire them and respect them for who they are as a person.

We slept together for the first time last February. I had been on the pill since August, so we didn't use condoms, and never have. We were both virgins, and we were so comfortable that we could laugh and talk and just be free in sex. It was incredible. It makes me so happy to think that we can gain that much happiness in being with someone in that way. 

And all the while we were figuring out where we were going to college the next year. He was committed to a public school in Washington, and I was applying to only out of state private schools. I did really well in school, and I had coauthored some papers in plant biology through a summer internship at the local university. I got really hefty scholarships from all the schools I applied to, and I knew that if I worked hard and put the effort into learning in college, I could do something incredible. I still know that. And I was so used be being alone because people terrified me all through my childhood. So I really thought the only way I could be happy and successful was through learning and working in something I loved. 

I guess it's relevant to mention that I was the biggest skeptic about gender relations before I met him. I really had this Fight Club thing going on in my head that relationships were just a guy conforming to all the materialistic insanities and insecurities of the girl he was sleeping with. My parents never got along, and having kids both degraded their careers massively I thought. I thought gender relations and marriage were what people resorted to when they couldn't find a job or work that they loved. I was really bitter about it. And he had the same views- that people should love what they do before who their with. 

But God. We got along so well. And it didn't take over my life at all. I still read tons and wrote and did well in school. I was still really self-conscious about my weight and would obsess about it a lot without telling anyone. It really didn't change anything. I just ate a lot less. Like a banana a day, and maybe a bagel the next. I didn't really think about it. I was pretty short, so people expected that I would be tiny anyway. I think the thing that really kills me looking back on it is that when a girl is as razor thin as I was (5' 3"", 94 lbs), they just assume that it's natural and genetic. 

Fucking society. Eating like that is like wearing heels though. You just get used to it. The hunger and pain. And the end justifies the means. And honestly, I wanted to look good naked. So I didn't really eat. And you're immensely proud of yourself for having such massive self-control.

Sorry. 

Being with him was just like constantly an adventure and like watching Bill Nye. We learned so much about the world (history, science, politics, philosophy, theology, conspiracies, astronomy, explosives, environmentalism. It was glorious.) from each other, and we were never bored. We're never bored together. We're either content in silence, or we're in open and honest conversation. 

I decided to go to school in Boston, where I am now. I choose the school because they gave me the biggest scholarship and I didn't want to depend on my parents financially very much once I was an adult. I liked the school because they really emphasized travelling, studying abroad, and work experience in companies during college. 

I told him I loved him in May, and because I think it's a lazy thing to express your appreciation towards someone with just those three words, I told him why. I loved him for his conviction, his idealism, his stubborn views, his open-mindedness, his eagerness to experience the world and see everything. His fierce protection of everything natural. His disgust with the waste created by society, and his intolerance for small talk and useless precedents. I loved him for what he wanted to do in life and for wanting to travel more than anything. I loved him for his sillyness and his immaturity, and his questioning nature. I loved him for his work ethic, and for his love of mental and physical struggle. I loved him for his sense of adventure and I loved him for his similar views on gender relations, but still being open to being with me and caring for me. I loved him for being comfortable and open with me. 

We spent a lot of summer together, but he spent a month and a half of it in the complete wilderness in the Northwest of the U.S. in a work program that involved trail maintenance and a lot of hard manual labor.  We weren't able to talk or contact each other at all during that, but it was fine. 

When he got back, we talked. Because we had planned to end things before we went our separate ways to college. We talked. Hard and long. Because when you have two individual who are skeptical about gender relations as we are, well, you talk a lot. But he told me that he wouldn't really ever find a girl as similar to him as me (and I felt similarly towards him) and that our friendship/relationship means a lot to him. We both think that marriage shouldn't be a legal institution, and that it's really degrading to what have two people have together. Just a personal opinion. 

But we really both wanted each other in each other's futures. A lot. So, we decided to do the first semester, and then meet up and talk. 

So, I moved to Boston. I hated it. I missed fresh air, trees, and sunlight. The students were all so generic and close-minded compared to my previous group of friends. They were ivy league kids. The product of their parents desires. Perfectly made up and perfectly toned. The only thing they probably admired me for was my 20 inch waste. And I missed him like crazy. 

So, I turned to food. Meal plans are like an open bar for an alcoholic if you have issues with eating. I remember eating a cookie my second night there. I hadn't eaten in a cookie in at least three months. Man. It was orgasmic. And before I knew it I had eaten about twenty. 

So, I rushed to the bathroom threw up. And I fasted the next day, because you can never get it all out. I had a stint of that in my sophomore year in high school, but it's really ineffective compared to not eating. And I like the hunger. It makes you feel together.

But, oh man. I could have eaten an entire whale. 

I skyped him at least an hour or two a day. Little bit excessive I know. I kept the eating thing from him. 

So, I started a pattern of overeating massively and not being able to throw up. Long story short, I gained about thirty pounds in two months. It's not hard to do. Gain weight. 

The weight gain made me feel more than disgusting. My confidence fell apart and I couldn't make friends because I was so disgusted with myself. This fat disgusting person with no self-control and a crippling depression. I did well in school somewhat, but not as well as I could. 

I lost myself. And just became this mess of worry and self-hatred and eating issues.

When he and I were talking one night, he mentioned that he didn't really want to stay in the same place for long, and that he wish he was alone so that he could experience everything he wanted in life. I understood his restlessness, but it still hurt. It hurt a lot. 

Last night, I broke down while talking to him. I told him honestly how much I hate myself when I'm overweight. How self-conscious I am. How I didn't want him to see me naked, and I honestly would rather not see him than have him see me the way I am now. I cried. The depression.The city. The lack of friends. It was all first world problems, I know. But god. The sum of it all just made me want to jump out the window. I wasn't worth anything anyway, and if I died now I couldn't get any fatter, and I wouldn't be creating any more waste.

Continued in comments. Sorry.

EDIT: I'm about to head to bed. Thank you all so much for your kind words. Thank you. I really appreciate it. You have no idea how much it helps to know that just a few strangers on the internet are at least thinking of you, and that countless have been here before. I scheduled something with my health clinic at the university, just to have someone to talk to. I guess, time. Time. Thank you. "
mn2ys,9,2011-11-23,Should I drop my MIS minor?,frankieg101,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/mn2ys/should_i_drop_my_mis_minor/,"My university offers a management information systems major/minor, and I chose to pick up the minor on top of my accounting and finance double major. I have 4 classes left for it, and 3 semesters to get it done. This means 2 classes will be spring of my senior year, a 6 credit project with a company that we help with IT or whatever else. However, I have a big 4 internship already lined up for the summer and I don't see myself as being too interested in this company project for my minor if I'm already going to have an accounting job, even though the subject of MIS doesn't bore me really.

I'm just wondering what you guys think of the usefulness of the minor for a big 4 audit position. In interviews, I tried to bring that question up and basically what everyone said was that it's useful to understand the IT side of things and being able to talk to the IT people in the company (sorry if this sounds stupid I don't really understand too much yet), but I won't actually use it for auditing.

So what does everyone think? Is it going to be useful in the end? I'm picking my next semester's classes now and this would affect that so I'm trying to make a decision. Any input on the real world usefulness of this type of minor would be appreciated. Thanks!"

I'm still trying to find my foot in the door opportunity to follow what I would like to be a career in Sound Design for video games.  The only problem is that I don't have any specific experience coding for video games which makes it very difficult to get a job for one.  What I'm wondering is would it be easier for me to try and get an internship at a company first and learn coding through work experience, or go back to school and get a THIRD degree for programing?  

What am I up against? If I go back to school, I potentially put off paying back very hefty student loans that I've accumulated from going to a one year tech school.  If I get the internship, I'm not making a ton of money if any to continue paying back my student loans as I currently am.  Which do you think would be a better choice or is there another way that I can get into sound design for video games?  This may also be an appropriate topic for /r/gaming I guess."

Did I overreact?",[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/mmrc6/update_to_ldr_just_ended_what_do_i_do_with_his/,"Here's the original post (it's tres short): http://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/mljfw/ldr_just_ended_what_do_i_do_with_his_stuff/

 This might be lengthy, so I apologize in advance. I'm just extremely confused.

 A little background us. He's 21, I'm 22. He goes to school near our hometown, and I'm at a different school 5 hours away. We met through a summer internship at our parents' job. I'm the first girl that's made him want to ""settle down and commit to a relationship."" Known each other for 6 months, dating for 4, LDR for 3. I've been in a few relationships, but I've never felt as comfortable or happy with anyone else as I am him.

 We talked last night in circles and I'm in need of advice. I'm a fairly laid back person, but I'm all strung out.  Here's what we talked about. 

* 1- He told me previously that when he doesn't want to talk to a girl/gets bored with her, he ignores her.

 He doesn't talk to me for a week (not even a hello) or answer the handful of times I contact him.  I assume he wants to break things off. He tells me that was stupid and illogical, I'm making a big deal out of nothing and we're okay.



* 2- He's still ""single"" on facebook. His reasoning: is that it's not a big deal if he keeps it up there, he knows what's going on the relationship and if he takes it down, he might as well deactivate his whole facebook.

 I'm a pretty private person as well. My friends and family know I'm dating him. I don't have any status up on facebook at all. He said it wouldn't bother him if I had single up there. I just feel kinda put off that it's as if he wants to give the impression that he's single, or that he has to resort to being irrational and deactivating his facebook
  

* 3- He wants to keep his ""private life private"" and therefore I don't think anyone has a clue we're together. I've met some of his guy friends, but the introduction was ""This is so-and-so, she's goes to StateU."" I'm not sure what message that sent.

 I guess what bothers me is one of his guy friend's tried to get him to sleep with another girl. If his friend knew we were together, maybe it wouldn't have happened? Also, someone made a joke about him having a girl, and he flipped out saying ""Whoa, no girl here.""
   


* 4- He says I overstepped boundaries by contacting his mom last week. He might be right, but I'm not entirely sure.

 I have met his mom a few times in the work environment, and spoken on the phone (per his request) with her but haven't met her officially as the girlfriend. She had invited me to Thanksgiving with friends, and said she considers me part of the family.

 I was supposed to work all this week but got the time off. I emailed his mom to see if she could help me surprise him. She was happy to do so. When I was trying to see what his schedule would be like for the week and he never answered, I simply told her I wouldn't be able to do it and might not be making it to Thanksgiving after all. She mentioned it to him, and he got mad that I contacted her before ""meeting her in a social setting.""


* 5- I have to work early Friday so I'm leaving tomorrow. He said it's pointless to see him today or tomorrow since it's an immediate family member's birthday and tomorrow is Thanksgiving. He said he'd see me at Christmas, since I didn't stop by since getting into town.

 He's going to his family's later this morning, so I offered to just see him for an hour or so. He lives on the way to my best friend's (they go to the same U), so it wasn't as if I was going completely out of my way. He said he wouldn't be up if I stopped by and the birthday would be a whole day affair. I also offered to stop by on my way out of town tomorrow, and he said he'd be celebrating with his family.

 He then said that I should just do what I want since I don't listen to him anyway. I ceded and said I'd just see him at Christmas. He said me agreeing to side with him was a turn off because it made me seem like I was doing it to please him. He said the only way to see him since I picked an ""inconvenient week"" is come to spend the night. Mind you this is at 1am, and it's a 40 minute drive to his apartment.




 I'm feeling slightly crazy since everything is apparently my fault. Everything was great up until last week. He's a sarcastic person, but if this was all a joke, I think it went entirely too far. I have (or had) implicit trust in him which is a rare thing for me when it comes to relationships. I'm not sure what to do/think. Two weeks ago, this guy is telling me how important I am to him and nearly drops the ""L"" bomb, excited for me to come home, and now this...

The kills in the first episodes also seemed a little forced/rushed without much context, almost as if the writers were grasping at strings trying to connect the audience with what they love and had grown accustomed to(a kill to seal the episode).  Masuka is the funniest character in the series and is all but inexistent this season.  LaGuerta's role is weak and her acting also seems forced/stinks this season.  The sexy intern brought some welcome sex appeal but then vanished almost as quickly as she came, and in a swirl of potential drama(stolen hand).  Batista's sister takes the focus off of us wondering why/how Dex can be absent from Harrison so much while working/masquerading as a serial killer, but she seems mostly irrelevent.  Come to think of it, I came to rely on Dexter's save-the-day/kill-the-bad-guy persona and have felt rather unfulfilled this season.  I have, however, enjoyed the rather dramatic ending sequences of the episodes involving the DDK that leave me wondering about the next episode, but even these seem unfamiliar and unlike any of the other episodes/seasons.

mmjjf,5,2011-11-23,Pepper spray associated with increased risk of death in people taking stimulants - From a newsletter a friend got,[deleted],occupywallstreet,https://www.reddit.com/r/occupywallstreet/comments/mmjjf/pepper_spray_associated_with_increased_risk_of/,"&gt;Dear Colleagues -
&gt; 
&gt;Here in California I've been seeing a lot of press coverage about police officers dousing protestors (and bystanders) with pepper spray. Pepper spray and hot chili peppers share the same active ingredient that gives them their heat - capsaicin. While being pepper sprayed is merely extremely unpleasant for most people, some groups have elevated risk of serious harms. Our group published a paper on the lethality of capsaicin when combined with cocaine. We found that capsaicin is capable of turning a survivable dose of cocaine into a lethal dose.
&gt; 
&gt;As with any drug, it is important that pepper spray only be used when appropriate, that it be used in the smallest dose required to reliably produce the desired effect, and that those using it be aware of possible adverse effects and drug interactions. In addition to hoping that the police take care when they use pepper spray, I also hope that folks under the influence of cocaine will steer clear of areas in which pepper spray is being used. 
&gt; 
&gt;My thanks to all of those who made this work possible - the subjects, NIDA for funding us, anonymous peer reviewers, co-authors, and many very hard working technicians, coordinators, interns, and behind the scenes administrators.
&gt; 
&gt;You can download a copy of the paper [here \[PDF\]](http://library.constantcontact.com/download/get/file/1106567940123-8/Capsaicin.pdf).
&gt; 
&gt;Abstract
&gt; 
&gt;Since 1992, California police have been using pepper sprays containing oleoresin capsicum (OC) as a nonlethal method to subdue delirious or violent individuals. Capsaicin is a primary ingredient in OC spray. From January 1993 to June 1995, at least 20 deaths in California were associated with OC and stimulant drug (cocaine, amphetamines, or ephedrines) exposure. Based on this background, we hypothesized a direct potentiation of cocaine toxicity by capsaicin. We performed animal experiments and also reviewed human data involving capsaicin and stimulants. The lethal effects of capsaicin administered with cocaine (both compounds administered intraperitoneally) were assessed in 14 groups of 20-40 male mice. Capsaicin at 10 mg/kg increased the lethality of cocaine in mice dosed at 60 mg/kg from 13% to 53% (P &lt; 0.01) and for cocaine at 75 mg/kg from 53% to 90% (P &lt; 0.001). Data from 26 autopsy and police reports from incidents in which death occurred after OC exposure were retrospectively analyzed for demographics, ethnicity, underlying disease, cause of death, and toxicology. All human deaths occurred in delirious and combative males, and 79% of these deaths occurred 1 h or less after OC exposure. Data indicated the presence of stimulants including cocaine in as many as 19 out of 26 deaths: 9 involved methamphetamine, 6 cocaine, 3 methamphetamine plus cocaine, and 1 pseudoephedrine. The animal experiments together with the human retrospective analysis support the idea that exposure to OC spray in cocaine-intoxicated individuals potentiates cocaine lethality.

1. I will have a graduate degree in science. Most law students will be unable to compete with me for the jobs in my  niche.

2. I can have most of my tuition covered (GI Bill).

3. I'm fairly confident that my scores will get me into a good school.

I am from Montreal and I just arrived in Michigan for an internship and to improve my English (it's getting better but still far from my French).
This internship is part of my Master degree that I am doing at l'Université de Montréal. 

I am here since a September so I don’t know a lot of people yet.
It`s too bad because I am sociable, I like to party and I would like to go out to discover the city (bars, restaurants, etc.) but alone it`s not the top.

I am 26, super chill, easy going. I like to have serious discussions from times to times and also like to have fun and enjoy life.   

I have been abroad several times (just for fun with friends or for school in exchange) but it`s the first that that is in a «professional environment» and I am realizing that is way more difficult like that to meet people. So, I decided to give it a try on reddit, I thought it be a good way to talk to interesting people.

So I'm currently a sophomore Chemistry and Psychology(the psych major is due to various things, none that are really important) major. I have a deep love of Organic chemistry yet at the same time I find neuroscience fascinating. I've done research on organic chemistry so I know that I could easily see myself working on it, but neuroscience continues to fascinate me. 

What I was wondering is if there is a field that combines the two. From what I've seen or read Neuroscience places more emphasis with biology. I've been looking at various SURF programs and other types of internships and most neuroscience programs deal with a psychology heavy regiment or a biology heavy regiment. Do neuroscience and chemistry not mix or am I just not finding the right things?

However, the people at work are brilliant and really acommodating.
There is tea, coffee and laughter all the time.
However, we actually also do some work.
We have a pool of about 5000 linguists who are in our database, and we employ about 250 on a regular base.
Our Employer, Stéphanie Denton, is having an eye on every move and is managing together with Keith their business.
They started expanding this year after being successfull for quite a time now, thus i had the chance to be the first intern.
My duties are basically translating and contacting companies, nothing unusual as i have a backgroung in retail and a degree in economics.

So, as i started being on reddit a few weeks ago, i figured i could post this, and take your questions, or maybe even requests for translations.
This is reddit after all, isn´t it ? ;)
Oh yeah, and of course we offer brochures and a landline for more details. I can also post them if requested.

Ultimatums and job issues...,stille88,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/mnwws/am_i_being_too_hard_on_him_ultimatums_and_job/," 23F dating a 32M. I've been with my bf for 1.5 yrs, and I thought he was actually the man I wanted to marry. Everything seemed to go well at first; we have a lot in common and we're intellectually compatible. However, he's had some bad luck with money. It started out where we'd go out for dates. But, then he ended up following me across the country for an internship, and had a hard time finding a job, so I started supporting both of us. 

I thought this would be temporary, and that when we got back home (i was finishing my degree), he'd get a job and things would get back to normal of sharing the weight. So, he finds a job, works at it for a month, and then one morning decides to call in sick. Of course he gets fired (this wasn't the first time). However, instead of looking for a new job right away, he decides to play video games and smoke pot with his sister and her bf for the next month. Meanwhile, I'm working a pt job while going to school, and i'm financing everything. 

So, at christmas we have a chat, he starts looking for a job, finds one, again things seem to be finally resolving. Fast forward three months later. His car is stolen (which he needs for this job), and he gets fired again. This time he starts looking right away. Finds another job, that he doesn't realize only gives commission. 
The whole time I'm financing everything on my entry-level just out of college job. 

Fast forward to now. We moved across the country for my post-grad studies, and after a month he had a job, then lost it again because it turned out to be a scam. Cycle repeats.

He's a great boyfriend in that he's there for me emotionally and is supportive, but he sucks at keeping a job and giving me financial stability. I feel gulilty and frustrated that I have to nag him about this, but hey, i'm a poor student that didn't expect to be supporting a 32M. I hoped that he would be the stronger person, but i was wrong.

Now, I've given him an ultimatum. Find a job by Christmas, or we're done. It's hard because I honestly thought he was the person I'd marry, but this cycle just wears and wears on me, and adds to all the other pressures I deal with externally.

So, am I being to hard on him? He's had some bad luck, but he owes me alot of money that I feel i may never see again and I'm tired of being the mother figure. Hell, i want to be the gf.
And, to top it all off, this really makes our sex life suck.

I am a post-bacc jr at a mildly recruited b-school. I have five campus interviews lined up in Dec. for sp '13 internships in public accounting (2 B4, 3 regional). I don't have the most awe-inspiring academic career or work history, so this isn't too shabby.

Well a wrench got thrown in my plan. I suddenly got an interview Friday for an internship with a big, well known but somewhat floundering company. Tuesday, I got an official offer. (no second interview or anything! insane.) Dilemma is because if I take the offer I have to forfeit all my interviews. I DO want to go into industry at some point but I wanted to get a start in public. 

I have to decide on the offer before my interviews take place, so if I turn it down and don't get any offers from the public firms I'm screwed. Just from your experiences and statistical knowledge of how many students usually make it past the first interviews at the big companies- Should I reject the offer and essentially ""go all in""? Will my non-stellar work history (I've only worked retail jobs, though I did awesome at them) come back to bite me in the ass or did I pass that hurdle by getting the interview?

I have decades of self-loathing, social anxiety, and family bullshit to work through, and it is really tough. I feel broken. Between my schoolwork, internship, and other responsibilities, it is really hard to make the time to workout every day. I wish I was losing weight quicker, and it is difficult to stay motivated when I literally have an entire person's worth of weight to go.

I like my home to be clean but sometimes I get lazy - I'm not anal about cleanliness.

I grew up w/ NOT wearing shoes in the house and that is how I like to live. It keeps the house cleaner and its more comfy. At the same time I understand that not everyone likes to live that way - I'm willing to compromise. 

I'm going to be pretty busy during the week with school &amp; side projects but I'm a strong believer of not doing work on Saturday.
I'll also be cooking most of my meals on a daily basis and shopping at the farmers market &amp; trader joes 

I don't care about sexual orientation, sex, race, political stances etc. I want to live with people who are chill, rational, somewhat clean, considerate and understand that you can't hate someone for their views, because they have a different history.

I would consider myself mature for my age, almost all of the friends I made over the past 1.5 years are 20-28 years. That being said, I don't care if you are 25 or 18, I won't judge by your age.

Pets: I'm cool with it, as long as your pet(s) are chillin. 
Smoking (cigarettes): as long as you are respectful about it. If you role your own then that's +points rather than minus and I might join.
Drugs &amp; Alcohol: I don't judge, do what you want just don't endanger anyone. I'm moderate in stance and use in this category, but being underage in the US might change things : \

Each e-mail was to the point, had the necessary information, demonstrated knowledge of the company, and included a resume. In addition, if I didn't receive a response within three weeks, I sent out another e-mail to another person from the company.


(By the way, I'm from the U.S., have passed three exams, had internship experience, have a high GPA, and am graduating university in March.)


Within the first month of sending the e-mails, I had about ten phone interviews, some more successful than others. I've had three companies fly me in for a face to face (""no"" from one, waiting on the other two) and had others promise to keep communicating only to be completely ignored by them (yes, I've tried reaching back out to them too). We also had companies come on campus, which I've interviewed with, and been decently successful with.


Now: it's Thanksgiving weekend, and I still haven't received an offer. These are the possible reasons I've come up with as to why:

1. I'm from the Midwest, and since I don't really want to work in the Midwest, any company that wants to interview me has to fly me in. This is costly so most won't even make the effort.

2. It's still too early.

3. There just aren't positions. Companies aren't hiring, or if they are, they're keeping their previous interns.

4. I'm being too selective.

5. I'm not interviewing well. 


I guess I can briefly get into my interview process: I'm relaxed, honestly, maybe more than I should be, but I try not to be cocky. I can answer all questions, I don't bullshit, I don't suck up, I have a knowledge of and genuine interest in the company, and I ask good, interesting questions. I like to think finding a job is like dating: there's no point pretending to be someone you're not if you're going to have to keep pretending. And honestly, I've been coming out of 80% of my interviews feeling confident that they went well.


So...if you're still reading at this point, do you think you can help me identify what my problem might be and/or possible solutions? I can give you more information, if needed, but I figured this was already way too long as it is. Thank you.

A bit about myself, I enjoy reading and seeing how people communicate (body language [facial expressions, hand gestures], why they do things and understand what they're trying to say), I feel like this description sounds vague however I do not have much academic experience in this field. One thing is for sure I am good at it, I am good at convincing people , reading them and knowing how I do it...I want to understand it as a science and not so much as a natural skill."

It has been fantastic seeing her face and celebrating the holidays with her. We also had the chance to celebrate me getting my dream job, at a fantastic local sushi place, have some wonderful sexy-times, great food cooked by her mom, and generally just enjoy each others presence. Well, all good things must end this included.  
  
However, unlike when she left 6 weeks ago for the first time, this was a very easy separation. In this week I found out my job starts a month later than I was thinking (late feb instead of early feb) so I can spend a long period with her over Christmas and still spend time with my family here before I move out to my job (closer to her). So I purchased tickets to spend 3 weeks with her and I will be leaving to do so in 3 weeks and we will celebrate Christmas AND New Years together. I fly out the day after I officially graduate college with the degree I have been after since freshman year of high school. My job will pay me enough to fly us around to see each other at least once a month over the next year while we are still LD, as well as cover rent in a kick ass apartment by myself until she can move in and get a yob for herself once her current internship is over, and still have allot left over for fun shit. And it will halve the distance between us and drop the cost of plane tickets by at least half.  
  
Last time we parted I had no idea what the future had in store for me, we had no plans to see each other until around Christmas-ish (this trip that just ended was unplanned, just good fortune) and even then we didn't know for how long we would be together. Everything on all fronts is going better than my most optimistic hopes and I am so thankful for the support this forum provides, as well as the good fortune that has been afforded me. I know there are many of you out there in much more difficult situations and this may come across as kind of gloating, but I am sorry I just had to share this.

TL;DR: Its much easier to say goodbye when you know how amazing the future is going to be.

We were together for 6 years.  It wasnt perfect, but i thought it was pretty damn good.  I graduated university before her and did an internship in another city in my summer before grad.

  I was pissed,  she had left for work other summers and i stood by her.  My internship was done and i was moving back soon.  I told her to move out, she did.  Her new roommate was nuts, so she asked to move back in.  I thought we could still work things out at this point, we share a cat, and i was working out of town a lot, so i thought that this could be managable.  This was about a year ago.  It turned out that she replaced me with a pile of alcohol and drugs.  She came home drunk every night, was constantly high and did an unspecified amount of cocaine.  Of course, i was still in love with her and wanted to fix her.  I mean, shes a bright girl with a great future, and wasnt into any of this stuff while we were together.  Surely this isnt *her*.  I know her.  Shes this sweet, beautiful girl and we love each other and would do anything to help each other.

Eh, I dont know what to think anymore.  Nothing has changed and its been a year. Ive asked her to leave a few times, and she told me that we could work things out.  I believed her.  I dont anymore.  But heres the rub -- shes 4 months away from graduation, and cant afford her own place.  Hell, she cant even afford to pay her part of the rent and utilities at my place.  The only thing she could do is live with her dad an hour and a half away, in Canada, in the winter.  And commute both ways every day for class.

Oh, and she has a new boyfriend.  And she just got diagnosed with lupus. And I still love her, so even though im done with the relationship, it royally bums me out to live there.  Im just a fucking mess, and shes worse.

Wtf do i do with all this? I feel like i cant bring myself to kick her out, but I hate myself for supporting her while shes out partying with her new boyfriend."

I have two years of experience in research labs, which I eventually entered into a supervisory position for, and did things such as submit budget proposals and write reports. Solid GPA (3.84) from a reputable University of California. But in the real world, my experience is just retail. 

My question is, what do I transition to? I've started off on a career path that I can't pursue due to practical concerns. I would eventually like to continue on and get an MA in something like forensic psychology, but I need a full time job until I have the financial means for that.

Right now, I'm only guaranteed work until January 3rd.  As of January 4th, I am unemployed by my current company because my internship will be over.  I can talk to my managers about continuing the internship on a limited hour basis, but that won't cover even a day of work a week and may not even happen.  I'm only halfway through a bachelor's degree in business and hate studying online, but I can't afford to not study and pay back student loans by dropping student status.

Currently I live with my serious SO of ten months.  He has a brilliant job and is being as supportive as possible, but I feel like such a burden because I don't know what I'll be doing in January, and I'm earning less than a third of what he's making when comparing our current positions.  I'm worried that I'll never have a decent salaried job like he does because I haven't even got a vague goal to head towards, and I'm afraid it'll mess up our relationship if he realizes I may never have that.  I've been stressed with worrying about school and lack of work come January for so long but keeping control, but now with increased hours due to the holiday season, I've hit a breaking point, and I don't want my stress to affect us.  I know, I know, he's supposed to support me, but I don't want to keep falling apart to tears because I'm frightened about my uncertain career future and because I feel completely lost.

I have zero passions, zero ambition, and zero direction.  I'm a 21 year old female and I feel immobilized by fear that I've already screwed up everything, that I'll always be trapped in miserable retail work, just making it by on part time jobs.  What did you do when you were this age?  When you reached a similar point in life?  What do I do now?

Edit(ed to add a few things that seem a little key on another read-through):  I've been working merch at WDW, which was the previous goal, and now I realize it's absolutely awful to work it 45 to 55 hours a week.  My schooling was two full years of private liberal arts college, now part-time online so that I can study and still work full time.  I'm only getting the degree because I have upwards of $50,000 in debt already and everyone seems to think it's better to have something to show for debt than nothing because everyone also apparently thinks having a degree magically makes jobs appear from thin air."

mq8de,2,2011-11-26,Why I'm not finishing this year: (mis)Adventures in writing literary fiction for NaNoWriMo,Id10t3qu3,nanowrimo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nanowrimo/comments/mq8de/why_im_not_finishing_this_year_misadventures_in/,"The first thing I should say is this: I've been reading Infinite Jest for the last few months, and if ever there was a book that could make 50,000 words seem like a trivial amount of work its that one, but that's not really what I want to write about.

I've been active in the NaNoWriMo forums, and from what I've seen, the vast majority of people who undertake this challenge are writing what I've heard other ""literature nerds"" derisively call ""genre fiction.""  Now, I don't have anything against fantasy or sci-fi or anything: if I do have a complaint, it's that I don't have a wild enough imagination to come up with a fully-realized world in my own head and then commit said world to paper.  It's just not something my brain can do.  So instead, I've been formulating an idea in my head that's been based on a rule I hear a lot in writing classes, ""Write What you Know.""  Well, there's really only a handful of things I know in this way: distance running, college life, and binge drinking.  

The plot of my book sounds pretty simple on paper, though I'll admit I have loftier goals than the plot sounds.  My goal was this: to write a book that captured, as realistically as I could, what it is like to go to an American college here in the 21st century.  The plot was boiled down a little further (this is something I've been outlining and whatnot for almost a full year).  The core group of characters are distance runners, they train for running, they drink too much, they interact with kids who are in frats, or are simply not runners, they fall in love, get hurt, and so forth.  (if anyone is actually that interested, you can read the short story I'm expanding into this book [here](http://www.danielcevans.com/uploads/7/9/4/1/7941205/you_leave_stuff_there_by_daniel_c_evans.pdf), though I should note that's a PDF, I promise I'm not going to ruin your computer).

I used Scrivner, which I have fallen in love with and am going to buy the full version of here soon.  I loved the features for adding characters, for keeping track of locations, all of it, it really was a tool I wish I'd had long ago.

Now, here's the catch.  If I wanted to, I could finish and ""win,"" I'm about 5k words away from ""winning,"" but for me, actually winning would be a hallow victory.  I've taken away a large number of lessons from what I've written so far (i'd estimate that, plot-wise, I'm only about 15% of the way there, if even that).  I want to share these lessons, and also extrapolate on why I'm going to go back to the drawing board for a bit before I start writing what will be draft #2.

1.  Structure.  I had a large cast of characters in mind, and each time I wrote about one and felt them come to life, I was thrilled.  That being said, I have a scope in mind here that is really expansive.  I want to present college life as realistically as possible, and along with that, NaNoWriMo has given me the ability to understand what I want the structure of the novel to be: less time with individual characters, but enough to make them real, and more time moving from character to character.

2.  Scale.  I thought 70k words was going to be sufficient for me to actually write this plot.  The answer is no, not with the vision I have now.  I'd say the more realistic assessment is 150k plus.  There's nothing wrong with that, especially for the first draft of a long work, but putting the scale of this project into perspective has made me feel encouraged rather than upset.

3.  Outlining.  I already had the plot in mind and so-forth, but now that I have the novel's structure in place, I am really going to blow this thing out of the water on the outlining front: there are three sections to the book, the first taking place in fall of the present year, the middle section jumping back a year and a half, and the third section taking place in spring of the present year.  I want to write, especially for the two chapters in the current year, one scene for each day of the semester.  Ridiculous, yes, but on paper, this allows for a meticulous and precise way to outline things.  I'm going to take that ball and run with it in a big way.

Now, I don't know when I will actually write this new, expanded version of the book I envision.  I have lofty plans to do it this summer, when I will have some time in-between internships and jobs to figure it out.  Basically, this post was supposed to be me patting myself on the back, a bit half-heartedly, I'll admit, while acknowledging what I've gained from this experience.

To those of you who are making that last push, godspeed, I'm sure you will do great.  That's r/NaNoWriMo, I will see you around, I'm sure!"

All of that - just to serve as a reminder for the fans of the show for who ITK is? I mean, I hate to jump to conclusions but I feel like that's all it was. There are still four episodes left to be proven wrong but - well - at the moment - its a frustration.

mpu1c,5,2011-11-26,Boyfriend and parents trouble,IllHaveASalute,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/mpu1c/boyfriend_and_parents_trouble/,"Ok Reddit, here goes nothing.

I have a boyfriend, and we've been together for about four year (I'm 22, he's 25). He's sweet, he's nice, but, the big problem is that him and my family don't get along. Various reasons for this ""He's no good for you."" ""They're trying to control you."" ""He/his parents don't have jobs."" ""They're dicks."" and so on, and so on.

My parents aren't as controlling as he seems to think they are (we're from quite different families, mine are a little pushy when it comes to expectations and social behaviour, his are more the 'as long as you're happy doing what you do' types.) They were, however, especially in the beginning, quite critical about him, his education, clothing style etc. 

Now, my parents aren't too bad to him any more, and that's a big relief to me, but he still doesn't like my family or being around my family. This makes every single birthday, holiday or otherwise special occasion in my family absolutely horrible for me. Not as much being there, but the discussions before it.

For example, today is my little sister's birthday, and tomorrow we're having a farewell dinner for her, because she's going abroad for her internship. My parents were hesitant to invite my boyfriend to this dinner, but did anyway, because they knew it would make me feel horrible if he wasn't invited. Logically speaking, this means my boyfriend would also go to my little sister's birthday, but he refuses to hang out with my family two days in a row.

This, in turn, makes them disinclined to invite him to other things, which makes me feel bad, which makes him behave better when it comes to my family, which causes them to invite him to things despite his attitude, which makes him annoyed because of the time spent with my family, which makes my parents disinclined...

You get my drift.

What can I do about this? Do I just stay in the middle of this? It's getting really, really annoying, and makes me feel bad, generally.

Edited for ages and a little more info on why he doesn't get on with my folks. "

Does anyone have any advice on finding jobs? I've applied to a lot of companies, but at this point the military is looking pretty tempting. 

The only graduates from my class that have got jobs are the ROTC guys and a couple guys that got good internships at Lockheed. Everyone else did grad school or is working other unrelated low level jobs. So it seems like it's a tough thing to get in to... wish I had done EE."

This year I applied to 40-50 and still have not heard back. This has lead me to go to grad school (M.S. in structural engineering) but if I had a job offer I would take it in a heart beat. 

Please, students. TAKE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO NETWORK! Get those internships! You do NOT want to be going through what I am right now after years of hard work.

I'm a senior at a public university in the U.S. and will be going on to Grad School after this year.  I'm from out of state, so I'm paying a higher tuition than most people.  For the last 3 years, I've also had to fund my own education.  Because of the tanked economy, my parent's can't afford to pay for me and my two sisters to go to school so I've had to take a large amount of student loans to fund my education.

My parents never set up a trust fund or anything to help fund our education, and they didn't emphasize saving extensively while we were young to help pay for college education.  I've been able to get pretty good internships over the summers, but that income has gone towards living expenses (rent, food, gas, etc.) and haven't been able to save much of it for living throughout the year.  I've also had a part time job for the past two years during school to have some sort of income to try and take a dent out of all my expenses.

Overall, I've got barely enough to pay for rent.  I can't go to the grocery store to get food that often because I don't have enough money.  I've got about $1k for expenses, which seem to add up left and right.  Overall, I'm a very frugal person.  I don't go out often (maybe once a week compared to what seems like every night for most of my friends).  I don't buy new things or get sucked in by impulse buys.  And I do what I can to save wherever I can.  But none of it really seems to work when I look at my empty bank account every month.

Not really sure where I'm going here, but do you guys have any advice of things that I could be doing to a) minimize my expenses even further, b) get a little extra income, or c) do anything else that could help.  

I look forward to hearing your advice!"

Furthermore, I was thinking, for something like a GPA, where if the truth were told they would not be considered, how closely are these checked?

For the record, I have absolutely no intentions of lying (not that the word of some dude on the internet holds much weight) and my grades are sufficient that I don't really need to.  But I've always been curious, I can't imagine most internships are investigated much further than the resume.  If anyone could shed some light on the subject I'd be very curious to find out.

Also, I understand the obvious problems with getting an internship/job you are not actually qualified for and being found out very early and then having a terrible reference.

I'm applying to grad programs now, wondering how exactly these salaries based on schooling differ.    One program I'm applying to offers placement in an internship; the school says the average salary of the Msc students is about 50,000$ over a 9 month period.  My sister who did chemical engineering says that that's a completely inflated number and that most companies won't pay that much; she says that that's more than what a chemical engineer gets paid.
So for those of you who are in industry (or know a little bit more), are these numbers inflated? Is it financially worth getting a Masters or PhD?

mr331,4,2011-11-27,Intern anxiety ,Ludapiss,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/mr331/intern_anxiety/,"I work in a kitchen as an intern, this is my third week. my first two weeks were wonderful and everyone was really nice. My chef was suspiciously cold towards me in the beginning only giving me orders not looking me in the eye or having any conversations with me that I can participate in but i thought nothing of it. I need to complete a 6 week internship program in order to get my diploma that I paid $30,000+ dollars for. I feel like I'm being taken advantage of for my labor when I walk through those doors but still i walk on because of the pressure of debt. this diploma doesn't ensure you have a higher chance of getting a job in the slightest but it cost me a lot of money pain and suffering to get this far and I wasn't going to stop just short. I have attempted to complete this twice already and this is my third try, I will complete it or I will die trying. When I'm at work I keep my head down and work hard. I work as cleanly and tightly as possible and always am respectful of the chef. last week when the kitchen crew just got back to work from lunch and I was starting a project I put away before we broke for lunch. during lunch I was speaking to one of my coworkers whom is the only person other than myself who speaks enough English to carry on a conversation and just so happened to be also female. we carried on calmly doing our work while chatting to keep our minds busy. suddenly my chef (male) quietly walked up behind me and screams at the top of his lungs something along the lines of this: 'TWO WOMEN IN THE KITCHEN WHO CANT KEEP THEIR FUCKING MOUTHS SHUT, DO I HAVE TO SEPARATE YOU TWO OR ARE YOU ACTUALLY GOING TO GET SOME FUCKING WORK DONE AROUND HERE? we were not behind on our work in the slightest. YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS PROJECT FOR HOURS! I just got back from a 30 min lunch. DO YOU THINK I ACTUALLY NEED YOU HERE? DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING ANYTHING? I'M DOING YOU A FAVOR BY LETTING YOU WORK HERE!' keep in mind that there are also 5-6 men in the same kitchen watching and listening to this who have been speaking to each other and chatting in the same way (only in Spanish) and have heard chef come over to me and stomp all over me. 

I'm not there to be a super star chef I'm not there to 'take over' or even find a job. all i want to do is complete my hours and leave and stay away from psycho's like this. the funny thing is I love cooking and I love to work in a kitchen but the last 3 jobs I have had, have ended this way. Now I have to look forward to being berated and humiliated for the enjoyment of my chef and while working the lowest of lowest of jobs while not getting paid a cent and I'm struggling to get out of bed in the morning. 

TLDR; I'm working as an intern in a kitchen with a sexist, sadist, chef who has berated and humiliated me and will probably continue. I have serious anxiety, depression, and self harm issues. I still have over 180hrs left to complete, I'm not sure if I'm going to make it out the other side but I have no choice but to keep going. "
mr15y,0,2011-11-27,Why does he still want to be with me?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/mr15y/why_does_he_still_want_to_be_with_me/,"My boyfriend (24) and I (22) moved in for the first time this past summer after having dated for three years since my sophomore year of college. This is the first serious relationship we've both been in. He and I have never lived out on our own before excluding dorms, so the first time I moved out, I moved out with him, which probably wasn't the best idea.

We've been having a really rough time adjusting, and fighting over a lot of things especially chores. I'm the one who has a lower tolerance for mess, and I would nag him incessantly, always wanting things to be done a certain way. He's really stubborn, and tends to rationalize how his way of (not) doing things is correct. He would complain that I would do all the chores before he got a chance to get to them, and then I would yell at him for not doing them. All of this bred much resentment on both of our parts. Whenever we would have serious arguments, he tended to leave the house when I got too annoying, which would frustrate me even more. I have also done some pretty irrational things when upset (e.g. pouring cat litter on his head), so I know I'm not blameless in all of this.

I also don't feel like we have a lot in common anymore. He enjoys sleeping in until 4 or 5 pm on weekends, whereas I would like to be up and doing something productive, preferably outside, and not in front of a monitor screen. However, he is content to merely play video games or watch GSL. I don't have any friends of my own or a lot of hobbies, so I know I rely on him too much for a social outlet. I would complain about not spending enough quality time together, but I can see how that may be an issue I have to deal with on my own.
Never throughout this time have I wanted to break up despite all the fights, however, he has expressed before that he would be happier being single, and that this isn't what he signed up for. I have a feeling I am just afraid of being alone, or that I am too attached to him because I don't have much of a life outside of the relationship. Flash forward to somewhat recently, we had another fight right before I left to visit a friend from high school on the opposite coast. He wrote me a check reimbursing a rather expensive birthday gift I had purchased him, and didn't come home the night before I left.

While I was at my friend's, I contacted him, and bought him a video game to try and reconcile our past fight. I asked him if there was anything that could be done to fix our relationship, and he said no. This was when I finally mentally checked out and accepted that maybe we weren't right for each other and even though I cared about him, that might not be enough to fix things. I also stupidly got really drunk, and asked his good friend to sleep with me (one I had a bit of a crush on from a year before). I know it was wrong and a huge bitch thing to do, but I thought we were over. My friend did not help because she encouraged me, saying that I didn't owe my boyfriend anything, and he should have no control over what me or his friend choose to do.
I come back from my trip, and my boyfriend does a complete 180. He says he wants to work things out, and that he learned that I mean more to him than he previously thought. (He did get food poisoning and got into a minor car accident, while I was away). He's willing to put more effort in doing things that make me happy (cleaning, spending more time with me). Of course, at this point, I'm still obsessing over his friend. I agree to try and work things out with my boyfriend, but I continue chatting and texting with the friend (including minor flirting), which is really wrong, emotional cheating, etc.

I understand I'm putting his friend on a bit of a pedestal in a grass is greener type scenario. My boyfriend never officially graduated from college (needs two more credits). He was going to take a class over the summer, but he never went and had to drop it, which wasted $2000. I think he can be a bit irresponsible, and honestly, I don't want to be put in a situation where I have to pay for all of our living expenses because he can't get a job due to not having a degree (his paid internship right now is temporary for one year). His friend on the other hand seems more driven (applying to medical school), and even though he was probably as much of a gamer as my boyfriend, he claims to want to do more productive things with his time.

My boyfriend catches me talking to his friend and lying about it (twice), and of course accuses me of leading him on, which I don't dispute. The only problem is he still wants to be with me even after all of this. I even told him what happened when I was away. I've since stopped talking to his friend, but I almost still want to us to breakup because he certainly deserves better than how I've been treating him. Now I don't really know what to do... our lease isn't up for another 6 months or so.

It didn't used to bother me that I've only ever been with one person, but it's definitely starting to now. How can you possibly marry the first person you've ever had sex with? The only person you've ever kissed? I feel like I've settled down way too early. I live in the suburbs with a relatively stable job, but I feel very repressed. I never partied or dated a lot in college, so I never got it out of my system. Even if I were single now, I doubt I would have any success because it's hard for me to meet people, and I'm not the most friendly or social person.

I'm tired of my older coworkers asking me to check in with myself to see whether or not I'm happy, and telling me I'm too young to be putting this much effort into making my relationship work. I'm tired of my boyfriend's parents getting involved and suggesting we go to counseling, giving us relationship self-help books. I don't understand why they're so vested in our relationship in the first place. It's hard for me to separate my unhappiness with my own life verses my dissatisfaction with the relationship. I just don't want to get married, have kids, be stuck in a huge rut, end up getting divorced and generally regretting the way I've lived my life. I also don't know how to stop thinking about the friend, and wondering if things would be better with him because even if I were single, that's not something I could feasibly pursue anyway... My boyfriend is doing everything I've wanted him to do, but now I can't get any of these stupid thoughts out of my head, and it's definitely poisoning my outlook on our relationship.

tldr; Asked my boyfriend's friend to sleep with him. Told my boyfriend, and he still wants to stay together."

I have also done some pretty irrational things when upset (e.g. pouring cat litter on his head), so I know I'm not blameless in all of this. 

I also don't feel like we have a lot in common anymore. He enjoys sleeping in until 4 or 5 pm on weekends, whereas I would like to be up and doing something productive, preferably outside, and not in front of a monitor screen. However, he is content to merely play video games or watch GSL. I don't have any friends of my own or a lot of hobbies, so I know I rely on him too much for a social outlet. I would complain about not spending enough quality time together, but I can see how that may be an issue I have to deal with on my own.

Never throughout this time have I wanted to break up despite all the fights, however, he has expressed before that he would be happier being single, and that this isn't what he signed up for. I have a feeling I am just afraid of being alone, or that I am too attached to him because I don't have much of a life outside of the relationship. Flash forward to somewhat recently, we had another fight right before I left to visit a friend from high school on the opposite coast. He wrote me a check reimbursing a rather expensive birthday gift I had purchased him, and didn't come home the night before I left. 

While I was at my friend's, I contacted him, and bought him a video game to try and reconcile our past fight. I asked him if there was anything that could be done to fix our relationship, and he said no. This was when I finally mentally checked out and accepted that maybe we weren't right for each other and even though I cared about him, that might not be enough to fix things. I also stupidly got really drunk, and asked his good friend to sleep with me (one I had a bit of a crush on from a year before). I know it was wrong and a huge bitch thing to do, but I thought we were over. My friend did not help because she encouraged me, saying that I didn't owe my boyfriend anything, and he should have no control over what me or his friend choose to do.  

I come back from my trip, and my boyfriend does a complete 180. He says he wants to work things out, and that he learned that I mean more to him than he previously thought. (He did get food poisoning and got into a minor car accident, while I was away). He's willing to put more effort in doing things that make me happy (cleaning, spending more time with me). Of course, at this point, I'm still obsessing over his friend. I agree to try and work things out with my boyfriend, but I continue chatting and texting with the friend (including minor flirting), which is really wrong, emotional cheating, etc. 

I understand I'm putting his friend on a bit of a pedestal in a grass is greener type scenario. My boyfriend never officially graduated from college (needs two more credits). He was going to take a class over the summer, but he never went and had to drop it, which wasted $2000. I think he can be a bit irresponsible, and honestly, I don't want to be put in a situation where I have to pay for all of our living expenses because he can't get a job due to not having a degree (his paid internship right now is temporary for one year). His friend on the other hand seems more driven (applying to medical school), and even though he was probably as much of a gamer as my boyfriend, he claims to want to do more productive things with his time. 

My boyfriend catches me talking to his friend and lying about it (twice), and of course accuses me of leading him on, which I don't dispute. The only problem is he still wants to be with me even after all of this. I even told him what happened when I was away. I've since stopped talking to his friend, but I almost still want to us to breakup because he certainly deserves better than how I've been treating him. Now I don't really know what to do... our lease isn't up for another 6 months or so.        

It didn't used to bother me that I've only ever been with one person, but it's definitely starting to now. How can you possibly marry the first person you've ever had sex with? The only person you've ever kissed? I feel like I've settled down way too early. I live in the suburbs with a relatively stable job, but I feel very repressed. I never partied or dated a lot in college, so I never got it out of my system. Even if I were single now, I doubt I would have any success because it's hard for me to meet people, and I'm not the most friendly or social person. 

I'm tired of my older coworkers asking me to check in with myself to see whether or not I'm happy, and telling me I'm too young to be putting this much effort into making my relationship work. I'm tired of my boyfriend's parents getting involved and suggesting we go to counseling, giving us relationship self-help books. I don't understand why they're so vested in our relationship in the first place. It's hard for me to separate my unhappiness with my own life verses my dissatisfaction with the relationship. I just don't want to get married, have kids, be stuck in a huge rut, end up getting divorced and generally regretting the way I've lived my life. I also don't know how to stop thinking about the friend, and wondering if things would be better with him because even if I were single, that's not something I could feasibly pursue anyway... My boyfriend is doing everything I've wanted him to do, but now I can't get any of these stupid thoughts out of my head, and it's definitely poisoning my outlook on our relationship. 

tldr; Asked my boyfriend's friend to sleep with him. Told my boyfriend, and he still wants to stay together.

He's openly admitted he's more into programming, and is just interning here for material on a video game he's making. Any intern spot where they train you and give you access to ongoing cases would be reserved for people who want to have a career there. Why waste the time on someone who admittedly isn't in it to win it?

This just doesn't make any sense to me. I'd rather take the guy with a weak stomach who wants to be there long term than someone who will waste the department's time and resources. Also, why is this game going unchecked by the department? If someone was working a serial killer case and told me, ""I'm making a video game of your department"" I'd be pretty concerned for the families of the victims that might have the details of their personal tragedies used as entertainment. 

He better be someone's nephew, is all I'm saying. The only excuse I'd believe for his hiring and placement is nepotism."
mqwam,0,2011-11-27,"Complaints about the ""We the People"" Petition System Need to Stop",strattonbrazil,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/mqwam/complaints_about_the_we_the_people_petition/,"I am only 29, but I am shocked by how many younger people actually seem genuinely disgusted that the [We the People](https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions) issue business-as-usual political responses.  I keep seeing posts like ""Sign this Petition to take Petitions Seriously!"" and wanted to state my case as to why these people need to stop whining.  

First, the Obama administration isn't going to take over the American government.  When Obama has been pressed publicly on certain laws affecting our government, most of the time he correctly defers the questions to the Legislature, which actually control most of the public policies.  An online petition system isn't going to change this.  

Second, just because there is an online petition system now doesn't mean the White House is now listening to you.  People have been able to send in letters and phone calls to the White House and they've been similarly addressed with equally worthless politically-safe responses.  The ""We the People"" website is a convenience rather than an awesome new voting system where you can now influence public policy based on your mouse click.  Just be grateful it doesn't cost you a stamp and cell phone minutes anymore.  

Third, recognize Obama has another year in his term and getting 25,000 petitions (or whatever the threshold is at the time) is pretty meaningless to his platform since he operates on the base of millions of voters.  If you're lucky, some intern will type up a meaningless response as you might get via mail or phone.  Stop whining that Obama isn't doing U-turns in Air Force One to get back to Washington and put your petition put into law.  

Glancing at the website, it makes no mention of intent that ""We the People"" will in any way affect public policy.  Don't expect to get special voting rights just because you know about it.  Complaints about responses that could just as easily be researched elsewhere are equally silly as that seems to be the entire intent of the system.  

&gt; ...We created We the People because we want to hear from you. If a petition gets enough support, White House staff will review it, ensure it’s sent to the appropriate policy experts, and issue an official response.
&gt; The idea of petitioning the White House or the government isn’t new, but this online platform is...

I'm a graduating senior from Michigan Tech with a degree in Mechanical Engineering and a 2.6 GPA. my GPA has never been above 3.0 my entire life (HS or college). I was able to obtain 2 internships with the sub 3.0 GPA. The GPA doesn't really reflect my intelligence, but more my attitude towards school work. I had a 30 ACT score, math was higher, reading was lower. After spending the past 9ish months hunting, I finally got a job at a place i wanted to work at. It has definitely been the most frustrating and painful processes I've been through. 

As you would imagine, not making the 3.0 mark makes finding a job incredibly difficult. It is still possible though, it just requires more work. You really have to turn yourself into a salesperson in order to answer the potential employers question of: ""Will this person be worth the money I'm going to pay?"".

I could write books on the process, what I went through, and what i learned along the way. I don't have that kind of time. So, whatever information you want to know just ask. I'll be around most of the day."

Now he doesn't in his new job, he gets home early morning and is off again. our communication consists of 10mins talks when he's on break and some chat when he gets home. This has completly thrown me, I don't have a lot of close friends but I keep busy at the wkds, the days he is off sometimes I only see him in the evening and he wants to disengage, we do quality time when we can but overall I feel like he nearly doesnt exist. Help me to cope. It was my choice to marry him but this is hard, I would rather he change jobs as i dont know how long this will go on for. I am scared to start any family since I will mostly be alone, again family live far not too close to them dont know anyone who would support me that much. This will no doubt affect our connection.

Edit- I would love to get a dog, I really want one but we live in a flat with no garden and saving money to get a place with one, one day.

I wouldn't ask him to change industry but perhaps the company

I will definatley look into getting into clubs and learn a new skill for company, I have friends but would like it to be based on more productive means of spending time.

I am unemployed at the moment so it is affecting me more, I am doing an internship and volunteering so will try to keep more and more busy.

mqs6t,2,2011-11-27,Why are my siblings much harder workers than me when we had the same education and upbringing?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/mqs6t/why_are_my_siblings_much_harder_workers_than_me/,"I really just couldn't be more lazy, and my two sisters have always been hard workers. One works long hours in a successful job in finance, and she's very devoted to advancing her career. Another went to a top ivy league school undergrad,  and now an elite med school, and has no qualms with studying for days at a time. We all attended the same elite schools kindergarten through highschool, schools which preached hard work and discipline. Both of my parents value and preach the value of hard work, lessons which seem to have sunk in with my siblings but not with me.

I've never had significant interest in school, which has shown from the earliest time that academic performance has been meaningfully assessed, (I'd say about the 5th grade), up until now in my sophomore year in college. Anytime I've had a job, after about 2 weeks my motivation dwindles drastically, and I begin doing a shoddier job. I've never really had interest in pursuing a career either. I don't really feel a personal or emotional attachment to my own future success, however you define success. Even when it comes to my dreams, which I do have and I do value, whenever I think of some way I could be moving closer to them, my reaction is just ""naw"". 

I did get an internship this semester where I'm finally starting to understand my strengths. Anything with a pretty immediate timeline, I work very well at and try to do a good job. Any kind of a medium or long term assignment, I find very hard to care about.

Nature vs. nurture? I wish I wasn't lazy :(

**tl;dr**: I don't care about school, work, or success. My siblings, my parents, and my education do. Why this discrepancy?"

mqhox,6,2011-11-26,Advice for student?,Beignet,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/mqhox/advice_for_student/,"So here's my situation: I'm a college student determined to graduate debt-free. I've got enough saved up to pay out of pocket for another year or so, but that still leaves another semester for which I have to take out a loan for, unless I do something about it. So in this next year, in between whatever I can do, be it a job, scholarships, stricter budgeting, methods a la r/beermoney, short-term investments, or whatever reddit can advise I do, I've got to save up about ~$9000. 

Some info:

* I already budget, and most months it comes down to: $338 for car payment and insurance, ~$150 for food, ~$120 gas, and ~$100-150 for misc.

* I'm currently doing a paying internship that I'll repeat next summer, and I'll hopefully get a raise for that also. It's given me a well-sized positive margin this semester. 

* If up to it, I can have a paid TA position next fall also. 

Is this even feasible, or worth bothering with? I go to a top engineering school with a reputation of good job prospects after college, and people seemed convinced a small amount of loans won't matter, but the idea of living with debt and not being able to find a job after school is truly frightening.

Time to change.,lazyengineer,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/msm69/at_my_lowpoint_time_to_change/,"I’m continually hitting my all-time low every day, hoping to turn it around. I'm a semester past my expected graduation date for Mechanical Engineering, going another semester on top of that. Not because I missed a year due to bad grades/co-op/just taking a break. I just failed enough classes to force me to take an extra year without failing out. 

I have a 2.0 GPA, which if you know anything about engineering, isn't really what employers want to see. I know I can do better, at least a 3.0, but I don't because of pure apathy. Almost all of my classes in these 4.5 years have had 10% of the grade as homework. I can probably count all the homework assignments I have done on my fingers and toes, and that's what actually makes me tear up at night. Knowing that if I just took 20-30 minutes out of my days to do those homework assignments, I would be in a much better situation.

I've managed one internship, this past summer, and I have no idea how I got it, I guess I just have good interpersonal skills because it sure wasn't my resume. Originally the plan was for me to graduate this semester and work full time for them starting January, plans changed when I found out I wouldn't be graduating this semester. I still had to apply to get the job, but that was essentially a sure thing. Instead I haven't applied, and haven't even contacted the company to update them on my situation. I slumped back into apathy. Every week for this entire semester (going on the 14th week in a row) I have told myself ""this is when I e-mail the company, I'm not going to put it off again"" but I never do. I think it's out of fear of rejection, that they won't wait for me to graduate, that I will have to find another company as generous as they were. No matter what it is, I can't bring myself to do something as simple as e-mail them.

On top of that, I have almost entirely stopped going to any classes. I sleep in late, stay in my room watching movies and TV shows to pass the days. The only classes I go to are the ones where there are tests, or group meetings/labs. I at least still do work for the classes where other students rely on me like lab reports and group projects, but nothing more than that. The killer is that I know I can learn the material in a night if I need to for tests. Knowing that I can get by without doing any work has kept me in this state of limbo for 4 years. Don't go to class, don't do homework, take the test, get an A or B on it, still get a C or D in the class. I almost wish I couldn't learn the material that easily, then I would have failed out long ago and gotten a wake-up call.

I’m overweight as well, only at 180, but I’m pretty short, 5'1"" short. Overall it gives me a rather poor self-image, adding in the fact that I haven’t had anything even close to a girlfriend since high school. 

The worst thing, and probably the lead cause of my apathy is how much I have lied to those around me over the past 5 years. My closest friends, my parents, my siblings, I have fed them all lies about my life. Telling them stories of what I wished my life were like as if it were the truth. I have had to live my life as if they were truths, but only as an outward appearance. Even as I’m writing this, I have to force myself not to lie to you, and this is a completely anonymous post… who do I have to lie to? I really want to turn those lies into realities, because it truly is who I want to be. I just can’t muster up the motivation to do anything about it when, for now, it’s easier to maintain the lies even though it causes me to be unhappy.

Just writing this has helped a bit, maybe not with motivation, but with sorting out thoughts. I began writing this because I felt tired of what my life has become and just wanted to tell someone because I haven’t had anyone to confide in since they all know me as the person in my lies and none of what I said here. I want to start changing my life, and I hopefully will start that now. I know that I will have to either force myself to start now, or eventually my lies will unravel and that will be my wake-up call.

TL:DR; I’m a lazy, apathetic, slightly overweight, pathological liar who wants to change. I just needed to tell someone.

It was a two person team affair.  It was the girl's (Kyle?) job to gain access to the Ice Truck Killer files and items.  Lewis, the computer whiz he is, set up that auction site for the girl to show Masuka in order to cover their tracks.  Knowing Masuka can't reveal any of this to anyone, they know the girl is in the clue.  Insert Lewis.  Lewis can apparently do anything with a computer.  He probably has already copied large amounts of information from Homicide.  He has also learned about each person in the unit and has mapped out the place.  Lewis knows there is something different about Dexter, but doesn't know what it is past Dexter being a superstar and the one who could ruin the big plan.  It is setting up for something big...which is...

Either Lewis or Lewis and the blonde, intern girl are going to be the major villains of Season 7.  I predict right now that in the final episode of Season 6, Jamie is killed by the pair in an Ice Truck Killer fashion which launches us straight into Season 7.

There is also something else I'm not so sure of.  Remember the first promo we got for Season 6?  It involves someone's fingers running across Dexter's slides and I have always thought it wasn't Dexter's fingers.  Maybe it is just me though.

* Debs is having epiphany after epiphany with her therapist. The more sessions Deb has, the more distant she's becoming with her brother. You can even see in the preview that she finds out Dexter is her safe place. Maybe she will break those bonds to stand on her own feet which lets her look at Dexter objectively rather than subjectively...something Dexter has been depending on for his sister not to find out
* The first interns short stay doesn't seem right. She was obsessed with the ITK and the latest victim had 1 of ITK's MO's...maybe she's helping Travis? Maybe both interns are?

**Edit** - Forgot to mention that I think Quinn and Batista are getting rather close. So close, that they might confide in each other about their suspicions in Dexter. Quinn will tell him about his past findings that will match up with Dexters sporadic schedule that Batista has noticed. Maybe next season... Dexters nemesis will be Quinn and Batista...now there's a twist"

The intern is also the one who severed the hand and wrote the blood on Travis's walls. Since Travis was alone when he found it, his reaction of horror was real to where he knew he didn't do it. Of course, some could say that he loses memory when he is being Gellar, but it seems like Travis wouldn't have had the time to kill him and do all that.

I worked as an intern systems analyst this past summer at an insurance company (AKA I intensely disliked it there). A few weeks after the summer I was notified of a job offer. I was given until November 7th to look around at other places and come up with an offer.

None of the types of companies I was seeking out (small to mid-sized tech companies) were hiring college kids who don't graduate until May. So I evaluated what I needed to finish up and school and found that I only needed one class next semester so I decided to advertise that in my interviews. So as long as they would be flexible I /could/ start working earlier in the Spring. 

Well I hadn't totally thought this through because I blinded by my dislike of huge-corporate-tie-wearing-insurance company. Now I actually found an awesome company (jeans wearing, cool environment, interesting working, good perks, fair pay, etc.) but I could not talk them into moving start-date from January to May (which seems fair and very reasonable of them). Though they will let me leave work early some times to drive the 45 minutes up to school and take this class once a week.

However now that the offer sits in front of me I'm terrified of leaving college before all of my friends do. 

tl;dr College senior got awesome early job offer, but need to start in January.

I need your advice please. I graduated high school with amazing grades at the top of my class, but was never really intrigued by any of the subjects. I find math to be interesting, but I can't say I *enjoy* doing it. I have no idea what to major in. I got myself an internship in Texas with a energy company in the IT field and so far its been working out great, and pays well. But I can't say I have a passion for managing Sharepoint or anything of the like. I took a java class in highschool thinking I would like it because I really enjoy using and messing around on computers but turns out I hated it.  Typing endless lines of code for such a small output seemed to not be my thing. 

I know that I want to be in the Technology field but am not sure what to major in. Engineering? if so what branch? I was considering Information Systems (MIS) but I don't know. I really enjoy playing music and composing so I am considering a minor in music but that is all I have so far. I like martial arts and am a really good communicator, and I like long walks on the beach.

Okay seriously Reddit. I have no idea what to do with my life and it has been constantly irking me and stressing me out. Everyone has told me I should do engineering because I am ""smart and good with math"". But I don't know.

Absolute fucking shit. I'm desperate for people to help me look over it, and if anyone here can give me any sort of advice I'd be really fucking grateful.


Statement of Purpose
	When I was young, my father brought home The Private Life of Plants by David Attenborough. I was captivated. I finished it within a week, and watched it over the greater part of a year. When my father subsequently bought The Blue Planet and The Life of Mammals, I knew that I wanted to be an ecologist. Over the years, these goals have evolved and become more refined, but the general idea remained the same. With this goal in mind, I set out on a journey to improve myself and acquire knowledge in the biological sciences. I remained fascinated by ecology throughout high school, working on projects involving the effects of growth stimulants on tadpoles, and scoring a perfect score on my Biology SAT Subject Test. I volunteered for hundreds of hours in the _________ Zoo, and gained experience with dealing with all sorts of fauna, including deers, boa constrictors, and snapping turtles. I also helped develop a few programs to boost the zoo’s popularity. Near the end of high school, my interests shifted towards biochemistry, and I entered college as a biochemistry major. I was lucky enough to be granted the opportunities to intern in various biochemistry labs. As a high school senior, I worked in Dr. ________'s lab, where I studied protein active sites with the help of some graduate students. I learned to operate many advanced laboratory equipments and learned various techniques for keeping good lab notes. As a freshman, I interned in Dr. _________’s lab, where I studied neuronal morphogenesis using pluripotent embryonic mice cells.  As a sophomore, I worked in Dr. ___________s lab, where I was fortunate enough to participate in a high funding study that studied impaired cognitive states using a 3D virtual-reality environment to simulate driving situations. As I continued through college, however, I realized that I wasn’t particularly happy with what I was doing. Remembering the visceral enjoyment I used to have working with animals, I decided to switch my focus towards ecology and evolutionary biology. I worked in Dr. _________’s lab as a junior, where I studied mutualistic interactions between endophytic fungi and plant hosts, namely those that can cause a high increase in plant fecundity. Currently, I am acting as a lab assisant in Dr. _________’s lab, under the guidance of graduate student ________. The project I am currently assisting with studies biotic controls of ecology and the evolution of plant growth and defense in response to these biotic controls. The project focuses on examining the differences between plant tolerance and plant resistance, using different herbivores as biotic controls to influence selections on plants for growth and defense. The questions that the project seeks to answer include the matter of whether herbivores select plants that tolerate damage or whether tolerance is a product of selection. I aim to conduct my independent research on a similar topic. I plan to use Sapium sebifera, the Chinese Tallow, as a study system. My goal in this project is to introduce herbivores as a biotic control to determine the change in herbivore tolerance and growth rate that occurs in the Chinese Tallow. Scale insects are a group of herbivores that have not been used with Chinese Tallow before. A study like this can be significant, as the Chinese Tallow is a noxious invader, and studying such interactions can allow ecologists to better understand how to fight the Tallow’s spread. I’ve also broadened my knowledge by taking all sorts of classes. The fields that I’ve been exposed to include insect biology, conservation, immunology, evolution, genetics, infectious diseases, and biodiversity. I’ve also expanded my base by taking all sorts of psychology, philosophy, and language classes. With all that I’ve done as an undergraduate, continuing my studies in graduate school is the obvious progression. I plan to acquire my Ph.D. with similar research to what I have experience with. Most likely I will be focused on the evolution of interactions between organisms. My prior experience consists mostly of mutualistic plant interaction with fungi and conflicts between plants and invertebrates, but I am also interested in studying population dynamics and how introduction of invasive species and other novel interactions can change the population structure. I hope to work on study systems that are having strong effects on the ecosystem that they occupy, and to publish data that can be significant in understanding the ecological interactions that they have. All things considered, I feel that _______ university is a good fit for all of my needs. The research of Professor ________ is especially compelling, as it focuses on biological interactions and population dynamics. Dr. _______’s research is a great fit for my interests, and I believe that I can definitely cultivate my knowledge and grow as an individual in his/her lab. I would be extremely pleased to work with Dr. ______, and if I were to be given this opportunity, I would do my utmost best to succeed in my studies. 

edit: Sorry about the strange italics bold font... I can't get it to go away for some reason. Any help would still be greatly appreciated!

I hope I'm in the right place. I've just moved to a new city and have been job searching for something entry level as my resume is quite light. I've stumbled across the occupation of being a Content Writer. It sounds like it wouldn't be a far fetch for me to do at all, and probably a lot of people would think that for themselves, I'd imagine. It seems only to ask for coming up with ideas and doing research for things to create text about for websites, blogs, and social media.

When I look at advertisements for them, they usually don't ask much of candidates like other jobs that usually want a Bachelor's or years of experience. They just say really basic stuff like that you're web savvy, passionate about writing, can come up with content ideas, have experience with social media, have a high school diploma and can work in the USA - things like that. At the same time, they don't explicitly say it's entry level. Only once did a place looking for an intern say that people with a background studying journalism, advertising, or anything communications would be ideal. I only have one example of a site I designed and produced text, video, and photos for, and I'm not an expert at all at web development/design.

So are there any Content Writers and/or Specialists that could clue me in to how difficult this job is? What's a typical day like? What are your responsibilities? Is it entry level? Do only people with lots of experience or degrees really have a shot?

I've never really pursued writing as a career, but I don't find the prospect disagreeable. I don't have a Bachelor's, and when I left off on college, I was pursuing anthropology. I used to be into making blogs and have personally written things for my own enjoyment that span hundreds of pages. I'm usually complimented for the clarity of my writing, and I'm used to doing research and making little reports from college, as well as troubleshooting problems online when trying to do amateur web design. Am I anywhere near being qualified to snag a job like that?"

During my sophomore year in College I was studying for a degree I hated and was talked to by my parents, which was Business-Marketing as opposed to English. Stupidly I complied as a freshmen and by the time I realized it should've been my choice, it was no mans land. Luckily, I took a business law class and fell in love with legal studies. Stupidly though, I took the December LSAT last year to be able to get into Law school the fall after, only to get a low score of 149 due to me trying to balance finals and LSAT studies in a months notice.

So recently, I took a Kaplan class, and I have another LSAT I have registered coming up this weekend. I have done well on my diagnostics until recently I have this horrible gut feeling and did horrendous on my last 2. I don't believe I am ready. I have a ""low"" GPA for law school apps and the a high LSAT score is my primary chance of getting in. That being said, my parents again, are constantly pressuring me to take the exam unaware of the ramifications of taking it more than twice and not improving by a large margin. I would hate to do bad on this exam and be in the situation where the schools deny my acceptance if I do well on the 3rd exam, for the fact that I had to take the exam 3 times with little/no gains on the first 2, assuming I don't do well. Self-fulfilling prophecy make take affect unless I snap out of it.

So that's the story, I have 6 days to study more and take the exam. I don't feel ready for it, and I'm stressing out thinking if I don't do well, I would have just let everyone down and fuck myself over. I want to go to Law School, but a good one, perhaps not a T14, but I would like to be able to do well and become a proper attorney regardless of the hard work it requires. I have my law internship done, and wonderful letters of recommendation along with a strong personal statement ready. Should I keep them in my application, wait until I am absolutely sure I am ready for this exam and can do astronomically well on the diagnostics and MISS the 2012-2013 academic year or should I bite the bullet and try to do well this time, and risk having to take it a 3rd time 6-9 months from now? I just feel at the age of 23, (24 in May) if I don't get in yet, I'm too old to go back to school and would be deemed a failure in my parents and peers minds, which I wouldn't, but that's the mindset acquired thus far.

Thanks in advance.

I figured that since I am one of his constituents, I should probably step up my attempts at political action from ""grumbling under my breath"" to ""writing a wordy letter for an intern to ignore"". I feel like I highlighted a few important points, and thought people might be able to use the info to write letters of their own, convince others to act, or as fodder for their own underbreathed grumblings. So here 'tis:


Senator Leahy, I am not one normally inclined to write such a note, but I feel that the topic is one that is of particular interest to me, and I feel that it is a part of a larger question of personal freedom that we are faced with in the 21st century. The issue I am concerned about is your proposed PROTECT IP Act. The reason that I feel so strongly about this issue is because I feel that the internet is possibly humanity's greatest resource in the foreseeable future, and while we do unquestioningly need to protect intellectual property in the information age, we also need to ensure that we allow the freedoms that inspire the internet's creative and fluid nature to continue enacting positive changes in our lives. 


Specifically, I am worried that PRO-IT, and the similar SOPA will make it too easy for monied interests and corporate actors to squash any online speech that they may not agree with by using your legislation. 
As I've said, I don't think that we can ignore copyright and intellectual property, I just feel that we must err on the side of allowing the free flow of information, especially media, to be legally used in the public realm. I think that the creative commons licensing scheme (http://creativecommons.org/) needs to be a focal point of any discussion that includes intellectual property and copyrights.

I know that your intern has probably stopped reading by this paragraph, but I hope that you will please consider the many online content holders, who I believe are well informed and good intentioned on the issue. The concerns of companies such as Google, Yahoo, Facebook, et al in their letter to you in the New York Times highlights some very important concerns.
(http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/internet-titans-fight-sopa-with-full-page-ny-times-ad/).
Furthermore, it is clear that currently, our enforcement options for offending websites seems to be working, as evidenced in the crackdown that occurred just this week (http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hO3RAzd3zq1nq_ZJWCbMB0CudwkQ?docId=CNG.fd45b16bab5be5f2e8a7f73314307c59.551). Even more frighteningly, we also seem to have the power to accidentally shut down thousands of websites (http://www.dailytech.com/US+Government+Accidentally+Abuses+Internet+Kill+Switch+Shuts+off+84000+Sites/article20934.htm). Instances such as this show that we need to offer protection to ensure that overzealous or erroneous governmental actions do not impose undo hardship on citizens acting in a legal manner.


Thank you for your consideration, I know that I covered a variety of topics, and if I was a bit verbose, it is only because I feel that we must allow the internet to be the positive vehicle for good changes to humanity that it is capable of, to create the beautiful futures that I know we all dream of.

mrk7j,1,2011-11-27,"Law students, I require assistance your assistance deciding if I should take the LSAT this weekend, or cancelling and trying again.  What should I do?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/mrk7j/law_students_i_require_assistance_your_assistance/,"So here's the story.  During my sophomore year in College I was studying for a degree I hated and was talked to by my parents, which was Business-Marketing as opposed to English.  Stupidly I complied as a freshmen and by the time I realized it should've been my choice, it was no mans land.  Luckily, I took a business law class and fell in love with legal studies.   Stupidly though, I took the December LSAT last year to be able to get into Law school the fall after, only to get a low score of 149 due to me trying to balance finals and LSAT studies in a months notice.  

So recently, I took a Kaplan class, and I have another LSAT I have registered coming up this weekend. I have done well on my diagnostics until recently I have this horrible gut feeling and did horrendous on my last 2.  I don't believe I am ready.  I have a ""low"" GPA for law school apps and the a high LSAT score is my primary chance of getting in.  That being said, my parents again, are constantly pressuring me to take the exam unaware of the ramifications of taking it more than twice and not improving by a large margin.   I would hate to do bad on this exam and be in the situation where the schools deny my acceptance if I do well on the 3rd exam, for the fact that I had to take the exam 3 times with little/no gains on the first 2, assuming I don't do well. Self-fulfilling prophecy make take affect unless I snap out of it. 

So that's the story, I have 6 days to study more and take the exam.  I don't feel ready for it, and I'm stressing out thinking if I don't do well, I would have just let everyone down and fuck myself over.  I want to go to Law School, but a good one, perhaps not a T14, but I would like to be able to do well and become a proper attorney regardless of the hard work it requires. I have my law internship done, and wonderful letters of recommendation along with a strong personal statement ready.  Should I keep them in my application, wait until I am absolutely sure I am ready for this exam and can do astronomically well on the diagnostics and MISS the 2012-2013 academic year or should I bite the bullet and try to do well this time, and risk having to take it a 3rd time 6-9 months from now?    I just feel at the age of 23, (24 in May) if I don't get in yet, I'm too old to go back to school and would be deemed a failure in my parents and peers minds, which I wouldn't, but that's the mindset acquired thus far.    

Thanks in advance.  "

I am from Pennsylvania - my permanent home address is there (I'm only 19 so I technically live with my parents). However, I attend college in New York (I'm not really sure if that matters in the situation). This coming summer and fall, I will be working in Mountain View, California as an intern. What I'm trying to figure out is exactly who I will owe taxes to and how much.

Will I have to pay CA income tax as well as PA income tax? That seems like it would be extremely expensive to be paying double taxes. If so, is there any (easy) way to avoid it (legally - for example, changing residency to CA for six months, then back to PA).

mrfuz,2,2011-11-27,Why does he still want to be with me?,[deleted],ihaveissues,https://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/mrfuz/why_does_he_still_want_to_be_with_me/," My boyfriend (24) and I (22) moved in for the first time this past summer after having dated for three years since my sophomore year of college. This is the first serious relationship we've both been in. He and I have never lived out on our own before excluding dorms, so the first time I moved out, I moved out with him, which probably wasn't the best idea.

We've been having a really rough time adjusting, and fighting over a lot of things especially chores. I'm the one who has a lower tolerance for mess, and I would nag him incessantly, always wanting things to be done a certain way. He's really stubborn, and tends to rationalize how his way of (not) doing things is correct. He would complain that I would do all the chores before he got a chance to get to them, and then I would yell at him for not doing them. All of this bred much resentment on both of our parts. Whenever we would have serious arguments, he tended to leave the house when I got too annoying, which would frustrate me even more. I have also done some pretty irrational things when upset (e.g. pouring cat litter on his head), so I know I'm not blameless in all of this.

I also don't feel like we have a lot in common anymore. He enjoys sleeping in until 4 or 5 pm on weekends, whereas I would like to be up and doing something productive, preferably outside, and not in front of a monitor screen. However, he is content to merely play video games or watch GSL. I don't have any friends of my own or a lot of hobbies, so I know I rely on him too much for a social outlet. I would complain about not spending enough quality time together, but I can see how that may be an issue I have to deal with on my own.
Never throughout this time have I wanted to break up despite all the fights, however, he has expressed before that he would be happier being single, and that this isn't what he signed up for. I have a feeling I am just afraid of being alone, or that I am too attached to him because I don't have much of a life outside of the relationship. Flash forward to somewhat recently, we had another fight right before I left to visit a friend from high school on the opposite coast. He wrote me a check reimbursing a rather expensive birthday gift I had purchased him, and didn't come home the night before I left.

While I was at my friend's, I contacted him, and bought him a video game to try and reconcile our past fight. I asked him if there was anything that could be done to fix our relationship, and he said no. This was when I finally mentally checked out and accepted that maybe we weren't right for each other and even though I cared about him, that might not be enough to fix things. I also stupidly got really drunk, and asked his good friend to sleep with me (one I had a bit of a crush on from a year before). I know it was wrong and a huge bitch thing to do, but I thought we were over. My friend did not help because she encouraged me, saying that I didn't owe my boyfriend anything, and he should have no control over what me or his friend choose to do.

I come back from my trip, and my boyfriend does a complete 180. He says he wants to work things out, and that he learned that I mean more to him than he previously thought. (He did get food poisoning and got into a minor car accident, while I was away). He's willing to put more effort in doing things that make me happy (cleaning, spending more time with me). Of course, at this point, I'm still obsessing over his friend. I agree to try and work things out with my boyfriend, but I continue chatting and texting with the friend (including minor flirting), which is really wrong, emotional cheating, etc.

I understand I'm putting his friend on a bit of a pedestal in a grass is greener type scenario. My boyfriend never officially graduated from college (needs two more credits). He was going to take a class over the summer, but he never went and had to drop it, which wasted $2000. I think he can be a bit irresponsible, and honestly, I don't want to be put in a situation where I have to pay for all of our living expenses because he can't get a job due to not having a degree (his paid internship right now is temporary for one year). His friend on the other hand seems more driven (applying to medical school), and even though he was probably as much of a gamer as my boyfriend, he claims to want to do more productive things with his time.
My boyfriend catches me talking to his friend and lying about it (twice), and of course accuses me of leading him on, which I don't dispute. The only problem is he still wants to be with me even after all of this. I even told him what happened when I was away. I've since stopped talking to his friend, but I almost still want to us to breakup because he certainly deserves better than how I've been treating him. Now I don't really know what to do... our lease isn't up for another 6 months or so.

It didn't used to bother me that I've only ever been with one person, but it's definitely starting to now. How can you possibly marry the first person you've ever had sex with? The only person you've ever kissed? I feel like I've settled down way too early. I live in the suburbs with a relatively stable job, but I feel very repressed. I never partied or dated a lot in college, so I never got it out of my system. Even if I were single now, I doubt I would have any success because it's hard for me to meet people, and I'm not the most friendly or social person.

I'm tired of my older coworkers asking me to check in with myself to see whether or not I'm happy, and telling me I'm too young to be putting this much effort into making my relationship work. I'm tired of my boyfriend's parents getting involved and suggesting we go to counseling, giving us relationship self-help books. I don't understand why they're so vested in our relationship in the first place. It's hard for me to separate my unhappiness with my own life verses my dissatisfaction with the relationship. I just don't want to get married, have kids, be stuck in a huge rut, end up getting divorced and generally regretting the way I've lived my life. I also don't know how to stop thinking about the friend, and wondering if things would be better with him because even if I were single, that's not something I could feasibly pursue anyway... My boyfriend is doing everything I've wanted him to do, but now I can't get any of these stupid thoughts out of my head, and it's definitely poisoning my outlook on our relationship.

tldr; Asked my boyfriend's friend to sleep with him. Told my boyfriend, and he still wants to stay together.

Edit: never actually slept with the friend. "

They never really covered this much in my courses on career development. I know in things like Digital Design, it is extremely important since it reflects directly a combination of the creator's technical prowess (to a small degree) and design style (to a larger degree), but since Computer Science is a much more technical field it is unlikely that a website would really showcase much in and of itself.

Of course, I realize that it can act as an online portfolio of projects or code and it can show off that way, but do people really look for these kinds of things or do they just care about job experience? It almost doesn't seem reasonable to expect that a recruiter would take the time to comb the code the of every applicant if they had a lot of things posted. Another part of the problem here is that some of my most technical work has been on internships and I can't post any of the code from that since it is all owned by the company I was working with.

Also, what does a 'good' CS website look like?

I'm currently finishing off my final year in undergrad as a double major advertising and psychology student. 

I run a student agency on campus and have internship experience, but it was on the account side. I've known that I've wanted to be a planner for some years now, but the account internship was the best position for the summer.

 I have been speaking with several planners at the agency where I interned in this past summer. The messages I have received are pretty mixed. Some of the senior planners say I have no shot without going to Miami's bootcamp or VCU. Others say that as long as I can present my undergrad experiences well, I can easily find at least an internship. 

I'm eager to get started on an initial book with my experiences running a student agency for local business and my psychology research to show for interviews. I know not to overwhelm people with research, and getting to the insight of everything is key. Beyond this,  can anyone share with me any sort of format or vital information that would be included from a book of someone coming out of Miami Ad school's bootcamp or VCU? ....or any advice someone may have for me in general.

My eventual career goal is working on medical devices such as artificial organs and implanted devices that could effectively cure chronic diseases such as diabetes, MS, etc. I am also interested in movement mechanics so smart prosthetics may be an option as well. One key piece of background information: I already have a BS in Exercise Science from a smallish state university you have probably never heard of, and I am currently attending community college to get some science &amp; math prerequisites done while getting my brain back into student mode after being out for 5 years. Thanks to all who can spare a few minutes to help me reverse-engineer my education.

1) Which sub-area of Biomedical Engineering should I study to reach the above mentioned goals &amp; are all three of those interests under different areas? 

2) In the biomedical engineering field does it matter to future employers or grad schools where I got my undergraduate in engineering? i.e.: Georgia Tech, Stanford, MIT or forget about it, or can I go to a state school near where I currently live, get good grades etc, &amp; be a competitive candidate for future jobs?

3) I am thinking a major in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Bio/Biomedical Engineering &amp; extra classes in Electrical Engineering, CS, etc. &amp; graduate studies in BME. Is this a prudent choice or should I go straight into BME undergrad, or perhaps EE or is there another major I should consider? How necessary is a graduate degree depending on my undergrad major?

4) How well do the school rankings provided by US News &amp; World Report match the rankings in the minds of those in the BME field doing the hiring? 

5) Can anyone recommend good schools that are second BS degree seeker friendly. (I.e.: certain highly ranked schools in engineering do not award second bachelor’s degrees, &amp; If I were to lie about my previous college experience &amp; I were found out, I would be expelled. Still others will award them, but NONE of my previous college credits count)

6) Co-op programs. (Where you switch between semesters of classes &amp; semesters of paid internships in the industry). Do they make for better prepared, more desirable applicants, or are they a waste of time?  Does it depend on the school, company you intern with, individual, etc?

That's all the questions I can think of for now."

My main struggle right now is what to do after this year.  I do not think I would bother with an MFA in Lighting Design.

I'm sure it'd be a nice luxury to have more CAD classes and the like, but for my experience level I feel like I might as well apply for internships.

Stage management on the other hand, I have very little experience in and am more curious about pursuing an MFA.  But I always wonder what a MFA is really worth?  It's a lot of money for experience you could theoretially be getting through internships.  And my professors seem to be very encouraging and telling me that I pick things up really quickly and that an MFA might not be worth the debt.

Thoughts from professionals?  Thoughts from people making their way in the field?  Regrets from getting one with a baggage of debt?  Regrets from wishing you went and got one when you didn't?

My best friend has decided that she will not do anything with me one on one. She won't give any explanation. She doesn't seem to want to understand how much this is hurting me. Just a few months ago, she swore up and down that she would never abandon me in any way (something that has happened a lot to me in the past). She doesn't accept that when I start my internship in two weeks, I won't have time to coordinate meeting up with her and someone else during my downtime. She won't accept that I don't even have many other friends to hangout with. She won't accept the *fact* that sporadic text based communication is not, under any circumstances, a way to sustain a friendship long term. She won't accept the *fact* that what she is doing without any explanation is exceptionally painful to me. She won't accept the *fact* that as painful this is, it is equally infuriating. She won't accept the *fact* that I cannot hold on much longer because of how painful and confusing this is. Yet, in spite of all that, she still thinks we can be the close friends we once we're if this continues.

In terms of backstory, she and I both have been suffering from severe clinical depression for years. I'm a 19 y.o. male, she is the same age. I suspect her passive aggressively jealous boyfriend (who she has know for less than half as long as we have known each other) has something to do with this, but she won't give an answer to that either. Now, the thing you need to understand about me is that my friends are my family, as my real family can't seem to understand what I'm going through. I love my friends, and would fight to the death for them. I would fight just as hard for the friendship itself. I don't have any idea what is going on, but I do know that what she is doing is making everything worse for me in terms of depression management. I can't afford to lose another friend. Not again. What do? And if you need clarification, just ask. "
mtixa,0,2011-11-29,Depressed - Is My Life Fucked?,[deleted],MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/mtixa/depressed_is_my_life_fucked/,"Hey there Reddit, not sure if I am posting in the right place, but might as well give it a shot. This is my very first post.

I understand that life is not easy, and that we all have a ton of problems to deal with. However, its as if my problems have compounded substantially over the past two or so years, and now I am feeling hopeless, depressed and unsatisfied with everything I have worked for.

*1* I'm a senior in college, and on May 20, 2012 I will graduate. What is supposed to be the day of my greatest academic accomplishment feels more like the impending day of reckoning. Academically:

- I'm 28k in debt (and growing), graduating with a degree in Political Science in May.

- Realized I hated my major and program last semester, but am finishing with my degree since I only have two courses left.

- I've worked part-time since I was 14, and pay for all my own expenses in college (except phone and car insurance). I was working 35 hr/week last semester with a 17 cred. course load.

- I've been very successful outside of the classroom (elected to Student Govt., appointed to city rent control board, did undergrad. research, and had spectacular federal internship.) 

- My major GPA is around a 3.4, but my cumulative GPA is right under a 3.0.

*2* Nonetheless, I am completely hopeless, sad and unmotivated to get out of bed most days. I feel intense anxiety, sadness, anger, disillusionment and contempt about the world around me, and have even sought psychological help:

- Diagnosed with inattentive AD/HD three times, including last semester, for which I began taking Dextroamphetamine Sulfate (Dexedrine). I stopped after three months because I became a zombie and developed social anxiety.

- Diagnosed with depression four times, once in each level of schooling: elementary (8yrs), middle (13yrs), high (17yrs), and college (20 yrs). 

- Recently quit attending therapy for general anxiety because I couldn't afford the visits after my insurance refused to cover the costs.

- I also identify as gay, which has had its additional issues. I'm out to most of my family and friends, but because I come from split parents, I still haven't told my Dad's side. Although, I am happily in a relationship that just surpassed the 1.5yr mark (woot!).

- I recently have developed a bit of an anger issue, though its more like I get enraged over the fact that I have so many self-perceived problems.

*3* My parents are another issue. I am extremely grateful for my mom, who has been my primary caregiver my entire life. I'm 21 years old now, and times have changed, and now I am attempting to become independent as much as possible. However, my Mom and I are not without issues, as she suffers from some serious issues herself:

- Blamed me for her financial problems and marriage issues this past week, even though I am never home.

- Attributed it to the fact that I am without a job for the first time ever. I was offered a seasonal job at UPS for 8.50 an hour, but turned it down because the shifts were from 10pm- 3:30am Sun-Thurs. 

- My mom and stepdad called me a loser and lazy because I turned down the job, but it would have seriously hindered my schooling (9am classes) plus term papers and finals season coming up.

TL;DR Help me Reddit, I have always worked hard, pushed myself academically, and exceeded people's expectations in my academic life and professional life. I am considering staying in school, but the money is not there. My parents are irrational and scapegoating because they are having financial problems due to their frivolous spending. I am hopeless, and just have nowhere to turn. I can answer any questions, because its too difficult to elaborate in one post.

What would you do? ,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/mthmq/reddit_i_need_some_advice_i_have_the_opportunity/,"I am a recent college graduate and am finishing up a long paid internship at one of the largest companies in my field. I recently applied for a job working for a very small company in a very small Caribbean island nation just for fun, and it looks like I will get it. The problem is that not only will I make less money than I am now as an intern but the cost of living will also increase. 
I was all for taking the pay cut to live and work in paradise until my father said, “That’s insulting to you. You didn’t worked so hard, do so much and graduated with honors just to make minimum wage.”

I can’t decide if this life experience would be worth the lost revenue and likely stalling of my career. But hell, with the way things are right now this is a good problem to have.

mth5l,0,2011-11-29,How should the last 2 seasons play out?  Describe your perfect ending to the series.,Trax123,Dexter,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dexter/comments/mth5l/how_should_the_last_2_seasons_play_out_describe/,"Anyone who watches Dexter can agree that the show has fallen off a cliff since Season 4.  What could the writers do over the next 2 seasons to redeem your faith in the show?

In between intermittently dozing off during Sunday's episode, I cooked up a plotline that I think could be fun to watch play out.

Louis isn't a serial killer, he's an FBI agent that's working undercover with Miami Metro Homicide.  The feds have had a file on Dexter ever since Rita's death and they now suspect him of being the actual Bay Harbor Butcher.  His relationship with Batista's sister and his work in the internship program are designed to get as close to Dexter as he can.  This is revealed at the end of this season.

Season 7 would be ""Dexter on the lam"".  He'd be on the run from the feds, giving the show the chance to get out of Florida and away from the characters we all hate in Miami Metro.  Deb would take a leave of absence from work and would be tracking Dexter separate from the FBI.  At the end of season 7 she catches up with him, and given the opportunity to kill him or turn him in, she delivers him to the FBI.

Season 8 would be Dexter on trial as a serial killer.  He'd spend the bulk of the season in prison or in a courtroom.  At the end of the series, Deb has a change of heart and decides to help him break out of custody and he flees the country.

I think this would be the most satisfying way to end the series.  Lots of drama, a chance to break out of the standard formula that has run dry, and a chance to get rid of the characters most people could give a shit about anymore."

I've always stumbled when it comes to interviews and am trying my best to prepare myself well for this one.

I went to school for Network Administration and have had a couple of internships that very closely followed my degree. However once school was complete I took a PC support position as there are not many people willing to hire a network admin right from college. I'm happy with my current job and intended on staying here a few years well working on my master. However a couple of weeks ago I received a email out of the blue from a former boss stating that they have a Senior Network Administrator position available and he really thinks I should apply. Now even though I'm happy with my current job I can't just ignore a opportunity like this.

I've unfortunately been doing PC support for a year and a half now. I'm not saying I've forgotten everything I've learned but I know I'm rusty. I know they are a strictly CISCO shop, mostly windows servers, they run VMWare, and client base is about 50% mac 50% PC.

My reply:

How is asking for the 1% to pay their fair share Socialist? We are demanding that big company influence stays out of government. We are demanding a much fairer society where people who have less money have the same opporty as the rich to send their kids to good school and have healthcare. 

We are tired of Wall Street controlling our world.  It's time for Americans to fight back and demand that government to stop bailing out the banks. We demand a tax system that fairly taxes the rich and end all loopholes. 

We the street people are demanding a better way of life. Wall Street got us into this mess. It's time for Wall Street to clean it up it's own mess and not the common citizen. 

A lot of Americans don't want to become the 1% percent. Majority of Americans want stability. Our current system does not provide stability of people. Our current system does not provide stability. It only provides destruction because Capitalism has a requirement to destabilize. 

Is this what you think every American should believe? 
""I got kicked in the teeth untill I liked it and I'm very angry that the same might not happen to you. I am the 53%""

Sorry, we are tired of us being kicked in the teeth every day and demanding us that we must suffer this fate until we die.

""Nobody living can ever stop me, 
As I go walking that freedom highway; 
Nobody living can ever make me turn back 
This land was made for you and me.""

mt485,14,2011-11-29,Recently moved to new city. coming to terms that I can't function socially or in school. advice?,throwaway_83219,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/mt485/recently_moved_to_new_city_coming_to_terms_that_i/,"**Warning: Long post, TL;DR at end**

**Background:** Male college student, early 20s. I've been dealing with anxiety/depression to varying extents for years. Dealt with some bullying back in high school, including by my own brother which my mom refused to do anything about (he's a lot better now). It was never any 'worse' than emotional/verbal abuse, but there were situations that I had no option to get away from him (ie driving to and from school).

I'm also gay, and felt horrified about coming out and such (even to people who would end up accepting me). Eventually I did it after I started college, and my family/others were ok with it. I would have never done this in high school because of possible retaliation from family, and being ""gay kid"" in HS.

I haven't felt that passionate or motivated for years (maybe when I was in middle school). I'm a CS major and have managed to slide by, but don't really have the drive to do awesome stuff outside of class that some of my peers do.

**Current situation:** Recently moved to a new area (fairly big city) and lived with family (wanted to take a break from previous school). Eventually I started school here and got a place on my own, which is paid for with college funds. I guess part of this whole thing was thinking I could run away from my problems…in theory it might help being that i'm now in a far more tolerant/diverse place.

I have very few friends here. Mostly it's because i don't feel like i can be myself around people that I meet. There's a couple of people that i get along with really well, but I met them online and don't hang out with them incredibly often (one moved away recently). 

I don't really think i'm that interesting or cool compared with everyone else in the city. Some of my old friends might think i'm a really interesting/smart person, but i derp out when meeting new people here. I haven't dated that many people, and tend to go out with people i'm not highly attracted to because i feel that i'm not good enough for anyone else.

Yes, i've gotten involved with student organizations and stuff, and months later I'm still paralyzed with fear whenever i'm around them. Some of them seem like great people (some others a bit less so), but they still really don't know me at all…i'm a complete weirdo around them. I held an unpaid internship in the city before starting school, and faced the exact same situation there. Made absolutely no connections there, and in the future it might end up having done more harm than good. Where I used to live I could go up to people and chat with them fairly easily (although i had few close friends), but can't really do that here.

I managed to get through the last semester okay, but I think i'm going to fail some of my classes this semester. It's not that i'm not intellectually capable of doing the work. But I constantly worry about my ability to complete it until I get started at the last minute and do a half-ass job, then later realize I could have done it easily.

**Long-term worries**: I continually question my ability to sustain gainful employment and sustain myself (unless I can find some sort of business venture to get into on my own or something). In theory i should be able to do well, but once again can't be myself at job interviews and end up settling for bottom-of-the-barrel jobs. The area I live in is a fairly big city, and for whatever reason I always think a person like me doesn't deserve to live here.

**Therapy?**: I've seen a couple of counselors/therapists in previous years. Didn't really get much out of it, and I don't know if i was actually diagnosed with anything. One of them recommended an SSRI eventually, so I went to a doctor and got a script for Zoloft. It worked a little (albeit with side effects) but eventually went off of it when the doctor shut down and I never bothered to go back. I tried to go to the student medical center once to get a prescription for antidepressants again, but they basically just blew me off. (Now I understand it's best to just see a real doctor or psych if possible.)

I know that I need help…I have insurance but don't know how to go about finding where to go. Should I go to a psychologist or psychiatrist first? What would I expect from a psychiatrist…is it basically just discussing symptoms and being given a prescription?

**TL;DR** Have dealt with (anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, lack of assertiveness, …) to varying extents for years. Recently moved to new city. I can't be myself around people, have very few friends, difficulty with dating, etc. Also having problems succeeding in school (likely in part because of social issues). Advice?

And thanks for reading."

We dated for almost 2 years and were living together when we broke up (I'm 24, she's 21).

About 9 months into the relationship, I ended up getting an internship at a company that was in a city 4000km (2600mi) away from our city. We weren't living together at the time. I was in love with her, so naturally I did what any other person would do; I invited her to come with me and live with me there for the 4 months that I was required to stay there. She didn't have a job at the time, so she came along. Everything was going ok, and I say ""ok"" because she has some depression and anxiety issues which made it somewhat difficult to live with her, but I'm a strong person so I made it through. About 3 months into my internship, she ended up asking me what was going to happen when we moved back home. Were we going to live together? Or would she move back home with her parents? In my head, I wasn't really ready to actually ""move in"" with her, even though we were living together during my internship. I told her I didn't know yet and she told me that she didn't want to move back in with her parents because she didn't really get along with them. She ended up guilt tripping me a little bit, and I didn't really want to be a jerk so I said we could move in together.

Moving forward about 8 months or so, we got a letter from our landlords saying they didn't want us to live in their suite anymore (long story). That same day, me and my ex sat down to talk about what we were going to do. I thought I should be honest, and told her the truth. I told her that I wanted to live on my own and that she should move back home because she had no job and couldn't afford rent. At that point in time, she had lost her job about a month ago and was looking for a new one. She also was planning on going to a local college to take a couple classes. She had no savings and couldn't afford rent (I had to pay rent for the both of us that month) so in my mind it didn't make sense to continue living together (no job, was going to school). I also told her that I felt like she guilt tripped me 8 months ago when we decided to live together.

When I told her this, she was shocked and moved out within days. I told her I still wanted to date her, but she said ""no, I feel like the relationship is going backwards, and it makes no sense to date if we aren't living together"". I pleaded with her several times but she didn't change her mind. About a week after we broke up, she slept with some guy she was hanging out with. After she slept with him, she came to me and said she wanted to get back together, to which I said ""no, you just slept with some guy ONE week after we broke up"".

She still says that I broke her heart by saying I wanted to live on my own. She says she will never forgive me and continues to guilt trip me. Am I really that terrible of a person for wanting to live on my own? I don't think I am, but she seems to convince me otherwise. I never meant any harm, and I still care about her, I just wasn't ready to live with another person yet. Yes, I made a mistake by saying we could live together when I wasn't ready, but it's not like I cheated on her or broke up with her.

**TL;DR** I moved in with my girlfriend because she guilt tripped me, we got kicked out of our place, I told her I wanted to go back to living on my own and now apparently I'm a terrible person."

I'm not sure if a lot of other people have come to this conclusion too...I'm too afraid to read all of the posts and ruin something for me.

But Travis didn't kill the Atheist Professor...the intern guy, Louis killed him. Look at the fact that the professor had his hand severed, his blood was drained, much like the Ice Truck Killer. He could totally pull it off to, he works on the inside, much like Dexter, and knew [or could have figured out, since he seems to be quite smart] how the next kill was supposed to look like. The trap to trip the buckets to flip over was also highly technical trigger. Travis would never be able to pull that off...or it would be out place ""background"". Louis even suggested that he has some weird interests, and he even has the hand of the Ice Truck Killer. I think he's trying to emulate him and Jamie is his ""Deb"". He's bad news for sure. Kinda like a foil for Dexter, an unsuspecting lab geek, but he's using his internal knowledge for whatever his alterior motive is. 

Also, maybe LaGuerta is gonna betray the department, or manipulate things to get to the top, you saw how she's trying to hide that murder scene...could she still have ill feelings about Doakes? 

ANOTHER literary thing....Dexter is obsessed...or was obsessed with getting rid of Travis's Dark Passenger....he finds absolution through other's freedom from their Dark Passenger, much like how he did it for Lumen. "

Masuka gave the speech to his intern about always following your dick right after the therapist told Debra to choose a better partner for her life. Masuka was at the strip with Quinn and was telling him to calm down and even though he was in a strip club he still was very respectful. I think Someone like Masuka is exactly what Debra needs right now.

I feel a bit silly turning to Reddit for help for what I think is an extremely silly problem, but I have nowhere else to turn. 

OK, first, my girlfriend is from Europe and I met her studying abroad about a year and a half ago. We've been doing pretty well doing a long distance thing and have seen each other every few months or so. 

So she's in New York for an internship and I am in NC living with my parents (I graduated and am still looking for a job). So I've interviewed in NYC and seen her and she was recently here for Thanksgiving. She wanted to spend Christmas with me and had assumed that she could be with my parents and my brothers here. 

My parents don't mind her but they are hesitant to have her over for Christmas. My dad likes Xmas as a really private thing for our close family and since he doesn't really know her that well and he would like to be reunited with his sons (my other brothers don't live in state). 

She is staying with a family that she has known for awhile and she is super offended that my parents don't want her over. So she thinks that my parents hate her (which I don't think is true) and she has taken it very personally and now wants me to leave my family and see her in NYC. I don't get what everyone's deal is (why do my parents insist on not having her over &amp; why does she make this some sort of ultimatum on our relationship?). 

As for me, I don't really have any personal cash to go and visit her. My parents wouldn't mind if I went to see her for New Years but she insists that she needs me ON Christmas Day because she will be away from her real family and will be lonely. 

So Reddit, what should I do? How do I save my relationship but also not hurt my parents?

TL;DR: My parents don't want my foreign girlfriend over for Christmas and my gf wants me to ditch my family for her. 

EDIT: Thanks for the responses everyone, I greatly appreciate it. Now I'm going to try and work it so maybe she can stay with my grandparents who live like an hour away and try to divide my time. I don't know. I'll keep you all posted. "
msx3a,1,2011-11-28,"Not sure if I'm in the correct spot, but here goes.",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/msx3a/not_sure_if_im_in_the_correct_spot_but_here_goes/,"Hey all. Like I said, I am not sure if I'm in the correct spot, but I guess I need to talk. I debated about posting this on an alternate, or really at all, but fuck it.


I am a 21 female engineering student. I was a self injurer for an extended period of time in middle and high school (roughly 4 years). For the most part since the middle of my junior year in high school and on I have been happy--with no desire to self harm, attempt suicide, nor would I classify myself as depressed. Recently, however, this has changed and I am having a difficult time. For example, I have not left the house since saturday afternoon and have literally stayed in bed since then. I have ignored phone calls and I have no desire to talk or see anyone. These feelings have been growing in magnitude for a while. Mostly that I just don't want to be around anyone or deal with anyone. I resent people for not helping me even though I am not asking for it because I feel like no one can offer a solution. I realize how that sounds, but I feel like a burden when I talk to people.


As to what is going on with my life, I just have been feeling increasing inadequate and isolated. A little over a year ago, I took a final exam and failed it due to stressing on it (which I have never had test stress in my life). Since then I have been in a fucked up place in terms of school. I know why I freaked out, it was because I literally had not taken a break (no vacations, no semesters off--every summer) for 3 years. I got a 1.6 GPA last fall (due to the material getting harder and me not putting in work because I was tired due to summer) having never made below a 3.0 in my life. I never had to work in high school. Academics were straightforward to me and I actually gained confidence and dealt with a lot of problems in my life due to my realization that I was pretty damn smart. This is very strongly the reason that I stopped self harming. It gave me some confidence, made me tough and a bit arrogant but I realized that I had something that earned me respect.


Maybe you can see where this is going, I lost my confidence. I judge so much of my self worth based on my intelligence and ambitions (which is academic performance while I'm college). I feel like shit. I am tired of failing--clearly I don't deal with it well. I know engineering is supposed to be tough but I'm exhausted, yet I can't take a break. I survived spring of last year with a 2.8 GPA and took summer off (which was a mistake because apparently I need to have been doing research or internships etc.). I thought I was ready for this semester but I just don't know if I care anymore. I can't get an internship despite trying, I am exhausted and uninterested in going to class (so I have missed homeworks and quizzes, etc. which is entirely my fault but I just can't seem to care about them until I am berating myself for it later) yet still interested in the material. I don't know what I want to do in the long term. I will apparently be failing classes again (D as well as F is failing for us) which delays my graduation which makes me feel like a failure. My final exams are right around the corner and I have no motivation. I fucked away all my time when I feel like I could have done things better. Yet I waste my time on things that don't really give me pleasure, but just an excuse to check out (internet, drinking, etc.)


Additionally, my personal life isn't together which is generally normal, but exasperated now. I don't feel like I have many close friends. I always feel awkward around people and like no one gives a shit. I am the heaviest I have ever been in my life. Dating feels exhausting. Every thing feels out of control and also feels like so much effort to even fix one aspect of it. I don't feel like I have put in the effort that I needed to be what I wanted to be so why fucking bother? I can't take back a semester. I have self injured once this semester which I hadn't done since high school. I have felt suicidal lately again. This year has been either feeling horrible or feeling baseline.


Logically I know what I should be doing. Go to class, go study more, work out, manage time better, make efforts to see people irl but I just 
don't/can't/won't and then I hate myself for it. I have done the school counseling here once and I found it difficult to keep the appointments. Ironically, they sent an email out today saying to watch out for the mental health of our fellow students because finals are coming. Any words of advice? I apologize again if I am in the wrong place. Sorry for the length."

msuea,0,2011-11-28,Tired of Being Alone (long but would really appreciate the read),[deleted],ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/msuea/tired_of_being_alone_long_but_would_really/,"I'm a 23 y/o guy. I've had 4 girlfriends, and consequently only slept with those 4 girls. As strange as it is, part of me is proud of that fact. All of my girlfriends were very special people to me, and to some extent, I have a hard time letting go of them all for different reasons. They have all left their mark, for better or worse. There are certain patterns that I have noticed over the past few years that seems to all play a part in my current situation.

One of the bigger issues is that all 4 of the girls that I have dated were dating someone else (usually a close friend of mine) before I took her from them. This is a terrible thing to do, and I've done it with all 4 of my relationships so far. This always leads to the inevitable mistrust because I know that if they left someone for me, they will eventually leave me for someone. Instead of just accepting that and keeping it light with them, I attach myself to them and smother them. It's a trend, and a very unhealthy one at that. I try to do everything for them, and try to be with them at all times because I'm afraid that it's only a matter of time before they meet someone else that is more appealing and leave just like they did to end up with me. For some reason though, I take it very personally when they do find someone else. It kills me to feel like I'm not good enough, and it ruins my self esteem for a long time after they leave. I feel like I'm always having to start my life over. I usually change careers, and go through stages of depression and huge issues with self identity.
I really don't actively try to take girls from other guys, especially not my friends. The problem is a combination of desperately wanting to be with someone, and not knowing how to meet new girls and really talk to them and get to know them without the pressure and nerves that come with it. I find there's less of a guard up when they are in a relationship, and I can be myself more. I don't try to make myself seem more attractive or appealing, but eventually it happens, and I know very early on because of how we are able to get along or not. For some reason, once that happens and i would gain a solid connection with the girl, I was able to justify it all to myself by telling myself that we are all still young and these things happen and we have a better connection anyway. As I said before though, this then leads to constant anxiety around my fear of being left and not being good enough to keep them even though I know it's an inevitability that they will find someone more attractive that doesnt smother them and has the self confidence to let them do their own thing and has a more functional foundation for a relationship.

This all being said, I have taken the past year since my last relationship where I did the same thing, and I have really worked on myself. I have come to these realizations and also decided to not go down that path ever again.
Now I'm left in a terrible hole though. I have zero self confidence, and I have no idea how to meet anybody new. The thought of just going out and having random one night stands is appealing because I've never been able to do it, and I feel like it would help me gain self confidence and ""swagger"". But truth be told, the thought from both sides makes my stomach turn. I can't help but find slutty girls unattractive. It disgusts me to think of myself as another random guy in the miles of dick that have been in her. And it goes the other way too, I have no desire to put my dick in everything I see.
All my girlfriends were very beautiful, and as I said, very special in some way. I guess you could say I have high standards, but both sides  would agree that while the looks play a factor, the connection between us is what made any of them worth it for either side.

That was all just back story to get to my current situation. After the rise and fall of my most recent relationship over a year ago, I did take a good hard look at myself. I realized that this is the wrong way to approach relationships and that I could never find a girl that I could trust with this approach, and ultimately, every one of them cheated on me before it was over. I also realized that I needed to make myself attractive, or at least make myself feel attractive to even have a fighting chance. 

I grew up around bands and live music. There are pictures of me on mixing consoles before I could walk, playing with effects on my own voice. In highschool, I owned a sound company that would tour around the region with local bands. The summers were spent on tour with national acts. The summer gigs were never paying gigs, just a chance to get on a tour bus and see the country and get some experience. I went to college to do this for a living, and have a degree in Audio Engineering and Concert Production. I graduated at the top of my class and had a job at the regions largest touring company right out of school. I worked there until the economy collapsed and they had to let me go because I was the low man on the totum pole. Since then, I have started and owned 5 companies, 3 of which were profitable at one point or another. My most recent was a film/photography company based in New England. It was very successful, and I ended up submitting a patent for a piece of camera equipment I invented/improved. When the economy fell apart though, I worked in local theaters and eventually closed the film company due to some greedy business partners. These are all moments and accomplishments that I have learned a lot from and hold a lot of pride in, but that pride never translates to self-confidence. 

A little over a year ago, I changed careers again, and now work in IT. I started at the very ground level, in a job training program for convicts. I then gained an internship from there, and began working at the company that I am still currently at, while tutoring at the job training program. I'm now a contractor at a great company, and just looking for my fulltime break in this new industry. This is my new identity and where I find myself in the present day. 
When I started this new job, I had been unemployed for almost 2 years, with the exception of the work my companies could generate. I had a girlfriend, but because of my trust issues, and the way it all started, it didnt work out. 
I have since tried to turn myself around and embrace this new career and life. I have worked myself into pretty good shape. When I started my IT job, I was 150 lbs. I am now 180 with 10% body fat. I work out at least 5 times a week, and I volunteer and coach 2 youth hockey teams in my town. I have taken on a lot of charity and volunteer work, as well as changed my work schedule to accommodate my sick grandmother. Once again, I have a lot of pride in myself as a person and the work I do, just no self confidence. I can't help but realize that no girl finds me attractive no matter how hard I work at it. I even find myself fairly attractive, but I've noticed that girls don't find me attractive. My friends are approached whenever we go out, and get hit on constantly, or get the girlfriend, but I'm just left alone. 

It's starting to make me very bitter. I can't stand the sight of couples, or the cheesy terrible pickup lines that seem to work for everybody but me. 
I have realized, the only difference between 'romantic' and 'creepy' is looks. If a good looking guy brings a girl flowers to wish her luck for something, it's romantic. When I do it, it's just the creepy friend.
It sucks though, because a part of me really likes doing nice things for people I care about, but I get friendzoned by anybody I have a crush on because I don't have the self-confidence to make a move, and then it just comes across as creepy and desperate instead of a genuine gesture from somebody that cares about someone else. 
Now I have one girl that I have had a crush on for a long time. We've been close for over 6 years now, but have always done our own things. The only times she's ever expressed interest in me, I was away at college, and already had a girlfriend. Since then, she has been in and out of failed relationships and so have I. She is an amazing person though, and really does deserve somebody who can appreciate it. She also has taken a lot of time to figure herself out. She opened her own dance studio recently, which I find amazingly hot being an aspiring entrepreneur. It seems like it could be the perfect situation for both of us, if I could figure out how to get close without seeming creepy. My problem is, the only way I know how to get to know somebody and get comfortable with them is when they have a boyfriend and the pressure is already off. She is at the point where she can't handle anything serious because of her new business, and I would love to start slow like that to see if I can get myself comfortable without the insecurities and trust issues that seem to come with my relationships. But I have been friend-zoned so hard for so long that it's almost impossible at this point. It's frustrating, mostly because I really haven't felt this way in a long time. I brought her flowers to her first recital for her new studio. Not because I expected anything from it, but because I wanted to show my support to someone I care about on a day for them. It was a huge step for her and her new company, and I wanted to be there for her. I couldn't stay because I had to go coach one of my teams, so I just stopped by, gave her the flowers, and wished her luck. I haven't heard a word since. So this leads me to believe that it came off waaaay creepier than I had intended, or that she indeed does have a boyfriend, and I am just getting caught in the same cycle again. Either way, I did a lot of this transformation over the past year with her in mind. I kept the smallest hope that if I got in shape, really worked on myself, and did enough things that I was proud of, that it would translate into some form of attractiveness, but I guess I was wrong.

I'm the life of the party no matter where I go.  I'm always the nice guy who talks with everyone.  I'm the type of guy that no matter what question you ask, as long as it doesn't involve me, I will give an honest answer.  My mother(60) is sick and constantly in bed.  My sister is young and always off with her friends.  My father(in his 70's) is a work-a-holic who has basically worked for the same company since he was 14 and was never there for me when I needed him most. We moved a total of 19 times because of his job while I was growing up.  This year when I turned 22, I had my first birthday outing with friends. I study mathematics at my university, and have worked with two different professors on two separate projects.  One of which we made a huge scientific discovery that should help scientist in understanding HIV.  I always go to class rain or shine.  I never take notes, but I listen to what the teachers say and remember it.  I can replay in my head every lecture that I have attended that dealt with math or science.  My classmates always ask me for help with their studies, and I always put a smile on and say I'd be more than glad to help them.  I intern at a company that most people would kill to be at.  This company has asked me to come on full time after I graduate and move over 2,500 miles away to be at their head office.  I was a resident assistant at my university for two years.  My residents and their friends loved me because I wasn't a jerk off like most of my co-workers. I let them get away with things because it's college and people should have fun. My bosses never liked me because I was the one that spoke out for the residents.  In January of this year a resident of mine died while I was not on duty, but I was there to help out as much as I could.  The school kept it under wraps because it happend during a big snow storm, and they didn't want the media to get involved.  They didn't tell anyone who lived in the same community, and they didn't provide any support for the residents who knew what had happened.  They wanted everyone to keep quiet and threatened my job when I tried to speak out.  I've had a few girlfriends over the time of my life.  One I thought I was going to marry.  We dated for a year and a half.  I finally worked up the courage to tell her that I loved her earlier this year.  Less than two days later she dumped me.  She told me that she had been cheating with another female who we were close friends with.  I've been seeing this new girl.  She studies microbiology, but refuses to believe in any sort of evolution and this bothers me.  What bothers me even more is that every since I hit puberty I have had a liking for other males.  I live in the south east where the bible is still the rule of law, so no one knows this about me.  No one.  No one could probably even tell.  I'm to afraid to come out because I will lose friends.  My father once told me that we should move the Australians off of their island and put all the gays there and when they get comfortable nuke them.  My family would disown me, my friends would leave me, and I would be all alone.  I know I need to tell this girl that things aren't working out between us, but I cannot bare to see anyone upset.  I know my best friend would be there for me know matter what, because he is a friend for life. More than a friend he is a brother from another mother.  I cannot convey these emotions no matter how hard I try, no one even knows the story of my life.  Only the professors I worked with know what I have done(Not even my family, and not a word to my friends).  None of the residents understand how hard I worked for them to have a good time in college.  My close friends don't know that I am a closet homosexual.  No one knows the torment that I had growing up being constantly ridiculed by my father who told me I would go no where in life.  My family and friends do not even know that when I graduate I will pick all of my things up and move to the other side of the country for work.  No one knows, no one knows anything about me.  I wear a mask everyday to protect myself from people.  No one knows that on most nights I cry myself to sleep because I am living a lie.   I cannot go see someone to talk about these things, because no matter what happens I'll lie to them and tell them that I am okay.  They will believe me too, because for whatever reason people always do.  My mother tells me I have a way with words and when I speak to people time stops for them.  She says it's like magic coming out of my mouth, and that people get lost in my blue eyes and can't help but to believe every word that I say.  She has told me this since I was very young and still believes to this day that it is true.  But even this person who pushed me out of their womb, will believe every word that I say.  Even when their gut tells them otherwise.  So, instead of telling someone in the real world what has happened to me and who I am,  I tell the internet.  I tell you because none of you know who I am, and even after you read this you will forget about me.  That's what I want though.  I don't want anyone to know who I truly am because I am a liar.  I am no one, but I like it that away.  I want people to continue to see my smile, and feel my warmth when they talk to me.  Because this is the only thing in life that brings me happiness.  I apologize if this is hard to read because of the grammer but it's hard to write when you are crying.  My crying is not from sadness or being upset, it's a happy cry for finally telling my story.  I'm glad to get that off my chest.  (&gt;^ _ ^ )&lt;  Happy redditing.  "

Throughout my 5 years at the university I went from film media studies to history to civil engineering (so I can stay enrolled in engineering classes) and then finally admitted to Computer engineering in my third and half year.

Computer engineering admitted 700 students freshmen year, and only 15-25 of us graduated (when I walked at least).

I became hugely involved with campus organizations and was even elected as a student representative at attend a high end faculty meeting.

I was able to intern at a fortune 500 company and am currently still employed.

I did mostly grunt level stuff like making agar dishes or spreading cultures.  When you spread cultures part of the procedure is to sterilize the tool you use between spreads.  One does this by dipping the metal piece in ethanol and burning it off with a bunsen burner a few times.  

It was a friday afternoon and I was spreading some cultures albeit a little bit hastily.  I failed to wait for the flame to completely dissipate from my tool before going back for some more delicious, combustible ethanol on one of my spreads.  Lo and behold I lit a fat petri dish full of flammable liquid on fire.  As if my brain hadnt already fucked me over enough, I then proceeded to blow as hard as I could on the plate full of burning ethanol.  For a few fleeting moments I was able to relish in my display of fire breathing skills before realizing what I had done.  In a perfect cone in front of me everything was consumed by fire.  Didn't turn out as bad as it could have, but I was moved to other duties in the lab from that day on.

So I'm derping around on Facebook, I go to the profile of Adam, a friend in Connecticut that I hadn't seen in a few years, I add someone, Joe, from his friends list that I had never gotten around to adding before. I forget about it and get on with my night.

An hour later, I'm in a Milonga (a bar where tango is danced) taking lessons. The lessons are split up by expertise. Now, I'd been in Bs. As. for almost a month at this point, and had taken several lessons, so I was in the upper-intermediate circle. The bar is full, probably 50% tourists and 50% porteños. I glance over the heads of the circles behind me, and I see a face I think I recognize in the beginner circle.

Fuckin' Joe. The kid I had just added on Facebook not an hour earlier. I go over, Joe freaks out, ""Shit man I just got your friend request like 10 minutes ago."" 

I joked about coming all the way down to Argentina to make sure he accepted it.

Anyway, Joe and I proceed to get stupid drunk with the local ladies (gorgeous women in Argentina, by the by) and he goes, ""Oh, by the way, Adam (the same Adam from before) is coming down tomorrow. We're going skiing in Bariloche."" So I hung out with them before their flight the subsequent day.

- He is always wondering and asking Dexter about how he is able to know exactly what happened in a crime scene and he is trying to learn as much as possible from him.

- He ~~purchased~~ got his hands on the fake hand probably because he wanted to collect it based on the fact that his apartment is loaded with collector's items, and if his game goes big, that item is going to be worth A LOT of money. He might have gotten access to the hand by paying off the previous intern (HOT CHICK) to get access to it because he knew she had a lot more power to persuade Masuka. The whole "" I couldn't stop the auction, but I deleted the records of it"" was just a cover for the fact that he actually got the hand from the girl after their deal.  

- He is possibly getting close to Jamie to be able to get into Dexter's apartment but at the same time he is not a ""macho hero"" that is going to be a physical threat to Dexter because he almost backed down from dating Jamie when Batista confronted him.

mv30t,1,2011-11-30,DAE prefer working life to student life?,Eurynom0s,DoesAnybodyElse,https://www.reddit.com/r/DoesAnybodyElse/comments/mv30t/dae_prefer_working_life_to_student_life/,"Now I'll preface this by saying that most of my perspective on ""working life"" is from my paid internship this summer. So maybe I'd have different feelings about this if I were permanently working and not just doing it for my summer break during graduate school. Also, I wouldn't really put this for grad school but the getting to spend lots of time with friends (both ones you made a week ago and ones you've known for a while) during undergrad easily beats the social scene after undergrad. But anyhow...

Yes, being a student is awesome. If I don't have class the next morning I can get drunk or stay up late on some random weeknight and it'll most likely be fine. Hell, going to class hungover/sleep deprived probably isn't even that big of a deal as long as you don't make a habit of it. It's fun to have the freedom to make bad choices and not really have consequences for doing so.

But what I really liked this summer was that there was a relatively clear-cut line between when I was at work, and when I was at home. Now sure, in some professions this won't always be the case (like if you're on-call 24/7). And depending on your responsibilities you might still get stuck staying late (but if you're paid by the hour at least you'll get paid overtime), and you might occasionally have to bring something home if it's crunch time on a project.

But in general, when you're not at work you're not at work. Sure, you might not have a ton of personal time during the week between getting home at 6 PM already pretty tired, and having to be in bed by midnight at the latest in order to get up on time for work, but on the flip side your weekends are yours because you don't have homework or exams to study for or anything like that. To me, this is much easier to deal with than this nagging sense of feeling like you should always be doing something--that even if you're done with your work you should be trying to get ahead on next week's work or something. Or the guilt you get from realizing that you need a rest day but not being convinced you can actually afford it.

And don't get me started on the whole not feeling poor thing (again, grad student here)."

Being truly shy, and also very introverted don't help either, when making hospital rounds, seeing patients in clinic, and talking with nurses, therapists and consultants is basically my whole job.

Anyway, I'd always thought that I wanted to be a surgeon, but gave that up in my 4th year because of the hours, the additional stress, and to be honest, some degree of not enough self-confidence. I ended up getting into a family medicine residency, which I started last July.

I guess it's OK. I do really believe that primary care is a valuable thing, I mean, I believe in the specialty. I CAN perform my duties. I'm convinced that my problem has a lot less to do with my specialty in medicine than being involved in medicine as a whole.

But now that I'm actually ""doing"" some real medicine, I hate it. I don't like being in the hospital, I especially don't like being ""on call"" just waiting around to have to go admit another alcoholic in DKA, and I don't like clinic (too quick, too much paperwork, too many drug seekers).

I keep telling myself that, once I just get used to it, get through the first few months, get past intern year, that it will be better, and I'll start liking my job, getting better at it, and I'll love medicine.

But I'm not so sure. I have a hard time thinking that I'll instantly change my personality to be compatible with doing medicine well. Its hard to believe that the nature of the work changes substantially after intern year. I worry that I've wasted so much time and energy and years of my life learning something, only to realize that I despise it, and given the chance would run far, far away from.

I don't know what to do. Part of me knows that I can stick it out, get used to this, just put my head down and do it for the next 30 years. There's another part of me that tells me I need to listen to my gut and find a different career. Obviously I'm torn. Like a lot of people, I want a career that matches up with my interests, and let's me feel like I'm doing something important for the world. I've thought a lot about the possibility of getting into more of a bench research type of career (though more schooling would probably be needed for that). 

I don't know what to do. Do any of you have any thoughts or suggestions?"

And even if there's no specific deadline, is it better to have applied by a certain time to be more competitive? I assume the earlier the better but I'm debating whether I should take my second exam before applying and I'm wondering if there's a ballpark time frame by which I should get apps in.

Combat is so much fun when you have a variety of NPCs fight for you instead of the stock summonables.

One problem: The voices. The moaning is a fun novelty at first, but it seems like the voice acting for ""zombified NPCs"" was recorded almost as an afterthought, it's terrible. It totally kills the immersion, especially when I'm in important dialogue with a quest NPC and the thralls WON'T SHUT UP. It sucks to have awesome dialogue by Christopher Plummer or Max Von Sydow be drowned out by what sounds like a high-school intern's zombie impression.

A reasonable solution would be to have the thralls only moan when you speak to them, or during combat (like the Dremora Lord). Or, replace their vocals with the Draugr vocals, which are much more refined ""undead"" vocals."

Our world stock exchange is increasingly on the decline, and more than a handful of european nations are going bankrupt. America is in over 15 trillion dollars worth of debt. 

Internet censorship is becoming more of a reality instead of just rumors, not just in America, but other countries as well. 

All over the world, governments are fighting their own people over peaceful demonstrations. In america, a bill is being passed through congress as we speak on whether or not our military is allowed to intern americans without warrant. (Steps towards a police state).

We as a country are becoming more poor on a personal level. Loss of jobs, rising prices of basic necessities, and gas... and yet we have more than enough resources and land to feed and employ every american. 

The media has downplayed all of these events, almost to the point where we never hear about any of it. 

And the saddest thing is, almost none of you could give two shits about any of it. You care more about what the fuck your next ipad app will be or how you'll be able to afford all those christmas presents you want.... 

Soon, within the next 5 years, things will be very different in America and all around the world...and it will hit almost all of us like a bullet to the chest. By the time you realize that we've been fucked, it will be too late. 

EDUCATE YOURSELVES AND CHANGE THE WORLD BEFORE WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE TO. 

What are you going to do when you can't use the internet and have to fend for yourself? Oh yeah, and if we have a military police state, their is a chance that you would be forced to house troops. And feed them. 

Those electronics and all that shit you use...won't be worth shit when you can't charge them or have useable internet to do anything with them. 

So, call me crazy or out of touch if you want, but eventually you'll see what I'm seeing. Just remember that I told you so."

The first part of the question had us create 3 user groups on a Windows 7 machine Sales Department, IT Support, and Interns, as well as use App Locker to restrict certain applications from different accounts.


The other part is throwing my group for a loop.  The second part asks us to enable disk quotas for the Interns group:

For our midterm we had a similar question, but we had to enable disk quota for a user.

mug4w,4,2011-11-30,A Little Help?,PrettySureYoureWrong,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/mug4w/a_little_help/,"Hey everyone. After browsing r/LawSchool for the first time, I've gotten a bit worried that pursuing a law career has way more disadvantages than advantages. I was wondering if anyone could straighten some things out?

I'm currently a in my senior year of undergraduate studies, but since my school offers a 5-Year BS/MS program, I have another year and will graduate with both degrees. I'm a computer science major and have had multiple internships in my field with a prestigious company. I have no law experience. Should I try to pursue another technical internship or get law experience?

My plan is to pursue IP law. My thoughts were that by working in the law department of a technology company, I would have a good understanding of the technical aspect, and therefore be better off. Does this make sense? Are there any better ways to combine computer science and law?

Also, I've seen a lot ""Don't go unless you get into a T-14 school."" My GPA is hovering around a 3.7/3.8 (and - if it matters - honors program, should get magna cum laude, etc). What LSAT score would I need to make T-14 schools a possibility?

I'm going to start looking at law schools and studying for the LSATs. I figured I would take a summer course and take the test in October 2012 (graduating Dec. 2012). That seem okay?

Thanks in advance and sorry if these questions were answered else where.

About 2 months ago, I had a one night stand with this girl, but then I ended up sleeping with her again. A week later I arranged a proper date, but had to cancel because I got hold of hockey tickets. She then proceeded to have sex with my best friend/roommate.

I told her and my friend to fuck off, didn't talk to her for 2 weeks, but then she told me she really wanted to talk to me in person. She explained that she was really drunk, that it's no excuse, but she didn't think I was interested in her when I cancelled the date. She says she wants to get to know me better, we really hit it off that night, talked for 3 hours then made-out when I dropped her off. She also explained to me how she had never been in a relationship, and is really not the kind of girl to sleep around.(I believe her now after we got to know each other better, but I was skeptic as hell when she first told me).

So since then, we see each other 2-3 times a week, I always end up sleeping at her place, and we always cuddle afterwards and get really intimate. More than I have ever been with anyone, including a past girlfriend. She tells me she is really comfortable with me, that she had never been this comfortable with anyone and so on. 

So last week, we were talking in bed and she told me she really wanted to see me over the Christmas break, and keep seeing me next semester (she will be away on an internship about an hour away from my apartment at school). To which I replied ''I really think we could have something meaningful in the future''. She said ''what'', I repeated, she said ''what'' again, I repeated. She just kinda looked at me, I told her I suck at these things and I don't want to scare her away, she replied that she also sucks at relationships, and that she isn't scared for once.. but she said ''I'll try not to choke this time, I'm a choker when it comes to relationships...''. This kinda threw me off... I've been dating and having regular sex with this girl, she wants to keep seeing me but something felt odd... 

I had a date with her last night again, had the most amazing time yet, I didn't mention anything about a relation, we just kinda joked around, slept together again, and she has been texting the living fuck out of me all day (I really enjoy it, shows that she is thinking about me...)

I am sleeping at her place again thursday... and she insists on making me supper. 

Anyways, here is my problem. I don't want to be just her fuckbuddy. I've been down that road before and got hurt. I'm sick of girls just thinking I'm a dick on 2 legs. I'm putting a lot of effort into this girl, and definitely want a relationship. I'm afraid she will go see elsewhere given the opportunity if we don't establish something... She gets attention from a lot of guys. The fact that she has already kinda cheated on me throws me off as well. 

TL;DR: I've been dating/having sex with this girl on a regular basis, but she has no relationship experience and seemed hesitant when I brought up the topic. How do I not end up in the ''sexzone''."

mubfy,1,2011-11-29,A long time ago,novembercomes,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/mubfy/a_long_time_ago/,"So this is a bit of a rant, but I'm very tired, and I feel backed into a corner. I am a Georgia Tech student who has been studying finance for the last 3 years. I still have about 2 years left to go, but that's not of any real importance. This has been my life for the past couple of years.

In 2009 I was studying here to be a mechanical engineer because of my background as a machinist and the family history of being engineers. Later I realized that I actually really hate engineering but enjoy business. So I swapped, but only after I had allowed my GPA to drop to around a 2.0.

In late 2009/ early 2010 my family life fell apart more so than it had ever before. I am a single child that comes from an alcoholic, and very judgmental family. In late 2009 I went to the hospital after complaining of a pain in my chest only to later find out that my parents had not claimed me as a dependent to our health insurance provider, and had subsequently been removed from it. They picked up the rather hefty ER bill, but still to this day blame me for the cost. About 6 months later, I developed shingles, and ended up having complications with the medication that ended up with my almost snapping my ankle after a blackout. When I asked my parents if I could go to the hospital, the response I got back was an accusation for having a drug problem. My mother then proceeded to remove the money from our shared account that was supposed to cover the rest of my college. We stopped talking after that.

At that time I had a job working as a research student/ machinist for $10 an hour. It wasn't enough to pay for rent, but I could afford to eat on that. I also had enough money saved that I could either pay for my summer semester, or pay for a place to stay. So rather than renting a place, I decided to jump couches and go to school for a semester hoping to figure something out with financial aid. During that time I maintained a 3.0 average, held a job, had an unpaid internship, and lost 30lb biking on a bike given to me for the internship.

When the semester ended I discovered just how difficult it is to not be filed as a dependent of your parents if you are under 23. The financial aid that the school offered me was not enough to pay for tuition, so I decided to leave school and try to save up enough money to go back and finish. I got a job working as a machinist down in Newnan GA, and secured a room in a house just north of Atlanta for the meantime. The job offer was about $5 less than industry standard, but they told me after the first evaluation that I would get a raise. I also figured that finding a place to stay in ATL for $300 a month that wasn't a pile of poop was something that I should probably hold onto for when I went back to college. By my calculations, I would be able to afford to return to college after a year of work, and be able to keep my loans at bay after I had to start paying them back. So I worked the job with extra hours for about 3 months. As we neared Christmas, I noticed that our work order due dates had gone from being 2 weeks behind to about a month and a half ahead of schedule. Sure enough they laid me off about a week later because they ran out of work for non-company men.

After that I received a couple of more offers for jobs in the Newnan area for the same pay grade, which was barely enough for me to make ends meet. So I decided that I would try to patch things up with my folks. They reluctantly agreed to let me move back in with them, and helped cover the rest of the cost of tuition. We have since been patching things up, even though they are still abusive alcoholics from time to time. So I started to commute to school from the Lawrenceville/Buford area to Tech every day. 

When I moved back in with my parents I immediately started having financial issues again making it to and from school (gas, insurance, maintenance, etc.) so I started to look for a part-time job. It has been a year, and I just found a job 3 weeks ago. Before that I had to give up almost everything I had to pay for gas and insurance over the last year which included my phone, a laptop, and the bicycle I got from my boss for the internship I took on while I was homeless. Now that I have a job, I finally started feeling like I would be able to absolve myself of my debt to my credit card providers as well as be able to move back into town to get away from my parents. 

I had to let my insurance lapse about 2 weeks ago. Last week I blew a tire somehow after coming home one night, and ended up spending about a $100 bucks fixing it. 4 days ago I scraped an RV's extendable compartment after the GT vs UGA game that was in my lane as I was leaving campus to go to work. The police officer gave me a charge for wreckless driving and driving without insurance. They towed my car. I got my friends to lend me enough money to get my insurance renewed and to get my car out of impound (~$300), but I feel terrible about it. I thought I was going to be able get out of debt and pay off my credit cards without defaulting on them, and here I am now $300 in debt to my friends with my creditors threatening to sell my debt. I am terrified of the man with the RV coming after me for damages.

I don't know how I am going to get through a lot of this. My grades aren't great, and I have trouble focusing on school because of my finances, but I don't want to leave school for fear of the loans I've taken out defaulting on me causing me to stay out of school indefinitely. I wouldnt say I am suicidal, but I bought a gun when I was working as a machinist because of where my house was, and sometimes I seriously ask myself if I purchased the gun to protect myself from intruders, or to give myself an easy way out in case things got too hard. I am a big proponent of being able to die with dignity, and some days I worry about myself.

While all of this happened, most of my friends stopped talking to me, I was barred from my fraternity for being poor, and I was fighting my depression. One of my most recent confidants and female friends told me a couple of days that she gets angry at me when I am sad, and has been very distant over the past 2 weeks. I don't talk to very many people anymore so this has been kind of devastating on my psyche. 

I have spent the last 4 days sleeping between my old fraternity's couches, and my friends couch eating nothing but rice and sleeping in the same clothes. I had to bike 12 miles in the rain to get my car out of the impound, and for the last 2 days I have been so exhausted mentally and physically that I don't really care too much anymore. I haven't been home to sleep in my own bed because I want to eliminated the travel costs too and from Lawrenceville so I can pay the friends who lent me money back ASAP.
 
TLDR: Life got hard, told myself it would get better, tried to make it better, and it got worse.


EDIT:   There's a lot more that contributes to all of this, but I tried to keep it as condensed as possible. (if that's possible)"

However, I've been looking at different career opportunities and figured out that I'm most drawn to public relations and journalism jobs.  So... I applied for an internship in a city 10 hours away from my s.o. and dogs because I absolutely love the organization that the internship is for.  

I highly doubt that I'll be chosen for it; but it's just refreshing that I've become excited about my education and career prospects again.  I haven't felt this in about 10 years.  Applying for the internship only solidifies my decision to apply to grad school for my m.a. in pr/journalism.

So... I just wanted to share my excitement with you all- and to encourage you to figure out what makes you tick; makes you feel empowered, and excited!"
mu8o6,1,2011-11-29,Are there any acceptable excuses for sleeping with someone else... and should I be going to talk it out with her tonight?,yeskia,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/mu8o6/are_there_any_acceptable_excuses_for_sleeping/,"Been on and off with this girl for 4 years (mostly on). Had a big fall out about a year ago where I ended up flirting with her best friend and she slept with someone else. We got back together shortly after.

For the past year or so I've been working really hard (I'm 21, she's 20), doing internships and working late at multiple jobs and uni to really kick me off into an awesome career (I work web development). I've been a bit neglectful of her through the year but tried to be good and thought she understood. She made a few comments about our lack of sex life (as I was always totally exhausted) and joked that she would have to find it elsewhere if I wasn't satisfying her.

Last Sunday we had a slight argument where I got angry at her for losing another job. She said she didn't want to see me again and I chased her home, apologised and spent the night. (At this point, she thought we were broken up, I thought we were good).

Last night she wasn't responding to my messages, I had a strange inkling something was up. I went to her house, her lights were on (she was supposedly babysitting) and I could hear voices. I called her phones to make sure she wasn't on the phone, and heard her comment, 'oh, yeskia's calling). I pressed the doorbell and all went silent. I went back around the back to see her standing naked in the kitchen and wouldn't let me in, saying that I was an arsehole and had to leave.

I managed to get inside through a window (I wanted to find the guy) and went through 3 rooms before she stopped me. Beside the windowsill there was a glass of wine and a condom wrapper. She said this guy had come over, drank wine and taken pills, they skinny dipped and then he put a condom on, but she decided not to go through with it. She said he had already left (I have doubts on this looking back, he was probably still in the house).

She tried to justify it, bringing up how I flirted with her friend a year ago, how I haven't been satisfying her and how she felt like I was cheating on her. She swore it was the first time and that nothing had happened beyond that. She said it was the first time in a long time that she felt pretty again, like someone was noticing/appreciating her beauty.

I took my stuff and left. She's been calling and has asked me to come over tonight and sort things out, but she understands if I never want to see her again.

I've already deleted her on Facebook, made plans to go running every second day and lined up things for the rest of the week to keep myself occupied. Should I be content with her excuses for what she did, am I to blame? And do I go over there tonight?

tl;dr: Have fight with girl I've been seeing for 4 years and she says we're not together in a huff, I try and fix it, sleep over a couple of nights and thought we were good. Find her getting drunk, taking pills, skinny dipping and possibly sleeping with some 30 year old French guy. Wants me to come around tonight (after I've gone out with friends) to talk things through."

mu6b7,3,2011-11-29,Gill for Congress is offering internships at ISU,[deleted],ilstu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ilstu/comments/mu6b7/gill_for_congress_is_offering_internships_at_isu/,"Any of you redditors who are politically minded might be interested in working for the Gill campaign as an intern next year.  They're offering college credit and all the interns are eligible to get full time jobs as staff after the election.  It's a grassroots campaign, so there's lots of hands-on experience working with progressive and union leaders in downstate Illinois.  Interns will also get management experience and get the opportunity to staff the candidate during trips.  If you're interested, send a resume' with a phone number to mclean.gill2012@gmail.com

edit-Also, if anyone has questions about the internship, you can message me on here if you want."
mu3yt,2,2011-11-29,Any Redditors graduated from ITT Tech? Do you feel like the whole thing is a scam?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/mu3yt/any_redditors_graduated_from_itt_tech_do_you_feel/,"I graduated from ITT Tech.. I paid $42,000 for an Associates Degree that holds little or no weight in this society (owe $33,000 now). The way ITT advertises, they seem to promise their students a life changing future with jobs in the IT field and such. 

ITT considers itself a college, and even does THE LEAST IT POSSIBLY CAN to make sure their program is viable enough to give college degrees. They don't hire quality instructors; I've seen many come and go because at the end of a course, students would give terrible feedback about these instructors and they'd get fired only for more terrible instructors to replace them (they are exceptional at reading power point slides however). 

After graduation, I wanted to continue for a Bachelor's in IT, but learned that NO COLLEGE EVER will accept anything I've done at ITT, and I'd have to start over as if I have no college credits at all. If I won't be accepted in at colleges (especially not-so-prestigious schools) why would any companies hire me at all? ITT has really no job placement system, while I could have paid WAY less at other colleges and gotten an internship.

Lately, I've been meeting/hearing about people who graduated from ITT Tech.. and absolutely HATE the choice that they have made and wish that they had NEVER done it. And I'm just starting to wonder if the entire organization is just full of crap. 

Basically I just want to know how many people are out there in the same position as me as far as graduating from ITT Tech. I must admit, I wasn't the best student for my first year (I was still in High School mode) but I really made a change at the end for the better when I realized what I really want to do. I sort of feel like I should try to tell as many people as possible to NOT go to ITT Tech. 

Sorry for the huge wall of text. Didn't even intend to go that far. Something has to be done about that place though, either they need to change or need to be brought down!

I'm an engineering student, gpa varies between 2.8 and 3.25, not going to graduate in 4 years (5, instead), and doing a year-long internship now.

I feel like I just suck at school and cannot get any better. How can I stop from feeling this way? I don't have much of a support group and feel like I could have a meltdown at any minute."
mu2dr,2,2011-11-29,"Why do people try so hard to convince others that life 
only gets worse?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/mu2dr/why_do_people_try_so_hard_to_convince_others_that/,"All my life people have pushed variations on this basic theme to me, and at this point I just flat out don't believe them.  

Every single year in elementary/middle/high school they told us that the next year was going to tear us up unless we seriously overhauled our work ethic and attitudes.  Not so.

In high school I sat in my counselor's office in tears over a heavy workload, but she told me not to drop a class because I should just learn to deal; life after high school only gets harder.  Not so!

People tell me to enjoy college because after this you get almost no vacation time and have to work eight hours a day, but last summer I did an internship (my first 'real' job in my career field) and felt lighter than I have since I was a child.  I was honestly astounded at how much less stress and frustration were involved in working longer hours but being able to leave work at work.  

I have disliked most of my life so far, but I've stuck with this path because I am working for future happiness, and I can tell that it's constantly getting better.  If I truly believed that life stays the same or gets worse from here on out, I would frankly end it.  So why does it seem like everyone is so hell-bent on convincing me otherwise?  "
