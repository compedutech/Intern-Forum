ugetf,0,2012-06-01,Shpould I do an unpaid internship? recent grad with no experience and mediocre GPA,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/ugetf/shpould_i_do_an_unpaid_internship_recent_grad/,"Hi, so I just graduated with a mechanical engr. degree a few weeks ago and have been going on a couple of interviews. I don't have any other related engr. work experience (interships/co-ops, etc.) other than a QA position at my dads company years ago and my gpa is mediocre (2.7 due to being shitty at circuits but made deans list a bunch of times), however I have a pretty nice resume with an impressive list of projects (some of which got high honors/awards). I have sent out my resume and cover letter to roughly 30 or so different companies and have only gotten 3 interviews out of it. 1 of them was for a manufacturing position which I never heard back from (im an ME), one was from a huge corp. which is flying me out for an final onsite interview next week (I did a few phone interviews with them already), and the third was for an internship that I had originally thought was paid (craigslist post just said: Internship, negotiable based on experience) however it turns out it is unpaid.

I had my final interview for the internship today with the CEO of the company who informed me it is an unpaid internship but it will turn into a full time job. He told me the internships there are like a long interview and usually it is 3 months, but for me they will hire me after two months, though I dont know if he tells this to everyone or really likes me lol. Now the company is a real small company with only like 4 engineers on staff where the team does literally everything up to manufacturing (theory, design, prototyping, testing, they got a full warehouse and machine shop but no technicians so the engineers build the prototypes themselves) so I would get a lot of cool hands on experience and it seems like a perfect fit for me. He offered me the job and asked me to start on Monday which I agreed too, but now I am kind of regretting it because I need to pay rent and shit, so what do I do?

I am hoping that I will get a full time offer from the big corporation after my on-site interview next week, but would rather have the job at the small company. Do you guys think I would be able to ask the place I am interning for to counter the offer (assuming I get one) if they want me to stay there? This is why I am thinking I should do the unpaid internship because by the time I would get an offer I'd have been working there at least a week or two so they will see that I am a good worker and honestly I would rather stay in my city than have to move halfway across the country to a place I never want to live. However i have also heard others on here blast un-paid internships as scams and even say they are illegal. So I really don't know. On one hand I take it and it's a good prospect, on the other I don't and I am back to square one of uncertainty and the sick feeling of 'im never gonna get hired by anyone, im gonna end up homeless, etc...""

Thanks for any advice. 


**UPDATE: I sent them an email and they offered to pay me and give me a hiring bonus as well!** thanks for the advice everyone. "

I decided to stay home with my parents and sister this summer after I couldn't get an internship. I started the summer at exactly 300 lbs but I was still a fairly active person. The rest of my family is in worse shape than I. My little sister tips the scales at over 300 lbs, my father is over 330lbs and my mother (who has lost over 100 lbs in the last 4 years) is now at 210.

Anyway, they've seen my progress and my enthusiastic reviews of running and they all told me that they want to join! Today was our first day and it went great. Started off on the Pre-C25K program for them and shuffled with them to keep them motivated. Unfortunately my mom had arthritis in the knees and can't run with us but she speed-walked with us the whole time.

I got a Masters in CS with a near-perfect GPA from a good school, did an internship that evolved into a dev role, and eventually got hired at what I considered my dream job.

The ""dream job"" eventually started getting tedious and I found it difficult to concentrate, so I mixed things up. I left things on a great note and I took a year off and traveled the world with my girlfriend.

Now I'm back, and I have a wide-open door to go back to the old job, but it feels so much like a step backwards and I'm not sure I want to. Despite that, I don't really see any other job postings that seem more appealing. I have an entrepreneurial bent and would love to do my own thing, but I'm in some kind of a post-trip funk and it seems irresponsible to work on a startup full-time with no real traction after such a long time out of the workforce. I've been on such a set career path for my whole life that it feels really weird being home and at this kind of crossroads. I feel like it's an important turning point and that if I could really get passionate about something and apply myself right now it would shape the rest of my life.

Has anyone experienced something similar? How would you go about making this decision/kicking your butt into gear?"

I'm a college student and a friend who I met and became really close with this year found out less than a week ago that she has leukemia.

Last I heard from her, they said she might have Lyme disease. I tried contacting her for about a week but I didn't hear back from her so I assumed she was busy getting ready for her summer internship (moving, meeting her roommates, etc.) but last night she sent me a text message saying that she wanted to talk to me and this morning she called and told me that after a ton of tests the doctors found out that the stomach pain was caused by leukemia. 

We talked for a little while and she said she's already started chemotherapy (yesterday, in fact) and that she's just so afraid of what's going to happen. She already can't participate in her internship, might not be back in the fall, and just so many things that she was looking forward to.

Hey Reddit, I’m struggling with a job hunt and I’m looking for feedback/guidance/direction/a sounding board.

I’m in my mid-early 30s, married for 8 years to a wonderful woman who is a little older than me.  We have a 14 month old daughter – the absolute light of my life –and we just found out that my wife is pregnant with our second.  We would love for this to be an exciting time, but our financial/employment situation is making our future tremendously scary, to say the least.

I have always had trouble with employment.  I have a college degree, but it’s in the impractical field of film studies.  While I’m in California, I have no desire to work in film production.  I have a family to provide for, and film work is nothing if not intermittent.  Aside from an internship in a film production office more than a decade ago, I haven’t really worked in the film industry at all.

After college, I spent a couple of years – great years – working for an international resort company.  I designed and built theatrical sets and was de-facto stage manager for their nightly stage shows.  I left this company after 9/11 when I decided that I wanted to be closer to home.  I found a job in southern California working at another resort theater, first as a stage hand, then eventually as their technical director.  My stage manager connected me with a friend of hers who had a video production company (think wedding videos and such) and I was able to work part time with him.  The money wasn’t great, but I added a little more to my resume.  In that time, my wife (then girlfriend) and I started dating long distance.  She was a high school teacher and had tenure, so after two years with this particular theater at something like $10/hr, it made sense for me to relocate to where she was.  I was still in SoCal, but too far away to keep working for the theater or production house.  Before I moved, I asked video production owner-guy if they would have a full-time position for me because the theater schedule was just about the exact opposite of my wife’s (at this point, upgraded to fiancé) schedule.  He made an effort to create a position for me, but things took too long to fall in to place, so like I said, I ended up relocating.  No hard feelings.  Shortly after relocating, my wife and I got married.

Over the next two years, I worked for a “marketing” company, but really my time was spent in a warehouse issuing credits for damaged office furniture.  After a year and a half of this, I got an internship, and commuted an hour one-way three times a week to catalogue tapes for a small production company that had connections to the music scene in Long Beach. (the band Sublime, the Ziggens, etc.)  They asked me to edit a few things for them, and I told them that if I was editing, I needed to get paid.  So they wrote me a check for $13/hr.  At this point, I had a bit of a crisis and panicked, because how is a man supposed to support a family in SoCal at $13/hr? (My wife and I still had not had kids yet, but we knew we wanted to, and I was working towards becoming a provider.)

I called my dad, who has had a great deal of success in the insurance/financial services.  I lived many hours away, and we talked about me getting my insurance license and going to work with him in a sort of mentorship relationship.  My wife did not want to do this, as she would lose her tenure.  My argument was that if I was to ever become the provider for our family, we needed to take steps that would put me into that position.  I got my insurance license, and we made the move to a place I’ll just call “the coast.”

About 8 months after we got to the coast, my dad bailed.  He was having trouble with the company we worked for and got a great job in a somewhat similar industry, and there was no room to bring me along.  I wasn’t too bothered, because I picked up his entire book of business and was hoping to nurture that into more sales (read:income).  At the same time, I was also working part time for my church.  They had installed this $75,000 video system and really didn’t know what to do with it, so they paid me about $25,000/yr to design the weekly presentations on it, to keep the campus’ network running, and just be an all-around tech guru.  During this time, I also really built up my photoshop, design and visual presentation skills.  I redesigned the church’s logo and built a sort of brand identity for them.  If it weren’t for the money from my church job, I don’t know how we would have made it.  It supplemented the irregular and inconsistent commissions I was getting.  I wasn’t really cut out for insurance sales.  I have major “call reluctance.”  Who wants to get a call from their insurance guy?  Who wakes up in the morning and says “I want to buy life insurance today?”  So the insurance side of my income stagnated, and there was no room for advancement at my church.

At the same time, my wife was really struggling as well.  We’re now in 2007-8-9, and she had lost her tenure when she changed school districts.  Each year, she would get laid off because she was the most recent hire.  She’s a fantastic teacher – the best, really – so her references were often able to get her hired on in another nearby district.  Still, the job hoping took its toll on our peace of mind and our income.

Two years ago, we found out my wife was pregnant with our first.  While income was not great, we had insurance and we were supporting ourselves.  I still wasn’t making enough to support us all, and my wife couldn’t realistically teach and be a mom at the same time.  She puts so much energy into her teaching job – it’s easily 60 hours/week if not more.

After my daughter was born, my dad had gone back to work for a business owned and operated by our extended family.  This business was located in “the desert,” and was on its last legs due to some health problems my uncle was having.  Dad was trying to keep the business running, and wanted my help.  I put on my negotiating hat and got a large enough salary that I could support my family and we could buy a house.  Due to the lower cost of living in “the desert,” we could finally reach our goals of owning a home and having my wife stay home to be a mom for our infant daughter.

Unfortunately, this family business was doomed before dad even got here.  I won’t get into it, but I got to watch the bank seize all of the company’s assets and destroy my grandparents’ legacy.  This was all due to stuff that had been set in motion a few years back.  Dad and I still saw value in the intangible assets of the company, so we took the customer list and a few of the strongest employees and started a leaner, meaner company.  For six months now, this new company has hobbled along.  We haven’t received any outside funding, and it’s expensive to start a company, especially in California.  We’re working on an SBA loan, but the banks aren’t exactly eager to lend these days.  There has been multiple times where I didn’t know if I was going to get a paycheck, or it’s been delayed by a few days.   

And that’s where I am today.  I’ve got a new house payment, a wife who works too hard to do what she’s always done and still be a mom at the same time, and a job that pays decent money when it pays, but I don’t know if I’m going to see a paycheck next week.  I’m applying for work all over right now, because I’m tired of being afraid of my own ability to pay all of our bills on time.  I want decent income, and I want stability.

Most of the jobs I’m looking at are either entry level and pay about $25,000/yr, or they are specialist positions that require years of experience in a specific field.  So reddit, where should a guy like me go?  I’m a jack-of-all-trades, master of none.  I can do basic graphic design, I have an eye for marketing and presentation.  My experience in theater and time with my church has taught me the importance of precision timing in live production. I’ve been the network admin for three different small business networks.  I think my strategy should be to market myself to a small/medium organization that needs a little bit of all those things, but doesn’t need to hire a specialist in any one field. Am I on the right track?  And if so, how do I find an organization like that?  It’s not like careerbuilder.com turns up something when I search for design/marketing/presentation/IT guru.

**tl;dr:** I’ve have had a series of jobs, but no career.  At a point where I need “career” income.  Where do I go looking for a career with my unique set of skills?"

I normally live in California with my girlfriend (also aged 27) of 2 years normally.

We have a great relationship, and I am fairly certain that I love her.  We have fun together, have a great domestic environment, have lots of common friends, and enjoy our distinct careers.  In short, we make each other happy consistently, and have a high level of mutual respect and all that good stuff. I guess our only problem is that our sex has been a bit less passionate recently, but I feel like that's not intractable given the overall relationship.

Anyway, I'm in Asia right now, and we talk online/on the phone a lot, and it's clear that she misses me a lot.  The trouble is, I don't miss her.  I feel like I'm *supposed* to miss her, but I just don't!  I have every intention of resuming our relationship as normal upon my return, but I'm starting to question how serious I am about everything given that I don't miss her right now.  I'm especially concerned about continuing an asymmetrical relationship, if indeed she cares for me more than I do for her - it's a hard thing to gauge (I care for her a lot and love her, but I'm starting to think less-so?) 

Life's super fun here, the work is awesome, and I'm meeting great people constantly.  I think maybe that's why I don't miss her - because I'm too engaged in my interesting present.  But is this a bad sign?  I feel almost inhuman for not missing her.  Should I feel bad about this?

What are your experiences?

Realized that copying entire email correspondence is futile, here is selected stuff from hate mail i am proud of:
Point is that there is no wish to act, and act you can. Hiding behind regulations and bashing my morals won't change that.
In that spirit there can be no respect from me to you. Respect is reserved for people that earn it. Only fool gives it for granted.

Anybody else looking?,ChrisloriousHD,columbusclassifieds,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbusclassifieds/comments/ufo1k/still_never_got_an_apartment_situation_settled/," A friend and I have been trying to get an apartment for a couple months now and because we are younger (I'm 19 and he's 18) we haven’t been able to find anywhere that will take us without a cosigner. This is based upon our lack of credit scores and rental history (cause you know, we can really control that….).

 At this point I am open to finding somebody who has the credit that would like to get the townhouse with us in Worthington that we were looking at (with utilities and 3 people it should be about $270 a month per person). I'm also willing to move in with somebody who is looking for a roommate, either both of us or just me, I'm just ready to be on my own again.

 I have good credit (for my age, 647) and a steady 40 hour a week job. I am an intern IT at a programming company. I am attending classes at Strayer University online and I have a steady girlfriend that I have been dating for 14 months. I grew up in a Christian home. I’m allergic to dogs and cats but I wouldn’t mind having either, I am cool with coping xD. I love dogs and cats both. I normally sit at my computer or play Xbox. I’m a calm mature person. I keep my areas clean and I help keep shared areas clean.

   I’ve been looking for a while. I moved here to attend classes at DeVry a year ago (literally a year today actually, oddly enough). I was placed into an apartment through them. The first apartment I was in I had to deal with druggy drunk roommates and I couldn’t handle it. I had them move me to a different apartment. In the second apartment, I had a thief for a roommate and ended up losing 1.5k worth of items, including a laptop. I got out of there, broke the lease (payed it through) and moved in with my cousins. I’ve been living there for 5 months now. I need to move badly, I don’t enjoy living with them because I feel like I’m intruding as they are raising a family.

   A big thing I'm looking for really though is a roommate that I can connect with. Somebody that has some similar likes. I've been lacking real social interaction due to what happened with the other roommates and such. I don't party so I don't really meet people that often. I like to play video games a decent amount, I personally own a Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, Nintendo Wii, Xbox 360, and PS3. I like music of all sorts. I have a powerful PC and 2 large screens for monitors, one being a 3DTV. I like bowling and playing basketball and such. I want somebody who will not only be a roommate, but be a friend."

I was given a 2 week placement, and after seeing my ability and the quality of my output they asked if I wanted to stay on for 6 weeks, paid pro rata.

After my internship was up, one of the area directors asked if I wanted to stay on full time, offered me a low salary but hey, it's the recession and media has been hit really hard so who was I to say no. Told I would be on probation for 6 months, I thought 'fine it's seems like the standard thing'. After doing work well and above my station (I've been taken on as a junior, but I regularly fill in for both the middle and senior levels very regulalry), the company investing in an expensive design course for me to go on, treated to the perks of working in media yadayada, when my 6 months was up, I was told my probation would be extended due to sporodic lateness and staying on task. Now I work 60 hour weeks for the lowest wage in the office, do the work of people above my position, am a graduate unlike others in the office, so when I wok 9AM to 10PM at least once every two weeks and til 6 or 7PM not getting home til 9:30/10PM most nights I thought they'd cut me some slack. The other guys in the department live 20 minutes away. Still, I made big improvements at the expense of my homelife and social life and my physical wellbeing but I can't allow for when a train line shuts down for 3 hours. 

As such, the head of design for my region has decided to extend it once again after they promoted two of my colleagues (who are a couple) to senior positions above me who have given me nothing but hassle since they got their job. They were the ones apparently who had the most issues, and have non-stop treated me like a dogsbody, giving me all the shitty little jobs to do. I know my work is better then their work, that's why everyone asks me to do the jobs because they know I'll get it done. This wasn't the case before the promotion, and the head of design has even said himself that my work has been fantastic, I work really hard and I am well liked by everyone and they need me there, just the issues raised by the seniors mean that by the company policy unless they're addressed he has to extend the probation.

Is there anything I can do? Do I have grounds to complain? Any advice actually would be much appreciated

**TLDR**: Put on 6 month probation at new job, worked my socks off for shitty wage, and they've extended my probation twice due to the meddling of seniors who have a thing against me.

I learned that ""Also, about a week before you start, I will send the form for your drug test to your house via federal express.""

I'm 22 F and have felt relatively happy with my identity up until a year ago.  I was in an internship in 2011 and roomed with two bisexual girls who spent most of the time trying to convince me that I was bisexual.  They were of the opinion that ""nobody is every just straight or just gay"" and really liked to announce their bisexuality.  It really grated on my nerves, but made me think that maybe I needed to consider that.  Of course, I eventually blew it off because I determined that my doubts were just from their pressure.

Now, though...  Well, I was snuggling with my boyfriend and we were just talking about random stuff when he mentioned well... to be as discrete as I can, 'hanging out' with another girl (as in me, him, and the girl together) and wanted to know if I was okay with that.  I was kind of surprised to find myself not opposed to the idea and shortly after started crying out of confusion.  (I'd like to note that my boyfriend is completely supportive and isn't trying to force me either way; he suggested I talk with others rather than just keeping it to myself)

I know for certain that I am attracted to males but now I'm beginning to think that I am attracted to females as well.  I wasn't raised in a particularly strict or homophobic family and I'm all for freedom of sexuality, so I don't feel ashamed or wrong feeling this way...  But it is a little confusing at 22 to suddenly realize I might be interested in the same gender.

I'm not really sure what I'm looking for here other than to just talk through it with people to help me sort myself out.  I have felt a little more... comfortable?  with myself after having that 'epiphany', but as I said, I'm pretty confused.

Anybody feel like just talking about stuff?  I don't really have any direction for this (probably because I'm pretty confused), but talking about it with people helps me more than just trying to think through it.

&gt;  Some things I didn't know...
&gt;Things to remember in November  
&gt;
&gt;      After going to both Harvard Business School and Harvard Law &gt;School simultaneously, he passed the Michigan bar, but never worked &gt;as an attorney.
&gt;·       As a venture-capitalist, Romney's first major business deal &gt;involved investing in a start-up office supply company with one store &gt;in Massachusetts that sold office supplies.
&gt;That company, called Staples, now has over 2,000 stores and &gt;employs over 90,000 people.
&gt;·       Romney or his company BainCapital (using what became known &gt;as the ""Bain Way"") would go on to perform the same kinds of business &gt;miracles again and again, with companies like Domino's, Sealy, &gt;Brookstone, Weather Channel, Burger King, Warner Music Group, &gt;Dollarama, Home Depot Supply,
&gt;and many others.
&gt;Got your calculators handy? Let's recap.
&gt;       Volunteer campaign worker for his dad's gubernatorial campaign &gt;1 year.
&gt;·       Unpaid intern in Governor's office 8 years.
&gt;·       Mormon missionary in Paris 2 years.
&gt;·       Unpaid bishop and state president for his church 10 years.
&gt;Took no salary as president of the Salt Lake Olympics 3 years.
&gt;·       No salary as MA governor 4 years.
&gt;Gave his ENTIRE INHERITANCE to charity.
&gt;·       That's a grand total of 28 years of unpaid service to his &gt;country, his community and his church. Why? Because that's the kind &gt;of man Mitt Romney is.
&gt; 
&gt;And He’ll show you his:
&gt;1)     Un-doctored Birth Certificate!
&gt;2)    College transcripts!
&gt;3)    Law degree!
&gt;4)    Un-doctored Draft notice!  Un-doctored Social Security card, &gt;and what state it's registered in!
&gt;Isn’t it time for a REAL CHANGE?
&gt;

Last year I almost gave up.  At the start of this year I got new docs and meds and really gave it my all to get better. 

It's been 6 months since I started recovering from those 9 years.  I'm working 2 internships, I was offered a full time job off of LinkedIn, I leave my room and socialize, I am trying to date, I am stable and faithful with my meds.  I still have to patch up my relationship with my dad and living with my mom sucks (divorced, he blamed it on me) and have drug abuse under control.

What prompted me to post is that I am returning from a 3 week vacation in Guatemala (where my mom is from) and I feel different.  The last time I was in that country was when I was 14 years old, before all the mental anguish and shit, and 12 years have passed!  My cousins are married or getting married, having babies, building homes for their families.  I was both embarrassed/sad that I didn't have similar accomplishments to talk about with them, but they were very happy to see me and took care of me/showed me around and I was even able to confide in one close cousin.  I climbed a volcano, partook in a cacao ceremony with a shamanic healer, visited family in the mayan kaqchikel highlands, and got laid (whoo! dry spell over), to name a few things I did during my vacation.

I want to say thanks to Puddles, Cat226, Logiz, erics, and the other mibbit users who encouraged me to stay off drugs during my trip, to take fewer books and focus on the experience instead, and for being open and honest about their lives.  It's made a huge difference to have this subreddit community available to reflect and learn from others.  And to those who are struggling every minute of every day, there is hope for you.

I am a 19 year old female living in a city away from home for the summer for a summer internship. I found a nice sublet (with strangers who I don't know really) close to my workplace in a relatively nice neighborhood. However, the thing is, the city I am working in is known for a relatively high crime rate.

My mother came to help me move in earlier this week and I have been sleeping on an air mattress, so that she can take the bed. I didn't expect her to stay for that long, but now she refuses to leave. Her reasoning is that:

* I am a female.
* I am young and I don't know how to live alone, despite me living in college alone for the past 3 years.
* The city is dangerous.
* The building doesn't have a good lock system (which is true, all of the doors are simply passcoded and the door to my room doesn't have a lock that I can lock from the outside.)
* I don't know my roommates or anyone in the city.
* She is paying for the apartment.

But my mother is driving me crazy. We don't have an amiable relationship and she is always paranoid and gossipy. Most of all, she treats me like I am 10 years old (including reinstating an 8pm curfew because of the city's ""crime"") and not letting me progress as an adult at all (other than going to work).

What can I do, if anything?

**edit:**
To answer some more comments:

* I am not financially dependent or remotely close to that yet. I still have debt and a full year of college left.
* There are people living in my family's house, so no worries there.
* One thing I forgot to add: I have had the talk with her that I want to be independent multiple times. She often guilts me by telling me how much I owe her for paying for university and how if I want her to leave so badly, she'll leave forever and I can say goodbye to my family because I am ungrateful.

I'm a 21-year-old dude who just moved here from OH for a summer internship. I don't really know anyone here, and have really only met the people at my job - I'd like to fix that and fill my time by getting involved, but don't know where to start.


Things I'm interested in:

* Nature/Hiking 
* Swimming 
* Ultimate Frisbee 
* Reading 
* Dogs, though I don't currently have one 
* Improv comedy 
* Gaming, to a lighter extent 
* Hot Wings (doubt there's a club for that... still figured I'd mention it =P If you know a bar with a great weekly deal or something, let me know) 


Preferably I could join some clubs that would get me outside and/or more active - would have loved Ult. Frisbee but can't find a league, and I've missed the Wiffle ball league sign-ups (so disappointed). 


I've also looked at some martial arts stuff (no experience here... although it does seem a little pricey) and tried to check out rugby (also no experience), but it seems like the kazoo league might no longer be active since their site was down - or maybe it's just out of season.


Anyways, any and all advice is welcome - thanks! And please don't be offended if you're very into a club and I don't end up checking it out, I appreciate the suggestion either way =)

EDIT: Thanks to anyone who messaged me so far. I don't want to be so picky but I'm also trying to turn away from the IT-related sector because I hear that entails less coding and more of just administrating or managing data.

**WHAT I'M lOOKING FOR:**

Hi all! I recently moved here for the summer on an internship and I'm looking to meet new people. I'm a little nervous about going to NYC because I'm from the South and I don't know anyone there. I've studied abroad and traveled around before, but this will be the first time I'll be truly on my own without anyone to look to. I can handle myself around the city [alone](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3kb3wg44K1qa24wx.gif) just fine but it feels like something is missing and that someone is YOU. 

I have to leave at the end of the summer to go back to school but I really want to take advantage of everything the city has to offer and I'd be great to connect with someone while I'm there. I'm mainly looking for a partner-in-crime to show me around town, to join me on random walks across the city or to the park, or even to kick back a few drinks at the local bar or pub after work. But let's all face it, sometimes we get a little lonely or too tired to go out and just want to stay in and feel close to someone. I understand that ladies and to you, I have this to say:

(AS ENRIQUE IGLESIAS)^*
&gt;I CAN BE YOUR HERO, BAAABY

&gt;I CAN KISS AWAY THE PAIN

&gt;I WILL STAND BY YOU FOREVVVER^**

&gt;You. can. take. my breath away...

**WHAT YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR AND WHY YOU'VE FOUND IT**

* I'm the tallest Mexican, EVER.
* Oh snap, did he just say Mexican? Yeah that's right AND I was raised in the South. How does that work? Show me yours and I'll show you mine.
* SHOW ME YOURS AND I'LL SHOW YOU MINE.
* GIFs AND INNUENDO - LOVE THEM. Send me your favorite animated gifs or dirty jokes and I'll be [like:](http://i.imgur.com/L0i38.gif)
* Music I like includes everything under the sun other than Country or its equivalent in any language. The former includes but is not limited to: Rock, Progressive Metal, Metal, Alternative Metal, Alternative Rock, Rap, Hip-Hop, some R&amp;B, House, Classical and some Indie (when I'm depressed), Progressive House, drumstep, and [gasp] DUBSTEP. That's right ladies.
 You can be all [like:](http://i.imgur.com/0soqE.gif) but I'm just going to be [like:](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3k9th0aHq1r8drs5.gif)
* CUDDLING - I'M ALL OVER THAT G. Get ready for CuddleFest 2012 in NYC 'cuz I'm going to be caressing ALL THE THINGS.
* Gentlemanly shit: Thank your lucky stars 'cuz Momma raised me right. YES, I WILL be opening doors for you, keeping you warm with my jacket and dry with my umbrella (when available), and walking you home if I can.
* Favorite TV shows of Christmas Past: Misfits, V, Lost, Caprica, Battlestar Galactica, Heroes, Death Note, Eureka 7, Batman: The Animated Series, Dark Angel, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Terminator: Sarah Connor Chronicles, The Wire, The Shield, Nip/Tuck
* Current shows I'm into: Community, New Girl, Mad Men, Eureka Seven: AO, The Office, Game of Thrones, Modern Family, Legend of Korra, Archer, Hell on Wheels
* Other stuff I'm into: Cooking, Dancing salsa, photography, running (I run half-marathons from time to time), Steam games I keep buying but never get to play, (computer graphics, special fx and animation), random Tech news, artificial intelligence and the oncoming zombie apocalypse, reading, travelling the world, and your pick of kittens or puppies (limit 1 per customer). 

**SOME CLOSING REMARKS:**

I'd really like to hang out with you so PM me if you're interested. We can chat for a bit if you'd like until we're both confident we're not ax murderers (I prefer knives myself haha jk). I'm really not expecting anything so we can just have fun and see where things go. 



**TL;DR:** ""My name is Buck and I like to..."" make new friends with pretty girls and have interesting conversations so let's hang out and do stuff!

**DISCLAIMERS:**

Currently, I'm working at an internship for the summer, but in December, I will be leaving everything I know to fulfill a lifelong dream of mine of serving in the US Army. While things are fairly serious with my girlfriend, she is not coming with me, not only because she has her own career to worry about, but also because my stay down there is going to be temporary and I wouldn't want her to uproot herself until I know exactly where I will be stationed. If we are still together after I finish training (which will be fairly long at ~18 months), then we were both thinking about marriage. I know that we are both young, but we both feel we are a perfect fit for each other because we have many of the same interests and similar wants out of life.

Despite the way we both feel, there is a problem that has been eating at me for quite awhile now. My girlfriend works at an accounting firm and will be working lots of hours over the next two years, which won't be a problem because I will be equally as busy doing all the training I have to do. Whenever I bring up the fact that we've had to cancel plans because she's had to work so much while she was interning, she accuses me of being unsupportive of her career path, which isn't true; during her busy season, I brought her lunch and flowers a few times a week so I could at least see her and try to relieve some stress, despite the fact that I was also super busy with school, ROTC and my own job. 

While it's not going to be a problem with her working so much while I am away for the next year and a half, I don't feel like she will be able to make time or take the effort to keep our relationship alive and well. It feels like the only reason we didn't break up over her busy season was the effort I put into our relationship and I was only able to do that because we lived near each other. We recently got into an argument about this - I wanted to talk about how things were going to be after I leave but she couldn't really answer. So now I am left wondering if it is worth it to stay together any longer, especially since our time together will be much more limited next year and she hasn't done anything to prove to me that I will be a priority over her job when I come back to visit.

TL;DR - I am leaving in 6 months to start a career in the US Army and I am not sure my girlfriend will make me a priority if we decide to stay together."

It used to have a black coating around it but it all peeled off.

I've liked this girl for a few months now we share similar interests and have been friends for quite a while. I think of myself as quite a confident 15 year old. Never being shy from social interaction regardless of gender. I never even had problems talking to girls who I liked. My real problem is telling a girl how I feel about her. So anyway. Our prom is coming up next month and I decided to step out of the confides of my previous self in which I'd had been to shy to ask a girl to prom. For some reason in our school, asking a girl to prom shows you like her more than a friend. It's stupid, I know but that's just the way it goes. We've been chatting quite thoroughly for a few days so I decided to ask her.

However to my expectation she said no, she'd rather just go with friends, which in my turn respected and we'd just go as friends instead. I thought nothing of it, but intern it has payed off better than if she had said yes. Since showing that I actually cared genially about her she's been a lot more considerate, friendly and a lot more ""interested"" in me. What I'm trying to say is that rejection is not the end. Even though that may sound a little creeper-ish it has give the opportunity to help get closer to this girl. If you put the effort in something good will always come out of it.

Hi all! I recently moved here for the summer on an internship and I'm looking to meet new people. I'm a little nervous about going to NYC because I'm from the South and I don't know anyone there. I've studied abroad and traveled around before, but this will be the first time I'll be truly on my own without anyone to look to. I can handle myself around the city [alone](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3kb3wg44K1qa24wx.gif) just fine but it feels like something is missing and that someone is YOU. 

I have to leave at the end of the summer to go back to school but I really want to take advantage of everything the city has to offer and I'd be great to connect with someone while I'm there. I'm mainly looking for a partner-in-crime to show me around town, to join me on random walks across the city or to the park, or even to kick back a few drinks at the local bar or pub after work. But let's all face it, sometimes we get a little lonely or too tired to go out and just want to stay in and feel close to someone. I understand that ladies and to you, I have this to say:

(AS ENRIQUE IGLESIAS)^*
&gt;I CAN BE YOUR HERO, BAAABY

&gt;I CAN KISS AWAY THE PAIN

&gt;I WILL STAND BY YOU FOREVVVER^**

&gt;You. can. take. my breath away...

**WHAT YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR AND WHY YOU'VE FOUND IT**

* I'm the tallest Mexican, EVER.
* Oh snap, did he just say Mexican? Yeah that's right AND I was raised in the South. How does that work? Show me yours and I'll show you mine.
* SHOW ME YOURS AND I'LL SHOW YOU MINE.
* GIFs AND INNUENDO - LOVE THEM. Send me your favorite animated gifs or dirty jokes and I'll be [like:](http://i.imgur.com/L0i38.gif)
* Music I like includes everything under the sun other than Country or its equivalent in any language. The former includes but is not limited to: Rock, Progressive Metal, Metal, Alternative Metal, Alternative Rock, Rap, Hip-Hop, some R&amp;B, House, Classical and some Indie (when I'm depressed), Progressive House, drumstep, and [gasp] DUBSTEP. That's right ladies.
 You can be all [like:](http://i.imgur.com/0soqE.gif) but I'm just going to be [like:](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3k9th0aHq1r8drs5.gif)
* CUDDLING - I'M ALL OVER THAT G. Get ready for CuddleFest 2012 in NYC 'cuz I'm going to be caressing ALL THE THINGS.
* Gentlemanly shit: Thank your lucky stars 'cuz Momma raised me right. YES, I WILL be opening doors for you, keeping you warm with my jacket and dry with my umbrella (when available), and walking you home if I can.
* Favorite TV shows of Christmas Past: Misfits, V, Lost, Caprica, Battlestar Galactica, Heroes, Death Note, Eureka 7, Batman: The Animated Series, Dark Angel, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Terminator: Sarah Connor Chronicles, The Wire, The Shield, Nip/Tuck
* Current shows I'm into: Community, New Girl, Mad Men, Eureka Seven: AO, The Office, Game of Thrones, Modern Family, Legend of Korra, Archer, Hell on Wheels
* Other stuff I'm into: Cooking, Dancing salsa, photography, running (I run half-marathons from time to time), Steam games I keep buying but never get to play, (computer graphics, special fx and animation), random Tech news, artificial intelligence and the oncoming zombie apocalypse, reading, travelling the world, and your pick of kittens or puppies (limit 1 per customer). 

**SOME CLOSING REMARKS:**

I'd really like to hang out with you so PM me if you're interested. We can chat for a bit if you'd like until we're both confident we're not ax murderers (I prefer knives myself haha jk). I'm really not expecting anything so we can just have fun and see where things go.

http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/u5pfb/college_student_seeking_advice_on_the_best_way_to/

I recently got hired to work a geoscience internship as a research assistant (in addition to the office job I currently hold), which will bring my total take-home pay to $380-450 per month (it will depend on the availability of the grad student I'll be working for). It's by no means very much money, but it's more than what I would have if I didn't work. 

As a result, I've decided to put 70-75% (depending on how much I've earned that month-- the more I make the higher the percentage) into my savings account. Roughly half of that savings will go towards a future study abroad/research abroad trip I may be participating in, and the other half will go towards my general emergency/future needs fund.

The money that doesn't go into savings (aka the money ""left over"") will be my ""fun"" money.

Thank you for your help, and if you have suggestions for improving this plan, I am eager to hear them!

I posted something earlier today, but I remained distant and vague in my explanation.

My girlfriend of eight months broke up with me a little bit more than a week ago. I know eight months isn’t a very long time and in the grand scheme of things, it’s quite trivial. But I’ve dated girls for more than a year and I’ve never felt this torn apart. She told me she no longer loved me. I saw this coming and I tried as hard as I could to keep our relationship together—and honestly I think that’s probably what tore us apart… I’ll explain.

We had a really good relationship. We were interested in the same things: action movies (Resident Evil, Avengers, etc.), videogames (Zelda of course!), Indian food (every Thursday), fitness, television shows (Burn Notice, White Collar, and Alias), and a lot more. I tried to help her with her school work as much as I could and she did cute things for me too, such as cooking me crepes or French toast in the morning. You and I both know the list of the good things could go on indefinitely--I’m in love with her.

However, there were issues like every relationship. We both had two majorly conflicting character traits.

I have an “anxiety disorder,” which is likely inherited from my father who tried to commit suicide a few years back, so I get extremely paranoid about whether the person I’m dating truly loves me. My paranoia and anxiety is also probably the result of my flawed family life. My mother was an alcoholic and my dad had an affair. He had two children with another women (a stripper actually), and he abused me childhood naivety; namely, he said that this situation was normal and that I shouldn’t tell my mother. For two years I knew about my dad’s affair while I watched my mother’s heart be slowly ripped into pieces as she wondered why my dad was becoming more distant by the day. She eventually found it and it wasn’t from my mouth. I regret that every day. Anyway…

Unfortunately, my paranoia was exacerbated by one of her quirks, specifically her distant and unaffectionate attitude. That is, she never gave me any sort of affection, which she said was the result of her depression and self-confidence issues that I will not go into for the sake of her privacy. I always said love you first. I cuddled with her. I kissed her and held her. And she never reciprocated; she never showed affection in return. She told me she didn’t like that I was affectionate because she didn’t like being touched by anyone (which is odd because for the first month and a half she was extremely affectionate).

Our two quirks collided obviously. Every day I became more and more paranoid. But I loved her, so I tried to conceal my paranoia as best as I could. In fact, it was the first time in my life that I could actually sort of contain it. I loved her and she hated my paranoia, so I tried so desperately hard to not be paranoid. Even though we had our issues and she still told me that she wanted to be with me. She said that if she couldn’t be in a relationship with me, then she wasn’t meant for anyone. She wanted to marry me and she actually designed our floor plans for our house one day. This was two weeks before our break up.

reddit, I no longer have passion or motivation to do anything anymore. I have an internship starting in 5 days at a Fortune 20 company and I need my motivation back. I’m going down the wrong road at this point. I don’t care about anything and I can’t be around anyone without being on the verge of breaking down and crying.

**tl;dr** My girlfriend broke up with me and I'm really sad about it."
ugv7e,0,2012-06-02,"reddit, you've probably seen this same post a thousand times, but I need your advice. ",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ugv7e/reddit_youve_probably_seen_this_same_post_a/,"reddit, I desperately need your help. 

I posted something earlier today, but I remained distant and vague in my explanation.

My girlfriend of eight months broke up with me a little bit more than a week ago. I know eight months isn’t a very long time and in the grand scheme of things, it’s quite trivial. But I’ve dated girls for more than a year and I’ve never felt this torn apart. She told me she no longer loved me. I saw this coming and I tried as hard as I could to keep our relationship together—and honestly I think that’s probably what tore us apart… I’ll explain.

We had a really good relationship. We were interested in the same things: action movies (Resident Evil, Avengers, etc.), videogames (Zelda of course!), Indian food (every Thursday), fitness, television shows (Burn Notice, White Collar, and Alias), and a lot more. I tried to help her with her school work as much as I could and she did cute things for me too, such as cooking me crepes or French toast in the morning.  
You and I both know the list of the good things could go on indefinitely--I’m in love with her.

However, there were issues like every relationship. We both had two majorly conflicting character traits.
 
I have an “anxiety disorder,” which is likely inherited from my father who tried to commit suicide a few years back, so I get extremely paranoid about whether the person I’m dating truly loves me. My paranoia and anxiety is also probably the result of my flawed family life. My mother was an alcoholic and my dad had an affair. He had two children with another women (a stripper actually), and he abused me childhood naivety; namely, he said that this situation was normal and that I shouldn’t tell my mother. For two years I knew about my dad’s affair while I watched my mother’s heart be slowly ripped into pieces as she wondered why my dad was becoming more distant by the day. She eventually found it and it wasn’t from my mouth. I regret that every day. Anyway…

Unfortunately, my paranoia was exacerbated by one of her quirks, specifically her distant and unaffectionate attitude. That is, she never gave me any sort of affection, which she said was the result of her depression and self-confidence issues that I will not go into for the sake of her privacy. I always said love you first. I cuddled with her. I kissed her and held her. And she never reciprocated; she never showed affection in return. She told me she didn’t like that I was affectionate because she didn’t like being touched by anyone (which is odd because for the first month and a half she was extremely affectionate).

Our two quirks collided obviously. Every day I became more and more paranoid. But I loved her, so I tried to conceal my paranoia as best as I could. In fact, it was the first time in my life that I could actually sort of contain it. I loved her and she hated my paranoia, so I tried so desperately hard to not be paranoid. Even though we had our issues and she still told me that she wanted to be with me. She said that if she couldn’t be in a relationship with me, then she wasn’t meant for anyone. She wanted to marry me and she actually designed our floor plans for our house one day. This was two weeks before our break up.

reddit, I no longer have passion or motivation to do anything anymore. I have an internship starting in 5 days at a Fortune 20 company and I need my motivation back. I’m going down the wrong road at this point. I don’t care about anything and I can’t be around anyone without being on the verge of breaking down and crying. I’m probably overly sensitive, but I’ve never felt this way about anyone. Maybe someone could share some advice."
ugv3h,2,2012-06-02,I've put my education at risk and I want to fix it. Can r/AskReddit help me improve my future?,BrewerHimself,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ugv3h/ive_put_my_education_at_risk_and_i_want_to_fix_it/,"Hello there, r/AskReddit! I’ve landed myself in a tight spot and I’m looking for some advice. I’ll start with a little bit of background on myself.

I spent two years studying abroad in Canada (I’m American) and I had no success. I partied too much and made excuses for my poor grades. I have a similar history with high school, but I’m ready to get serious about my future.

I recently moved back in with my mom in Florida. She moved here from North Carolina a little over a year ago and I haven’t spent much time here so I don’t have any friends. I’m working a full-time retail sales job right now that is satisfying, but not totally fulfilling. I’ve been strongly considering taking a year off from school and using this year to become a better programmer, but I’ve realized that I don’t want to be *just* a programmer. I want to be an algorist. I want to work on hard problems that require a deep understanding of algorithms and data structures, as well as discrete and combinatorial mathematics. I could study these things on my own, but it seems that most reputable employers who are looking to fill such roles are interested in a degree, which I don’t have.

Going back to school is still an option, but I’m concerned about the situation I’ve put myself in. Based on my high school and collegiate records, no university in their right mind would accept me and -- to be completely honest -- I don’t blame them.

Community college is one possible solution. I could go for two years and then transfer to a university. The problem with this is that the CC here in Jax is really lacking in the areas that I want to study (computer science and discrete mathematics). They offer basic math courses (through elementary differential equations) and no computer science courses -- only introductory programming courses. I’ve been programming for a number of years now and, while I have much to learn, I certainly have no business in an introductory course.

Furthermore, I’m looking for internships during my college experience and getting one as a community college student would be very hard. This leaves only the summer between my Junior and Senior years. I’d like to think that, with hard work, I could have a decent chance at finding an internship for my Sophomore-Junior summer.

With that said, I have some questions for you, r/AskReddit:

* With such a sad record of failures and laziness, how can I avoid a community college and get into a university? The selection for classes is greater at a university and will allow me to get started on courses related to my major much earlier than I could at a CC.
* What is the best way to work while going to school full-time? Should I search for a part-time retail job making minimum wage, try freelancing, or something else?
* How can I find the time to study enough to get good grades, work enough to make a decent living, and still be able to work on my personal projects?

I'm off to bed for now. I have work in the morning, but I'll be sure to check this thread and respond to as many questions and comments as possible before I leave for work."

If you are still reading you should know that I'm a pro-am cat juggler, a car nut, tech junkie, gamerish, and a hacker in training. I'm going to school for IT, more specifically network admin/security and my internship is in the same. I love good beer/wine and want to get into home brewing.

ugtbh,4,2012-06-02,IAMA College StudENT Who Unfortunately Has To Stop Smoking Trees. My Story of StudENT To Student Along With Questions I Propose To Anyone,FalloutForever,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/ugtbh/iama_college_student_who_unfortunately_has_to/,"My Story, (I have been trying to write this IAMA for awhile now so hopefully someone will read it)

To start, I am afflicted with depression as well as a high level of social anxiety so writing this has me really feeling vulnerable because I do not know how people will react to (if even read) this IAMA. 

So I am a college Sophomore that is studying engineering. I began smoking trees about a month into school after experimenting with alcohol/ tobacco (Cigars mostly). I found that trees really helped me deal with my social anxiety and depression better then any other medication I have taken.

Because trees allows me to be more outgoing and less self conscious I gained many friends and friENTs in my first year of college. I will without a doubt say that my first year of college has been the best year of my life so far because of the many positive experiences I have had with and without trees.

There is much more I want to say but I feel as if people will not be interested in my somewhat boring life so I will move on to why I need to stop the thing that brings me great joy and relief.

For me to get a job at a well-respected, high paying engineering firm I will without a doubt take drug tests. I could of had an internship this summer at a very respected, multi-billion dollar company except that I would have had to take a hair folical test. I was told that I had been accepted for the position because of cancellations of others and I would be able to work at the company over the summer. Unfortunately I had done large amounts of research into the company and confirmed they do hair tests so I was had to decline the offer. When I finished the phone call I immediately thought I had missed a golden opportunity to start my career of on the right foot. I still feel this way.

So for the sake of my potential career as an engineer (which I don't really want to be but it is the only job with substantial income that I don't resent) I am stopping my trees smoking this Sunday.

If it were not for drug testing, I feel I would be a productive member of society while also smoking trees. I mean, I do very well in school, 3.5 GPA, I follow every state and federal law with exception to speed limits and marijuana prohibition, I try to help those around me when possible. Why is it that I cannot smoke an herb that provides me relief from my (in my point of view) very unimportant, un-special life.

Me stopping this Sunday will provide a sufficient amount of time for the THC to leave my hair folicas due to the fact I will have about a year before I have to take the hair test. (I have high metabolism, I take niacin, I get buzz cuts every 2 months ect...) But me stopping this Sunday will take something I love completely out of my life.

Since I have to stop smoking, I am going to try and become a major advocate for the legalization for marijuana. I feel that I am insignificant in this political world where pharmaceutical companies spend millions lobbying to keep marijuana illegal. A world where politicians can lose their credibility for trying to pass pro-marijuana legislation. A world where money has absolute power and the individual has little to none. I want the world to change, not just for marijuana, but for everyone. A world where the logical/ right thing to do is implemented over a company wanting to increase its profits by denying rights to millions

I was a sophomore college studENT, now I am a college student with the will to try and change at least one aspect of the world. I know that I am small in this world, but even small things can make an impact.

Questions:

1. How should I go about my pro-marijuana activism

2. What do you think of my story and viewpoints

3. Is there anyone else in my situation or one close to it

4. Feel free to comment on any part of my story, I will comment back. :-)

       (I am open to any response to this, I just hope some reads this because trees are an important part of my life and I would like feedback on my situation) 

Thank You In Advance,
      FalloutForever

ugpx6,1,2012-06-01,Engineering Females : Are you treated equally in your school's program?,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/ugpx6/engineering_females_are_you_treated_equally_in/,"I am not necessarily saying that I am not treated equally by anyone in the program at my school, and I am not saying that the men of /r/engineeringstudents are all sexist - I'm sure the vast majority are great people. :)

However, I have dealt with many men assuming I'm less intelligent, less interested in the subject, or less of an asset to have in a student project because I'm female. 

I will digress to say that I am an incredibly hard working student, as hopefully most engineering students (yourselves included) are. My claim that negative behavior from peers concerns gender, previously an assumption of mine, has been proven repeatedly to me since joining the department, despite my optimism.

My experience with men in the engineering department, from peers to professors, has been overwhelmingly negative thus far. Is this a trend at most universities, or am I alone in feeling this way?

I apologize if I seem like I'm on a soapbox here, but after a particularly hard day at an engineering internship, I came home to find an opinion on a circumstance last fall - essentially, an exception made was associated with me being female, not that I deserved it. My work ethic was also under scrutiny. This type of feedback is incredibly discouraging in a field that is already trying enough on its own."

Eventually I was offered an engineering internship (not at either of those companies unfortunately) at a company that machines aerospace parts for Boeing, Airbus, Spirit etc. and they gross about 40-50 million a year.  So far, most of my work has been focused around data entry and entering part numbers for orders so that they can give a company a bid. From what I can tell they dont seem to have a large in house engineering department. Nothing I've done so far has really had anything to do with STEM stuff and I havent had to use my brain at all really yet. **My question to other aspiring aerospace engineers, is what were your internship experiences in the industry like?

13,499 subscribers so far, a community for 2 years.

Just over a month ago, rileyxradio (a modteam member who MUST write a book one of these days), [did a great piece on](http://redd.it/sv46z) the subreddit /r/frisson.  I highly recommend a revisit to this place that's dedicated to the goosebumpy sensation you get during ""epic moments of a song or the climax of a movie.""  By the way, frisson?  Not to be confused with the *pee shivers* or *poophoria* - totally different things.

Today we explore a community based around a similar concept - music that speaks to the soul and lets the body act accordingly.  Where frisson had a larger approach (all forms of artistic production), the focus of futurebeats is razor sharp - just experimental beat music.  And where frisson is all about the shivers, futurebeats covers the emotional and sensory spectrum.  Elation, relax or chill, hyper energetic, fight or flight, soothing, it's all there!

Let's visit /r/futurebeats in today's Subreddit Breakdown!

* futurebeats is the place where experimental beat music gets all the attention.  Maybe some of the artists are well known, maybe some are redditors &amp; are brave enough to share.
* what I find most interesting is how easy it is for the music on futurebeats to get right to your core.  Sure, no one could possibly argue that Ke$ha makes the best music, but often vocal tracks get in the way.  I can't explain it other than this, it's not what Thom Yorke sings about, but it's the way he uses his voice as an instrument.  The stuff on futurebeats does this really well - music that gets inside you and demands an emotional or physical response.
* finally, there's the experimental angle.  Each song tries new and creative things, new rhythms, new instrumental sounds that often don't follow conventional scales or keys. The result is mixed, some hits, some misses, but never a predictable formulaic tune.  It's the cure for those bored with music!

We salute /r/futurebeats for their contribution to reddit.com, making it better, one booop, whoosh, thump thump, bweeep at a time.  For over 2 years this place has been providing excellent creative music to redditors.  The moderators work very hard to foster a supportive environment and by the large number of submissions and subscriptions, I'd say they're doing a great job.  For some redditors, *this is the their favourite subreddit...* so let's allow the modteam explain it all!

&gt;How is futurebeats different from /r/electronicmusic, or any other musical subreddit? What makes it unique?

&gt;&gt;FRONTCANNON:  Our All-Time top post is porn, so that's one thing :D To understand what r/futurebeats is you first need to know how it came to be. This subreddit was created by logosfails as a safe haven for the refugees from r/dubstep, whose sound started to become more and more aggressive and Americanized, which left the people who were more into the darker, 'dubbier' and experimental sounds of dubstep without a subreddit to post their Electronic bass music to. r/futuregarage was created because of similar reasons, so r/fb and r/fg are basically sister subreddits. 

&gt;&gt;r/futurebeats in general works as a catch-all subreddit for 'experimental and forward-thinking beat music', we love stuff that falls between genres, is difficult to define, the oddball tunes of Electronic music, no matter when or where they're from. At first this meant mainly what came out of the UK (see r/futuregarage), but with the rising popularity of this beat music we now get stuff from bedroom producers all over the world, the absolutely huge LA bass scene, Japan, you name it :D 

&gt;&gt;By refusing to limit us to one genre, the quality and variation of music you find here is unparalleled. This is my honest opinion. We're by far not the only musical subreddit that does it, but we are the most popular (for Electronic music, that is). This has made us many people's favourite subreddit, introducing people to music and tunes they've never even knew were a thing. I've heard futurebeats being described as 'electronic nerd music', when the normal stuff gets to formulaic or anything that just about even has a formula doesn't do it anymore ;) I've been on here for a little less than 2 years now and r/fb remains my primary source of new music, though the times that I could check out every single tune on here are long gone. We mods try to keep the quality up, I do a monthly Mix Series where we feature the community's favourite tunes of that month (including some personal tunes here and there) and the community feedback has been overwhelmingly good (we sometimes get modmail with people thanking us just for the subreddit, which is awesome, personal validation is always nice :D - so people, message your mods from time to time, they'll appreciate it), which makes me glad to be part of r/fb and its modteam :)

&gt;&gt;SICKLAUGHTER:  I come to the style of futurebeats music through an adoration of hip hop which led my ears to eclectic beatmakers such as Dibiase, Mux Mool, Flying Lotus etc. From there, if one takes an aerial perspective, you find that the loosely defined genre of ""futurebeats"" is a full on collision of many different styles. Multiple roads of musical evolution crashing headlong into one another and getting lost amidst a dense spider webbish spaghetti junction of beat experimenation. This gives it a very diverse fan base as well as sonic output. You can hear all manner of genre bending aural experimentations under the ""futurebeats"" umbrella. Which is awesome.

&gt;&gt;THE_MUSIC_DIRECTOR:  r/futurebeats is great because it's not genre specific. It celebrates that ""future state of mind,"" which is something that I can't really describe, but I can tell you that it can be heard in tracks that are as different as [Can - Vitamin C (1972)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a1NhRbNJ_Y), [Cannibal Ox - Scream Pheonix (2001)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HXpqYMQ5l4), and [Hudson Mohawke - Thunder Bay (2011)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvKAr9qaI1I). All of these songs are from different genres and time periods, but they are all rhythmic and experimental, and thus are welcomed in r/futurebeats. In fact, r/futurebeats is the only music subreddit I even subscribe to besides r/futurepopmusic, and this is because it encompasses so much more.

&gt;&gt;SIRMARCUS:  We’ve got the tagline “Experimental beat music”, which mostly means the love-child of hip-hop beats and electronic beats, but the beautiful thing is the nature of the word “experimental” invites different sounding songs from any side of the musical spectrum. Before I found futurebeats I was pretty bored with music, I tried to get into “experimental music” but found it hard to stay entertained. The genius of futurebeats is adding “beats” to the idea of “experimental music”, which leaves you with the magic of “unique fun music”, a line you can sell to anyone.

&gt;What are your favorite ""futurebeat"" tracks or artists? What posts from the sub are your favorite?

&gt;&gt;FRONTCANNON:  Well, that porn was pretty good actually.. I all honesty, I really can't say. There are too many. But I have to make a small selection, so here goes (I'll try to use some very different tunes to showcase the variety I spoke of):
[Gramatik - The Drink Is Called Rakija](http://redd.it/ix9dg) You can definitely hear the HipHop influence here, this is a classic futureBEAT :D Lots of sampling, cutting and beat-repeating without getting glitchy, plus the second drop is just absolutely nuts. The album is free, go grab it!     
[Teebs - Verbena Tea (feat. Rebekah Raff)](http://redd.it/mg59b) This tune includes many 'typical' futurebeats attributes. Very hazy, lush synths, a minimal clap instead of a snare, a kick with lots of syncopation and a good low-end (bass). This on good headphones = bliss.       
[Kuedo - Glow (Clark Remix)](http://redd.it/ihebe)  This tune perfectly showcases what I mean by experimental and forward-thinking. I doesn't even have a beat, just lives off its sounds, very fragile yet so powerful. Headphones are an absolute must. When I first heard this my eyes started to water.. There are many other artists and styles out there, I'll be sure the other mods will introduce you to some of them :)

&gt;&gt;SICKLAUGHTER:  There are so many amazing artists out there, currently I've been listening to a lot of [Dimlite](http://redd.it/jyie5), [Soosh](http://redd.it/u7czo), [Shigeto](http://redd.it/miyxx) and this cat [Amai](http://amai.bandcamp.com/track/sun-among-midori).

&gt;&gt;KLITZKRIEG: One of my main pet projects for r/FUTUREbeats is to broaden awareness of where to find new music and how to support. That is why when I submit a link I always make a point to mention when an album is coming out and on what label. Posts to a typical music subreddit are simply a YouTube link of a song ripped from someone’s album. To keep our community from falling into a repost circle jerk we need to share more than just the song and title. We need to share how to get more. That’s why I started the [favorite sources of music.](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/futurebeats) The community has submitted their favorite record labels, blogs, publications and other music services. We keep it in a wiki so anyone can edit it if they feel adventurous. We’ve only done a couple sefl.posts asking for additions but the community has helped us make it very comprehensive. 

&gt;&gt; I could list favorites for days but I have to refer to our [TWO YEAR anniversary self.post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/futurebeats/comments/s9r58/rfuturebeats_just_turned_two_and_we_want_cakeday/) We asked our community to join us in a celebration of two great years of FUTUREbeats by posting THEIR favorites from the archives. They showed up in style and droves. Almost every track and artist on there is a favorite of mine.

&gt;&gt;SIRMARCUS:  I’m going to keep this simple and go with the very first “futurebeats” song I ever heard that made me who I am today, a song I still love more than every other song ever. [Gold Panda – You](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Su1wK7iCQfQ)

&gt;Are you involved in music in ""real life""? What do you do, play or otherwise worry?

&gt;&gt;FRONTCANNON:  I'm a DJ and just got started in production of Electronic Music, so yes, I'm heavily involved in music in real life, too. I'm also a drummer which may explain my focus and bass and beat music :D Regarding personal life, I'm a 19-year old dude from Germany who just got done with school and is now looking into getting into university for winter. I absolutely love introducing people to music, seeking out music (my friends even call my music 'Frontcannon-music') and listening to music. You generally never see me without my ATH-M50s on... If you want to get into Futurebeats, [my Mixcloud](http://www.mixcloud.com/Frontcannon/) has often proven to be a good starting point. Get digging, and thanks for the feature!

&gt;&gt;THE_MUSIC_DIRECTOR:  I am pretty involved with music, I played piano for quite a long time and then moved on to making beats and shit like that, but after a while I realized that what I was passionate about wasn't playing or creating music, it was supporting artists, listening to music, and really being a part of the atmosphere. I became a music director and DJ at a pretty well known college radio station for the past 3 years (that's the reason for my username) which allowed me to meet a lot of artists, get underground music before it comes out, and a bunch of other cool perks. College radio stations are the only radio stations where you'll hear this great music on the radio, so support them (sorry for the plug). I have, however, in the last three weeks, stepped down from my position in college radio and I have moved to a production internship at an advertising agency, in the hopes that I will be able to license music as a career. Interestingly enough this subreddit has come up twice in interviews.

&gt;&gt;KLITZKRIEG:  I fall on the side of a curator of music vs. creating it. I geek out on finding new music that sounds different from anything I’ve heard previously. Then I share it with others online or in person but never from a DJ booth.

&gt;&gt;SIRMARCUS:  Very much so, in fact /r/futurebeatproducers is for anyone as passionate as I am. Most of my projects are futurebeats + vocals, or as we futurenerds like to say: futurepop (see /r/futurepopmusic). The most fun I’m having now is a project about the year 2044, where futurebeats/futurepop is the main hype of the world. We have been getting real world artists to put themselves as artists in the 2044 world and it’s so much fun. We are currently turning it into an animation and live-show series and so far some of the bigger artists on board are of Tokimonsta and Sonnymoon. I can’t tease much more but if you stick around these parts of the web I’m sure you’ll find out more soon :D.

I am just ending my senior year of college, and it is supposed to be one of the happiest times of my life, but today that all changed.

 I have been with this guy for almost a year. It was a relationship unlike any I have ever had before. We clicked immediately. He told me he loved me before we even started officially dating. From the day we met (at an internship) we spent all of our time together until the summer ended and we went back to our individual colleges which are 3 hours apart.

Everything the past few months has been great. We had a little scare because he is going to grad school and he almost ended up across the country. But, by some stroke of luck he got into his dream school which by coincidence was only half an hour away from the place where I had accepted a job offer.

Since then we have been counting the days until we would be living near each other. We see each other about every other weekend, and for Memorial Day, we spent the long weekend together. We had an amazing weekend, a vacation on the beach and I left on Tuesday feeling like the luckiest girl in the world.

Wednesday he says that he is worried about graduation and wants to spend a lot of time with his friends and starts mentioning needing some space. Everything since Wednesday has been an awful rollercoaster of emotion culminating in him breaking up with me today.

I just feel like this is so sudden and abrupt, which is why I am struggling to deal with this. He had already purchased a train ticket for my graduation (One week from now). I had plans with his parents to drive down for his graduation. He bought me a day to make and bottle our own wine in Napa in July for my birthday. We bought concert tickets this past weekend for a concert in late July. All of these things seem to indicate he had no intention of breaking up with me and I am devastated. 

Reddit, where do I go from here?? How do I deal with this?? Everything I thought about my future, where I was going to live, how I was going to make friends, even my plans for graduation and the month break between school and work are destroyed.

TL;DR Boyfriend broke up with me with no warning 1 week before college graduation and 2 weeks before we would be living near each other. How do I deal with this shock?"

[Nice work on the blog folks. FT Alphaville is my go to blog for interesting economic news. Your curation of the comments section means that the discussion is invariably worth reading too.  Congrats on the London Whale reporting. How much further do you think it goes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy440?context=5)|Re: London Whale. I swear I've spent too much of my life thinking about it!! :-) It's so interesting to see how it gets reported on and discussed, especially when you think about how little JPMorgan has actually said.  In the meantime, lots of reporters try to get access to people who might know something more. I think Bloomberg had an interesting piece today for one: ""JPMorgan’s Iksil Said To Take Big Risks Long Before Loss"".  Re: Sovereign CDS Pricing widget. I often wonder that too! I mean, I know a lot about the data, but what meaning to derive from CDS in the current environment? Especially sovereign CDS, because there are a lot of banks out there who will buy CDS mitigate counterparty risk exposure to those sovereigns, pushing the spreads wider and wider.
[What's the Eurozone endgame? Despite all the apocalyptic talk, markets have had a fair amount of time to prepare e.g. the Greek's triggering CDS payments was the non event of the century.  The Sovereign CDS Pricing on the right hand side of the blog is looking fairly dire but I've always wondered what the best way to read them is. Any guidance?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy440?context=5)|The thing that fascinates me most is what this says about what regulators are up to with all that CDS data that they have access to. The fact that anyone could have seen market distortions and large volumes building up... and they have access to legal entity level info, so the concentration in the hands of one market player would have been quite visible.  I guess when I look at CDS spreads, I tend to look at them more relative to each other, and relative to their own time series, plus net notional and activity data. In isolation, they aren't that revealing, imo.
[A lot of financial market journalism seems to be driven by exploiting peer networks to provide an explanation of market moves. Currently there is a lot of leaning on the work of economists and analysts to do the quantitative sifting through data. It seems like the Alphaville team is also starting to back up the stories by doing their own quantitative analysis. Do you see this continuing? How important is a background in maths, economics and statistical analysis becoming for a journalist over having a large number of contacts? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy6fc?context=5)|I consider myself something of a data addict, and I think this influenced their decision to hire me. At least, I'm very much encouraged to do my own analysis. The thing about doing your own work with the data, or even lots of your own non-quantitative research (e.g. understanding a complicated legal case), is that it can take a lot of time. If you have a deadline, like newspaper journalists often do, it could be more challenging to pull off. That said, I'm sure it would be encouraged if agreed to in advance. Everyone likes having something unique. Alphaville is more flexible time-wise, which I really appreciate.  For myself, there's also this scary element to it because who do you have to check your work if you're on your own? Usually I try to call someone who's an expert in the area to talk them through what I did to see if they think I missed something. It can really be nerve-wrecking though to put yourself out there so much!  As for a economics/stats/maths background, I think it helps if you have a history of reading other people's analysis and critiquing it. We have a lot of research thrown at us and it's important to question it, especially if you are saying that you agree/disagree with the thrust of it rather than just passing it on for others to decide on themselves.
[Izzy - Citi would argue that the differential yields on EZ sovereign debt in part reflects a contingent FX rate i.e. how the asset will appreciate/depreciate in the event of a eurozone break up. Do you give this theory any credence?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uygvn?context=5)|I think that makes a lot of sense.
[What did you do before the FT Izabella? I fricking love your take on things...so few other commentators think like you do, and are able to get it across like you. You need to replace Robert Peston.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uyfs8?context=5)|I have always been a financial journalist. Have worked at Reuters, and at Platts, CNBC.. mainly specialising in commodities. I have an Ancient History degree however, and have always been interested in early and ancient economies, on the basis that we are destined to repeat the mistakes of the past, over and over :)
[Let me ask you this Izzy....do you contribute to a pension? or is it bricks and mortar for the next 30 years? or is it....no contributions and spend it all on alcohol before fiat money blows up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uylmc?context=5)|I don't believe in pensions (for myself anyway). Also I'm pretty sure that by the time I'm 80 I'll still be working because technology will allow us to keep working for much longer. I don't have any investments.
 |As an ancient historian I'm going Roman on this one. My investment will be my children/descendents.. (let's hope they don't turn out like Joffrey in GoT)
[1\) To all of you: Do you have a code of conduct when it comes to dealing with bulletin board soldiers from GKP et al.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy9oc?context=5)|We have conduct rules for commenters -- such as don't be abusive -- and we do zap people from time to time.  But I will give you the old hand newspaper story that I share with my younger colleagues here, namely:  ""You get the letters page you edit"" -- ""If you print letter from people who write in green ink, the next post bag will be full of green ink.""
[2\) Izabella, I love your 'What is money' series and I think to myself sometimes how much time does it take to put the articles together / if you have help from others? They transcend many levels of financial thought and are just fantastic.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy9oc?context=5)|Very glad you like the posts. As to how much time they take.. it really depends on how inspired or passionate i am about the subject :) Sometimes I can just sit down and write a stream of consciousness and it turns out to make some sort of sense (or not, others will argue!), other times it takes a good week or so to research the idea and to bring it together. Generally, I think all of us are constantly developing story themes and ideas. That's the great thing about blogging.. You can just keep evolving and developing your story. It's very different to traditional journalism in that way. - Izabella.
[One last one, will Alphaville ever be behind a pay wall? Its my first point of call for economic news and is one of the few websites I couldnt live without.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy9yr?context=5)|Alphaville will be free for the foreseeable future. Indeed, I'm not sure it would work in its current form behind a paywall.  Thanks for reading us mjpbol.
 |There are absolutely no plans for Alphaville to go behind the pay wall. In fact, the trend, if anything, has been the reverse. It used to be that our newsletters were for FT-subscribers or Cut-subscribers who paid a small fee (that was less than the full FT fee). We reversed that a couple of months ago and now you just have to be registered to get those. Registering is free.
 |In the future, it may well be the case that Alphaville requires registration to read posts. And again, registration is free, and it then allows you to get things like the newsletters. The upside for us of registration is that we get to stay free while having a better proposition for advertisers because they know a bit more about what type of people read Alphaville.
 |So, in short, one day there might be a trade off where if readers want to continue to visit us (and we very, very much hope they do) we might need a minimal amount of input about who they are.
 |(Lisa)
[Thanks for all the work on the blog, it's one of the few that I subscribe to on a daily basis.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy6l1?context=5)|Speaking for myself - if I *wasn't* regularly getting flak (feedback, really) from market participants, I'd be worried. Didn't go into being a journo to smooth feathers really. Actually it's very rare that I personally get flak because someone in the market didn't want the story out there (that's more what PRs do). Since it takes two views to make a market, it's more that they want their point of view across as well.
[One question I had was how do you come up with the majority of your stories?  Do you tend to sit down and discuss/think of most of them yourselves, or are they driven by tips from market participants?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy6l1?context=5)|As to where we dig up all this stuff. For me it's about 80% starts with just seeing something and digging in and asking around about it. That other 20% does tend to come from tip-offs, but these can often be pretty brief by necessity. So you then go back to the 80%. Looking back, on some of the fave stories I've done/broken on AV, the Finnish collateral stuff, ELA, all the Greek PSI ding-dong - these tended to start with initial tips and then grew from there.
[On the same note, if you're writing something controversial/that people would rather not see picked up in the MSM, do you get much flak from market participants? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy6l1?context=5)|Joseph 
[What happened in Iceland?  Has that country paid back what it owed after the banking collapse in 2008? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uyjrt?context=5)|[Link to www.imf.org](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2012/cr1291.pdf)
 |Actually this might be a good opp for me to exorcise a little bit of macro tourism that's been bugging me...
 |OK, it's really important to remember that Iceland, the sovereign, never defaulted in 08. They're back selling dollar bonds now and everything. (You sometimes see the argument for Grexit citing Iceland as a great precedent. Nope.)
 |Iceland did decide that some its banks' liabilities were just too much to take on to the sovereign balance sheet, which is fair enough. But you also have to remember that Iceland also kept up talks on eg. Icesave.
 |The other thing... they got capital controls right, which made the devaluation of the currency a lot easier to manage. (Joseph)
[Izy Is it just me or does the whole world feel the same? Your intellectual power is simply phenomenal. You see stuff and understand concepts that make my eyes revolve in their orbs.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uyhbr?context=5)|Thanks that's very kind. My general rule is to look beyond the obvious (but on the right side of the conspiracy line). If the story is big and breaking now.. I'm kind of bored by it already. I look for clues to what the next big story may be. I love thinking deeply about topics as well as out of the box. I also don't want to waste people's time with noise. :) - Izabella.
[I have notice a trend for alphavillans to 'graduate' to the main paper over time. Is that what you are all aiming for or do you see AV as a place to stay for a while?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy4md?context=5)|Of course, those Alphavillains who have gone on to the FT (Sam Jones, hedgie correspondent, Helen Thomas, now over at mining, Neil who's Australia correspondent and Tracy Alloway, US Banks) are doing really well.
 |But, just speaking for myself (it's Joseph here), the funny thing is - there really is no career structure on AV. It's too new. (Even though Paul started this way back in 2006...) I think the rest of the media still hasn't really got its head round the idea that blogs - in general - AREN'T a 'beginners' level' for journos. Skill sets, etc. very different. (Joseph)
 |Ehwatay, thanks for this question.  Historically Alphaville has often functioned as a springboard to another job on the paper.  And hey, nothing wrong with that.  But the site continues to mature, and more than at any point since I joined, the team is comprised of bloggers who really want to keep blogging for as long as we can get away with it.  Writing for a blog and reporting for a paper are very different, and the people whose bylines you see on Alphaville these days have a strong preference for the former.  -- Cardiff.
[Does FT management get pissed that a free blog on their website is more popular with the average city types than their more traditional behind the pay wall articles?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy7iw?context=5)|Thanks jdmerts for bringing forward the day when we might be forced, spitting and kicking, behind the wall!  Seriously though, there's lots of stuff behind the FT.com paywall that is hugely popular with City readers (I see the figures.) Higher-ups here accept that Alphaville relies on being a  member of the wider (free) financial blogosphere for its style and tone. And it's also acknowledged that we drive plenty of readers to the main site. That said, there is pressure on us to be more profitable -- and i suspect that will lead to us introducing compulsory registration at some stage. But we will remain free.  (Murphy)
[How do you get along with Martin Wolf?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uyheo?context=5)|Martin? Great fun. Always feel like my IQ's gone up 10 points after speaking with him. (Joseph)
 |I can report that Wolf is excellent company, if a little scary. Brain on legs. I particularly like the way he's always ready to engage online -- which not all traditional newspaper columnists are prepared to do...  (Murphy)
[Regarding Greece, do you suspect Germany and the other powers that be have a secret plan for them to exit the Euro? For example, Greece leaves and then steps are taken reinforce the remaining Eurozone. At the moment there is no sign of such steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy4vh?context=5)|All right, trade secret - German officials are just the *worst* for leaking stuff. Don't ever get them to plan a surprise birthday party.  Sure, there must be contingency plans by now. That's what bureaucracies do. Make plans and file 'em away. But a secret, unified plan (which the Germans wouldn't leak)? It's not even clear that one end of the Troika knows what the other is doing or what the drivers for Grexit are.  But being bureaucracies, you've got to remember how much inertia is simply built in to the Troika's programme by now, two years on from starting it all. The IMF staff for example was talking about a longer adjustment period for the bailout at the last review, despite all this poker-playing between the Troika and Syriza at the moment. (Joseph)
[How do you guys deal with the whole ""dying industry"" thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uyoso?context=5)|Yeah, terrible shame what's happened to banking. (Joseph)
[Is he the most respected person inside the FT?  If not, who is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uyxhj?context=5)|I don't mind telling you that every Wolf column gets huge online traffic.  But there are some other cracking writers -- and on other subjects.  Think of Lucy Kellaway, or Nigel Andrews on film. he's in a league of his own.
[How well does the daily traffic on FT Alphaville correlate with the global economic uncertainty?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy98d?context=5)|There's clear correlation Iksjwww. In the early days, our traffic grew in clearly defined steps: first big M&amp;A, then things like the Socgen rogue trader, and then into the Crunch. Nowadays, we get a swell of new readers with things like The JPM Whale and each escalation of the eurocrisis. One point to add:  traffic spikes higher when equity price fall and credits widen, rather than the other way round.  (Murphy)
[For each of you:  If you could only choose one economist to steer the US' fiscal and monetary policies through the recession/depression who would you pick?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy46c?context=5)|You mean like a supreme fiscal overlord and Fed chairman to boot? Hmm. Gosh. Well, I personally like Scott Sumner's work on NGDP level targeting... He blogs over at [Link to www.themoneyillusion.com](http://www.themoneyillusion.com) by the way. (Joseph)
[I guess I worded it wrong - I meant a particular economist's policy prescriptions....but that'll do ;\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy803?context=5)|AndyRooney, good question.  Of course, the job you're describing -- a kind of fiscal and monetary policy Grand Poobah -- doesn't exist.  But if I had to choose an economist whose outlook and views probably closest mirror my own, it would be Karl Smith (of Modeled Behavior fame).  This is fodder for a longer conversation and I don't agree with him on everything, but I'd want someone who not only would favour more stimulative policy now, but who also understands collateral effects both in financial markets and in households.  That's Karl, and he also was first to write about the household formation and durables depreciation trends that I'm keeping an eye on.  And I'm mostly on board with Karl's longer-term structural views as well -- on immigration, especially (which, yes, I view as a huge fiscal issue), but also his generally liberal-tarian outlook.  
[Given the horrifying performance from many schools of economics in predicting the crisis (not to mention the often ridiculous prescriptions they still have the temerity to toss off as if they made sense, not least in America but particularly in Europe\), it's perhaps unsurprising that alternative schools are seeing the light of day even in academia for the first time in a while.  How has the emergence of reality-based economics, such as the Minskian schools of Steve Keen's circuit theory and Warren Mosler's modern monetary theory, changed Alphaville's coverage of the ongoing crisis?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uyfkk?context=5)|I'll speak for myself, but to me the most interesting development in the last few years relates to the importance of the money-like properties of safe debt.  There's about a half-dozen economists and strategists doing great work on this (Singh, Pozsar, James Sweeney, Perry Merhling, a few others), or you can read any of AV's posts on the matter.  I'd also recommend Izzy's writings on MMT and, recently, on gold.  -- Cardiff.
[Lisa - how much of a cultural shift was it moving from Markit to the FT?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy3mm?context=5)|Pretty big. I had a number of different jobs at Markit. The first one I did was CDS Portfolio Compression, which meant I had a lot of banks as clients. It was very high pressure.
 |Then I was in the Credit Data team, and then finally in a kind of hybrid role. In the last role, I got to work with new colleagues from Wall Street on Demand (that Markit acquired) as well as the economists, who I'd never worked with before. Also, I started speaking to journalists about the dataset... which ultimately led me to Alphaville.
 |I knew zero about how journalism works before I started at the FT. It's been interesting learning about it! Alphaville is great in that you have a lot of flexibility to pursue topics that interest you.
 |If I had to summarise it though, it felt a lot like moving from the sellside to the buyside. You know, instead of hanging up and then swearing, I can swear and then hang up. (Just kidding, I'm nice really.)
 |(Lisa)
[What is Alphaville's current thoughts on the US debt ceiling deja vu? Without getting too much into politics, do you find a situation in which the Republican party holds the debt ceiling hostage again this year to score political points in an election year a possibility? If so, what might that imply for the US with respect to potential credit rating revisions and/or other negative impacts on the economy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uyi8i?context=5)|I think the most likely outcome is simply that Congress, in the lame duck session, will decide on another temporary postponement until the new Congress (and possibly new President) has taken over in the new year.  But make no mistake: I'm worried about this, and about the rest of the fiscal cliff issues.  The potential for a mistake is very high, and lame duck sessions make for notoriously precarious political environments. -- Cardiff.
[The blog roll is all very good, but who do you actually read first in the morning? Do you split it and discuss? Or do you have a list of tabs &amp; sites you look at individually?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uynqt?context=5)|Praxis, don't have a typical morning, but it's always some mishmash of whatever people are linking to on Twitter, the morning papers, catching up on earlier FTAV posts from London and Geneva, as many analyst research notes as we can get through, and in my case a handful of bloggers that I consider must-reads (Marginal Revolution, Felix, Econbrowser, Modeled Behavior, a few others).  -- Cardiff.
[Cheers Cardiff! anyone else?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uz05y?context=5)|Joseph here! It's funny being in NY because your mortal enemy is the time difference with European markets.
 |One of the first thing I like reading is what I guess you could call the 'practitioner' finblogs - so that's John Hempton, TED, Cassandra does Tokyo, Condor Options, Distressed Debt Investing, and loads more. It helps that they're all tweeting as well. The academics (the ones CG mentioned, a few others - Scott Sumner, the underrated British econ bloggers).
 |Loads and loads and loads of research, obviously. I do read it all.
 |And then... scouring the FT and the rest of the comp. As a journo, I'm usually reading not just to get info but look for good writing. And to kick myself when someone's got a story I missed.
[Ty for the reply. the blog network you link to in the right hand column...do you find it increases your readership or is it because you think they are genuinely good blogs? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uykzi?context=5)|It's a mix.  Most are blogs we visit regularly.  A small number are there as favours.  An important portion of our readership comes from other blogs, so we are more than happy to reciprocate. (Murphy)
[What's it like for European elites to watch the euro project collapse? Are there still many policymakers who don't understand the fundamental flaws of the currency union?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uyjyu?context=5)|That time when the European Financial Stability Facility was going to sell ersatz sovereign CDS thingies was pretty wacky. (Wait, are they still doing that?)  As for those policymakers... “We all know what to do, we just don't know how to get re-elected after we've done it.” - Jean-Claude Juncker  I still think that the whole idea of pay-as-you-go CDS is pretty insane. A lot of the structured CDS, e.g. ABX and the tranches thereof, are/were like that. They pay out with each little non-payment.  As for the European elites, I'm going to cross my fingers and hope that some of their staffers have a clue at least.
[What is your view of the really pessimistic, end of the world goldbugs/tin food people that contribute to the comments?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uya7s?context=5)|I'm ok with them, so long as they can write well and/or entertain us.

[Imagine there is an internet attack on the Financial Times because someone doesn't really like salmon, and your website is down.

[Correct me if I'm wrong, but it is my understanding that you think the flow of money out of China is an under-reported story, most notably compared to the problems in Europe.

[How are finance company PR's responding to Blogs, Twitter and other social media. Do they engage or pretend it's not their?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uy7a1?context=5)|I think they are working hard to catch up -- but you really would not have wanted to start from their position.

[2\) What percentage of your inspiration for articles comes from the City vs your own interests vs the blog-o-sphere?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uyocs?context=5)|Billygreene -- fair question, but really quite difficult to answer. it varies.  If something is a rumour and its important and we think we can verify it, we will do that. But as financial regulation has tightened it becomes increasingly difficult for journalists to verify things, since everyone in your industry has become paranoid about information flows.  It's all subjective, but sometimes we do say:  ""This is what we hear is/has happened. But the information remains speculative.""  Also see the ""raw"" definition during a markets Live session.
[What lessons do you think have been drawn from the FT Tilt launch?

But my line throughout this recovery is that things were never as good as we thought in the best of times (early this year), but also never as bad as we thought in the worst (last August).  This has been a steady, too-slow recovery that hasn't jumped to above-potential growth yet.  Little has changed. -- Cardiff.
[I guess I have a question about financial reporting in general.  A lot of financial advice revolves around looking in the long term due to the emphasis on using the stock market to plan for retirement.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uflwl/iama_reporter_on_the_financial_times_alphaville/c4uz5vi?context=5)|I think this is 100% true -- So much financial media -- especially broadcast media -- is focused on short-term movements, as though the only people needing commentary and advice are day traders. I think the longer term advice more people need is difficult to project on TV. (murphy) Honestly I think it's because the news networks are committed to going on air every day. If you only talk about the longer term, you'd have to wait a long time for stuff to move, then you'd analyse and talk about that, then you'd have nothing to say tomorrow, right? I remember when Jim Cramer was taken to task by Jon Stewart on the Daily Show for some of the advice he'd given. Part of his response was that ""it's entertainment"". Worth keeping that one in mind... Ideally, imo, reporting is a mix of examining short term and long term trends. But there are a lot of people who are in jobs with deadlines and they have to write something or they won't get paid. That's the reality.

By November the bonds had become a major cause/casualty of the freeze in interbank markets (in their capacity as collateral).

The only catch is that I don't turn 21 until later in the summer, so 21+ bars and clubs are out for the timing being. Which totally sucks, because I'm really excited to hit the gay bars. :-)

Is there anyone out there in WeHo or nearby who would want to show the ropes to a lonely newbie? I'm kind of intimidated by the scene here, so a companion or a few might make the transition a bit easier!"

I don't have any other related engr. work experience (interships/co-ops, etc.) other than a QA position at my dads company years ago and my gpa is mediocre (2.7 due to being shitty at circuits but made deans list a bunch of times), however I have a pretty nice resume with an impressive list of projects (some of which got high honors/awards). I have sent out my resume and cover letter to roughly 30 or so different companies and have only gotten 3 interviews out of it. 1 of them was for a manufacturing position which I never heard back from (im an ME), one was from a huge corp. which is flying me out for an final onsite interview next week (I did a few phone interviews with them already), and the third was for an internship that I had originally thought was paid (craigslist post just said: Internship, negotiable based on experience) however it turns out it is unpaid.

I had my final interview for the internship today with the CEO of the company who informed me it is an unpaid internship but it will turn into a full time job. He told me the internships there are like a long interview and usually it is 3 months, but for me they will hire me after two months, though I dont know if he tells this to everyone or really likes me lol. Now the company is a real small company with only like 4 engineers on staff where the team does literally everything up to manufacturing (theory, design, prototyping, testing, they got a full warehouse and machine shop but no technicians so the engineers build the prototypes themselves) so I would get a lot of cool hands on experience and it seems like a perfect fit for me. He offered me the job and asked me to start on Monday which I agreed too, but now I am kind of regretting it because I need to pay rent and shit, so what do I do?

I am hoping that I will get a full time offer from the big corporation after my on-site interview next week, but would rather have the job at the small company. Do you guys think I would be able to ask the place I am interning for to counter the offer (assuming I get one) if they want me to stay there? This is why I am thinking I should do the unpaid internship because by the time I would get an offer I'd have been working there at least a week or two so they will see that I am a good worker and honestly I would rather stay in my city than have to move halfway across the country to a place I never want to live. However i have also heard others on here blast un-paid internships as scams and even say they are illegal. So I really don't know. On one hand I take it and it's a good prospect, on the other I don't and I am back to square one of uncertainty and the sick feeling of 'im never gonna get hired by anyone, im gonna end up homeless, etc...""

Thanks for any advice.

I just wanted to share it with you guys. Hopefully it'll help someone else out too. 

I'm currently a sophomore in high school, wrapping up the school year. During my freshmen year, I received mostly B's with a few A's. They were decent grades, but I was not satisfied. I enterred sophomore year with a new motivation to succeed. 

Halfway through the year, they updated our GPAs and class rank. My grades had improved immensely. I had attained a GPA of 4.0 and my class rank had jumped up several ranks. it wasn't enough. I pressed on throughout the school year. Somewhere along the line, I had realized that I perform well in leadership positions, and others had realized it too. I ran for Student Council President for next year, and won the elections. I ran for Vice President of my school's South Asian Club, and won the election. I started my own club, a volunteer association, which I am extremely passionate about, and to which approximately 50 kids have signed up for. And I kept up with my grades. At the end of the school year, I have attained a final grade of an A in every class, save for one class in which my final grade was a B. 

I am improving in almost every aspect of my academic life. I signed up for tougher classes, confident that I can handle the workload. I am sending an application to volunteer for Doctors without Borders in their NYC office. I am applying for an internship at a local state Senator's office. 

Throughout it all, I am keeping one goal in sight: to get accepted into an Ivy League college. 

I had scheduled an appointment with my guidance counselor for this morning. Sitting in her office, we discussed how I was doing academically. I asked her how my college prospects were looking. She said, ""Well, you won't get into Princeton, but you'll have an easier time getting into Rutgers."" 

At first, that hurt. Guidance counselors send hundreds of kids to college every year. If she didn't believe I could get into an Ivy, then surely my chances were shot. I thanked her and left her office, without telling her that I planned on applying to Ivys.

However, now that I've had some time to dwell on it, I have realized something. My guidance counselor's omen was not a prediction, it was a challenge. She doesn't know about the fiery desire that burns inside me. She doesn't know the insane amount of drive, dedication, and passion that I possess. I know that within myself is the capability to exceed her expectations. And I'll be damned if I don't do all that is possible to exceed. 

Mark my words, wolves. I will dedicate every fiber of my being to prove her wrong. "

Maybe I'm letting my way-too-goal-oriented side get the best of me here. I mean, wouldn't most people kill to have these hours? I've already scheduled three vacations this summer and have plenty of time to write and volunteer now (which is something I didn't have time for when I worked full-time).

So, I guess my question is, if you were in my position, would you make the best of the situation or work your butt off to improve it? I am young and without many responsibilities, but I'm sure I'll want to be in a better position to start a family and/or buy a house in a few years. If I stay where I am, am I likely to regret it later? Or will I regret not making the most out of all this free time?

Thanks, Reddit."

1. The game is really hard.
2. The casual player is supposed to buy the items from the AH/RMAH.
3. Noone finds the good gear, all we see are threads where we learn that ""other"" people found the items and that they were purchased via the AH (and this comes from the more hardcore players, who actually post on a board, not the average player).
4. If you were blizzard and needed money for the servers, which you control, you could.. sell your own items.

Basically, they can create items out of thin air -&gt; sell them vs the best bids (for the hardcore group of people who will pay thousands of REAL dollars/euros to get the best gear -&gt; check how it worked in D2, with imports)
PLUS they could sell medicore items for the twenty-something average Joe, who finds MFing a chore. (for me all the fun is trying new classes builds - so I should make 5 characters at least -&gt; which are gear dependant)

I mean, are people from Blizzard really trustable now?


The same problem was with d2jsp (the biggest diablo2 trading forum), which had their own currency, called forum gold and noone really knew how much FG was there. D2jsp was like a central bank, that could easily abuse the market to earn real money (apart from the obvious selling of FG for currency; they could buy good items for FG and sell them vs currency/to shops).

I predict that this will be downvoted to oblivion because ""blizzard is good"", but we all see the game as it, where the only good thing are the dialogues between the minor characters, which were obviously made by someone else, or some intern; while the whole game feels either bad, or is made in a way to earn on the average player.
I mean, diablo2 was popular, because 'above casual' players could bot; here you (supposedly) cannot bot.. so people will either quit or use the AH. And if they are using the AH... they could buy items from blizzard itself. I have a felling that this is the way the game was designed.

I am an undergrad pursuing a degree in computer engineering at Grand Valley State University in Michigan.  I have done well so far, with a 3.9 GPA, and am fluent in English and Spanish and learning a few other languages, but even with any relevant qualifications, I am still worried about finding a career in the industry.

I have obtained a job at an electrical engineering design and manufacturing company nearby, where I  have been successfully employed as an embedded software engineer, and I am also being taught practical electrical engineering concepts as they apply to the projects I work on.  The job is amazing but I view it more as a stepping-stone to a long-term career.

Essentially, it is my dream to work at either Google, Intel, or Apple (me and everyone else, I know).  I applied for an internship at Google (on the Google Translate team) last year but was denied based on what I perceive as a lack of experience, as I am just now entering my Junior year and did not have the aforementioned job at the time.

My questions are as follows: 

-Does anyone here work at Google, Apple or Intel? If so, what advice can you give me to aid my in my pursuit of my dream job?

-What other companies offer desirable employment for computer engineers?

-Where is the biggest demand for CEs in the U.S. or Spanish-speaking countries?

-How difficult is it finding a job as a computer engineer in the U.S. with all the overseas programming jobs?

-Have you ever had the need to speak another language (Spanish?) on the job? I feel bilingualism is one of my most prized qualifications.

-On a daily basis, what do you computer engineers out there do? What does a typical day (if that exists) look like?

-What general tips can you give me as I finish my last few years as an undergraduate student looking for a career?

ui6ct,11,2012-06-03,Are all government IT shops sucky?  Is it better in the private sector?,sfrjack,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/ui6ct/are_all_government_it_shops_sucky_is_it_better_in/,"I was hired on as a desktop support technician about eight months ago with a federal government agency as my first job out of college.  Now during college, BS in CE minor CS, I worked with a non-profit for 20 months as an intern so this is not my first job per-se.  Before that I was in the military doing electronics repair.

At the non-profit, there were about 400 employees in the entire organization and there were eight IS folks not including the CIO.  There were three full-time and one intern each for the systems and the enterprise-apps/database side of the house.  I worked on the systems side and because of the small organization, I got a little taste of everything.  You name it: VMware, Netapp, Microsoft AD infrastructure, SCCM, application virtualization such as ThinApp, I lead a systems deployment where I changed 30-something users from thin-clients to full-blown desktops.  Additionally, there was a big emphasis on automation because of the small staff.  Further, I always felt that the IT staff there had a good idea of what they were doing.  I suppose they should since everyone on the systems side, other than me, was titled systems engineer.  

Now fast forward eight months and I absolutely hate my job with the federal government in a 1500 user organization with 15 doing desktop support.  Possibly relevant is that 12 of them are age 50+ and the other 3, myself included, are age &lt;30.  My impression is that most of them do not have technical backgrounds and have very outdated skillsets.  What I have noticed at my job is that there is zero accountability and a lot of my co-workers have zero or little prior IT experience.  My manager does not stand up behind me and kow-tows to the CIO’s whims.  During my first two weeks there, I was shadowing a co-worker and I realized this guy is a complete idiot and that this was not a place for me.

In one situation, while shadowing my co-worker, we were supposed to map a network printer since users cannot map one themselves, and he was completely surprised when I right-clicked the Add Printers icon and then did Run as.  The standard practice was to log off the user and then log on as admin which adds about 10-20 minutes easily in our environment.  He seriously had no idea that was there and afterwards he got mad at me because I was raising (customer) expectations.  That was not exactly what he said, but it was implied.  Hell, it could have been done remotely over the network too, but he had no idea that was possible either.

In an organization with 1500 users, I would think that there would be some form of network OS deployment even if it is something like RIS or heck, Ghost or Acronis images or something on the network.  Nope, we store “images” on HDDs and we have three older Dell Optiplexes without covers booting Ghost off a floppy that are to clone HDDs.  A lot of people won’t even share their HDD source drives because they are afraid of others messing up their copy so there is a lot of inconsistency.  At least one person still has their copy only up to XP SP2.

In a recent project, we had about four months to our initial Windows 7 deployment as a test, we are now two months past the deadline and have not successfully completed this.  Now the computers are imaged using SCCM from national using a local distribution point so I have no control over that.  There are known incompatibilities with certain enterprise apps and national explicitly warned us about it.  The project lead, who is also my office lead, waited until two weeks before the deadline to start on this and I had the systems for this staged headless on the network for at least 2 months.  All I have to say is that the lead completely dropped the ball and then left the thing to deflate.  Not only did he wait until 2 weeks before the deadline to start, he, nor his deployment team, did a functional analysis on the users who were to receive the machines so we had to recall about 2 dozen of the Win7 systems three weeks after the deadline.  Three weeks later and we have not yet managed to deploy all the 2 dozen Win7 systems we recalled.  The project lead has not been relieved of this duty, nor his office lead, position.  I have no confidence in this guy getting the project done in good order.  

I have worked with many of my co-workers and I often feel that they are afraid of command line.  When I asked someone why she always types “ipconfig /all,” when all she wants is the IP address, her response was “how else am I going to do it.”  In another case, I was troubleshooting a network issue and I told the person at the keyboard to do a nslookup and he asked me what that does and same for tracert.  

The CIO…what can I say about her.  She has no technical experience and I have no idea what her background is.  She seems friendly, and claims to have an open door policy, but I seldom see her in the office, so the door is mostly closed.  She once asked if I could build a database to organize 230,000 photos.  My first thought was yes, but I told her no because I do not have an experience building database aside from a few in MS SQL as homework and part of a senior project.  Additionally, I am not going to get paid for building and supporting the thing.  They pay me for desktop support, not system admin or engineer.  Further, I would not be confident in single handedly implementing a production DBS of that magnitude.  As I stated before, I would not be able to get much help or peer-review from my co-workers since many think Excel is a database.  My manager got upset at me when he learned I refused the CIOs project; he somehow had confidence that I could build the DBS and brought up how during the interview I mentioned that I built a MS SQL DB as part of my senior project.  My rebuttal was that it was not a production system and that I had peer-review and assistance and that a school assignment and a production system are vastly different tasks.  For one thing I did not have to design a user-friendly front end, I just interfaced with the DB using crude Powershell scripts; nevermind multiple user support and security.  He was noticeably upset when I suggested they find a consultant or an off the shelf solution.  I do not know what happened this this project.  

I have built a Openfiler and ESX box at work just to play around with, but no one else wants any part of them.  One luddite even asked me why I want to play with virtualization when it does not work.  I later found out he only played with Virtual PC back around 2006-7ish.  My NAS contains a bunch of Clonezilla images for the computers so I do not have to keep a bunch of HDDs around as source images.  

Hopefully you are still with me, I have written close a thousand words thus far.  I am now seriously starting to look for another job because in four months, I will get to my 1 year mark and get a pay increase.  Since I have not worked in private sector really, what can I expect?  Since business is typically profit driven, I kind of assume they have more competent staff on hand, or at the minimum they are more easily able to rid useless or incompetent staff.  Are other government agencies going to be the same way?  I do not feel it is fair to base my judgment of on one shop I guess.  I am looking for different kind challenge than what I am working with right now.

On one hand, I'm fairly certain my job is fairly stable.  Considering the other staff, I am probably going to pass probation which is up in 4 months.  The benefits are ok, health, dental, 401K, and potentially a pension, but after 6 months, my internship at the non-profit provided me with full health, including dental and vision, and covered all of the premium.  The job is mostly stressful because working with my co-workers is frustrating at times.  In private world, I'm guessing, there is no pension but I would, possibly, be paid more and it would be maybe more stimulating.  As of right now, annually, I get 160 hours vacation, 240 max carryover, in addition to 104 hours sick leave.  I'm going to guess private sector may not be so generous.  "

I'm sorry if this is not allowed, but I figured r/Jobs was the best place to ask this question. I recently made an oDesk account, and I haven't really done much on there. I have experience doing medical transcription and I speak/write fluent French. I was hoping to maybe do some transcription work through oDesk, but I am worried I won't get hired because I only have a med. transcription background.

If it helps, I'm getting my BA right now. I'm currently doing an internship (office type stuff for my local Chamber of Commerce).

I'm icesoldier, and I just graduated college. I still don't know what I'm doing with my life, since my illustrious Computer Science degree doesn't automatically provide you with a job offer if you have no internships, pet projects, connections to the industry, desire to sell yourself, or faith in your institution or abilities. But that's for my eventual post to /r/MLSG.

Anyway. I'm a music nerd with an eye for programming. My favorite band is [Hey Ocean!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prqzD27_T3U), which as bronies you need to be aware of. But I have odd preferences in music, which leads to [a wide variety in music genres in my collection](http://www.last.fm/user/bwicesoldier). I love [chiptune](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCx5fPtJtYs), and have dabbled in [making it myself](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVbxBIJ7j0E). I recently [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/ugs53/smile_smile_smile_for_tenor_and_famicom/) a pony-inspired piece that combined my love of chiptune with my love of singing, to modest reception.

I compulsively buy indie games, but I don't necessarily follow through playing them. I recently bought [Creeper World](http://knucklecracker.com/creeperworld/cw.php) from the [Because We May](http://www.becausewemay.com/index.html) event, and I love it to death. Somehow, it was my only purchase from the event. I think I'm beginning to learn that accumulating games I won't play is not something I want.

Oh, and I love peppering things in links. I guess I like proving my point, or leading others to cool things.

So let's have a chat! We can start in comments or PMs, and I'm usually on AIM at psyshock73. (EDIT: And I'm always on Twitter as @icesoldier.)"

The classes were taught in Scheme (Lisp dialect), C, and more C respectively, with a bit of assembly

I try and learn things on my own, the best/biggest non-school related work I've done is a really small version of Conway's Game of Life done in Python, C, and C++ (independent versions). The Python version I used to learn some GTK and added a GUI.

Anyway, I won a paid internship with a research group at my university, and I'm really worried about being unprepared.

uhwo8,1,2012-06-02,I've put my education at risk and I want to fix it. Can r/AskReddit help me improve my future?,BrewerHimself,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uhwo8/ive_put_my_education_at_risk_and_i_want_to_fix_it/,"Hello there, r/AskReddit! I’ve landed myself in a tight spot and I’m looking for some advice. I’ll start with a little bit of background on myself.

I spent two years studying abroad in Canada (I’m American) and I had no success. I partied too much and made excuses for my poor grades. I have a similar history with high school, but I’m ready to get serious about my future.

I recently moved back in with my mom in Florida. She moved here from North Carolina a little over a year ago and I haven’t spent much time here so I don’t have any friends. I’m working a full-time retail sales job right now that is satisfying, but not totally fulfilling. I’ve been strongly considering taking a year off from school and using this year to become a better programmer, but I’ve realized that I don’t want to be just a programmer. I want to be an algorist. I want to work on hard problems that require a deep understanding of algorithms and data structures, as well as discrete and combinatorial mathematics. I could study these things on my own, but it seems that most reputable employers who are looking to fill such roles are interested in a degree, which I don’t have.

Going back to school is still an option, but I’m concerned about the situation I’ve put myself in. Based on my high school and collegiate records, no university in their right mind would accept me and -- to be completely honest -- I don’t blame them.

Community college is one possible solution. I could go for two years and then transfer to a university. The problem with this is that the CC here in Jax is really lacking in the areas that I want to study (computer science and discrete mathematics). They offer basic math courses (through elementary differential equations) and no computer science courses -- only introductory programming courses. I’ve been programming for a number of years now and, while I have much to learn, I certainly have no business in an introductory course.
Furthermore, I’m looking for internships during my college experience and getting one as a community college student would be very hard. This leaves only the summer between my Junior and Senior years. I’d like to think that, with hard work, I could have a decent chance at finding an internship for my Sophomore-Junior summer.

With that said, I have some questions for you, r/AskReddit:

* With such a sad record of failures and laziness, how can I avoid a community college and get into a university? The selection for classes is greater at a university and will allow me to get started on courses related to my major much earlier than I could at a CC.
* What is the best way to work while going to school full-time? Should I search for a part-time retail job making minimum wage, try freelancing, or something else?
* How can I find the time to study enough to get good grades, work enough to make a decent living, and still be able to work on my personal projects?

I'm off to bed for now. I have work in the morning, but I'll be sure to check this thread and respond to as many questions and comments as possible before I leave for work."
uhvym,1189,2012-06-02,Don't Turn off the Webcam,0450AZ001,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/uhvym/dont_turn_off_the_webcam/,"Linh and I met in 2008. She was from a very small town in Washington with a population of less than five hundred. I was working my way through college as an event bartender in Portland. Linh’s cousin was getting married in Portland, and as fate would have it, the wedding reception was held at an upscale hotel on the Columbia River where I frequently tended to small wine and beer bars. I noticed her immediately, as I often notice women that I quickly convince myself are too beautiful to ever date someone like me. Eventually as the night went on, she made her way over to my bar and ordered a white wine. We talked for a while about Portland. I sweated profusely as I tend to do around girls like her. She would be spending the next two days in the city, and I took a few moments telling her about the most interesting sights to see and things to do in town. 

“Wow, you should just be my personal tour guide” she said, grabbing my arm and smiling. This happened to me so infrequently that I really had no idea how to react, so I just mumbled “Sure, what time?” and laughed nervously to hedge in the event that she was joking. “How about 10:30 tomorrow morning” she replied.

And so started my relationship with Linh. She was infectious, with a personality that was so innocent and warm. I immediately fell in love with her. There were a few issues that we would have to work through. She was still in Washington and I was finishing school in Oregon. Linh was Vietnamese with a very traditional father who would never approve of her having a white boyfriend. She lived alone in a house with her father as her mother had passed away several years earlier, so going to Yarrow Point to visit her was out of the question. She would come to see me every three weeks under the guise of a prestigious internship program. 

Being in a long distance relationship, we spoke on the phone and texted constantly. When high speed internet finally came to her small town in Washington, I surprised her with a webcam for her computer so we could have an even better means of long distance communication. In the back of my mind, I was always looking for ways to be with her as even after two years of dating I was paranoid a girl as beautiful as her would eventually find somebody better to share her life with. 

In 2010, Linh’s father passed away suddenly in his sleep from a heart attack. He was everything to her, and she was heartbroken. When she returned from Florida where the funeral was held and her father buried, she was all alone in the house where she had lost both of her parents. With Linh’s father deceased, she was open to finally allowing me to come to Washington to see her, which we planned on doing in a few weeks after my college finals.

One night during our usual bedtime conversation, Linh mentioned to me that her father had been acting strangely in the days leading up to his death. She explained that he had taken to checking up on her multiple times throughout the day and night, and scattering religious artifacts throughout the house. This behavior, she said, was highly uncharacteristic of him. Vietnamese culture and religion was something foreign to me, and at various points Linh had mentioned things like this that I normally wrote off as just being a little silly. She explained to me that being in the house alone without her Dad was emotional and may be playing tricks on her. She hated the feeling of being so alone. She told me that being able to see me on her webcam was the closest thing she had to family, and asked that I promise to never turn off the webcam. She meant the world to me, so I was happy to oblige.

A few days passed and it was now the Tuesday before the weekend when I would finally come to see her in Washington. We spent our bedtime webcam session excitedly talking about our plans and I dozed off with my head on the kitchen table in mid conversation. It had been a long day. When I woke up, I saw Linh sleeping on my screen and stumbled off to bed. 

At 3:00am, my cell phone begin to ring. Disoriented, I rolled over, took a look at the clock and knew it could only be her. She took great pleasure in waking me up in the middle of the night to let me know that she had just gotten a drink of water, or had an amusing dream. Anyone else would have gotten an earful from me, but her flirtatious giggle made me feel lucky to have my much needed sleep interrupted.

""I had a nightmare"" Linh gasped. ""...You danced in front of my friends"". She burst into laughter. 

""What are you doing up so late honey? You've got to work in the morning?"" I said.

""I was thirsty, and went downstairs to get a drink of water.""

""Great, well we really should go back to sleep, tomorrow is a big day"".

""Allllright"" she conceded, ""Hey by the way, don't forg----""

After a few crackles and a brief burst of static, the call disconnected. I hated Linh's phone, she had an old flip phone that dropped calls with no rhyme or reason at least three times a day. I held down the #1 on my own phone, my speed dial for Linh. No ring, straight to voicemail. 

I tried to call several more times, and each time it again went straight to voicemail. 

I was exhausted, and though I loved Linh to death, to be honest I just wanted to go back to sleep. My eyelids hung heavy.

A little annoyed, I decided to walk out to my kitchen for a quick drink of water. The two glasses of wine that I drank before bed had left me with a little bit of dry mouth. As I rinsed the glass and went to place it in the dishwasher, out of the corner of my eye I saw movement on the glow of the laptop perched on my dining room table. 

It was the webcam. Two fluffy brown paws were making a swimming motion directly in front of her camera. As I got closer I saw a close up of two grinning faces. One of that silly dog of hers, and the other of my giggling girlfriend, who knew that eventually after being unable to make phone contact I would wander out to the webcam to say goodnight. I wouldn't put it past her to turn the phone off on purpose to elaborately stage this scene. Me, standing in my underwear at 3am on a work night, half asleep staring at a girl and a puppy on a webcam. 

I waved goodnight, and she kissed the lens of the webcam and pulled away.

I froze.

I wiped my eyes and looked again.

There.

It's... standing in the corner of the room. It’s...

Staring at her. 

Wrinkled. Angry, twisted mouth. 

Hateful eyes. 

What the fuck. 

HATEFUL eyes. 

It’s watching her.

-------------------


Two hours later, I woke on the dining room floor. I had a ringing in my ears and a knot on the back of my head. I immediately knew what had happened. It wasn't the first time. Sudden, extreme stress has given me panic attacks and black outs a few times before. I had never felt such fear when what had happened came rushing back and I nearly had a second panic attack when my thoughts turned to Linh. I loved her more than anything in the world. It took me several moments to summon the courage the look in the direction of my laptop. When I finally did, the screensaver had long since turned on. I looked away from the screen as I flicked the touchpad with my shaking finger. It took me another two minutes to open my eyes. 

Linh laid sleeping in her bed. She looked so peaceful. Sleeping on her side, facing towards the webcam. As frightened and confused as I was, relief at her safety gave me a sense of comfort as I desperately tried to process what had happened. Maybe the wine had hit me harder than I thought. Maybe I slipped and fell on the slick tile floor, and it all had been a nightmare.

I stared at her. I loved her. Maybe more than even I realized. So peaceful and beautiful as she slept.

The light of her television danced across her room and illuminated the bed.
As I watched on, her hand began to move. 

Slowly. 

Unnaturally. 

She was sleeping but her fingers crawled across the bed slowly until they reached something. It was her cell phone. 

Her hand moved like a spider, fingers popping in several directions across the keys.

What the hell?

BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

My phone was vibrating.

""New Message: DON'T...""

BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

""New Message: TURN...""

BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

""New Message: OFF""

BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

""New Message: THE""

BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

""New Message: WEB""

BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

""New Message: CAM""

Complete terror set in as the messages came across the screen of my cell phone.

""New Message: DON'T...""

""New Message: TURN...""

""New Message: OFF""

""New Message: THE""

""New Message: WEB""

""New Message: CAM""

As I glanced back to my laptop, horror overcame me as slowly a shadow crept across the floor. Something was crossing in front of the television. Moving closer to Linh.

I told myself it was just her dog, right? The color drained out of my face when I noticed the puppy sleeping in the far corner of the room.

I picked up my phone and dialed Linh. I didn’t know what I would tell her, but I knew she needed to get out of there immediately and never go back. Dammit straight to voicemail! THAT STUPID OLD PHONE OF HERS.

The full shadow now hung completely over Linh.

Her hand jerked, flipping open her cell phone.

My phone was ringing.

I answered, “LINH! LINH CAN YOU HEAR ME YOU NEED TO…""

A burst of loud static forced my phone reflexively away from my ear.

On the webcam I saw Linh’s lips begin to move. Her eyes were shut, but she was speaking.

I heard her voice come across the phone, but something wasn’t right. She was speaking, but a second, deeper voice echoed hers in perfect unison.

“DON’T TURN OFF THE WEBCAM…. AGRAMON WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU. DON’T TURN OFF THE WEBCAM. AGRAMON IS READY FOR YOU NOW”

“Who? What? What does he want?” I yelled in desperation.

“HE WANTS TO EAT YOUR SKIN”. 

The line disconnected.

The shadow across Linh’s bed changed directions.

It started moving away from the bed… and towards her laptop… towards the webcam.

As the shadow moved closer small streams of gray liquid rolled towards the lens.

The images coming across my monitor began to shake violently.

It was almost here. I could now see the top of it’s head. It was CRAWLING towards me. Wet strings of silver and black hair hanging over it’s face. I remembered those hateful eyes and I lost control of my bladder as it slowly begin to tilt it’s head up. 

And then I did it. 

In panic I slammed my laptop shut and threw it against the hard tile floor before collapsing to the ground.

I wished for a panic attack to take my consciousness and end this nightmare, but it didn’t come.

I crawled to the panel of switches a few feet up on the wall and turned on every light that I could. I noticed the bottle of wine still open on the kitchen counter and drank most of it down in a single swallow. I reached up and pulled open my apartment door, and stumbled across the threshold, extending half of my body into the common hallway so I wouldn’t feel so alone. A pathetic coward sprawled out on the concrete. 

My phone began to ring.

I crawled to it. Linh’s name was flashing on the caller ID. I held it in my hand, paralyzed by fear.

And then the ringing stopped.

I took another mouthful of wine and mustered the courage to call back. It went straight to voicemail. And then again and again as I tried to call.

Eventually the shock and drowsiness from the wine got the better of me, and I passed out on the floor after making a few more attempts.

When I awoke several hours later, despite the broken laptop and empty bottle, I wanted to believe that it was all some sort of horrible nightmare.

Out of the corner of my eye I saw blue flashing light on my cell phone.

“You Have One New Voicemail”

My hand trembled as I dialed my voicemail and entered my passcode.

The message was time stamped, and was from the missed call I had from Linh before passing out.

Her voice. She was in tears and frightened as though I had never heard her before.

“You promised. Why…….why did you….turn off the web …webcam… “

“His… his tongue … burns “

With a crackle the message ended. 

-----

Two years have passed since that night. I never tried to contact Linh again. I never called her work to see if she came in the following morning. I never made it to Yarrow Point in Washington where she lived. She was my soul mate, and I let this happen. I was probably right on the night we met when I told myself I wasn’t man enough for her.

The only reason I am telling this story today, under the cowardly vale of anonymity, is because my drug and alcohol counselor thinks it would be good for me. So here it is. I made the decision to let the love of my life face an unimaginable nightmare to spare myself, and the worst part is that I may not even regret it.  

Now if you will excuse me, I think I need another drink.

ul4ff,46,2012-06-04,This may seem like kind of a weird proposition but...,Bfannin13,Columbus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/ul4ff/this_may_seem_like_kind_of_a_weird_proposition_but/,"Columbus, my entire life, I've been extremely Math and Science focused. I've kind of shut off my mind to anything else. I recently have started to become bored by what is known and extremely interested in less definite parts of life. Here's the thing though, all I've ever known is Math and Science. **So here's my question:**

**Would anyone on here be interested in simply meeting for coffee (on me of course!) and just telling me what you're passionate about? I think it would be really cool to have coffee with a whole bunch of people who think differently just so that I can get a greater understanding of people's outlook on life.**

After coffee, I would write a couple pages on your particle passions and aspirations in life and save it for personal reference. Once I get enough of them though, I might put them online (with identities hidden if requested) so other's can read them and perhaps open their minds to ways of life that they've never experienced. I think there is a lot to learn from each other. 

PM me if you're interested. Maybe you could learn something from me as well. 

**tl;dr:** I want to know what you're passionate about. I'll buy you coffee if you sit with me and talk about things no one else cares enough to listen to.



**EDIT:** I wanted to add an edit to clarify a few things:

1) As Jeff_E_Popp suggested, I want to let you know that I don't plan on chopping anyone up into little pieces. To ensure this doesn't happen, I'm suggesting that we meet in a public place of your choice. That way I get to experience a little more of Columbus too!

2) This is all about you. I know that some people have so much they want to say, but know one cares. I care. If you get bored talking about yourself and want to hear what I have to say, ask. I'll gladly share. 

3) I am getting a lot of people who are interested so I am making a spreadsheet so I will not forget about anyone. If you said you are interested, I WILL meet up with you at some point this summer. I apologize if it's not for a couple of weeks. 

4) A little more about me: I'm an OSU Engineering Student and will be working in Columbus this summer in an internship. I'm just legitimately curious about different people's perspectives on life so that I can open my mind a little more to differences among all of us. 

Thank you for your interest! This will be an exciting project! 


**EDIT 2:** This is easily the best idea that I've ever had. I look forward to meeting all of you!


**EDIT 3:** I currently have about 35 people who have expressed interest. If it works out that I can meet with all of them, one person per day, that is 5 weeks of meetings. That is extremely exciting for me! But, it means that it could be a while before I actually meet with you. Be patient because if you are legitimately interested in doing this, I will find the time to meet with you. It just might be 5-6 weeks from now... 

I should also note that I will only be here for 14 more weeks before moving to Findlay, OH. Because of this, I would not like to book more than 70 people tops. I'll let you know when/if I get to that number. Thanks again for volunteering guys!


**UPDATE: ** I just realized that there are a lot of people on here that said they were interested that I haven't set up a date with yet.

ul023,67,2012-06-04,Alone...Right?,DeadlyToken,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ul023/aloneright/,"This weekend I was completely alone, everyone was out of the house and my mother trusted me enough to not burn down the house (but i think she still slightly relied upon the interns here who came for morning and nightly chores...). I woke up on Saturday and being me, immediately logged into Reddit. I checked out a few posts, then went downstairs and grabbed a bowl of cereal. 

The dogs were quiet... which was very odd but I didn't pay attention to it at the time. They're always barking and yapping at random cats moving about the yard. (I live on a farm with 103 horses, 8 dogs, 40 cattle, 50 cats, and 7 donkeys, quiet is rare.) Soon enough, I started watching TheAmazingAtheist. Behind me, I heard my door open and close. I whipped around and looked behind me. Nobody there, I yelled ""Hello?"" like any girl in a horror movie. No answer. I scolded myself for that, who did I expect? The boogyman? Maybe Nosleep was getting to me, i remember thinking.
 
 I forgot about it within about 10 minutes. So I started talking to friends on facebook, the usual chatter that you'd expect about summer. When I got up to get a glass of water, the guitars started strumming. I froze. The strumming sped up and I cautiously turned the corner into the living room where they were kept. The guitars looked untouched, and undisturbed. I tried to laugh it off as hearing things. For the next hour I felt uneasy. 

My mother called me, and I was relieved, I started walking to my room but I had my foot on the first step when my brother's prized baseball came rolling down the steps... it was in a case, in his wardrobe in his room... And he hasn't been here for a week.  I tried my best to make myself believe that my sister, Katie, had been playing with it... but I couldn't believe it. Nosleep has taught me to try and rationalize out first, then believe. 

About 10ish, I made myself supper, watched a movie, then went to take a shower. As i was stepping in, I felt this unbearable feeling of being watched, and subconsciously pulled my towel tighter around myself. Yes, I keep the towel on until I am in the shower and the windows are fogged since we still don't have blinds in the bathroom. I did my routine, and was halfway through the Proactive facewash treatment when... In the mirror i saw someone. I turned, but of course there wasn''t anyone there. I quickly dried my face and left. After a few hours of Alesana and talking to friend, I passed out. 

The next morning, I woke up to find a slice on my leg from my knee to my ankle. Red and puffy, it screamed in protest when I brushed it against the mattress. I hobbled to the bathroom, and let my dogs out on the way. I came out, and I immediately heard this whispering and giggling. Stupidly, I called out ""hello?"" and the sounds stopped. Being easily freaked, I wrapped up my leg, and grabbed my laptop. F7u12 is where I was for awhile, but decided to come here. 

At around noon, I heard this ear splitting scream, my hands flew up to cover my ears and I curled into the fetal position. I remember screaming ""Stop it!"" Silence. The dogs were barking and whimpering, and I was in hysterics, so I asked my mom if someone could come home, she said I could go do chores instead. So I went across the road to check water, and was greeted by this ticking sound, like the old bike my sister rides. I sped up the pace and came back home. I strummed my guitar, did a few scales, retuned, but it didn't help me relax. I went back on Facebook to see if anyone was willing to come over, or at least talk to me... before someone blew behind my ear. I flipped my laptop and it crashed to the ground, then I started crying.

For the remainder of the evening, I sat in the living room with 3 white candles, my dogs, and a movie playing at full blast. I may be paranoid... but when I woke up this morning there was a note beside me saying, ""Sweet dreams""... Nobody came in until noon today, and everyone denies being home last night."
ukzii,0,2012-06-04,"Reddit, I hate people that haven't improved their minds and blame it on the environment they grew up in. What do you think determines one's will to 'learn'? Some noticeable differences in your own family?",Franceonstrike,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ukzii/reddit_i_hate_people_that_havent_improved_their/,"First of all, sorry if my title ain't right, but I don't really know how to translate ""se cultiver"" in English. If someone can help me ? :]

Anyway, so here is the thing : my sister is 32 y/o, I am 21. Even if we don't have the same father, both of us were only raised by my mother, and had to learn everything by themselves. And the fact that I have a sister didn't help me through school, as my sister doesn't even know what something like 2+6*5 equals. 

My sister dropped school at 16, only worked once for an internship of 1 week as a cashier, and then got married. She spends her days watching soap operas, eating, and raising her children who, needless to say, are getting very bored at school. And I feel sad for them. One day, for example, her son who was around 5 at the time, came to me and started asking me questions like ""Hey, franceonstrike, is the universe infinite ? Because I believe it is, but I think it's only my mind that can't perceive it...?"". God, I was surprised. And now, it's all about football (soccer) and call of duty. 

As for myself, I grew up in the same environment. Was considered a ""gifted child"" (sorry if it's a bad translation), jumped a class, learned English, German, Spanish, Portuguese, read hundreds of books, and am still studying. I know studies ain't unreachable in 2012, but seeing the family I come from, it's quite a miracle. I also saved money to spend 6 months in London, 3 in Barcelona for an internship, shit like that showing something like a cultural distinction between us.

And I've always been wondering... How come she doesn't know that Berlin is the capital of Germany ? How come she so easily admits that she has never read a book in her life ? How come she is happy not learning shit for now 32 years ? 
I mean, I do like my sister, but I just can't imagine myself living that way. And I'm not saying I'm the Chosen One, because I know there's lots of people like me outside. But there's also lots of people like her. 

A friend of mine told me that maybe I worked to not look like her, right, but sometimes the opposite happens. Some other dude once told me it might be because I met different people as a child. But as far as I remember, once I started 'thinking by myself', I've CHOSEN my friends. 

So I end up thinking some people were born different, and I get it is a fact. But how come, in a same family, it can be SO different? Do you have found some answers in your specific case? It can't only be because of Mother Nature...? "
ukz8l,1,2012-06-04,What should I do now? move on or not? (repost from Relationships),konfoozed,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/ukz8l/what_should_i_do_now_move_on_or_not_repost_from/,"I (M:29) dated my ex (F:30) for 21 months. I loved her the whole time, and totally was excited about being with her. We are both students. She is extremely smart, musical (which I adore) and kind and empathetic. I am about to get my doctorate and she got into Pharmacy school a year ago and has 3 more years to go. I was thinking marriage and a future with her and was considering getting a job in the town we are now or even getting another degree while she is finishing up her program. 

I should add to this that we had problems along the way. We broke up several times but never stayed broken-up for more than a couple days. The chemistry was incredible. I felt amazing with her and just wanted to be affectionate whenever we were together. Last semester was really stressful for both of us. She had 3-4 exams/quizzes per week and I had a big exam scheduled. She was being distant and attributed that to her stress from school. I was totally fine with that and tried to accommodate her and be helpful up to a certain point when I broke down due to her irresponsiveness and my personal school-related issues I was dealing with/felt depressed about, and got extremely upset. Normally she would try to make me feel better, but this time, she didn't do anything and even didn't talk/communicate with me for a week, when I realized, by driving to her place, that she had moved on and wanted a break-up. She has been insistent in her decision, and I don't seem to be able to make her change this decision. 

We have hung out after the break-up a couple times and each time we had lots of fun. We'd joke around, go shopping together, exchange funny notes, and each time I see her, my feelings surge up again. We were even planning to go to a karaoke last week which got cancelled due to her dentist appointment. 

I was planning to take her to my country (I am a foreigner in the US) for the summer and my family even had planned accommodations for her to be able to practice piano (she is a pianist and has an upcoming performance). I never told her about this though.

I am well aware of our differences, but I have strong feelings for this girl and see myself sacrificing a lot to just keep her happy. The situation exacerbated when I got an internship somewhere ~2000 miles away from here which would last for 3 months. I feel so bad about the internship as I think I could've mended the relationship if I had stayed in town. She actually helped me a lot to get this. 

Yesterday she emailed me and said let's not prolong the torture. She said she thinks it's to our best in the long-term if we break-up.
I am totally torn-apart now. I am having a hell of a hard time explaining to her that the reason I don't wanna move on is not because I am afraid of break-ups. On the contrary, single life is still attractive to me. I just value being with a person with her qualities more than anything. She wants to get married eventually. I know there is no other guy involved. 

What should I do? Should I move on? Is it selfish if I disregard her want and contact her again and try to reconcile? I have nobody else to talk to about this. 

**TL;DR:** Girlfriend broke up with me, I love her to death, relationship was problematic, but not a big deal in my opinion. Moving away soon, which exacerbates the situation. Should I move on or try to get her back? I saw myself with her for a life-time."

ukt2x,1,2012-06-04,"Just graduated with what I think a great resume, but I have no idea what to do.",[deleted],sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/ukt2x/just_graduated_with_what_i_think_a_great_resume/,"Hey guys, let me start off saying I'm asking for advice. If this is the wrong place, please don't read further and tell me where to go.

I moved this part from bottom to the top of my post: I learned a lot in college. But even after everything I learned, there was no one person who could tell me how to get started or the type of jobs in the field. No one in my family does computers and my advisers are to far removed or worked in the military.

First some background:

I graduated in early may from the University of Tampa with a degree in Management Information Systems. I graduated with a 3.72 overall gpa and a near perfect gpa in MIS (I got all A's and only one AB). I received 2012 Outstanding Graduate in my major, and two of the most difficult teachers in the program that everyone hates told me I was one of the best students they ever had. I did this with minimal work and I don't feel like I learned anything/very smart. I read this subreddit and just feel overwhelmed and have no clue what you guys are talking about majority of the time.  My coursework focused heavily on Information Design (mostly Object Oriented), IS Security, SAP and sql databases. I had two internships, one which I'd say is B.S. and one where I did system admin duties in a lab...by myself...working with no-one.

I moved back to new york (where my family lives) when I graduated. I'm looking for jobs in both Tampa, and NYC/Long Island. I only applied to two places, my old internship where they said I did everything perfect (funding got cut for my program) and another place in tampa. I don't think there's a position available for me at my old job despite really fitting in well there. I put my resume online at monster and dice 4 business days ago. I've been getting about 3 calls/emails a day from places in NYC, all for system admin jobs from recruiters. 

My problem?

All of them have asked about my Linux knowledge and what I would say my strongest skills are for the position. I don't know shit about either! I don't know how to answer these questions. I'm never nervous about interviews/phone calls so I tell them the straight up truth about what I've done. I worked only with an old outdated windows 2003 and fedora 7. I got asked about my home setup.. I don't have a home setup. I have a 1k gaming asus laptop (I don't even game). I don't know how to get even started or practice. My major had nothing to do with this and when I look it up I just feel so overwhelmed (I guess partially thanks to my panic...). I got a call today and scheduled a interview for Wednesday. At the end of the phone call the recruiter told me the position was actually mostly tech support with some sysadmin duties for 17-23 a hour. I got that much with my internship in Tampa. I'm going to call back and say I'm not interested (esp. for tech support). 

my questions:
Should I be looking for a IT job in a different position and not sys admin? 
What kind of starting pay should I be looking for in NYC?
Am I wrong to be panicked about my skills?
How do I improve my skills? I'm a excellent learner, which is why I got through school so easily by doing bare minimum. 

Believe me, I researched before I came here, and it only made me more confused than ever. I wasn't panicked. Now I am. I need some personal advice...

Other notes:
I have Information Systems Analyst (ISA) cert, and I'm on the verge of passing CISSP (maybe 3 months more studying). If I studied for the SAP TERP10 I could pass, I don't like SAP though. No other certs.
I have a security clearance.
My programming skills suck.
Example of my resume with some stuff X'd out: https://docs.google.com/open?id=0ByffL1FF50iYOWQzejhHb1JxR1E

I know this is kind of a mess, but hopefully I got my situation across. If I got confusing anywhere please tell me. If any professionals in the industry can help me I'd seriously may fall in love with you.  Thank you so much."

ukrzo,24,2012-06-04,Are young people who used to work summer jobs now volunteering in the summer? What does this do to wages and job availability?,Gecko99,lostgeneration,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/ukrzo/are_young_people_who_used_to_work_summer_jobs_now/,"Nowadays there isn't much seasonal work, and teenagers are often expected to volunteer to get experience and ""serve their communities"". Volunteer work is said to be a way to prove that you're mature and responsible enough to get even a minimum-wage job. In many high schools, volunteering is a requirement for graduation. Unpaid internships are even difficult to get into, due to the abundance of applicants simply looking to get experience and references. It looks to me like society views young people as a source of free labor.

In previous decades, I think lots of teenagers would get jobs in the summer when they were off school, and those jobs would pay them well enough that they could afford luxuries like going to the movies and eating at restaurants and they could buy cars and pay for higher education themselves without going too deeply into debt. That seems to be almost a thing of the past. Does anyone else think that this expectation of volunteer work from teenagers might drive down wages? Why pay someone to do an unskilled job when you could get a teenager to do it for free just by telling them it'll help them get jobs eventually? Why should any employer pay its employees if the employees are getting ""experience""?"

I am currently finishing up my Computer Science degree and had previously worked as a help desk phone jockey and web development roles before, but this is a new frontier for me to get out from behind the desk.

The mentor I was working under had called in this last Friday so I was manning the office by myself in this adventure. 

I get an email from our QA department saying she needed to have the TV in the training room set up so that someone coming in from out of town could hook a laptop to it for a presentation. The TV had just been recently set up and my mentor was in the middle of getting cables run from the TV to a HDMI wall jack for this purpose. 

Since it was close to time for me to leave for my second job and I really didn't have time to finish running the cable - I walked over to the training room and hooked up a VGA cable and a AUX cable to the TV/sound system receiver. TADA!

I run into the lady from the QA department and advsied her that I could show her how to hook everything up so the presentation at 6AM on Monday could go smoothly. (Remember that time, it's important) She tells me that she is too busy and asks if I can leave a post-it note instructions. 

After thinking it over in my inner mind theater about how I/my mentor was going to get a call at 6AM asking how to do this, I in my eternal naive kindness offer to meet her in the training room before the meeting to set everything up. 

This morning I was at the business ready to set everything up. I had come home from my second job the night before at 11PM and had a fitful sleep. AKA: I'm really exhausted. The two men giving the presentation show up and I am eager to take the laptop off their hands so I can set it up and go home. 

He looks thoughtful and mentions ""oh, it's a Mac and I forgot my adapter"". 

*The situation at this point*: 

*The office section of the building where the IT office is at is locked currently with no way in.  

*Even if I could go in this office the business is only equipped with Windows machines so we don't have an adapter for the Mac in the office anyway.

*I hate life and I want to collapse from exhaustion or string someone up with the aforementioned VGA cable. 

He chuckles and tells me ""Oh we don't really need to hook up the laptop anyway!""

Prologue:

I grab some McDonald's breakfast on the way home. I eat it and think about how to avoid this in the future. Then I texted my mentor told him I wasn't coming into day and called in to the second job and did the same. Then I slept until noon and relaxed.

I'm away for the summer on an internship, so this all happened very quickly for me; it seems even more difficult being physically separated from the ordeal.

I found out late Saturday afternoon that Cody, my cat, was suffering from an infection in his lungs -- his chest cavity was filling with fluid -- which was bloody, they drained it once -- which made it tremendously (if not nearly impossible) for him to breathe. My mom told he he was whimpering, very weak, and at the end he kept trying to stand up but didn't have the strength and kept falling over. He was on antibiotics for the 36 hours he was in the veterinary hospital, but two vets, the veterinarian on call at the hospital and a family friend, said the only way for the antibiotics to reach his lungs was going to be if they performed an invasive surgery.

Between my mother and myself, affording the surgery for Cody would have been a light/moderate financial burden. I'm a graduate student, so my internship pays better than those I had during undergraduate, so this was the first time I've been in a position to help shoulder the majority of costs. The procedure might have entirely saved Cody's life, but it would have been very invasive and there was no guarantee. My mother decided to have him put down and avoid putting him through that hardship, which I can understand, but I can't help but wonder if we could have saved his life. He was only three and probably the sweetest animal I've ever had the pleasure of knowing -- although most pet owners would probably say the same thing about their beloved pet.

**So, vets and pet-lovers of Reddit, where does the morality and/or humane decision lie when you're faced with a very sick pet but have the option for treatment?**

I know there's no right answer, nor can we ever know what our pet is experiencing or thinking, but, selfishly, I think some sort of discussion would help me right now. My brain is wired to solve problems and this is a problem I can't solve.

Thanks for reading.

Edit: Cody was only 3, so this was not something we expected and he arguably had a lot more of his life to live."
ukipi,83,2012-06-04,a close call on the metro,phalseprofits,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/ukipi/a_close_call_on_the_metro/,"Longtime reader, first time poster; I was hoping I'd never have something to contribute to this subreddit. 

Last friday I was taking the metro to my internship downtown. I've never lived in a big city before, and it has been really fun to use public transportation for the first time in my life. Silly, I know, but it's kind of thrilling to feel like I'm part of the hustle and bustle of a big city. 

Back to the story, I boarded the metro at the station right next to my university, and was chatting with some classmates. It's a morning train full of commuters in their business suits. I blend right in, wearing office clothing and carrying my backpack. A few stops later, a young guy gets on the train. He's wearing baggy clothes, looking very casual, but that doesn't really matter to me.

Anyway, the longer he stays on the train, the more odd his behavior becomes He's standing way too close to people and seems unusually jumpy. I notice him check to make sure that something is in his pocket. At the next stop, the woman in front of him starts to move, and as he's standing too close to her, he says out loud ""Oh, you have a baby, go ahead."" Like he's doing her a favor. 

At this point the train has emptied a little bit, and I see an open seat and sit down. Immediately, the guy sits right next to me, so suddenly and so close that I am instantly uncomfortable. After I settle, I look up and realize that we are just arriving to my stop. 

Ready to leave, I stand up and gather my bag. Usually, it seems like that is always an unspoken cue for the person sitting next to you to move out of your way. Instead of moving, he just stares up at me with this odd, frozen expression on his face. I ask him repeatedly to move and let me out, and he just sits there, staring. From his earlier behavior I saw that he was healthy enough to get up and down, and he certainly understood english. No reason for him to just sit there. 

Well, at this point, everyone else on the metro-car sees what's going on. One guy yells at him to get out of my way, and leave me alone. He finally lets me out, but it's too late and the doors have closed at my stop. As I stand near the door, another gentleman presses the security button and explains what's going on to the conductor. As we get to the next stop, the creepy guy gets up and stands at the doorway, looks around, and then with a defeated expression turns around and sits back down.  At the next stop, I make sure there's a security guard there, and exit when I see that there's no time for the creepy guy to follow me out of the car.

Looking back on it, I am convinced that he was on the metro to find someone to mug. He was shopping for a victim, and decided to let the other lady go when he realized she had a little kid. When he sat down next to me, he made sure that the pocket with an item in it (most likely a weapon of some kind) was right next to me. I honestly believe that he was amping himself up to mug me, but my sudden departure threw him off of his plan. Once I missed my stop and the other guy yelled at him, he knew it was too late and that there were too many people watching him to be able to get away with anything.

I'm driving to work from now on."

I'm going to be a Junior this fall in English/Creative Writing. My ultimate goal is to get a PhD and become a professor.  

I've looked at the UIUC website about deadlines and stuff, but I think hearing from people who have already gone through the process would be helpful. 

Soo....
1.) **The GRE** Is it really difficult? Should I be starting to take practice exams for it? Are the prep classes worth it? Oh, and do other test scores correlate with GRE scores?

2.) **GPA** How much does it matter? I have a 3.5 overall right now, with a 3.6 major GPA. I'm going to probably apply to grad school here and then maybe some ivy leagues if I end up doing well enough on the GRE/graduate with honors.

3.) **PhD** I'm confused about how some schools go about master's/PhD programs. For example, I looked at UChicago, and the website said they don't offer a terminal master's.  Does that mean I enter directly into the PhD program, or I have to go somewhere else first for my master's?

4.) **Experience** How much does it factor into the equation? I have a job as an assistant in Burnsides Lab under a food chemist (I'm an IB minor) but I do more writing and copyediting than actual lab work. Should I be working towards more internships next summer?

Any help would be greatly appreciated."
ukbc0,270,2012-06-04,What's the easiest job that you ever had?,kirbee,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ukbc0/whats_the_easiest_job_that_you_ever_had/,"I'll start:

I had a internship for 2 summers in a row with the department of transportation in my state.  Our job was to survey roadway conditions in several local counties.   We drove around in a crappy car with state plates and a big orange ""ROADWAY SURVEY"" sign on the back.

We checked the conditions of drainage pipes, guide rails, and shoulders.  We were given 20-30 miles of road to survey each day.  Sometimes we had an hour or so drive to get to the road that we needed to survey.

We did drainage pipes at the beginning of the summer, because it wasn't too hot out yet, and we actually had to get out of the car to find the pipes.

Then we did guide rails and shoulders, and this just involved driving slowly in the shoulder looking at the guide rails and shoulders.

We had 2 people in each car... 1 would drive, and 1 would do the surveying.  One summer we had an odd number of people, so my car had 3 people.  The 3rd person would rotate on the ""sleep in the back seat"" shift.

Here's the best part: 

We ""worked"" from 7:00 AM to 3:30 PM.  We would be done surveying the roads by 11:00 or 12:00, and have the rest of the day to kill.  It was frowned upon if you went back to the office to get more work.

So we had to find things to do...  such as golfing, swimming, dining out, sleeping, shopping, going to state parks, etc.

We just had to make sure we backed the car into the parking spaces, because of the big orange ""ROADWAY SURVEY"" sign on the back.

The pay wasn't too bad either... I think somewhere around $10-$12/hour.  Thank you taxpayers.

Thank god they didn't have GPS trackers back then!

",non-confidential,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uk7xw/do_you_think_it_professionals_should_have_a_code/,"It starts with me. I was once a IT assistant (internship). I worked in at least two organizations where the technology was up-to-date but the people were not very tech savvy. They were competent enough to handle day to day software but knew very little about Windows or how networks work. They didn't need to. 

It started with the recruitment of a new director of sales. He knew very little about computers in general. Much of his work on computers revolved around analyzing reports and using email. On this particular day, he was overseas and he emailed me directly requesting the web address for our web mail access portal. I reply back with it. Soon after he asks me what the username and password should be. I tell him what his username would be and that the password would be whatever he uses to log on to his computer. He replies back thanking me and saying it was still the default password we assigned to him. 

I think I was tempted then but I held back. Later when I got home I accessed his email via Tor. I was being extra-careful and ensured that I was in the same country as he was. I proceeded to read hundreds of emails. I was hooked on the information. Much of it was boring sales blabber. But so much of it was also discussions about employees, their problems and executive decisions. I stayed up quite late into the night and the next morning I woke up knowing much more than anyone else did! 

I was hooked. In the next few weeks and months, I would try different ways to access other peoples mailboxes. I started with testing the default password in those who I thought were least likely to have changed it. It worked and I felt like an addict who just received his fix. I read about personal problems. Letters to their loved ones. Company gossip and speculations. I knew about their personal problems, financial problems, relationship issues, company issues. Hell, I even knew their flights, banks, and passport details! 

When I had gone through much of them. I went a step further and used my administrator privileges to directly access the other mailboxes. This unfortunately had to be done during work, so I had to be extra cautious. By then, the thrill of getting caught was part of the entertainment. 

After a while I realized how addicted I was to it. Everyday I would read their emails after work and every morning I'd know a little bit more about them. Until one day, I woke up and realized what I was doing was wrong! I stopped. I fought my urges to read their emails and for the most part succeeded but knowing access was easy, I then proceeded to find an excuse and do a company wide change of password. This happened as planned and slowly I started to lose my urges. 

Did I tell anybody about what I had read? No, thankfully not. My interest in it was not to make it public but rather knowing about their lives gave me, I suppose, a sense of superiority. Do I regret doing it? Perhaps, but I cannot say if I would not do it again. In the same way, I cannot say that if it had come to a situation where divulging this information would have saved my ass, then I might have. 

I am sorry if that went on for a bit. But it is what leads me to my question. The amount of information that an IT professional is privy to is astounding. While a lot of this is covered by company confidentiality agreements etc. what I do with the personal information of the employees in their emails is not. Considering the amount of people who are socially active at work via various methods, one can quite literally know them better than their loved ones do. 

Would I have adhered to code of professional responsibility? Yes, I would like to think so. It would have been etched into my memory by teachers from day one. I would have respected the code and feared the repercussions of my actions. 

But, heh, who knows .....

I went through college, medical school, internship, residency, and finally got my degree, so I was Fred Johnson, MD. After a while I got bored being a doctor, so I decided to go back to school. Dentistry was my dream! Got all the way through school, got my degree, so then I was Fred Johnson, MD, DDS. Got bored doing dentistry, so I started fooling around with my assistant and she gave me VD, so now I was Fred Johnson, MD, DDS, with VD. Well, the ADA found out about the VD, so they took away my DDS. Then I was Fred Johnson, MD, with VD. Then the AMA found out about the ADA taking away my DDS because of the VD, so they took away my MD leaving me as Fred Johnson with VD. Then the VD took away my Johnson, so now I am just Fred.'

I took an internship this summer at a small brokerage firm in NYC.
I've had financial sales internships in the past and from my interview and job description I was given the impression I would be doing more research and analytic work.  

These guys have me cold calling all day long, sun up to sun down.  I don't mind cold calling, I'm good at it and realize it's part of the business, but this place is more or less a chop shop.  They're swindlers and borderline thieves. They spend the day yelling, swearing, and manipulating prospects and clients, I'm amazed anyone actually gives these guys money.

Anyway, I know I'm gonna have to deal with shit like this on some scale but I'm really looking for an out.  I'm not above cold calling, I'm just looking to get some analyst work done before I graduate. 

Do I have any options? I know most deadlines have passed.  I've resorted to combing through the likes of craigslist for postings but, are there any other avenues out there??

I'm a junior, 3.7 gpa from a SUNY school, hard worker, quick learner.. Any good news out there??

My problem is, is that he wants me to go bed at the same time as him (10pm) and I usually stay up until around 2am. During the time he is sleeping I do everything I can to please him. I use headphones, I turn my computer screen away from his bed and try to make no sound at all. 

He just now asked me to leave our room because the light of my laptop on half brightness angled away from him is making it so he cannot sleep. I feel like I am doing all I can to accommodate him, but he is asking too much. I feel like it is my room too and I should be able to quietly browse facebook/reddit in my bed before I go to sleep as long as I am my computer is on mute and I am not making any noise.

ujqad,1,2012-06-04,US - [Request] Twin Cities (MN) Metro (WI) coffee drinker requesting a new/used/gift card for working coffee maker and/or coffee?  Help jump start my performance at my new job! :),[deleted],randomactsofcoffee,https://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofcoffee/comments/ujqad/us_request_twin_cities_mn_metro_wi_coffee_drinker/,"Hello!  This is my first time posting to a random acts subreddit, so hopefully I am doing this right!  

I have been living on my own since my junior year of high school, and in all this time I have not had a coffee maker (roughly four years).  Way back when I did have one, I was an avid coffee drinker and loved trying out different roasts.  I have usually either lived at a house with roommates who have a coffee maker or had a job where they always have coffee in the breakroom.  I got through my last job every day (an internship) by drinking a few cups of coffee (admittedly not top-notch, but any coffee becomes delicious when you are deprived) every day at work.  

I have just started my first real job in my field as an IT Data Analyst.  The position is at the headquarters of an awesome globally acclaimed company, and I am very grateful to have filled the spot.  I have problems with exhaustion due to various mineral deficiencies and a couple medications I am on that have undesirable side effects - coffee usually solves this problem for me during the day, at least for the most part.  Even though I'm working at a great place, THEY HAVE NO COFFEE! *gasp!*  Well, alright, they do have coffee that you can purchase, but it's too expensive for me (around $5 a cup).  I am nervous about my performance, as even the hiring manager (once I was hired) told me that I am much, much younger than they would usually hire, and that usually they would hire someone who already has their degree.  I've been doing great so far, but I still feel drained as soon as I sit down at my desk, no matter how much sleep I get.

With the current bills I have had supporting myself, my boyfriend, and our two pets, student loans (still working on my degree), and some medical/insurance bills, as well as a car payment, I have not had any extra money for ""extras"" - for example, buying any new clothes/work clothes, renting movies, going out to eat, buying extra supplies for the house like tissues or hangers, you get the idea - and this includes a coffee maker and coffee.  I can't bring myself to spend the money when it could probably be spent elsewhere on more basic necessities, even though it's something I very much desire.

Once I start getting paid my higher wages from my new job, and I am caught up with my bills enough, I would love to pay it forward through Random Acts of Coffee, any other Random Acts subreddit, or I am also open to suggestions or wishes. :)

I am looking for a new or used coffeemaker, or the means to obtain one, as long as it is in working order.  I would also love any coffee (love medium/dark roasts), but if one of the two are not doable, I could buy the other item at a later date when I have the funds available.  I hope I don't sound too needy right now; I just stumbled upon this subreddit and looked back upon my coffee drinking days with a deep yearning and desire.  I also know how much more attentive I would feel during the day if I had my coffee fix.

**TL;DR : Looking for means to obtain a coffee maker and/or coffee.  I work in Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States, and live in the metro area (Wisconsin).  Help a sista out?**"

ujkw9,357,2012-06-03,IAmA Radio/Water Tower Climber. Saw the interest on the front page today and thought I'd do an AMA as everyone was blown away by it,RDProgrammer,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ujkw9/iama_radiowater_tower_climber_saw_the_interest_on/,"My family owns a Wireless Internet Service in rural America and we rent tower space from the companies that own large radio towers, from smaller towers, from cities' water towers, and other random towers (we have ~55 broadcast sites). Our antennas are between 100' and 450' off the ground and I've done higher climbs relative to where that guy from the [""scariest video in the name of science""](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/uijtx/the_scariest_video_you_have_ever_watched_in_the/) guy got off the elevator (And really, above 50' or so you're dead if you fall anyway).

Even better some of our antennas are on water towers that have no ladder, so you just have to scurry up the existing metal work where ever you can. (Yeah, this REALLY sucks).

As said in [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCYZZPwJr_c), and argued in many responses to other places I've seen that posted, I do free-climb often (When there is not a way to be clipped in in a way that will not make me get exhausted quickly. Also, clipping in requires you to stop what you are doing, which when getting in a rhythm as you climb, is very distracting. With many designs of towers the ladders' rungs are not evenly spaced, but follow a pattern, one that you must count out in your head to make sure your feet are going to be in the right place at the right time.), but I also clip in when working if there isn't a safe platform to stand on.

Craziest thing I've seen: the tower in the pics below has a buzzard's nest about 100' up on a walkway that is about 3 feet wide and has had a chick in it each of the last 3 years. [Here is is empty.
](http://i.imgur.com/NnP1Nh.jpg) Other than that, I've been on towers and found where lightning has hit them and just blown the tops apart (mostly on water towers), have seen women sunbathing in their backyards in various states of dress (but I was at least 300' away and couldn't seem much), and had a cop order me down off the tower thinking I was up there to vandalize.

Close Calls: I've gotten my safety harness caught up in rigging before and been stuck for a while until I could get out, nearly had heatstroke on a tower, had the mount-point I was clipped into bend and make me nearly fall, and dropped a screw driver a few hundred feet onto the roof of my jeep (still has a big dent).

Best part of the job: it's always something new and rarely boring (except for driving long distances). Some of the set ups are really interesting and have evolved over the years: we have a tower that has something like 35 runs of ethernet cable going to the top (it's grown with the business), the electrical box that houses all our equipment for that tower looks nuts. That and our solar powered systems that are out in the middle of nowhere; building those are fun, imagine hauling a ~100lb battery up a tower just like that guy in the video had his tool bag (while also hauling the tool bag).

Worst part: The heat and the cold. Where I am the summers get to 110 F and 100% humidity and the winters get to 0 degrees and windy. I'd rather climb in heat than cold though, as your hands REALLY hurt after a climb in the cold, the metal of the ladder sucks any trace of heat out of them.

Is it scary anymore? Almost never, there are moments when you realize that one slip and it's all over, but its also a rush and I'm an Adrenaline Junkie (been skydiving, have a motorcycle, etc). I also get a lot of laughs out of people who I show pictures to and just get a ""nope, nope, nope, nope, NOOOOOOPE!."" My GF also lost her damned mind when I climbed a remote tower we had just had installed to install our antennas. the ""tower"" was a 70' telephone pole (about 20"" wide at base, 8"" or so at the top). I had to drive long bolts into it as I climbed to ""build"" the ""ladder"" and then sit at the top and rope components up to myself (the weight caused the pole to shake as much as 3' to either side according to my GF). That was some squirrely shit and I'll admit I'm glad I haven't had to climb it again since.


[Here is my verification](http://i.imgur.com/2PpFR.jpg) (see first picture for same face)


...and some pics from when I was up them in the past:

[Here's what I normally climb wearing](http://i.imgur.com/69nGa.jpg) it has multiple different attachments for safety gear for different types of towers.

If y'all have any questions, ask away.

EDIT: imgur links, screw photobucket

IDK If I'm allowed to do this, but throw me some upvotes, I'm constantly annoyed by how many people think tower climbing is some sort of crazy job that only nutcases would do (seriously been denied a college internship because the recruiter thought I was ""too wild"" for their company).

umzgk,2,2012-06-05,What the hell is my friend's deal? Narcissism? Entitlement? Douche-baggery?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/umzgk/what_the_hell_is_my_friends_deal_narcissism/,"I'm 23 now, I first met my friend (well call him ""M"") M &amp; my current group of friends when I was 19. When I first met this dude I thought he was amazing. He claimed to have received his chemical engineering degree in 3 years while battling pancreatic cancer that had occurred while he was away at school. He also loves smoking weed as much as I do, and at that point in my life I blamed the marijuana on my laziness instead of taking a much deeper look at myself. 

I was just coming back from University at the time, after failing out due to partying, playing WoW and never going to class. I was in-between friend groups at the time, leaving my high school friend group finally as they took the plunge into harder drugs that I'm glad I stopped while I was ahead. I say this so that you can understand the allure that M had to me, as solid proof to me at the time that you can party AND get your work done. What a motivation &amp; confidence booster!

Turns out that the degree doesn't exist and he dropped out of school when his high school Gf dumped him and he was too sad to attend classes (f**kin pussy). One of my friend's moms met up with M's Mom in the town supermarket and she mentioned his degree. M's mom looked at my buddie's Mom dumbfounded and was like, what degree? I guess that explains that in all of the years of our friendship I have NEVER been invited into his house or formally introduced to his family despite hanging out together just about every day. 

As far as the Pancreatic Cancer goes, he had some minor procedure done and he must have told his ex they also found cancer to try and get her to feel awful. He told all of us it was cancer and rode this lie for a good 3 years until we started unraveling everything. At this point, we've started to make strides on calling him out on everything, except for the degree &amp; this. The degree is obvious, I just don't feel like arguing about it. As far as the Cancer, our bro's agree that we'd almost rather not know if it's real or not and still want to give him the benefit of the doubt due to the severity of the potential circumstance, despite never seeing any proof of this. He appears to be in perfect health, never watching his diet &amp; doing what he pleases. 

I'll write more about it below, but M has a ""charm"" about him that I've never witnessed before. It's almost creepy looking back on it how people bend to his will &amp; how incredible he seems off the bat. I felt great thinking this guy was my best friend, and I get this charisma and charm to myself &amp; I can learn and grow my confidence further. Also, keep in mind I have never had a father figure so I take what I can get in those areas to supplement. 

I remember one day he bragged about how charismatic he is and how he has a habit of splitting up groups of friends. At the time I was sure that there were other circumstances and didn't think much of it. I had introduced him to a best friend of mine, a kid that I've known the longest but didn't see as often due to our schedules. He and M hit it off and I thought it was great, until I started not seeing any of them often &amp; knowing they were just hanging out together without me.

I didn't want to look like a jealous asshole, especially amongst bro's - but one day it finally upset me enough and I cracked. I confided in M on a car ride and said that I felt like I was loosing my friendship with one of my best friends. He assured me that it was all in my head and that my other friend had mentioned nothing of the sort. 

M ended up pissing off this kid a few months down the line (more on this to come as it's relevant) and I finally re-connected with my best friend. I told him that I had had that conversation with M about how I felt that I was losing a very good friend. To my surprise, my friend said that he had had the exact same conversation with M about me, and that M said that I had never once mentioned it to him. 

At that point it was clear that he was making an effort FOR WHATEVER FUCKING REASON to try and de-rail my friendship. I still don't understand why, and try not to dwell on it simply because I feel like it's utter stupidity. We're 20 something years old, this isn't high school and certainly the last thing I'd want to deal with when spending my time with dudes.  

As for how he pissed my best friend off (who is normally extremely easy going) - we have a mutual female friend who is extremely over weight. One of the kindest girls I know, but due to her weight she acts out overly promiscuous and my friend likes to keep it in line as he is essentially like a brother to her. It was a topic that was discussed many times that if someone ever legitimately wanted to date her that they need only ask, if they truly were into her. You need to keep our ravenous dudes on a leash when she's hungry for some dick and the booze is flowing.

From my best friend's exact words to me were ""M looked me in the eyes and said ""Our friendship is more important that just fooling around for easy sex"" .""

As it turns out, because women have huge ass mouths, is that they'd get drunk and go screw around. I guess it only happened 3 times, but M's excuse was ""oh I was drunk"". Yeah? 3 times? My friend FLIPPED the fuck out, and this girl's older brothers (huge scary italian dudes) were about to kick the shit out of my best friend because this girls at home crying her eyes out saying that my friend is really mad at her. Obviously she isn't going to say ""I fucked this dude and here's the real situation"".

Sparing the rant, this is what pissed me off the most. I tried to take M out and talk to him about this. I told him that this kid is getting flack from this girls brothers due to HIS actions. He goes, ""oh, they're mad at him? Oh well, at least I'm ok."" - he then proceeded to laugh it off like a fucking joke. Meanwhile he'll be texting my friend saying he's so sorry, and that he's crying his eyes out and that he's sorry for being a shitty friend. 

Fast forward to this week, everyone's back from school including her. When we get together and he manages to come around he has her giving him back massages and shit, since this girl is still head over heels for him. She keeps begging my friend to let them fuck again, even though M is seeing another girl. He still pulls this shit, and I guarantee none of the girls he's had since have any idea about this shit. He has absolutely no problem straight up using this girl infront of all our friends &amp; her group of friends.  

It's only as I've smartened up and stopped putting this kid on a pedestal that all this shit added up. You think you fucking know a guy man, and then you find out everything about him is total bullshit he made up to feed his ego.

I can't fuckin stand him and I still see him at least once a week. Anytime someone calls him on his shit he makes up some ridiculous bullshit, its mostly entertaining at this point and none of my other friends feel like upsetting an otherwise good time to argue with this idiot, but everyone is well aware. He never gets invited out, so if he finds out what's going on he'll usually just end up inviting himself through someone else who may also happen to be going and isn't in our immediate group of friends.

Just last week we were at a pool party with a new group of girls. He doesn't even have shame anymore, he's sitting in front of 3 of our friends talking to this one girls dad about how he's going for his second degree and is being contracted by the department of defense for chemical weapons development and blah blah.

THE WORST FUCKIN PART is that people eat it up. He comes off so charasmatic, always has girls all over him even though I bust my ass at the gym and he doesn't do shit. After bullshitting this chicks dad all I could hear the other rents present talking about was how awesome that new guy that came over is. Makes me so fuckin mad.

The thing is, he IS smart. If he actually did anything with himself maybe he could achieve something. He still swears he has a degree, yet he's working at KOHLS. His Mom works at KOHLS, let's take a guess on who got their 23 year old son a job? If you have a Chemical Engineering degree, where's your fucking internship somewhere? Oh, he also switches the title of his degree from Chemical Engineering to Organic Chemistry depending on the situation, and I'm positive he thinks that I just don't care enough to remember. 


The only great thing that's come of this is for me really. For years I was so certain that this kid was for real that I adapted the qualities that I liked in myself. I worked my ass off for a year and a half to get accepted back into school full-time, while working full-time. I just finished this semester with a full course load and received A's in all of them. I'm pretty stoked - and I still party and enjoy myself quite a bit. All in moderation. My confidence has never been higher, and for this entire experience I'm actually grateful. Losing someone you're close to always blows, but I've learned way to many valuable lessons here. 

EDIT: Name's removed

EDIT:

TL;DR - Close friend lied about having a degree &amp; possibly pancreatic cancer. Uses his ridiculous charisma to carry himself through life while lying left and right, and it works. "

I have been repairing and building computers since I was 12 (first one I took  apart was a DIGITAL x386 EMM running Windows 3.1). I built and repaired over 300 computers for my friends/schoolmates/family while going to middle school and high school. In middle school my friends and I created a ""company"" (it was never incorporated), building and repairing computers for all of our friends and their families. We successfully ran that business for about 4 years till I moved away to Dallas. In Dallas, my dad needed a Linux (SuSE) Admin for his new business. So I learned how to administer a Linux Server (using CLI, didn't even touch a GUI until 5 years later), setup and maintain a webmail, IMAP, and SMTP server. Configured our local DNS using BIND command line. Even designed and maintained my dad's website and webstore. After I graduated from high school, I moved to Austin and took some time to find myself while still keeping up with my skills by occasionally helping friends out when their computers broke and keeping current on technological trends. After 3 years of staying in Austin, I moved to Killeen, TX and worked for a man who was repairing computers out of his house. He tried to convert me to Christianity, so I left that job. I started working for Acer Computers, and during my 10 months of employment there I personally repaired ~3000 desktops, laptops, servers, and projectors. The only reason I left that job was because I was moving back to Austin, and traveling 120+ miles a day for $10 an hour is not economically efficient. So, I got a job at Apple Computer doing tech support over the phone. In my 5+ years at Apple, I have assisted thousands of customers (~300 a month for 66 months) in repairing issues with their computers. My primary experience at Apple has been network and email client troubleshooting. Although, I have had plenty of experience with basic desktop/laptop troubleshooting and educational facility support as well.

Now you are probably wondering why I took the time to detail my experience to you. I don't want to be at my job anymore (it was just supposed to be a temporary placement till I got a better one). I have applied to 30+ internal positions in the past 2 years (positions that I know, realistically, I qualify for and I know I would be able to excel at). The only time I have had an interview, I was turned down for someone that I was told is more well rounded and that I am not far along enough in my career (the position was for in-house computer repair). 

So, I'm done. I am looking for a new job, preferably in the SA/NA area. What I would really like is an apprenticeship or a paid internship, learning how to do SA/NA work. I am the kind of person that as long as I'm doing what I love (building, maintaining, and repairing computers), I don't really care what I am making (within reason) and I am willing to stay right where I am. I am known for keeping good records of my case history and as a no-nonsense worker. If there is work to do, I do not slack off. If there is no work to do, I find work to do. Being unproductive when someone is paying me to be productive infuriates me to no end. I just want to do what I love, so that I don't have to hate my job and get depressed just walking in the door. It would be nice if the largest stressor in my life was not my job.

So, there you go /r/austinjobs. If you want a real resume, PM me for a link. "

Also, I need some nerd refrences, such as, ""Dear [Insert Test Subject Name Here]"" This essay is written for the incoming freshman class of a special educational program. By special I mean a rigorous and hard one, made for the smart.

  Dear [Insert Test Subject Name Here],    
   Congratulations on making what could quite possibly be the most important decision you will have to face in life. Your decision to join the Utica Center for Mathematics, Science, and Technology will not let you down. Here at UCMST, or MST as it is usually called, you will learn to make all your work MST quality work, collaborate with other students, and have many a fun time. MST may seem like a big challenge, and it is, but I know anyone who passed the entrance exam is capable of performing to the best of their abilities and will go far in school and in life in general. MST will be the best four years of your life.
    
   To start off, homework in chemistry will either put you ahead or behind. We have these things called Web Assigns, which are our homework problems that are online. We have to print them out, show our work, and submit the answers online. A word of advice, do not procrastinate, and complete your homework at least two days early, because you get .5% percent extra credit for each question you answer early. Here is where collaboration comes in handy. If you and your friends start early, you can come into school early, and help each other figure out how to solve questions they may not get. Be warned! DO NOT just tell each other the answers and have them copy the work. This is called cheating. If you copy, you also will not remember how to do the problems as well, so when it comes to test time, you will not perform as well as you would if you tried it yourself.
    	
   This next subject varies greatly from student to student, C++. Either you will love C++ as I did, or you can’t stand it and wish it over. To me, C++ is a third language, a puzzle, and a potential future career. I love puzzles as you may, so in C++ when you have to figure out ways to make your program compute something, return a value, or do anything, I found it exciting and invigorating. I loved trying to find what the simplest and most concise way to the end product would be. A C++ program may look like the code in the image below. C++ coding is a way of innovative problem solving to get a solution for a problem that may be as simple as finding prime numbers, or as complex as program that renders terrain, uses coded in physics, and a GUI engine, or in other words, a video game. Whether you like C++ or not, it will be a major help for your junior year when you take AP Java. Java is a coding language very similar to C++. The bottom line is whether you are intimidated by C++, love it, or are appalled by it, take your time when learning it, and try to understand what each thing in a program does. It can help you through the course.
    
   So far, we have covered chemistry and C++. You may think next would be advice to math, but almost everyone understood math, so I do not think there is much to advise you on. Instead, this will be about what opportunities, both in high school and out, MST can provide for you. As a requirement for our junior year at this fabulous establishment, each student has to get an internship. This means that you can get hands on experience in a career field you may find intriguing. Do not worry if you do not like the internship, you just escaped wasting part of your college life on this. Now, as for the more distant future, MST can put you well ahead of others. You will have a better high school education, and more knowledge then the competition. You will be smart, well informed, committed to what you do, and more. These are all key things for your life out of school, which MST conveniently provides. You may ask, “Why are you telling me this? I thought this was a survival guide.” Well, here is the connection. Pay attention, do your work, and find what interests you. If you do not do these things here at MST, you will not be as committed, as smart, as informed, as educated, or as capable as you could be. What you do now pays off in the future. So, try your hardest, do your homework, and most importantly, have a passion for learning. With these things, you will surely excel in school and in life.
    	
At this point, you may not know what you should take out of this. Let me help you out there. At MST, you need to try your hardest on everything, do your work, find what you like doing, stick to it, collaborate on ideas (not answers), and more. With MST comes many late nights, lots of trips to the pop machines, and stress, but MST also comes with an excelling education, many great people to become friends with, pie,  fun activities, random food bribes (basically lots of free treats such as doughnuts, cake, and more), Pi day, pie, fun clubs, afterschool events (such as lock-ins and tournaments), and more pie! MST is an unforgettable experience you will NEVER regret going through. As a sophomore this year, I can personally say you will survive school and I wish you the best of luck in your educational endeavors. 
    
Live Long and Prosper

I let it go on. He kept saying he'd ""get me back"" but it never happened. I dropped $400 on entertainment, gas, and food over the course of a few days because he said he'd ""get me back."" 

What I realized upon him leaving, was that he didn't mean he'd give me cash, but that he would one day make it up to me somehow. I talked to one of our mutual friends about this and she said that this is not out of character and no one invites him to do anything anymore. The picture he painted was that every one ditched him because he was the only single guy. He is a super cool dude so I figured our coupled friends were just nesting and didn't wanna hang with a single dude. Totally not the case. 

Now he is gone and I have spent my bill money on his entertainment. I can bounce back, but it is going to be tight and I am frustrated. Not only did he not pay a dime for anything, he was also messy, ate all my food (he would open a box of something and finish it, even after I said he could have ""one or two""), and left a mess. He also messed up my antique dresser by putting a cup of ice water on it and leaving it for days, after being told specifically not to use that dresser for cups or food. I almost moved it out of my guest room when he came to stay, but figured laying down some rules would be good enough... nope.

So, while I will still be friendly with him, I will never have him as a guest ever again. Is it worth it to bring this stuff up? I don't want to ask for money, but I feel that I would like to know if I were a crappy guest... even if the truth was hard to take. The problem is he is super emotional and will probably take it wrong. No one likes to hear a laundry list of things they did wrong.

How do I approach this? Do I even approach it? We weren't super close in the first place so distancing him won't be a big deal. We are both 27, and I have lived on my own for 10 years while he went through school living with mom and has never had a real job outside of being an R.A. and an intern, which I think is a big part of the problem. He technically lives at home but sleeps over at some of his friends bachelor pads 6/7 nights a week. 

tl;dr Crappy guest just left. Do I tell him I am upset or just forget it since he is gone and I let it happen"

I could be wrong since I haven't been browsing this sub much lately, but a search gave me nothing. Here are my questions:

1. I will only be 20 throughout the summer even though I'm going into my senior year (my birthday is super late). I was wondering if you guys can shed some light on the social aspect of interning and how not being legal drinking age here in the US might affect my experience outside of work with other interns as well as the trip that I've heard many people take (to Florida, etc.). I'm a little worried that a lot of socializing and whatnot might be done out at bars where I wouldn't be able to attend and I don't want to end up as an outcast (for lack of a better term) because I can't go out with everyone.

2. On a different topic, I'm also looking for others' experiences with their job offers after the internship. Did you try and get an offer in a different city than where you interned? This is an important question for me so I'm wondering how the whole transferring process has worked out for others since, if I plan on sticking with my company, seeking an offer for a different city is something I've been thinking about. This doesn't seem like something that is often allowed, but I thought I'd ask for everyone's input.

Sorry if this is a little unorganized I don't have time to look over it before I post. Hopefully by the time I check again we'll have some good discussion and I hope none of this is the same questions this sub gets all the time. Thanks!"

Do we want it to be a big circlejerk of ""look at this item relevant to film that mentions Louisiana"" or do we actually want to help develop our industry by supporting each other in whatever way we can?

**Things I Did Right**

Today I accepted a position for a paid Software Engineering Internship. I spent last summer in depression at home.

I've spent the last two and a half months going to the gym and running around my University 3 days a week. Last quarter, I sat in front of my computer all day.

I've missed 2 lectures this quarter - I used to skip 2 lectures in a day.

**Something I Screwed Up**

The only goal where I've hit a wall is music, and I need your advice. I wanted to start a band, and I started playing with someone: a girl whose ability far surpassed mine. You can probably see where this is headed. At first we just played music, but it turned out we had a lot more in common besides a common passion for clarinets and phrygrian scales. The lines between having a jam session and having a talking-about-life session began to blur. She has a boyfriend, but the way we interacted, always alone, talking for hours about things, confused the shit out of me. A few days ago I told her I couldn't be friends with her. But she didn't like me - she really did just want to be friends.

I used to be a forever alone/'nice guy'/etc. who would dwell upon That One Special Girl instead of dating people, and I thought I had moved past it. It's ingrained into me that it's pointless to like someone who will never return your affection - and my feelings for her dissipated with my new found knowledge. So now I really do want to be her friend, and play music with her, etc. But I'm afraid I've permanently damaged our friendship, and that even if I apologize she will still be averse to spending any extended periods of time with me.

However, there are definitely aspects of the website that are either out of my expertise (ie: Design) or that are simply out of my ability as a programmer. At what point is it a good idea to bring more people onto the project? How do I find these people? Should I try and raise capital and find investors? How do I do that?

It's a pretty daunting/overwhelming thought for me to start my own project like this. I have no business experience. I had a couple high school internships at Microsoft, but my knowledge of running a business/project is next to nill. I feel like this:

I am originally from Bangladesh and have been living in Canada as a student for the past 3 years. I have spent 6 years in the middle-east before coming to Canada. I have been an ex-muslim for 5 years. My journey towards the light has been a long and extremely difficult journey, due to me being in the middle-east and my family being  conservative muslims.

my sister (the main ""offender"") is 24, married to the ward mission leader, two kids, has a master's in early childhood education, a primary teacher... basically the epitome of the perfect mormon wife.

i know that what she does, she does out of love and genuine concern for my ""eternal soul"".  after all, i can't make it to the celestial kingdom without an eternal companion.  i know this because i used to believe the same thing.  but this past week she did something that for some reason has really gotten under my skin:  she set me up with a complete stranger (to her as well as me) for no other reason than the fact that we both live in the same city.

basically, she met a girl who lives in my same city (and who she described as ""very attractive"") and gave her my phone number, telling her to give me a call.  i don't know much about the exchange other than that.  what i do know is that i got a call from this girl - who just finished her first year of law school at BYU and is working an internship with the DA here - offering me a ride to church.

i've *never* been more uncomfortable on a phone call.  luckily, i was out of town on sunday, so i was able to at least delay said fellowshipping effort, but i have a very difficult time saying ""no"" to people - especially people i don't know, so i agreed to ride with her next week (though i had forgotten that i'm going to be out of town again, so there'll be another awkward phone convo where i delay again).

so here's my dilemma:  i don't know what this girl's expectations are - i'm not opposed to going on a date with her, but i *really* don't want to be a reactivation project.  i don't know exactly what my sister told her, either.

my sister at this point knows i'm ""not that into the church"".  she knows that i smoke - or at least her husband does, and i'd be seriously surprised if he'd kept that secret from her.  my father knows i drink, and he found my condoms a while back while helping me clean my old car for sale.  even if he hasn't shared these things with my sister, there are other signs.  i rarely attend church when i'm visiting her or my parents.  i didn't stand in the circle during her sons' baby blessings, and when my best friend since childhood got married last month, i waited outside the temple.  i've never had a formal ""i don't believe"" talk with any of my family, but they know i'm not the wide-eyed RM i once was.

i'm actually really upset about this.  i don't like confrontation.  i love my sister to death, and i don't want to do anything to alienate her from me.  at the same time, i can't handle her attempts to save me - especially not if it involves pimping me out to random strangers.  any advice (on either problem - how to talk to my sister, or how to approach interaction with this new girl) would be greatly appreciated."

My girlfriend on the other hand can't seem to leave the social media alone.

uly1p,1,2012-06-05,Problem scraping site with foreign characters,der_berliner,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/uly1p/problem_scraping_site_with_foreign_characters/,"hey everyone,

I need help with a scraper I'm writing. I'm trying to scrape a table of university rankings, and some of those schools are European universities with foreign characters in their names (e.g. ä, ü). I'm already scraping another table on another site with foreign universities in the exact same way, and everything works fine. But for some reason, the current scraper won't work with foreign characters (and as far as parsing foreign characters, the two scrapers are exactly the same). 

Here's what I'm doing to try &amp; make things work:

1) Declare encoding on the very first line of the file:
    
    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

2) Importing &amp; using smart unicode from django framework
    from django.utils.encoding import smart_unicode

    school_name = smart_unicode(html_elements[2].text_content(), encoding='utf-8', strings_only=False,
    errors='strict').encode('utf-8')

3) Use encode function, as seen above when chained with the smart_unicode function. 

I can't think of what else I could be doing wrong. Before dealing with these scrapers, I really didn't understand much about different encoding, so it's been a bit of an eye-opening experience. I've tried reading the following, but still can't overcome this problem

* http://farmdev.com/talks/unicode/

* http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html

I understand that in an encoding, every character is assigned a number, which can be expressed in hex, binary, etc. Different encodings have different capacities for how many languages they support (e.g. ASCII only supports English, UTF-8 supports everything it seems. However, I feel like I'm doing everything necessary to ensure the characters are printed correctly. I don't know where my mistake is, and it's driving me crazy.

Please help!!

EDIT: I just found out that the 1 doesn't have anything to do with the input/output of the program. It just allows you to insert non-ASCII characters into the source code. That's one less possible culprit. 

EDIT 2: 

I'm currently using the lxml library (http://lxml.de/). Unfortunately I'm not sure if I'm allowed to use another external library like BeautifulSoup (this is for an internship). I'll have to check to see if it's OK. 

Sure, here's the site I'm trying to scrape: 

http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2011-2012/top-400.html

What I mean by ""won't work"" is that it doesn't give me the correct output. Take the following university for example, I want the name to be stored exactly like this (in this case, with umlauts over the u's). 

* ""ETH Zürich - Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zürich"" 

Unfortunately, I get garbage like this:

* ETH ZÃ¼rich - Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ZÃ¼rich 

I'm not entirely sure why, especially when I've already scraped another site with foreign universities, and every university name was parsed &amp; stored correctly. Here's a link to that site: http://www.webometrics.info/top500_europe.asp?offset=00

EDIT 3: 

Ok, I'll try to include more details. When I say ""I get"", I mean that I'm 

* Printing to the console in PyCharm 2.5.1 running a Python 2.7.2 interpreter in a virtual env. The improperly displayed output (see above) is what's printed. 

* I'm currently saving the university name &amp; details in a dictionary. I set a breakpoint &amp; run the debugger so I can see exactly how the university name is stored in the dict, and the improperly-displayed output above is what's stored as the key (while the rest of the information is stored in another dict, which in turns serves as the value in the first dict).  

So if the site that, at the moment, doesn't work is encoded in UTF-8, then something on my side needs to expect input that's encoded in UTF-8, right? To be honest, I'm actually not sure if I should be concerned with the parsing library, the IDE, or something else entirely. I thought that by using the smart_unicode &amp; the encode(utf-8) functions would have taken care of that, but that's clearly not the case.

In any case, I've been given permission to test BeautifulSoup, so I think that'll be my first step (although I read a blog post that said lxml is superior to BeautifulSoup when it comes to performance, but that's immaterial in this case since this code doesn't need to scale really). 

Any other input would be greatly appreciated. I'm still new to Python, but I'm really trying! Special thanks to Rhombold for your input. Have an upboat!

**&lt;TL;DR&gt; My elderly Indian (as in the country, not the race) parents are visiting my brother for a month and I need to figure out a list of activities, tours, sight-seeing trips, etc. for them. Any help would be appreciated!**

Now, for a little back-story: My parents will be in San Diego for a month between June 15th and July 12th meeting up with my younger brother who works as a student intern at an organization in San Diego. They will be staying with him, so accommodation seems to be taken care of. He lives somewhere near the Black Mountain Open Space Park, Poway. (Google maps tells me that it is a little ways from central San Diego, so I'm not sure if the definitive list still applies...)

Since he is new to the area (NEU student, orginally) he doesn't have much of an idea about things to do in and around San Diego. So I thought, I'd ask you! I've been checking up on the internet and have found a good list of things but most of them don't seem like something an elderly Indian couple could do. :D

To give you a brief idea: We're Indian. Mom and Dad are both 50+ and are enthusiastic about traveling. This is my Dad's first trip out of the country. Mom's recently visited my cousin in Germany, so she's had her taste of the 'new world culture shock' phenomenon. Of the three of them, only my brother can drive and he will be working five days a week. So, they'll probably spend most of the time cooped up in the house. 

From the tentative location on Google maps, it seems there isn't much to do around the place. My brother's planned a trip to Vegas (I'm not sure if it's a good idea to take your parents to Vegas but hey, when in Rome, right?) and a few other such well-known spots. 

Here's a list of questions I was hoping you guys could answer: 

* If you are from around the area I mentioned, can you suggest a lits of things to do and places to see?
* How's the public transport system to and from central San Diego in the area? What are the available options?
* Assuming my brother won't be able/available to drive them around, what are some nice, clean, leisurely activities for an elderly couple in and around the area? 
* Or, provided public transport/mass-transit to central San Diego is a viable option, what places must they absolutely 'check out' in and around the area? 
* Any idea about how safe the area in which they are staying, is?Are there any places that they must absolutely avoid? 

Any information you can provide would be a great help! Thanks, in advance. :)"

Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wap1j?context=5)|Advice -- it's never too late to change your major. I ""retired"" from the business and am back in school getting a second degree in something totally unrelated. But if you insist on being a journalist, make sure you have a portfolio or tape of your work you've done at school or as part of an internship. I can't stress the importance of an internship enough. Don't have your heart set on one particular job. Expand your skills set so you can be a jack of all trades. You may want to be a reporter, but you might have to work as an assignment desk editor for a while. Don't turn down any chances to learn something new. When I started, although I was working primarily with a paper, I was going out with the local tv news crew learning how to shoot and edit video. That progressed to me being called to shoot a story if we were lacking photogs or reporters for whatever reason. I made myself a great tape that way. If you write, keep EVERYTHING.
 |The role of verification still exists to some degree, but it's a little loose. You may read or hear the words ""We're getting reports of suchandsuch.."" That's news talk for ""This might be going on but we don't have any concrete proof. We'll let you know for sure when we find out, but we wanted to let you know in case it is true so we can later say we brought it to your attention first.""
 |I was a little burnt out and jaded, so my view on the future of the business is bleak. That's another reason why I left it all behind. Shady things go on sometimes. People are being laid off left and right, more people are turning to the web for news so advertisers are leaving tv and print which leads to budget cuts. The business is changing, but it's always going to exist in some shape or form. 
[If so few of the employees were true conservatives, how did they reconcile their beliefs with the ""slant"" Fox news has?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wabx4?context=5)|It's like working on a busted septic tank.. you just hold your breath, wade through the shit, and get your work done. Just about every show has a production meeting. During the meeting stories would be pitched and how each segment would be presented would be discussed. Often there were eye rolls and audible sighs, but we knew what was expected of us and we just did it.
[Also, how did the employees view the reputation of fox news (i.e. its a punchline for half the country\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wabx4?context=5)|It varies. Many employees were proud to work there. Fox is the number one news source and has been since it started. We have the numbers and the ratings, and in this business that's all that matters. Others were self deprecating and joined in on the jokes, and some were ashamed of themselves and the work they were doing.
[I find that many people involved with journalism tend to give it a sacred quality of sorts. They tend to think that the country is ""owed"" solid journalism, and that a good journalism serves an important function in any free society.  Were there still people like that at Fox, or does everyone's idealism die out after a time? Did anyone ever fight the direction a story was going to take?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wand7?context=5)|Absolutely there were people who thought their jobs were ""sacred."" You'd think they were curing cancer or something, and these were the people who were the worst to work for and with. Amazing how we could fit so many people into the newsroom with all the egos taking up a lot of free space.  Many people lost their idealism. Myself included. At some point a lot of us had some eye opening experience that made us look around and think ""this is total bullshit.""
[This is interesting. Where/who did the 'angles' come from? Are the producers ever keyed in to the GOP's official talking points of the day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wf68p?context=5)|We know everybody's talking points. Usually before a politician (Republican or Democrat) was going to make an announcement or give a speech, we had a good idea what was going to be said. You'll hear intros to that kind of story kinda like this ""The president is expected to talk about his plan for job creation today...""
[*We have the numbers and the ratings, and in this business that's all that matters.*  Ah, the old argumentum popularum. Did it ever occur to you that journalists at actual news organizations (not the propaganda mill you worked at\) take legitimate pride in their work and don't have to compromise their beliefs or ethics just to keep their jobs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wb6yu?context=5)|Name a valid actual news organization. 
[What was your eye opening experience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4whkuh?context=5)|Mine came when somebody very close to me was killed in Iraq. He had about a month to go before he came home. He left behind a young son who would really never get to know how awesome his dad was. I was in the editing room working on a package about how everything was just peachy keen in job related news when I got the call.

Shall I go on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wbcuy?context=5)|Bless your heart. Did you know Wall Street Journal is part of the News Corp family. Fox is News Corp. NY Times, ABC, NBC and reuters have been racked with scandals throughout the years. We weren't allowed to use Reuters sources for quite some time because of the erroneous reporting (and this was before I started at Fox and was working local gigs). I would consider AP to be the most reliable of all the ones you've listed.

I can't speak for Glenn Beck, but funnily enough a couple of the nicest guys were Hannity and Huckabee. 
[Have you met O'Reilly? He seems like one of the more laid back and humorous personalities, considering his various Daily Show/SNL appearances. But then again, the ""we'll do it live!"" video would show otherwise.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wd24g?context=5)|I've met him several times, and I plead the 5th.

[Did they ask you to sign a gag order or anything along those lines when you quit? I saw Outfoxed too, and I think a couple of the people that spoke in it had to. I can't recall if this was because they got fired, or just because they left the company. I just found it interesting.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wa1sb?context=5)|On my last day, I had an exit interview with HR. I had to hand in my ID badge (which also served as a key card), and I remember signing something confirming that I was leaving on my on free will, that I met with HR and they explained to me termination of benefits and things like that. I don't remember signing a non-disclosure agreement. It's possible that I may have, but I left on good terms and my permanent record there says I'm allowed to be re-hired.
 |I know a couple of people that were asked to go that had to sign forms. I also know a man who was part of the Outfoxed documentary. He used to hang out in one of the nearby bars that was frequented by employees. He would try to get us to talk to him about what was going on because he wanted to write a book. Fox knew all about that. We weren't allowed to talk to him, and I don't think anybody ever had a fuck to give for his book anyway. 
[You were not allowed to talk to him? That's illegal.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4whrmk?context=5)|We never got a memo saying ""Don't take to the creepy guy at the pub or you'll be fired."" We werent allowed to talk about the company when money was involved. The guy didn't have enough of his own stories, so he would try to get us to talk, so he could finish his book and sell it. It wasn't exactly a secret, what he was doing either. 
[That is also illegal.  Surprising you didn't know that.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wjms1?context=5)|I've worked for many companies who didn't allow employees to ""sell"" information. I didn't think it was a big deal, and I never felt my rights were violated, and I don't care enough to sue.
[Why did you reconsider your political beliefs? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4w9e6j?context=5)|Well, there were lots of little reasons... I'll just say I got tired of drinking the kool-aid.

When the economy started to tank while Bush was in office and all the other news channels were talking about how we were going into a recession and it might be another great depression, we had to show things were not-so-bad. For example, when the housing market bubble burst and foreclosures were happening left and right, I wrote a story that went a little something like, ""Housing prices are at an all time low and it's a good time to buy!"" When the market tanked- ""Cheap stocks to buy now!"" and countless stories about why we needed to invade Iraq. 
[If your story didn't approach the situation from the angle they wanted to frame it in would it get cut, or edited or what? What would they say if you tried to do a story in an angle they didn't like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4weibf?context=5)|It would usually just get edited ( a little re-wording here and there). Stories would only be cut as a time management issue, if we were running over time, we'd slide the story into another show or broadcast hour. 
[Do you ever feel embarrassed to tell people where you worked?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wcpxs?context=5)|Ha!Ha! This is an awesome question. Yes. At home (in the south), if people asked where I worked I told them because I knew they'd be impressed (bless their hearts). In NYC, when somebody asked what I did for a living I would say ""Oh, I work in journalism."" That would usually end the conversation. If they pressed me and asked where I would say Fox, and 9 times out of 10 they assumed I meant the Fox 5 (a local channel), and I would let them assume because a lot of New Yorkers enjoyed watching the Fox 5 morning program. They would ask me a lot about Ernie Anastos, and I would say he was awesome and fun to work with although I had never laid eyes on him in my life. 
[How is fox not a valid oranization ? Hollaback just cause you don't agree with their opinons don't attack the guy. And if you really wanna get into a flame war allmost all major news orgs are slanted.

Nearly all media have a slant. Let's say the stock market is crashing..again.. Fox uses this story to tell you why it's the perfect time to buy stock (because the prices are all so cheap!) They're right. The prices are cheap. I've used this phrase before, Fox is telling the same story **with their version of the truth**. MSNBC, CNN, Headline News consistently lose to Fox in the ratings. Why? Because their audiences are mostly liberal and the liberal viewers are split among three networks. Somebody should wise up and start another conservative news outlet to finally give Fox some competition and maybe, just maybe, dethrone them.

The production assistant position was hourly. When I became a writer, I was given the option of being salaried or hourly. I chose to remain an hourly employee because I could make more money annually with all the overtime. This check was clearly from a slow news week. 
[I once saw a facebook post from fox news linking to an article on their site about all of the Christian persecution is the middle east, with a couple jabs about it happening in america.  The next post linked to a story about ""bizarre weather,"" going on all over america, but the storms didn't even really seem all that wild. Tornados in the bible belt, hurricane in the gulf, thunder storms in cali....  To me, it seemed calculated and hugely manipulative. Do you this level of manipulation is something Fox News is capable of pulling off intentionally? Or am I just being paranoid? Would they really use scare tactics like this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wcvyd?context=5)|They don't have to do much manipulating. Most of Fox News viewers and readers are conservative, live in the bible belt, and are crazy religious. They throw the bait, and the fish come to the surface.  The Fox Nation site, on the other hand, well... that's an entirely different beast. It was just starting when I was leaving. That's...that's.... there are no words for what it is. It scares me. 
[Please tell us more about the Fox Nation site! I want to know how they come up with the bullshit they put on there!

I'm not sure what this means. Did I feel I had a message to spread? No. I applied for a job at Fox because it was my goal, as a young, naive journalist, to work for a major network one day. At the time, I was a fan of Fox News. It was relatively new and different then than it is now. I had no ulterior motive for working there.

I went through a few rounds of phone interviews and had to take a current events test before I was made an offer. Writers/producers were required at the time to take a writing test.

I don't know anyone who's killed himself over ratings, but working in news can be a soul crushing experience.

[How were the HR practices by way of movement or promotion within the company.  I.E. were you able to move around laterally within the organization provided you met the required competencies as opposed to the company making outside hires?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wcnj2?context=5)|I think there were more outside hires for several reasons -- most of the positions that became available were entry level production assistant positions (because people would be promoted or just leave after a while). If a new show was launching, Fox would use a few in house producers and then hire writers and such from outside. Also, to keep costs low, instead of promoting someone from within and having to give them a raise, they'd hire from the outside and lowball salary.

You have to work your ass off. Some people try really hard for a while and then burn out, and keep their shitty jobs. It can be a soul crushing experience. 
[In your opinion, is Fox more concerned with reporting the news or viewership and ratings? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wcngg?context=5)|They aren't concerned at all about ratings. They kill the competitors and it's been that way since they started. You might see ridiculous adds like ""11 years of being your number one news channel."" They have worked to broaden the viewership demographics. They've got the lock on the old white man market, but increasingly try to gain the viewership of the oft-coveted 18-35 demo. They work hard to ""improve"" (for lack of a better word) programming to gain younger viewers.
[What was your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4w95cy?context=5)|I started as a production assistant (worked with the video department, graphics, and ran scripts). I was promoted a couple of times, and left as a writer.

The newsroom isn't split into different departments. We don't have a sports department to write sports stories or a political department to write political bits. All writers must be up to date on current events and on-going stories. I've written lots of stuff from bears falling out of trees, the market ""crashing,"" and bombings in the Middle East.
[Do you currently work as a journalist?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ukv42/i_worked_at_fox_news_no_im_not_the_mole_amaa/c4wblmx?context=5)|I may do some freelance work from time, but I no longer consider myself a journalist.

ulq7p,6,2012-06-05,Need advice: brother just came out of the closet to me and seems depressed. I don't know what to do.,Dontknowwhattodo987,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ulq7p/need_advice_brother_just_came_out_of_the_closet/,"Reddit, please please please give me advice. I don't know what to do and I don't know where to post this. This is so long and I don't know how to condense it. I just got off the phone with my younger brother (20 years old) and can't stop crying. I know he needs lots of counseling and therapy, but there's no way we can afford it, nor is he comfortable opening up to someone in general.


My brother has always been quiet and always keeps to himself. He has friends, but it doesn't seem like he gets super close to them. Today, he told me he was gay. I have no problem with, but I'm worried that my family will since most everyone else other than my immediate family lives in Asia. My parents will be somewhat uncomfortable, but I think will eventually come to be okay with it. We're not very close with our parents, which also leads to many problems. Before I talk about that, I want to write out what happened today.

He's been hooking up with guys that he's been meeting through on an app. He started dating one of the guys exclusively who is supposedly a sex addict. This guy told my brother the urges stopped because he met him. I don't know how long this has been going on for, but my brother said that this guy has met up with others from the app but ""hasn't done anything."" My brother doesn't know what to do. Gay or straight, it's too suspicious to me. My brother doesn't want to leave this guy because he's the first person he's opened up to ever and especially doesn't want to leave him if he's a sex addict (I don't know the dude, but it sounds like this guy is guilt tripping my brother into staying with him). I told my brother to leave him and nurse his heartbreak by getting outside, blocking this guy on facebook, hitting the gym (typical reddit breakup advice). My brother seems to be apprehensive about breaking it off with him. The guy told him that he stopped himself from doing anything with the person that he met up with because he thought of my brother. I think fucking bullshit. The intention was there. How do I get him to stay away from this guy?

I asked him if he's gotten tested and he said yes, so I think he's clean. When I told him to go to the gym, he just said that he just really doesn't want to be around people. It makes me so sad, I don't know what to say or do. I want him to be safe and I want him to be happy.

He's an only child and is the only boy in the family. I knew he always kind of felt this way, but today was the first time he's voiced it. My parents have always had higher expectations for him because he's the lone male child, and I don't know how to change that. He knows my parents care about him, but doesn't really feel it. He can't stand being around them and he wants to move out ASAP. We have a rough relationship with our parents and it's not because they're horrible parents, but they don't know how to show affection. Their way of showing us they care is by being on our cases all the time. I moved away for college and am now living in San Francisco doing an internship. They love us and we understand that, but there is a language barrier so it's hard for us to communicate. The kids don't really speak Mandarin, whereas my parents don't speak English that well.

My brother never comes out to eat dinner with the family, never really talks to anyone in our family. My parents are very asian and used to spank us when we were little. It stopped a long time ago after they realized that it's not acceptable in America. My brother said he's getting flashbacks to when they used to spank us. It seems like he's getting a lot of abandonment feelings and I want him to talk to someone, but he's not comfortable with talking to people and opening up. He's never really been very close to anyone, has always kept to himself. How do I get him to talk to someone? Do I refer him to LGBT for support? We have so many family affection issues that don't have to do with him being gay. How do I fix this? My parents can' afford counseling, I wouldn't even know how to bring it up.

My little sister is also young and I don't want her to go through the same family problems that we both grew up in. I consider myself a strong and secure person, but I think it's because I've always had a very close-knit group of friends.

I think my brother is thinking about suicide. I'm trying to be there as much as I can without physically being there. He didn't tell me anything, but I've had a friend commit suicide and this seems too similar. Reddit, I'm sorry this is so long, but can you help me with any advice please?

EDIT: He just said he's going to a gun range tomorrow. That's okay right? It'll help him get his mind off things? This makes me really nervous for some reason, even though I probably shouldn't be."
ulq5u,2,2012-06-05,"Reddit, the last couple years have been tough as far as college goes.  I should have graduated this past semester but some sort of depression or something of the like has caused me to become uninspired when it comes to most classes.  What helps you stay on track?",keebler3337,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ulq5u/reddit_the_last_couple_years_have_been_tough_as/,"As I said I should have graduated in May, but due to some circumstances I couldn't control, and a lot of circumstances that were within my control, I did not graduate.  Part of this was because I hadn't done an internship yet, part of it was because for some reason I could not get myself going to go to class or do homework.  The entire time I knew it had to be done, and I did it the first two weeks every semester, but then it hit me like a brick wall where I would only go to two classes and fail the others.  The only ones I attended were within my major.  I don't know why I do it, I wish I could force myself to stop but I have a hard time convincing myself to do so.  So, how do you give yourself the motivation to do things you know you have to do but do not want to do?

TLDR; I know I need to get these classes done, but lack of motivation/ some kind of depression makes it nearly impossible, need advice."

ullyu,1,2012-06-05,Nothing huge... I'm just so damn frustrated with my own self defeating attitude and inaction,19Throwaway91,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/ullyu/nothing_huge_im_just_so_damn_frustrated_with_my/,"Well, this my my chance to whine and complain like a bratty kid and not feel bad about it. 

Every single day I fantasize about how my life would be different if I had a do-over. I have a mother who loves me and is extremely supportive. If I opened up to her she would be very compassionate. I will never open up to her though. It's not how my mind works. My father and I have a very shallow relationship. He's a great guy, but I have never talked to him about anything more personal than sports or vacation plans.

Through highschool I was friendless. I had people who I enjoyed to hang out with at school, but we never interacted outside of school. This would probably be surprising if you met me because I tend to be very spontaneous and lighthearted when I'm with a group. Now I'm in college and I made a tight knit group of friends. We went on road trips and cooked together. Now for no reason I'm just backing away from them. Avoiding them. No reason at all. I'm stressed because of what I'm doing and I'm doing what I'm doing because I'm stressed.

I fit a common stereotype on reddit. Coasted through highschool without any effort whatsoever and did excellent on standardized tests so my parents though I was some sort of genius destined for fame and fortune. Thought this success was some inherent part of myself and I expect things to fall into place without me taking initiative. Now I'm an engineering student at a mediocre school who's grades are getting progressively worse and worse. I should study, but I have no motivation. (What a terrible excuse, eh?) I may fail a class for the first time ever when grades are released in a couple days. Classes are the sum total of my accomplishments so far in life, so that hits hard. 

I've been a lazy bum when it comes to applying to engineering internships, so it comes as no surprise that I didn't get one. I'm an engineering student who will graduate at the end of next school year with no internship, or research experience with a mediocre gpa. Hopefully I'll get a internship period to hire deal at some engineering firm.

I think I hit the nail on the head with this: ""I expect things to fall into place without me taking initiative"" 

(Summary of the ""Wah wah, I don't have a girlfriend paragraph."": I friendzone girls who show attraction to me. Why? No reason and I hate myself for doing it.) I'm only a little socially awkward and can pass it off as bashful, in fact I love good discussions. I'm not overweight or anything, in fact I'm athletic and love ourdoorsy things. Still, I've never been on a date, never held hands, never kissed (Virgin goes without saying?) at 21 y/o. There's been a few girls who were definitely relationship material. Hell, for a year and a half a wonderful girl and I had a mutual crush. Did I do anything about it? Ha! Good joke! I even went to her house a few times with a group of friends, was sitting in the hot tub right in front of her and told her to her face that I thought she was awesome, but no, I didn't want a relationship. What the fuck brain??? Why'd you say that??? You hurt her feelings and she's just laid it on the line. I'm not gonna break out of my shell. She moved away. Recently, there's been a cute girl who has been going out of her way to say hi and smiles at me from far away. I suspect that she's been interested in me for a while. I plan on doing precisely nothing about it.

I've also disappointed some other people more recently whom I respect. Purely by my inaction.

I know exactly what I need to do to get rid of my problems, but I don't do it. I never have. Will I ever? Only time will tell.

Well, that's all for now folks. If you know who I am, please pretend you don't. Anyways, I realize I'll probably look back at this in 10 years and think it's completely inconsequential, just like I do now with ridiculous 8th grade drama, but I'm angsty and frustrated at myself. Perhaps I'm a little bit depressed. Not really though... I still find humor everywhere. It's just that there's the person I know I could be and he's awesome, then there's the person I am. I know what I need to do to fix it, but for no reason at all, I don't. What the hell. C'mon! Just do it! ... Sigh ...

I think I'll feel better over the summer."

(Civil/Environmental),Salty_Fetus,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/ulhzo/entry_level_engineering_jobs_where_one_can_learn/,"Ill try and keep this short, and any insight would be really appreciated. Basically, I graduated in May from an Engineering school in Virginia with a Civil degree. I had a great GPA, a bunch of experience doing field engineering for development in the third world (Haiti) over the summers, and landed an internship with a city public utilities department (water/wastewater). The job is good, pays ok, and Im learning a good deal, but it will only last for a few months. Its also 90% an office job, and Ive quickly learned that being in an office 40-50 hours is not exactly my cup of tea. 

Basically, I was wondering what suggestions people had for types of jobs/internships to look for that would teach me a lot and get me outdoors. Pay isnt too big of an issue, as long as I can eat and pay rent Im cool. I was considering trying to be a construction inspector or get on a survey crew, but Im not sure if these would assist me in looking for future engineering positions or be that educational.

Perhaps Im being too picky and I should just apply to anything I can and pray I get a callback. Maybe Im not even in the right field and every engineering job just lands you in an office for the rest of your life. I have no idea, this is all so new and a little overwhelming. Ive been constantly searching on the usual websites like Indeed and Monster and Craigslist, but nothing too interesting (or entry-level) has really come up. Like I said, any insight or advice would be very very welcome!

tl;dr: Recent graduate, looking for a position that wont have me in an office all day and will teach me about civil engineering more, any advice would be awesome

edit for a little more info: I have passed the EIT (woo!), our school's career center is garbage, and I need find a job where I can stay in Virginia"

When I was first told that the internship would be at Louisville, I was a little worried. I'm from the southern part of Florida (actually I've noticed quite a bit of Florida plates), so to me going *anywhere* in Kentucky might as well been like sending me into the boonies. Needless to say, I was very pleasantly surprised upon arrival. Everyone that comes up to visit has the same impression.

The state itself is fucking gorgeous. Coming from nothing but flatness and endless heat, anything with more than one hill in it puts me in awe. The people are friendly (though I will say it depends on where you go), and theres no shortage of things to do.

One thing though...and this bothers me to no end. It isn't the way you guys say Louisville, LaFayette, or any other French named thing most of America admittedly butchers anyway. It isn't the food. Oh dear God, it isn't the food. It is *absolutely* not the food.

Its the driving. You guys can't drive worth salt. I've been here twice, for a total of around one year, and it never fails to amaze me how absolutely horrifying the drivers are. At first I thought it was the snow. Sure, being from Florida myself I wasn't the greatest, but I made do and managed to not break down sign posts *constantly*. OK, it will definitely get better in the summer.

No, it doesn't. Somehow, its worse than before. The merging lane is for **merging**. When approaching a merge, it would be awful nice if you moved one lane over. You know, to avoid slowing down traffic? People getting on won't magically just disappear or stop. They're going to get on, whether you block it or not. The blame isn't placed solely on those blocking the merge, the mergers are pretty asstastic, too. If you're getting ready to enter high-speed traffic, you should try to *at least match the speed of the highway*. Why the fuck are you going 10 mph *less* than everyone else?

If that isn't bad enough, once you actually get on the highway, it isn't any better. Do people here know what the mirrors on their car are for? This isn't a huge game of deathly bumper cars, look before you haphazardly dive into a lane.

When it rains, the road is not trying to kill you. You don't have to **stop in the middle of the highway** (yes, this has happened) or slam on the damn breaks every time you approach a light. You can go fast, in fact, pretend it isn't even raining. Just leave a little room between cars for once, and everything will be fine. Breathe. Relax. Take a deep breath and let some oxygen flow through your system.

There is also the fact that **red lights are a totally foreign concept**. Its comical how many people will cruise straight through a red like it isn't even a thing. Bitch, *you can die from that!* I know you're probably thinking ""dude it doesn't even happen that much!"" Well, that may be true, but I will say in Miami I can count the number of times I've seen it happen on one hand. Literally. This is in Miami, where cops don't give a shit unless you're throwing crack out your window and shooting them with an automatic rifle like some game of drug dealer's skeet shooting. Even then you've got to be doing it in a nice neighborhood for it to be an issue.

Here? Dudes burning reds is called lunch time traffic. Not sure why though, because drivers here are mind numbingly slow. Its like nobody has anywhere to be ever, so might as well coast and take in the view. Gotta burn that red though, it'll slow you down from going ten under the limit, right next to the guy going the same speed. Its like some game of low speed drag racing, and the only losers are the people behind you, because we can't fucking go around.

Even nature here has a tendency to be awful motorists. Stupid ass Canadian geese, chilling out on the fucking backroads like its all good with their geeselings(?). *SERIOUSLY?!* Doesn't matter how close you get, they just waddle around with a look that I can only describe as ""What, you're gonna hit me with your pussy ass truck, bitch? Come at me, bro!"" At first, it was cool to see those geese. Now I just want to strangle them and deal with the huge fine. Get the fuck out the way, feathers!

The worst part of every day is waking up knowing that there are plenty of great places around, but getting there means I have to deal with *this shit* again. Fuck.

Edit: Added a small section about rain. No idea how I forgot about that given the rain thats been happening."
ulcgm,7,2012-06-04,"Engineering, Am I Doing It Wrong? Should I Be Doing It at All?",Kaprica_Six,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/ulcgm/engineering_am_i_doing_it_wrong_should_i_be_doing/,"I'm a confused, burnt-out sophomore chemical engineering major with only two more final exams standing between me and a two-week vacation to Europe. Help me sort my life out. I have gone to no classes and done next to no studying for the past three weeks. My last two finals are tomorrow. Before this, I had never gotten any grade lower than an A- since seventh grade and I am in an honors program at a top 20 private university. I have done almost nothing except bookwork for the past couple of years. Three weeks ago, I just shut down and stopped. It's mathematically likely that I'll still have above a 3.0 this term due to sheer inertia. I'm in no immediate academic danger, but I'm very unhappy and this cannot continue. 

I know I have the worth ethic and intelligence to master anything engineering throws at me, but I don't know if I have the heart. I'm strongly considering taking part or all of next year off (maybe trying to get an internship/co-op, traveling, just calming down, etc.) to figure out myself and what the hell I want to do with my chemical engineering degree. So here's goes.

I'm doing engineering because I'm good at it. To be honest, I have no real interest in the mundane technical details of anything and care very little for building gadgets, doing science for fun, and the like. I do, however, get immense pleasure from teaching, organizing, and directing things. The only real extracurricular I've ever done was lead my school's chapter of a student-run civic organization (any former JSA-ers out there?), and to be honest it's the only thing I've ever ""done"" that I'm really proud of. We had debates, conventions, meetings, and I loved every minute of it. Contrary to what you'd expect, I actually think I'm really good at working with people, speaking publicly, and asserting myself, when I care enough to do so. Doing that is really what makes me happy. I think I've shutdown (read: zero motivation to do anything) because I've deprived myself of social interaction and the things that actually fulfill me for far too long so I could become an academic machine (long story). I've begun going to parties, socializing more, trying some new things, and ""caring"" more, and I'm finally feeling like a real person, but that doesn't resolve my basic dilemma as regards this:

Basically, I don't want to sit at a desk all day like my father (also a chemical engineer, but he really likes his job, so more power to him) and I have little interest in doing research or gaining technical knowledge for it's own sake. Don't get me wrong, I like learning, and I've read a ton of books, but they're on an extremely wide variety of subjects and have little to do with what my job would be. I want to do something with myself, but I don't know what that should be. I want to know where should I go? What companies should I look at for co-ops? Should I look at companies for co-ops or should I do something else? My internship this summer is at a biomedical research institute, and even though I don't care for research, it's in downtown Madison and the people there are awesome, so I'm excited, I guess, but I don't really think I'd want to do that for the rest of my life. To make a long rant short:

Given everything I just told you about myself, does anyone have any tips on how the HELL I go about finding something that I actually want to do with myself?"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Do you think it takes a particularly smart person to go to college by the age of 13, or is it just a product of being homeschooled?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w3u8w?context=5)|No, the average person probably wouldn't. I credit a lot to my older sisters, who genuinely loved to learn. I'm talking multiple trips to the library every week with stacks upon stacks of books, 30-40 at a time sometimes. The other homeschoolers that I know were not really on my sisters' level, nor mine. I'll be the first to say that my two older sisters are much smarter and more dedicated than I. One of them graduated with her ChemE degree with a 4.0, the other graduated with one B. The are both in graduate school, and doing fantastic.
[Basically, to be more specific, do you think any average smart person could do it by thirteen if they were homeschooled?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w3u8w?context=5)|So no, I think it takes a special combination of parenting and having kids with a personality of REALLY wanting to learn, and read, and explore.
[*every week with stacks upon stacks of books, 30-40 at a time sometimes.*  You read 30-40 books a week? Are you sure that's accurate or are you being hyperbolic? You realize that would equate to about 5 books a day, do you really find yourself reading that much?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w7c0x?context=5)|4 kids in our family.
[What was an average day of homeschooling like?    was it 8-4? or when you are done, you're done?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w3jpn?context=5)|When you are done, you're done. I don't remember having to wake up by a certain time, but there was a certain incentive to get done earlier so we could go out and play with the other neighborhood kids.
[Who taught you ""Sex Ed."" ?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w3jpn?context=5)|My dad gave me the talk first, then I was given some literature to read. I took the incentive to educate myself by using the college computers, ha.
[What the fuck are you doing wasting your time on reddit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w3kio?context=5)|Hey man, I'm waiting on our CAD guy to finish up some drawings. It's a little slow today.
[Fuck, I'm a Mechanical Engineer on internship as well right now. You have people who do drawings FOR you?  I have to do all my drawings and many others for people =\[](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w3sb1?context=5)|Yup, full time AutoCAD guy. I've got enough other stuff that I have to do.
[If you can speak to it without giving away too much info. What other tasks do you have? Do you do design work?  Also with the autocad guy, do you tell him what you want and he draws it? Or is he like doing drawings of models you have created?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w44ul?context=5)|I'm in the project engineering department. We handle the projects that our sales guys sell to the customer. We don't design any of the things we sell in-house, but rather get them assembled for the customer (we have them assembled by someone else). So, I do a lot of work with installation drawings, P&amp;ID's, and our inventory system (SAP) to track orders, parts, stock, etc.
[How did you fit in with the other students? Did anyone treat you disrespectfully? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w31eu?context=5)|I'm an engineer. Most engineers are nerdy anyway. It was perfect.
 |When I was younger, nobody ever treated me disrespectfully, no. I think everybody realized how young I was, and either thought it was cool or didn't care. Community college is like that. Nobody really cares what anybody else is doing. Very different from highschool, so I've heard.
[So you've never gotten knocked down or picked on in your life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4wd9fm?context=5)|Sure I have. Not because of homeschooling, really. Some hazing in the Boy Scouts and other stuff, but I've always been on the taller side.
[Sorority girls at your community college?  Fucking a 15 year old?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w7w8v?context=5)|I'm at OSU now, and 19. If the question was directed towards when I first started college, that would be incorrect. Only in the last year.
[How about when you were homeschooled???](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4wrbma?context=5)|No.
[You mean the ones who quickly switch to business?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4wcvwv?context=5)|Yes, those are the ones, haha.
[Proof First. Next, how well do you think you were prepared for actually going into college? Did you feel like you had a gap in your education, if not, what was your curriculum like when you were home schooled? Lastly, I've had some friends that were home schooled that were a lot less social than people in a public or private school, did you have any problem with that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w30o8?context=5)|Proof is available, but the sort that I would like to submit to a mod.
 |I was prepared education-wise, but going to class and dealing with other people was something I was unfamiliar with, especially colleagues that were years older than me.
 |I used to be much less social, yes. I was never a hardcore gamer, but I would play Halo and COD in my dorm by myself for hours. I was fortunate enough to get on a dorm floor my freshman year that had a lot of activity throughout the day. Many doors were open, and the lounge was almost always full of people.
 |It wasn't until this past year that I was able to open up socially, meet girls, find out girls were actually attracted to me, got in a relationship, etc.
[Since you took Engineering, do you think Dr. Sheldon Cooper would think less of you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w4le9?context=5)|Seeing as I dislike his character, I don't really care.
[Did you ever trade tutoring/study tips for older classmates to buy you beer or take you out with them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w4le9?context=5)|Yeah, I did a few projects where I did most of the work, and my teammate brought me a case or something. However, I don't really drink too much. I work too hard at the gym to throw it away with excessive drinking.
[Do you feel like a socially unskilled virgin among the other students? Anything you feel you missed out on that others experienced in school that you cannot relate to? Would you homeschool your own kids?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w30v1?context=5)|My nickname for a while was ""tall and awkward."" I was a 6'4"" beanpole with an unruly head of curly hair. So yes, it took me a while to gain some confidence. I transformed my body and my personality, and now you probably would not be able to tell.
 |Sports.
 |Girls.
 |Greater number of friends.
 |I truly do not know whether I would homeschool. At this point I would say yes, but my situation may change, and my wife would have the final say.
[*I transformed my body.*  How you weigh bro?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4wflt7?context=5)|I really don't know, man. Check my ladybonersgw post and give me a good guess.
[How often do you experience others judging you negatively because you were homeschooled?  What sorts of things do people who dont understand homeschooling tend to say to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w2z56?context=5)|Homeschooling just isn't something that comes up very often any more. Those who know that I've been homeschooled have usually already gotten to know me, so they don't particularly care. However, I haven't experienced any negative backlash because of it, no.
[Thank you in advance for your replies.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w2z56?context=5)|Things like ""Don't you feel like you've missed out on your childhood?"" ""So you didn't have any friends?"" ""What about learning good social skills?"" are pretty typical.  
[This has been my one concern as well when thinking about homeschooling my own children.  Much of the K-12 educational environment is, in my opinion, learning to work in groups and with others, adapting to social norms, learning to cope with others' habits, etc.  I don't think you'll be able to adequately measure the difference until you're out in the workforce and have to deal with different people (and they have to deal with you\) for several hours a day on a daily basis.  Do you feel like you're prepared that transition or do you feel awkward around other people?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w52qy?context=5)|I don't feel awkward around other people at all. Used to. I've seen plenty of public schooled socially awkward people, so I doubt I would have been different had I been public schooled.
[Why did you pick OSU? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w4gjk?context=5)|Southern girls.
[What was the process to get into the community college? Do they just let you take classes or do you have to take some test first? How were you academically compared to other students in class? Were you homeschooled by your parents only or did you have tutors for other subjects?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w3uls?context=5)|It was tough. We had to get special permission from the Dean, which took some sweet-talking in itself. I just took an entrance exam, clepped out of a flew classes, then I was in.
 |I did excellently in community college for the first year or two, then my grades started slipping as I had more things going on in my life.
 |Parents only, although we did attend co-op classes with other homeschoolers for a while, until my parents decided they didn't like how they were teaching certain subjects, and we quit going.
[Proof?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w2tyz?context=5)|I have proof which I can submit to the mods. I haven't done one of these before, but I have already scanned my DL and unofficial academic transcript for proof.
 |Edit: Proof is up.
[I know I'm probably going for an untrue stereotype here, but any Obsessive-Compulsive tendencies, and/or Attention-Deficit disorders?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w49kh?context=5)|I had a video game addiction for a while, but no OCD tendencies that I'm aware of. I have trouble getting started on homework and projects, but that's a little thing called procrastination and I'm pretty sure almost everybody suffers from that.
[ACT/SAT scores?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w3uze?context=5)|Never took 'em and I don't really know why.
[Whoa! A 'C' in 'Gen Chem I'! How often did you see a non-'A' grade on your marksheet/transcript?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w48jd?context=5)|Every so often nowadays...I've got multiple projects going on, girlfriends come and go, other hobbies, etc. Some partying the last few semesters, nothing too major.
 |That C was because that class was an almighty load of horse shit. I took it again once I got to OSU, since it didn't transfer, and got a better grade. I hate chemistry anyway.
[Chemistry-hating-engineer-high-five!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w4bzk?context=5)|*returns high five as awkwardly as possible*
[Why go to a community college? If you can afford a better one, why not go there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w7km1?context=5)|When you are 13, you can't exactly drive. Or live on your own.
[Do you have any other degrees?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w5wyv?context=5)|No other degrees.
[If you started at 13 and are finishing at 19 that's 6 years... Why did it take you so long to finish college? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w6c4u?context=5)|I stretched it out a little bit. Community college, I wasn't taking full-time classes most of the time. I worked a part-time job for half a year before starting at OSU. In the grand scheme of things, going to community college so early was more like finishing highschool than starting college.
[Only on Reddit does the dude who started school at 13 get shit for taking 6 years. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w8ovw?context=5)|Plenty of engineers take 5 years to do it at OSU. Accounting for a semester or two with little to no classes, I'm not unhappy with how fast I finished. Both of my sisters graduated at the same time I am, and their records speak for themselves.
[What is your IQ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w6nop?context=5)|Fucked if I know.
[I started at the University of British Columbia at 15 but I gotta ask this, how did you fit in?  Did you isolate yourself from other students?  Personally most of the time no one noticed the age difference but 13 is a lot younger than 15.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w86nh?context=5)|Yeah, I didn't hang out with anybody I didn't already know until I got to OSU.
[Was that tough?  In a lot of my classes, having support from others in the class has been beyond helpful.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w8dwa?context=5)|Considering I had all the help I needed back home, no, it wasn't too bad.
[Have you been diagnosed with any conditions like ADHD or Bi-polar disorder or even Aspergers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w37yc?context=5)|No, but I may have a mild form of ADHD. Nothing I would ever be prescribed anything for, most likely.
[Do you think homeschooling is a more efficient way of learning than the public school system?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w4ggp?context=5)|For kids like my siblings and me? Yes. For everyone else? Probably, but the whole school system is screwed up anyway.
[Any idea on what you're gonna do after you graduate? I mean you're younger than the general workforce, and that does impact on whether or not certain people will hire you.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w3g63?context=5)|I'm currently working at a summer internship for a reputable company. Both of my older sisters are just as far ahead as I am, and had no trouble acquiring internships. However, they both went to graduate school, and I'm staying with my B.S.
 |I'm hoping for a career somewhere down in the midwest, perhaps Texas.
[Texas=southwest I can see why you'd say midwest being that Oklahoma borders TX though, some think of that as a midwest state.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w5do0?context=5)|Whoops, you're absolutely right.
[You have a very interesting academic history OP. I'm sure as a homeschooled kid you plan on assuming the role as homeschooler parent to your children (if any\). Do you think this is inevitable? Would you have it any other way? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w5cp4?context=5)|I don't think it's inevitable, but I will be seriously considering it.
[I don't really understand, did you take a year off? I'm about a week younger than you and only a year behind you. If I wasn't getting any minors I would be one semester behind you, I started college at 16.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w4nyf?context=5)|I re-took a few classes, some didn't transfer, etc. I would have graduated this year, but some of the classes I needed are only available in the fall, so I have a very light course load this next semester, and I had a pretty light load last semester.
[Are you from upstate New York by any chance? I went to OSU a couple of years ago and knew of two sisters who were in engineering and started really early like you. I think they were from Fishkill maybe.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4wq726?context=5)|Yes, that was them.
[Small world, my brother used to date your oldest sister back in school.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4wv3ot?context=5)|Wow. Small world indeed. Only on Reddit.
[I think the real accomplishment this guy has done is graduate 1.5 years earlier from uni.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w8ye1?context=5)|Also, almost every single engineer I've ever known has had trouble with their calculus classes, and I aced all three before I ever turned 16. Community college or not, I still understood the material, and it's a bit odd to suggest that most 14 year olds would be able to understand that stuff.
[In my experience, most engineers did not struggle with calc.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4wc82w?context=5)|Freshman engineers who don't know what they are getting into do.

[C'mon OP we're waiting.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4wapri?context=5)|Fine. Once. Mine turned out shitty and my brother's turned out awesome and golden brown. Nobody had to know.
 |Nobody had to know....

I decided not to get an MAE degree, just ME. Until I start getting some options, I'll take most any job that will pay me well at this point, though. 
[Honestly, congrats on being much more advanced intellectually than the average person. I would definitely want to be smarter and have the drive you have for learning stuff that puts me to sleep. Just remember to be humble with what you have!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uk69a/i_went_to_college_at_13_ama/c4w5eqb?context=5)|Hard work is the secret to success in engineering, not being smart.

I'm 21, and a student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.  I'll be living in Austin for the summer, working an internship.  I don't really know anyone here, so I'm looking for someone to have fun with.  It can be as serious or non-serious as you like.

I'm pretty outgoing.  I love going to shows.  I've been a big fan of punk, ska, metal, 80s, and alternative rock for a long time.  Over the last couple years, I've been getting into EDM/Rave scene, too.

I'm a bit of a nerdy guy, but it doesn't impact my social skills too much.  I enjoy partying as much as the next guy.

I was originally going to post this in /r/questions however I figured redditors here would have a better understanding of the subject. 

Long story short, I'm a business student looking for internships in marketing and I see many that require knowledge in Graphic Design, however I am unsure of what specific skills are required. 

**What would you consider neccesary to be able to claim knowledge of intermediate graphics design skills, compared to a basic or advanced level?**

If you want to answer my bonus question, **what is a good way to improve upon my graphic design skills.** I consider myself computer fluent (like most redditors) and can do the basics with photoshop and could probably navigate my way through some graphic design software with some practice, assuming it is not meant for users with a higher skill level. 

Thanks in Advance! :)

Something with multiple variables would be great, perhaps I want rain, maybe I just want dark towering ominous clouds, maybe I want thunder and lighting, perhaps I want to know what it would be like to throw snow in with an electrical storm. Who knows? It's my world you just live in it. 

I prefer something that is portable, perhaps with an easy to use interface like an Ipod, but, you know, actually good. If there is an option to plug it into my car for on the go weather God play that is a plus.  I also prefer something that uses a common style charger cable, perhaps something awesome like the android charger cable. 

An option to create weather at will in a completely geographically separate place would be good too. Perhaps we can link this thing to a GPS system so that I can create say.... a sand storm in Florida from the comfort of my own home in Canada.  It should be waterproof as well, who knows when this thing might accidentally go on the fritz cause a flood while I am not around and drown itself. 

Tech support should be available 24/7 365/6 and there should never be a waiting period for me. I would prefer it if you employed people from all over the world, maybe one or two call centers in every country so that I can have a support center no matter where my evil schemes take me. 

Send me a message when you have created the prototype and we can schedule a meet up to test it out. If you have done well I might pay you with a high five or words of encouragement. If you are lucky you can earn an internship with me as a henchmen and join me on my adventures as I try to... what is it that we do these days? Take over the world? That seems too time consuming and complicated. I think we should aim to just travel the world at our whim and enjoy doing whatever we want with no need for money. That is a truly diabolical scheme there.

During my last semester of college I had a change of heart and realized that a career in engineering was not what I wanted. I did a serious re-evaluation of my interests, and when putting together my interests in art, design, horticulture, and the outdoors, I decided that a career in landscape architecture would really be fitting for me. Doing some research of my own in the career fields involved in LA and meeting with professors and students in the LA department at my university helped solidify my decision to make the switch from engineering.

I plan to apply for MLA programs for the Fall of 2013, which means I have until November~January (5 months) to prepare an application, including my portfolio, which I have learned is the most important component. 
During those 5 months I plan to focus on preparing my portfolio.

My plan is to enroll in classes for Sketching, Photoshop, Illustrator, AutoCAD, and 3ds Max. I have some basic skills in AutoCAD and am pretty confident in sketching, but the rest I have no experience in. It's a LOT to cover in such a short period but does this sound like a good plan?

Also, I'd like to get some exposure of LA in action. Since I have no background in LA at all, getting internships in LA firms are pretty much out of the question. What other things are there that I could do? My main goal is to get some experience so I am more than willing to do unpaid jobs. 

I’d very much appreciate any advice on applying for MLA programs with portfolio prep in particular and also finding work in LA.
Thanks!"

Content-wise, I'm not sure if I should even included the 2 latter entries. The part-time stuff just shows I had been working, but I'm not sure that it matters considering most firms will likely want internship experience. The ""broker-trainee"" role was a boiler-room environment call center and only for a few weeks, but that is the only way I got my second job because the manager knew to go through 11 hours of cold calling a day, I had to be hard-working to some extent. So, I'm really not sure about that one.

I preferably want to get into equities. I know I-banking is pretty much out of the question, but I was thinking general asset/investment management.

&gt; We're looking for an Accessories Engineering Intern to come work at Apple for a minimum of 6 months beginning in either September or January. 
&gt; 
&gt; This role is extremely cross-functional; this team is responsible for defining and driving accessory interface features, which includes EE, SW, and ME interfaces. This interface applies to both Apple branded accessories and the entire worldwide accessory ecosystem. They are responsible for the technical specifications that govern every product that bears the Made for iPod/iPhone/iPad badge.
&gt; 
&gt; They are looking for an intern who has a strong interest in system-level architecture and understands both hardware and software. This individual will help define, coordinate the implementation of, prototype, and deploy a new accessory interface feature to the rest of the world.  A strong software engineering background is essential, and some amount of OSX/iOS/Linux application development is to be expected, but the primary focus of the position is on cross-functional interaction with multiple engineering teams all across the company towards a common goal.
&gt; 
&gt; Familiarity with the LaTeX typesetting system is a strong plus.  Anyone who knows what a Gumstix, Beagle, or Panda board is and has experience developing for one is a strong plus.  This candidate must be still pursuing their degree or planning on returning for an advanced one.

I started an engineering internship with a tug and barge company this summer. My boss wanted me to build him a vessel maintenance management system using which he could


1) Enter records of maintenance completed
2) Enter records of regulatory inspections completed
3) View a history of maintenance and inspections completed
4) View all upcoming maintenance and inspections, tiered by priority. 
5) An alert function for tasks upcoming within a given time duration
6) A way to print a report for work history (3) and a worklist (4)
7) There would be a separate workbook for each vessel. Easily add new components or inspections to book for it to track.
8) Easily copy and modify the workbook to work with a new vessel


I am a really computer savvy guy but had little to no knowledge of programming or macros. I do have a really good ability to pick up new computer skills quickly to get work done. As long as I have a defined problem, I can come up with solutions. It took me a little over two weeks to figure out how VBA works with Excel and build a system that does everything mentioned above really well. The maintenance and inspections work off of either time or engine hours. I figured out a way for the worksheet to pull the engine hours from another workbook that gets updated with running hours every month. Using ""Hours to Go"" till an overhaul or inspection is due and the average number of hours an engine runs over the course of a month, the workbook can predict when a new inspection or maintenance is coming up. All these inspections and maintenances are compiled into a sheet where they are prioritized using conditional formatting. Once an inspection or maint. is completed, my boss will select it from a drop down and hit a button which will paste the entry with a time stamp into a Work History sheet and at the same time, reset the Upcoming Work sheet so that the component or inspection gets an updated due date (satisfying 1, 2, 3 and 4). Then I figured out a way for Excel to send out an email using Outlook once a component or inspection fell within a certain ""Days to Go"" range (5). The email would contain the name of the vessel, the component or inspection that needs attention and the number of Days to Go. Currently working on figuring out how to have Excel automatically add the due dates to the Outlook Calendar. I am also in the process of streamlining 6,7 and 8, and just making the workbook robust in general. My boss is highly satisfied with this current system I built but I want to make it better. I want to explore all the possibilities. 


I have two more months to go on the internship and I have just now started looking at MS Access. The program just seems to be a lot more clean-cut and has the same VBA capabilities. I am wondering if it would be worth it for me to move this whole program into Access or if it is a total crap shoot. As it stands right now, I know nothing about the program but I can learn quick and am pretty interested in learning about databases. I have already started playing around in Access, just exploring what it is capable of. So it is time for me to reach out to you Access gurus! Is it worth it? Are there any better options?"

Since it's entry level and I don't have that much experience, I thought it would be best to keep it to 1 page.

I worked for my school while attending, it started as a 1 month internship between year 1 and 2, they hired my full time for the rest of the summer, and then hired me part time through the second school year (it was the first time my school has ever hired a student part time through the year, not sure if that's worth mentioning anywhere). In the next summer my contract ended so a new student could start, that's why I put (temporary) next to the position title, not sure if that should be there.

I live in a rural-ish part of Canada, the IT job market is pretty dead here and I made the mistake of being complacent with a call centre job (that I actually did enjoy, it was working for Logitech). However I was laid off last week (also not sure if that should be mentioned in the cover letter, or how I should mention it). I am not working right now, the contract was moved to Mexico so all positions were terminated. No I don't have any certs (I know, I should have gotten some and it looks bad on my part), but I'm studying for CompTIA ones now, I plan to have A+, Network+ and Server+ by the end of the summer.

Before entering the IT world I did a year and a half of Mechanical Engineering at university, before deciding it was not for me and dropped out, so it's not worth mentioning, and at the same time I spent 4 years in the Army Reserves as a vehicle technician (mechanic), 2.5 years of that working full time. It's not IT related, but I thought it was worth mentioning in the cover letter.

Anyway I would really appreciate some help with it, I desperately need to find a new job now. I think my cover letter needs the most help.

I don't want to seem like a traitor to the engineering community, but I'm not so sure engineering is for me in the long run. I *don't mind* engineering, but I don't really have a passion for it or a huge desire to succeed. I have been a longtime browser of /r/engineering, and I recently came across [this comment mentioning investment banking](http://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/ufpsf/in_it_for_the_money/c4uz3fm) and I had a few questions.

From what I can gather, IBankers love engineers... as long as you graduated from MIT. What about the rest of us? I couldn't afford to go to an elite university, so I ""had"" to go to the only ABET accredited public school in my state. Does this kill my chances? I had a 3.7 GPA, worked 20+ hours/wk throughout college, had an internship, and have worked as a structural engineer for the year since I graduated (on a side note, I also surmise that civil engineering is far less valuable for breaking into another field than pretty much any other engineering, but I could be wrong). I have good social skills comparatively to the stereotypical engineer. 

But the more I type, the more it seems like I'm really not at all a commodity. I have worked very hard and been very successful, but there's always someone better. I think if I am to get in somewhere, I'd be able to learn anything they throw at me, but I'm only basing that off of how I've handled everything else in my life. I haven't taken finance courses or other math courses I've seen mentioned (control systems, number theory, computational fluid dynamics). Is grad school the only option? Would that even help? Engineering graduate degree or business? Should I just forget about it and be miserable in engineering forever? Is this too many questions in a row?

Any insight would be greatly appreciated. I'm just a young, naïve engineering graduate who wants to know his options... I'm not getting any younger!"

uo4ys,1,2012-06-06,Graduated last year; looking to transition into finance role. Please critique. ,[deleted],resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/uo4ys/graduated_last_year_looking_to_transition_into/,"Here is my resume: http://i.imgur.com/IO027.png?1

I'm not really concerned with the formatting, although if anything is glaring, please point it out. Also, my GPA is not included because it is far from impressive. 

Content-wise, I'm not sure if I should even included the 2 latter entries. The part-time stuff just shows I had been working, but I'm not sure that it matters considering most firms will likely want internship experience. The ""broker-trainee"" role was a boiler-room environment call center and only for a few weeks, but that is the only way I got my second job because the manager knew to go through 11 hours of cold calling a day, I had to be hard-working to some extent. So, I'm really not sure about that one.

I preferably want to get into equities. I know I-banking is pretty much out of the question, but I was thinking general asset/investment management. I have begun studying for and plan on taking the CFA level 1 exam in december, which, if I pass, will hopefully open some doors. Again, I'm unsure how/if I should include these plans in my resume.

Thanks to anyone that takes the time."

I'm a summer intern and I'm as far as I've ever been away from home. 

I first moved in to an obviously creepy home with 3 retired old men to try and save money on rent.  After being thoroughly disturbed I decided to suck it up and pay more rent so I could feel safe. 
I found what I thought was the perfect apartment, and moved in immediately. After I moved I learned that my upstairs neighbors/land lords are soon-to-be retired clowns (clowns are my biggest fear). I recently had dinner with them, and learned I am the first person to live in the apartment since their daughter died. Every time I walk out of the shower I find one of her long black hairs stuck to my body. 

They are nice people and the apartment is beautiful. The only thing scarier than my story is the awful Internet connection. *shutter*

It's my second day. I hardly know anybody, but he was really nice, bringing me to meet the big shot. Apparently he holds an open door policy for employees, but has a reputation for terseness, arrogance, and being serious. I was only told to be polite. I didn't even get that far. My colleague asked if he had time and was invited in. He walked in, introduced me, and stepped aside. I walked over, smiling, with my hand extended.
""Nice to meet you.""
He looked at my outstretched hand and completely ignored it. I kept it there for an awkward 4 or 5 seconds and then lowered it. What the hell? I was more surprised than anything, like opening my dishwasher and finding an anteater or something completely unexpected. He then told my colleague to show me around and dismissed us. Oh, and he had a smug smile on the entire time. I guess lowly interns dirty his hands.

What's the most arrogant act you've ever encountered?

This is my first internship since I've always been involved in research during my times off school/coursework.  I get to work in R&amp;D with what seems to be a down-to-earth and laid back group, so I'm almost exactly where I want to be (the research area is a little different than my thesis focus but still in a related field).

So what advice do you have to get the most out of this experience?  So far my goals are:

* Network, network, network!  I need to talk to EVERYONE, hear what they're doing, chat with them, and introduce myself so they'll remember me later.

* Get a feel for company culture.  Do they work hard hours?  Is there a good work-life balance?  Does everyone get along.  Is there strife between research and upper management?

* Figure out what opportunities will be available in the future.  Will I be able to switch groups easily?  Does the company typically hire from within or bring in someone else.  (Related question: Do ChE's hop around these days more so than a few decades ago or do most stay with one or two companies their entire lives?)  Will I be able to travel?  Live in interesting places?  Take vacation?

* When I give my final presentation to The Bosses, try to frame it in terms of cost savings; explain more than the technical benefits (Is it safer? Does it use less resources?  Is it more durable/robust?).

My parents always told me that I wasn't going to make it in life because I just didn't try hard enough and did not care about school. Well after I graduated(2.1 gpa) I started at the local community college. I was working for a car wash and knew I wanted to work in computers (networking or something). 

Well I found a job and it happened to be where my dad worked. He is an engineer and the job was an IT helpdesk position (internship) So I applied and gave him my resume to hand it to them IT team. They interviewed me and must have liked me gave me a job. I was 18 making 12 bucks an hour and felt like a boss. Fast forward 2 years of basically browsing the net and doing some basic help desk duties I found another job making a few dollars more an hour. This job was a hardware manager and eventually full system admin position. 

I hardly did any work other than what had to be done. I got laid off from there after multiple rounds. It was my turn to go. I stayed unemployed for 6 months didn't even look for a job. The last week of my unemployment I'm like oh crap need a job. Interviewed at 3 places and one of them called me back and offered me a job that was better and making more than I was previously.  So i started immediately.

Now fast forward a few months and i'm offered another job making 20% more than the job i took so I told my them and they matched almost all at about 18% so I stayed. I am currently still working here and support everything but I keep everything fixed so there is nothing for me to do. 

I don't make a lot now 50-55k. But having no degree and being 26 I feel like it just isn't fair that I haven't even tried and it feels like it has been handed to me. 

I see people all the time working 2 jobs just trying to make ends meet and the work they are doing is 100 times harder than what i do. 

How has life been unfair in a positive way for you?

Other people I worked with were supportive and made me feel appreciated, but the negative feedback from this one supervisor was a huge knock to my ego.

unk5g,1,2012-06-06,Close friend lied about having a degree &amp; probably cancer. What's this dude's deal? *Long post - TL;DR included*,[deleted],psychology,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychology/comments/unk5g/close_friend_lied_about_having_a_degree_probably/,"Hey guys,

I had originally posted this in /r/askreddit and it was suggested that this should go here. I apologize if re-posting this is against any rules, and furthermore apologize for the upcoming wall of text. Basic * *TL;DR* * is at the bottom. Hoping some of you Psych Redditors have the time to read this, and if so - thanks!

I'm 23 now, I first met my friend (well call him ""M"") M &amp; my current group of friends when I was 19. When I first met this dude I thought he was amazing. He claimed to have received his chemical engineering degree in 3 years while battling pancreatic cancer that had occurred while he was away at school. He also loves smoking weed as much as I do, and at that point in my life I blamed the marijuana on my laziness instead of taking a much deeper look at myself.

I was just coming back from University at the time, after failing out due to partying, playing WoW and never going to class. I was in-between friend groups at the time, leaving my high school friend group finally as they took the plunge into harder drugs that I'm glad I stopped while I was ahead. I say this so that you can understand the allure that M had to me, as solid proof to me at the time that you can party AND get your work done. What a motivation &amp; confidence booster!

Turns out that the degree doesn't exist and he dropped out of school when his high school Gf dumped him and he was too sad to attend classes (f**kin pussy). One of my friend's moms met up with M's Mom in the town supermarket and she mentioned his degree. M's mom looked at my buddie's Mom dumbfounded and was like, what degree? I guess that explains that in all of the years of our friendship I have NEVER been invited into his house or formally introduced to his family despite hanging out together just about every day.

As far as the Pancreatic Cancer goes, he had some minor procedure done and he must have told his ex they also found cancer to try and get her to feel awful. He told all of us it was cancer and rode this lie for a good 3 years until we started unraveling everything. At this point, we've started to make strides on calling him out on everything, except for the degree &amp; this. The degree is obvious, I just don't feel like arguing about it. As far as the Cancer, our bro's agree that we'd almost rather not know if it's real or not and still want to give him the benefit of the doubt due to the severity of the potential circumstance, despite never seeing any proof of this. He appears to be in perfect health, never watching his diet &amp; doing what he pleases.

I'll write more about it below, but M has a ""charm"" about him that I've never witnessed before. It's almost creepy looking back on it how people bend to his will &amp; how incredible he seems off the bat. I felt great thinking this guy was my best friend, and I get this charisma and charm to myself &amp; I can learn and grow my confidence further. Also, keep in mind I have never had a father figure so I take what I can get in those areas to supplement.

I remember one day he bragged about how charismatic he is and how he has a habit of splitting up groups of friends. At the time I was sure that there were other circumstances and didn't think much of it. I had introduced him to a best friend of mine, a kid that I've known the longest but didn't see as often due to our schedules. He and M hit it off and I thought it was great, until I started not seeing any of them often &amp; knowing they were just hanging out together without me.

I didn't want to look like a jealous asshole, especially amongst bro's - but one day it finally upset me enough and I cracked. I confided in M on a car ride and said that I felt like I was loosing my friendship with one of my best friends. He assured me that it was all in my head and that my other friend had mentioned nothing of the sort.

M ended up pissing off this kid a few months down the line (more on this to come as it's relevant) and I finally re-connected with my best friend. I told him that I had had that conversation with M about how I felt that I was losing a very good friend. To my surprise, my friend said that he had had the exact same conversation with M about me, and that M said that I had never once mentioned it to him.

At that point it was clear that he was making an effort for whatever to try and de-rail my friendship. I still don't understand why, and try not to dwell on it simply because I feel like it's utter stupidity. We're 20 something years old, this isn't high school and certainly the last thing I'd want to deal with when spending my time with dudes.

As for how he pissed my best friend off (who is normally extremely easy going) - we have a mutual female friend who is extremely over weight. One of the kindest girls I know, but due to her weight she acts out overly promiscuous and my friend likes to keep it in line as he is essentially like a brother to her. It was a topic that was discussed many times that if someone ever legitimately wanted to date her that they need only ask, if they truly were into her. You need to keep our ravenous dudes on a leash when she's hungry for some dick and the booze is flowing.

From my best friend's exact words to me were ""M looked me in the eyes and said ""Our friendship is more important that just fooling around for easy sex"" .""

As it turns out, because women have huge ass mouths, is that they'd get drunk and go screw around. I guess it only happened 3 times, but M's excuse was ""oh I was drunk"". Yeah? 3 times? My friend FLIPPED the fuck out, and this girl's older brothers (huge scary italian dudes) were about to kick the shit out of my best friend because this girls at home crying her eyes out saying that my friend is really mad at her. Obviously she isn't going to say ""I fucked this dude and here's the real situation"".

Sparing the rant, this is what pissed me off the most. I tried to take M out and talk to him about this. I told him that this kid is getting flack from this girls brothers due to HIS actions. He goes, ""oh, they're mad at him? Oh well, at least I'm ok."" - he then proceeded to laugh it off like a fucking joke. Meanwhile he'll be texting my friend saying he's so sorry, and that he's crying his eyes out and that he's sorry for being a shitty friend.

Fast forward to this week, everyone's back from school including her. When we get together and he manages to come around he has her giving him back massages and shit, since this girl is still head over heels for him. She keeps begging my friend to let them fuck again, even though M is seeing another girl. He still pulls this shit, and I guarantee none of the girls he's had since have any idea about this shit. He has absolutely no problem straight up using this girl in-front of all our friends &amp; her group of friends.

It's only as I've smartened up and stopped putting this kid on a pedestal that all this shit added up. You think you fucking know a guy man, and then you find out everything about him is total bullshit he made up to feed his ego.

I can't fuckin stand him and I still see him at least once a week. Anytime someone calls him on his shit he makes up some ridiculous crap, its mostly entertaining at this point and none of my other friends feel like upsetting an otherwise good time to argue with this idiot, but everyone is well aware. He never gets invited out, so if he finds out what's going on he'll usually just end up inviting himself through someone else who may also happen to be going and isn't in our immediate group of friends.

Just last week we were at a pool party with a new group of girls. He doesn't even have shame anymore, he's sitting in front of 3 of our friends talking to this one girls dad about how he's going for his second degree and is being contracted by the department of defense for chemical weapons development and blah blah.

THE WORST FUCKIN PART is that people eat it up. He comes off so charismatic, always has girls all over him even though I bust my ass at the gym and he doesn't do shit. After bullshitting this chicks dad all I could hear the other rents present talking about was how awesome that new guy that came over is. Makes me so fuckin mad.

The thing is, he IS smart. If he actually did anything with himself maybe he could achieve something. He still swears he has a degree, yet he's working at KOHLS. His Mom works at KOHLS, let's take a guess on who got their 23 year old son a job? If you have a Chemical Engineering degree, where's your fucking internship somewhere? Oh, he also switches the title of his degree from Chemical Engineering to Organic Chemistry depending on the situation, and I'm positive he thinks that I just don't care enough to remember.


The only great thing that's come of this is for me really. For years I was so certain that this kid was for real that I adapted the qualities that I liked in myself. I worked my ass off for a year and a half to get accepted back into school full-time, while working full-time. I just finished this semester with a full course load and received A's in all of them. I'm pretty stoked - and I still party and enjoy myself quite a bit. All in moderation. My confidence has never been higher, and for this entire experience I'm actually grateful. Losing someone you're close to blows, but I've learned way to many valuable lessons here.

Reading back on this entire post makes me seem like a bit of a pussy. I'm cautious when dealing with him on such extreme matters because I am infact afraid of him. The kid knows how to get into everyone's house, and if angry enough I wouldn't put it past him to do something very extreme. 3 of my other friends have expressed the same concern. 

* *TL;DR* * - Close friend lied about having a degree &amp; possibly pancreatic cancer. Uses his ridiculous charisma to carry himself through life while lying left and right, and it works. Actually intimidated by what he would do if truly angered and uncovered.

My family isn't well off, so it would difficult to be able to do an unpaid internship since I would be putting myself in a serious financial rut. Any ideas on how to go about this?

And this may seem a little far-fetched and unrealistic. (I can have goals) But I would also like to aim for a company and position in which I'd be able to find employment within Japan. Either that or a direct job transfer. That may be the biggest kink I'd have to work out with my plan. I'm going to return to Japan regardless, but I'd prefer having a profession in which I don't have to worry about money quite as much. And if it matters much, I've had interests in starting a small-scale import/export service. So possibly something like that?

I want to know the best way to get my résumé to hiring companies. I have tried many job websites without much success thus far. Are any websites better than others? Is there a trick to these websites? I have sent résumés in recent months all over the East Coast and West Coast without much feedback. When it comes to résumés, it feels like I am throwing a bowl of spaghetti against a wall to see what sticks.

I just earned my MBA in Finance last month from a top 25 school. I know it’s not Ivy League, but it’s decent. (Lots of negative publicity from the Sandusky scandal.) I think my biggest problem is my job history or real life experience. During my 4 years of undergraduate study, I graduated in 4 years with a dual major (Accounting &amp; Management) and a dual minor (Math and Economics). I love to learn so I didn’t mind the extra course load. I was unable to get a worthy internship since I played collegiate baseball. It helped me pay for college, but I think baseball has negatively impacted my life for many reasons. During grad school, I just worked for my father since he owns his own beverage business. The job had flexible hours which was crucial for an accelerated grad school program. He owns a very small business so I don’t even consider it as job experience since it was mostly just grunt work. 

I am just hoping for any job to cover necessities while living alone to gain valuable experience. (Food, Housing, Car Payments, Insurance, and of course… college bills). I don’t need a get rich quick scheme. I am expecting to work about 45-55 hours a week.  I don’t mind moving far away. I have some money to pay for any relocation fees. 

I just do not understand what companies want from me. Hell, I will even work for a month for free. If I do a shitty job, cut me loose. I am not incredibly well-spoken. Public speaking has always been my biggest weakness so I commonly suck at interviews. I wish I was a good bullshitter like some of my friends. 

What shall I do? Job Fairs? Send résumés by the dozen? Quantity not quality with résumés? There has to be something out there that works. I appreciate all comments because this has been a frustrating process.

Thank You

unhdc,5,2012-06-06,Side Projects,danjam11565,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/unhdc/side_projects/,"So, to preface this, I'm only a rising sophmore in college studying comp. sci, and am probably getting myself a bit psyched out over nothing, but as I look into career options for CS, I keep seeing sites like GitHub mentioned, as well as the importance of having various examples of code to show off during interviews, like writing an app, or something similar. Do people have code from classes in cases like this, or do people really spend tons of their free time writing programs?

I'm just kind of wondering, is it realistic for companies to expect students fresh out of college to have written a bunch of code on their own time? There's always code from classes, but the way it sounds sometimes makes it seem like you have to spend your weekends coding just to get a job. 

I know that elite companies like Google will expect stuff like this, but do more average good companies, or do they understand not everyone (even good coders) codes their own programs during their free time for fun?  


Edit: I want to add that I know employers expect some sort of experience, and I definitely plan on applying for a lot of internships over the next few years, but do they also look for independent projects as a neccessity? "

Is Canonical trying to become the Apple of Linux? What other strategies are you implementing to help Linux go mainstream?

[*I believe the criticism around Unity could be divided into two broad categories (1\) fear of change and (2\) critcism about the design/stability of Unity.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/umavd/iama_ubuntu_community_manager_at_canonical/c4wm5cx?context=5)|""I fear Canonical hasn't been listening to the specific concerns of its community when it comes to Unity in particular. It's not that I'm afraid of change, or that it's unstable, it's that it's ugly, unwieldy to use, and non-configurable. The lack of control and configuration coupled with the fact it's been forced down our throats is what really seems to irk the community"".

 |Newer artists with smaller labels, still probably working part time.
 |For the big artists, the traditional music industry (make music, sell it, go on tour, sell overpriced merch and tickets etc) works well. This is because for these artists the music companies work like VCs: they put lots of money into different projects and every so often they get a Justin Bieber.
 |For smaller artists, they are typically working with small labels with barely any marketing budget. This means they sign their value (their music) to a label who often doesn't have the resources to bring the artist up to a higher level.
 |I believe that for smaller artists, the Creative Commons is the way to go. We did this with Severed Fifth: we grew a community, raised $5000 in funding to record our album, and gave it away for free so others can use it. Our music has appeared in all kinds of music videos on YouTube, in games and elsewhere.
 |The challenge is for smaller artists who work full time on their music. For weekend warriors like me, money is not that of a deal as I have a job, so giving music away for free is fine. If you are relying on getting paid at a show and need to sell that merch, giving away your music is a big deal, so I understand how some folks are resistant to it.

It threw its lot in with eucalyptus, and then jumped horse to openstack.

[Lets try again. Unity had terrible reviews. Why did Canonical not listen to their users about the introduction of this? You have to admit, it was a pretty bad reception.

They ignored it. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/umavd/iama_ubuntu_community_manager_at_canonical/c4wnl78?context=5)|That's better, thanks for presenting your question more politely.
 |When we introduced Unity we knew that chunks of it needed more sheening and refinement. What was important to us was to ensure that Unity was in good shape for Ubuntu 12.04, our next LTS, this is why we dropped in a few releases early to give our users a chance to play with it, share their experiences, share their concerns, and give us a chance to fix these outstanding problems.
 |Now, as you say, some folks were not happy with Unity. I think part of this was that those early Unity releases has a pretty tiny amount of QA applied: they were crashy, and when Unity crashed, it would take compiz down with it too. To remedy this we built an automated testing lab, and hired someone on my team to build a community of manual testers. I think most would agree that the Unity in 12.04 is much higher quality.
 |When we introduced Unity originally some folks just didn't like the design. This is always tough: design is emotional, and so is change, so a change with a new design is really emotional. Now some of the feedback at this time was constructive: it highlighted specific deficiencies in the design, problems in the implementation and other things. The design and engineering teams read all of this feedback with interest and reacted to much of it in future releases.
 |Some folks just didn't like Unity for the fact it was ""different"" and ""why didn't you guys just keep shipping GNOME 2"". For us to bring Free Software to more and more people we need to constantly evolve, and Unity was a step along that evolution. We have expanded our target demographic to not just Linux enthusiasts but general consumers too, and we found that GNOME 2 did not serve general consumers as well...as such Unity was designed to bridge that gap.
 |Now, of course, Unity is not perfect. There is still lots of work to be done, and many improvements to be made, but I think we are on the right track.
 |One thing I can assure you is that Canonical did not ignore this feedback: quite the opposite, but we did focus on the constructive feedback as opposed to the rantings on social media networks. Ubuntu is a shared project, our community is an integral part of the project, but we have to have a platform of respect and collaboration to do good work...and this is why we focused on the feedback from those who wanted to engage as opposed to yell.
 |I hope this answers your question. :-)

Some people presume that just because we don't have everything that a Linux enthusiast needs we are ""ignoring"" them. We want to build a system for *everyone*, and that requires a delicate balance.
 |As I said earlier, for a novice user if we include too much configurabilty that doesn't make sense or is not properly designed, user testing shows that it makes Ubuntu less useful. Technically savvy people can install and add additional configurability where desired. This is why I think it is better to have a simple Unity by default and then allow people to tune and tweak it with additional tools like MyUnity where needed. This way you get the best of both worlds: a simple out of the box experience, yet Linux enthusiasts can hotrod their system to get more if they want.

Why should they trust you now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/umavd/iama_ubuntu_community_manager_at_canonical/c4woyec?context=5)|Software is never ""done"", you have to release early and release often; that is at the core of how Open Source works.
[""Unity"" means − among other things − ""the same interface for Desktops, TV, phones, tablets, cars"".

I think it could be awesome. :-)
[What advice can you give to someone who is new to the field of Community Management?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/umavd/iama_ubuntu_community_manager_at_canonical/c4wnop5?context=5)|Without wishing to push my book, I think it will be helpful for you. Just make sure you get the new 2nd Edition: there is lots of other good content in there.
 |My advice for getting started is to study the work of other community managers, and listen and learn from their experience. Community management is a skill that is passed on between different people, and that kind of observational work is useful in seeing patterns and approaches to the profession.
[Is the 2nd edition available as an e-book?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/umavd/iama_ubuntu_community_manager_at_canonical/c4wpv5w?context=5)|Yep! :-)

The classic use case we have here is something such as an Ubuntu contributor wanting to thank someone for some great work that cannot be auto-detected with the current system. We would give them the ability to award a trophy to this person so it appears in their My Trophies view.
 |For your parachute jump example, we could potentially set up a system where a set of people can issue trophies when they see proof of something. For example, you send someone a photo of you doing the jump and then they award the trophy.
 |This would be great for bucket lists (e.g. visiting a set of landmarks) and then getting trophies for each one you visit.
 |It is all possible, we just need more hands on deck to write the code. :-)

ung65,3,2012-06-06,Becoming the GF I never wanted to be and the summer is making me worse.,No_Bueno_Hombre,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/ung65/becoming_the_gf_i_never_wanted_to_be_and_the/,"I just need to get this out. Maybe people can relate or give advice. Throwaway account. Due to our LDR I think this is the best subreddit. I will try to keep this short.

**Background:** My SO and I dated all of senior year and never had any issues but we basically broke it off because of college distances. A few months in we just *had* to get back together.  We have now been in a LDR for almost eight months and really haven't had many big issues. (Three hours apart and see each other about once every three to four weeks). He got a sudden summer internship and so he didn't get to come home for an expected three month LDR break. (We are still three hours apart for summer) 
Now, this summer, I am working Mon-Fri and have friends in our hometown. He is also Mon-Fri and he has become good friends with his summer apartment mates :) We have seen each other most weekends. :D 

**Here is my problem:** Lately I have been freaking out about everything. If he doesn't text me, I am mad. (We implemented a 24 hr. reply period b/c we're so busy but now I freak at twenty minutes of a wait.)  I never believed in double texting but I do it constantly now. He isn't into texting and I never had a problem with that. If he can't Skype because he is with friends, I am super jealous. EVERYTHING IS DRIVING ME INSANE! I just started Birth Control about two months ago because we have a sex life now (YAYYYY!!!:D) and I have some suspicion that is part of my mood swings?  But I had NO issues the full first month and it only started when summer really set in. I haven't told him yet because I feel crazy. I cry over EVERYTHING, which honestly isn't that big of a deal because I have always done that.. but it has been much harder and more frequent tears. 

I know I should talk to him but I am even scared about how much the littlest things upset me. I know these tendencies cannot sustain a LDR. Giving each other space and time is essential to how we function. We both strive to be fully involved members at our respective universities and his summer internship is very demanding and important. I never wanted to be the jealous/obsessive girlfriend and now I feel like that is what I am quickly becoming. I am trying so hard to hide it from him but I think that may make it worse. Our motto is: *Conversation is Key*, but I wanted some opinions or something before I brought it fully to his attention. 

**TL;DR I am going crazy over the little things but hadn't felt at all this crazy in the already seven month LDR.**

[Was that really Dog the Bounty Hunter? If so, how did you get him and do you have any crazy bounty hunting stories?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wlpip?context=5)|That was Dog!  We lucked out in getting him on board.  The director of the film, Alan Deutsch is also a producer and director on Dog's show so he pulled a few strings and got The Dog to come out to Austin, TX and do a cameo for a day.  He was incredibly nice to everyone on the cast and crew and was adamant about us getting exactly what we wanted out of him.  And he loves Pepsi.  A lot.
[What kind of Pepsi? Also, did anybody offer him ice with his Pepsi? If so, did he think they were referring to crack cocaine and give them a speech?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wmd25?context=5)|Just regular Pepsi in a bottle.  Everyone knew better than to offer His Majesty, Dog the Bounty Hunter ice.  
[Any nudity in it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wmxtc?context=5)|Abso-lutely.
[Will it be on Netflix in the near future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wlqd2?context=5)|It will be.  Sometime this summer.
['Merican only? Or will it include Canadian?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4woive?context=5)|Good question, I'm not really sure.  
[Ok, I'll bite. What's the name of the movie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wlhld?context=5)|""Austin High"".  It's listed on VOD services as ""420 Austin High""

Reminds me of a less stressful time in my life. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wlo09?context=5)|Cool, thanks!  It's more of a broad comedy that just so happens to include a lot of stoned-ness.  More Mel Brooks than Cheech and Chong.
[Any advice for independent filmmakers now that you've completed a feature film?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wm84p?context=5)|Don't shrug off post-production costs.  During filming, we were always running into things that cut into our post budget and we did what we had to do to just finish the film.  Then we got to post and had very little budget for editing, sound mix/design and music.  That's the real reason the film took so long to complete.
 |Also, next time I'm going to write a more simple story that takes place in only a few locations with a few characters.  I loved having all of our actors and set pieces but it was a beast to coordinate and pull off.
 |Also part deux, don't be a dick to people.  They're working for cheap or free to work in the film industry.  Be nice.
[I would have edited and mixed your audio and did the sound design for free. Independent artists need to help each other out and support the arts. Maybe next time, champ. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wvg77?context=5)|You're a badass.  And I may just be in contact in the near future.  :)
[Budget?  Tech stuff? Camera? Edited on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wlxde?context=5)|Budget came it at around 100k.  We shot on the Canon 5D and 7Ds.  Edited on Final Cut Pro.
[How did you feel about using those cameras re battery life? I was thinking shooting on my t2 but dunno should I look around and borrow something else.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wlzxx?context=5)|Battery life wasn't really an issue because so many people on set had Canon products, we always had a few spares to go around.  The issue that we kept running into was the cameras overheating.  When that happens there's nothing you can do but turn it off and wait in the 106 degree heat for it to cool down.  
[What about sound equipment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wmd3l?context=5)|I'm not sure of the exact brand of sound equipment.  We used both boom and lav mics and had a field mixer.  
[Interesting. I've heard of overheat problems but never had it happen myself. I had the chance to work with the 5D mk III and it's awesome as a movie camera. All the crap you have to work around with the mk II, the 7D and the T2i is totally gone.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wml4t?context=5)|Yea, the mk III is a dream.  I wish we had that when we shot.  
[Did you re-dub all the audio in post production, or was there not enough time/resources/money left in the budget? Or was it a purely artistic decision? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wvjnx?context=5)|We didn't re-dub all of it, just picked up some random spots here and there that were crappy on-set dialogue.
[How stoned were you while doing the film? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wlurk?context=5)|Not very.  We were pulling 16-18 hour days almost every day so things were semi-intense.  Pre and post production were a different story...
[Stoner! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wmgx0?context=5)|Not me.
[Wanna be my friend while I'm ""stranded"" at my parents house in Austin for the next couple weeks? I'll bring snacks...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wmoo7?context=5)|Sure.  Wanna play Blazer Tag?
[Blazer tag.... do elaborate.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wn375?context=5)|It's the biggest laser tag arena in TX.  They play techno remixes of the Braveheart theme on repeat.  It's not un-fun.
[You got a link to the trailer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wlh3d?context=5)|[Link to youtu.be](http://youtu.be/MVWfQ7tYK-0)
[Got a link to the torrent?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wmkkm?context=5)|I'm sure it'll be torrent-able soon.  That's when I know I've made it in this world.
[I just IMDb stalked you and saw you were in ""Ross McKenzie..."" I'm friends with a couple of guys on that picture, we all went to film school together. Small world, eh?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wo8hz?context=5)|It is a small world.  I'm friends with AT.
[Crazy, I'm good buddies with SK. We've worked in the trenches together on a few things.  Thanks for the info! If I wake up in a cold sweat later realizing I forgot a question, could I drop you a PM?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wqec5?context=5)|Hah.  Definitely.  I do dream analysis too.
[How old are you? What made you want to become a filmmaker? What advice can you give to an aspiring script writer/filmmaker like myself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wnawn?context=5)|I'm 27.  I've wanted to be some kind of entertainer since I was a kid.  After realizing I couldn't break dance, I started to mess around with short comedy films around junior high time.  Since then that's pretty much all I've focused on.
 |Only advice I'd give is to write/make your films.  I spent a lot of time doing internships and working shitty jobs on set and didn't get too much out of that.  It's good to network and meet people but you'll never get the opportunity to make your films if you don't have something to show.  Plus, you'll get a lot more respect as someone who's made a film rather than someone who talks about making a film.  
[That was for show, right? You didn't actually smoke oregano...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wnizn?context=5)|No we did.  It was disgusting.  Actors hated us.
[Haha that's hilarious. Egg whites and kool-aid flavored weed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wnna7?context=5)|Quite a head rush.
[Trailer looks awesome! I think I may have to give this a watch. I've always wondered though, what is that weed substitute they use in films? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wm4ko?context=5)|Here's a little vignette with our chosen method of weedery: [Link to youtu.be](http://youtu.be/b5QWPp1tbLA)
[The trailer looks hilarious!  How long have you been into making films and what was the budget for the movie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wlnur?context=5)|Thank you!  I've been making films since junior high, although they're pretty unwatchable now.  I guess I've been serious about filmmaking since college.  Budget was around 100k which goes pretty quickly when you start shooting a feature film.
[There are a lot of trolls on this subreddit. Not saying I don't believe you, but is there any way to prove you made the movie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wm2l7?context=5)|I'm no celebrity so no reason for me to lie, but nonetheless, I linked a picture of me in my illustrious cameo role as DJ Tinklesqueez (which can be seen for a split second in the trailer).
[Anyway, the movie looks hilarious. I've always thought what it would be like if my friends and I all ended up teaching at our old high school. It sounds like making it took much more time than you expected. What was it that made it take so long? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wm2l7?context=5)|Thank you! It took so long because of our restricted budget.  The whole ""fast, good or cheap and you can only pick one"" saying was very true. We had to pull in favors at every stage of production so we couldn't rightly give hard deadlines to our friends that were doing us a kindness.  We also did a shitload of test screenings to make sure that our jokes were hitting their marks.
[Would it upset you if people torrent your movie rather than paying for it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wpw8c?context=5)|Upset is a strong word.  I would prefer that they purchase it in some form or fashion so that we can make our investor his money back and continue to make films.  BUT, if it were between not watching the film at all and torrenting it, I'd prefer people get to see it somehow.  I torrent things myself, mostly when I'm not able to find something or when the distributor withholds the release of something (GoT).  That being said, let's torrent things like Battleship and throw the indie guys a bone!
[ even torrent the movie as a measure of judging the quality of the movie before going out and purchasing it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wpw8c?context=5)|I'm not opposed to that.  There's a lot of shit out there.
[I just smoked is this movie on Netflix, HuluPlus or some shit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wloo8?context=5)|It will be on Netflix very soon.  Netflix doesn't give the best deals to the independents.
[I've always wondered how that worked. Do you get a cut for every view or is it like a renter store where they just pay a larger amount up front?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wp3cj?context=5)|No cut per views.  They basically put the film on their site with the ""save"" function on.  Then based on how many people add the film to their queue, you got one flat fee for a certain agreed-upon amount of time.  It sucks.  I'm not sure how disc rentals work on there but Instant sucks for filmmakers without an established name or marketing campaign.
[Cool movie! Or so I think from the trailer! Do you have any ideas for your next movie? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wmz95?context=5)|Thanks!  I do.  And it sure as hell won't take place in a high school.
[Why, what's wrong with shooting in a high school?  Any stories to tell?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wt7qv?context=5)|Nothing wrong with it.  It was just incredibly difficult to shoot an R-rated  comedy in a state-run high school.  Then when we finally found someone cool enough to let us, there was the problem of filling it with high school aged kid extras whose parents didn't mind them being in a comedy that glamorizes drug use.  
[Hehe sounds cool, what genre?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wn1b2?context=5)|Comedy/horror.
[Together? Like an Evil Dead/Army Of Darkness kind of thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wonat?context=5)|Yea.  I pray it's in the same realm as those.
[How can i watch your movie being in the netherlands? i never used itunes and i don't plan to, any other options?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wn728?context=5)|We should be on Netflix and Amazon later this summer.  Otherwise, you may have to take to the high seas...
[I don't have cable. Is there any place on the internet that I can watch it that won't be taking money out of your pocket? Is it available on your site? Is it available on Amazon Instant?  **edit** - don't direct me to iTunes. I refuse to put that bloatware piece of crap on my computer.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4womnx?context=5)|Hahah.  I appreciate that but we don't have our own distribution outlet at the moment.  Amazon Instant is coming soon, as is DVD and Blu-Ray through Amazon.
[How hard is it to actually make a profit in the independent world? Any ideas for future films in the making?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wn9ol?context=5)|Well, this is my first foray into the feature film world but I have a lot of friends who have been in it for a while and it's pretty difficult.  The studios and distributors don't want to make or release anything that doesn't have a big name attached or is already a viable property (comic book, reboot, toy).  But, Video On Demand is changing some of that.  It's getting easier to secure a release with VOD and if the film's budget is kept low then making a profit is less daunting.  We'll see how this one goes.  It's been out on VOD for a couple of months but we haven't heard anything from the distributor about what kind of numbers it's done.  Fingers crossed.  The real goal is to just make the investor back his money so I can continue to make more films.
 |I've got a few ideas in the works.  
[How do you go about finding investors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wsjah?context=5)|We actually found our investor at Burning Man.  That's a good place to start I guess.
[How did you get your start? What advice do you have for film students who are trying to follow their dreams like you are?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wsb9b?context=5)|I got my start out of film school as a post-production dude at a video game publisher.  Did a lot of editing and a little bit of shooting.
 |Keep at it.  Get around people who know what they're doing and watch and learn.  If you want to write or direct, do that as much as humanly possible.  That's more important than going to film school.
[What was the hardest part of the shoot? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wm19u?context=5)|The hardest part of the shoot was just getting it all in the can.  Because of our restricted budget we had to cram in a lot of things to a short period of time.  We had about 35 locations and close to 100 featured roles and 19 days to shoot it all.  Dumb.
 |Also, there is a rally at the end of the film that was particularly hairy.  We were trying to sell it as a jam-packed, city-wide event but getting extras to come stand out in the 100+ Texas heat for no dough was difficult.  It was an exercise in camera wizardry to fill the frames with our same 50 extras.  Hope that doesn't ruin the illusion if you choose to watch the film!
[I was able to find a torrent for this surprisingly enough, but me once being an aspiring filmmaker i could not make myself do it. 10 dollars to you good sir! But for the AMA part.  How did you get started in film making?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wqoxi?context=5)|I've been making films for a good portion of my life but sort of got serious about it when I went to film school.  I made a few films during school and did a lot of internships at local production companies and on sets.  Then I broke off and did my own thing.  Started a production company called Beef &amp; Sage with a very funny man named Will Elliott, where we made a bunch of comedy shorts.  www.beefandsage.com.
[How did you keep yourself motivated in the early stages of trying to become what you are now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wqoxi?context=5)|I just have a crippling fear of failure that my parents instilled in me at an early age and that has kept me motivated.  Also, watching funny or great films is a big inspiration to try to make great work.
[Duuude! This looks awesome!! What was your favorite part to shoot?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wwflb?context=5)|We shot at a place called Hippy Hollow.  It's a nude beach here in Austin.  That was really fun.

[Does this have the token sexualization of women and treating them as one-dimensional fuck objects?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wsyuz?context=5)|Yes, women are sexualized in the film but so are men.  Intrigued?  I think there are a enough strong female characters in the movie to even out the hyper-sexualized ones that were shown off in the trailer.

[Trailer looks great, how was it working with Dog?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wni21?context=5)|Dog was a badass.  He had just come from doing something with George Clooney (not sure what but I want to see it).  He told us a story about how he asked Clooney if he had any advice for him.  Clooney told him, ""Just go for it.""  And he definitely did.  He was at full intensity every time he was on camera and we could all tell he was having a blast.  He's a good man.
[If you had a chance to make the movie over again, what would you do differently?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uma1u/iama_very_independent_filmmaker_who_recently/c4wn3k1?context=5)|I would write a more contained story that didn't take place in a high school.  We had way too many locations for our budget and securing a high school for an R-rated stoner comedy in Texas was quite difficult.  That was the only location that was really hard to lock down but oh was it hard.

Most of them though were paid well below the rate they deserved.  Others were paid on a deferred basis which meant half then, half if/when we  recoup our costs.  So, they were sort of taking on chance on that second half of the payment.  We did have some PAs, Grips and Extras as well that were volunteer.  The real heroes.

I ended up getting screwed over in a few of my classes in college so my GPA was not as high as I had hoped. Even with a year of practical intern experience I feel that it is difficult to find a job just because of my grades. A lot of my fellow classmates had the higher grades but by no means are they smarter in my opinion. Yet just because of those grades they get the jobs. Do you guys feel that a persons grades in college are more important than work experience?

un8wh,2,2012-06-05,"Help with my girlfriend's rather difficult parents, please?",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/un8wh/help_with_my_girlfriends_rather_difficult_parents/,"Hey R_A, I have a problem that, after awhile, I decided to ask you strangers what to do; someone has to have a similar incident. **TL;DR AT BOTTOM!** 

I've been dating my girlfriend for close to a year. It's been wonderful and after two horrendous LTRs and some ONSs, I've fallen in love. I'm 21, she's 19 and we met at college. I'm from New York and she's from New Hampshire - about 4 hours apart. Both have full time jobs (I'm a landscaper and she works at a dog shelter) over the rather work-filled summer to consume our time, but thankfully texting and Skyping on the weekends has kept it good. Since school ended in May and won't start up until August, we've decided that for a few days she should come down to me and I can introduce her to NYC, as well as get her name into the zoos here in hopes for an internship - and my parents, close family, and not-so-immediate family absolutely love her.

On campus, she's a welcomed visitor to my house by the guys I live with; her positivist attitude, cooking skills, and attempted to be one of the guys is admired by all.

Her parents however, do not love me, let alone like me. I'm Hispanic - Puerto Rican and Spanish, complete with the caramel complexion and affinity for laborious outdoor jobs at over minimum wage, while she is Caucasian and extremely sheltered. My parents have raised me with a, ""don't tell him the stove's hot, let him touch it"" approach while hers have deemed it necessary to bubble-wrap and hide everything from her. Now while I was understanding with the dislike towards me (Daddy never wants to let his little girl go), the dislike has become more spiteful and mean.

-Her mother REFUSES to acknowledge me. Going for a handshake, a hug, initiating or reciprocating a conversation leads to acting as if no one has said a word. When she came to my school condo to pick-up my girlfriend, she refused to leave the car and called her to leave, as well as denied my request to invite her in. He Christmas gift to me was a broken Navigational system, which I believed was an accident on her part (broke on transport, fell, etc.) until my girlfriend mentioned that it was a dud they had received ages ago and never threw out.

-Her younger brother's hate for me. Entering puberty, he generally can't stand me. It isn't surprising, he is the younger sibling and I wouldn't expect him to care about me too much since our similarities are bar none (He loves soccer, while I prefer going to the gym for example.) However, he wanted admission to an ""Academy"" of sorts for high school. When I mentioned to the family that at my community college, I won numerous awards in English, worked in the English department, and worked at the writing center, they asked for my help in his paper; an entry paper or, ""why should you come here"" essay. After formatting and fixing all I could while abiding to the rules I was taught, and his mother given the final lookover, when he was rejected the blame was placed on me by the parents and him. He constantly berates me for my ""accent"" that I never knew I had - it's all fun and games until I ask him to stop; then his father acts quite angrily towards me. Once again, childish antics.

-Her father believes he's competing with me for her affection and love. I'm not a sports fan, I admit baseball is boring without beer, football is good only for the Superbowl, and soccer is only fun if I'm playing with the guys at work for fun, etc while he is, thus he is extremely competitive. I've been quite understanding that yes, he must feel the pain every father feels when his little girl finally becomes serious with someone but also taken aback at some of his actions. I've said multiple times that I want to have a good relationship with him and that I admire him for being a ""self made man"", and in no way do I want to separate the family. He refuses to have anything to do with me as well; he has had multiple conversations with my girlfriend trying to convince her that I'm trying to emotionally and even psychically abuse her into leaving her family for me. He's told her many times that I want her for superficial reasons and that if our future extends beyond that of dating, I'd permanently separate the family for good. He has also done everything possible to cancel any form of communication between us - Skyping is interrupted by the immediate need to help him, texting me when he's around leads to him mocking my girlfriend and making her cry. He has also refused to pay for anything she needs since she started dating me. When they take us out (only after much begging from my girlfriend) I was required to pay for my meal after he ordered me a pricey dinner.
 
-Her family, two nights ago said that if our relationship continues that she will permanently be disowned - currently, my girlfriend is upset at the temporary disownment placed on her. Calling me crying, I was unsure what to do. I've been abiding by my mother's advice - ""never badmouth the parents, just be a shoulder for her when necessary."" She's never been the kind of child to scream and yell how she hates her parents and whatnot, but lately she feels unloved. Upon confronting them, they treat her like a two year old asking what sex is and feed her crap.

About my parents: they are both bilingual and rather ""modern."" My mother, Puerto Rican and secretary to an extremely well-off architect and my Spanish father, unable to work due to being shot and leaving him somewhat crippled and depressed, has become essentially a ""stay at home dad."" They both suggested that upon the meeting of the two families, any hate or negativity (she believes that, since where my girlfriend lives white is the only color around, her parents assume we embody the negative Spanish stereotype) would melt away and this would be a thing of the past. Her parents did NOT want to see my family nor liked the idea which have convinced my folks that there may be racism involved, something; her great-grandparents did call me a Spic upon meeting them but I credited that to their generation.

I've helped my girlfriend lose 20Lbs and counting, helped with her writing (she's dyslexic). and improved her self image and self-esteem. as well as (at first) got her to understand that her parents love her. I've slowly been introducing her to the ""real world"" and opening up politics (in a way where she can form her own opinion) and the like. I, as well as multitudes of other people - including her own grandparents - have said that we are wonderful together and I'm such a great guy. Yet her parents disagree up and down, and would swear by it. 

So here's the question and the 

**TL;DR** - what do I do with extremely spiteful parents towards me? Do I just let it roll and hope for it to end? My girlfriend is tired with the animosity from her parents, and I'm tired of the attacks at every possibility. I don't want to break up with her, but I'm afraid that this may lead to well, that, or her parents losing their daughter.

So I was wondering if you guys could enlighten me on whats expected when you get a first job in programming? How much do I need to know? What kind of programs should I be capable of writing? Etc. The more I know that I need to know; the sooner I can get started on teaching myself it..."

Pearce's pistol seems to be labeled a ""92-FS."" Google reveals that [this is an altered version of the Beretta 92](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beretta_92#92FS). Again, probably not significant.

The price of fuel appears to be $4.34 for a gallon of unleaded 84.

----------------------------------

That's about everything. Hopefully at least one of the random specific details will be important to the ARG. Even if not, at least I found some information such as protagonist background and the fact that this probably isn't too far into the future considering the price of gas doesn't seem very inflated."

",[deleted],business,https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/un1qu/i_have_2500_documents_pdf_word_html_that_i_need/,"I recently purchased a small social media marketing company. On May 1, an intern application form was set-up for a few summer intern/temp-to-hire positions. I left the application form open for 1 month and decided that I would process all of the applications at one time on June 1. Much to my delight, I received more than 500 applications each with a resume, cover letter, and multiple reference letters. The documents were uploaded as PDFs, Word documents, and HTML files. Now that I realize that I have 2,500 documents to peruse, I'd really like to be able to search through all of my applications for specific references or specific schools and such. I've been reading about OCR file processors but the cheapest I've seen is $599 with a 1,000 page daily limit. (*WTF?*) 

If possible, I'd like free software that I can put all of the files into and it will look at them all and index them into a searchable format.

Do any of you amazing people have experience in browsing such large quantities of documents, and if so, what's the industry standard for this process?

I'll start it off.  I am a rising senior in MechE, and just started interning at ERDC (Engineering Research and Development Center) for the US Army Corps of Engineers.  I'm actually working with a bunch of civil engineers on one of their big summer projects.  I can't give many details, but basically we are doing tests involving [these](http://i.imgur.com/gA36n.jpg).  Super pumped about the opportunity."
un1cu,3,2012-06-05,I am in need of some advice.  Sorry this is long.,MeanMuggin,education,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/un1cu/i_am_in_need_of_some_advice_sorry_this_is_long/,"Hi.  I am a graduate student right now in a program that is falling apart, mismanaged, unhelpful to its students, and generally the most disappointing and stressful thing I have ever done in my life.  The subject is really interesting to me, but the professors and the education are a joke.  Before you right me off as a complainer for signing up for something that is obviously hard work, just believe me and try to humor me. 

Now, when I was applying to grad school I applied for the program I am in now and a Masters in Teaching program for Secondary English.  I got my BA in English.  I was accepted to the teaching program, but decided against it.  I had done two summer student teaching internships for at risk under-served middle schoolers in my city.  It was the hardest and most rewarding thing I have ever done in my life.  All my students tested much higher on their exit exams.  I felt good about myself.    

Now I had a dilemma.  Do I pursue a subject in which I am really interested in or do I become a teacher?  I know I would be a good teacher.  My recommendations were great.  I had people I respected tell me that I would be good at being a teacher, and I don't take that lightly.  I am not really sure I am much good at anything.  Being a professional teacher was not going to be like my summer internships.  I would be teaching to tests.  No child left behind is some dumb shit, and I can't imagine myself teaching in private schools.  Could I imagine myself teaching To Kill A Mockingbird every year for 20 years?  

So now right when I am trying to get my master's proposal for my thesis approved for research, I am just getting shit on.  A torrent of shit from drama and stupid mismanagement.  I have no advisor.  I have no one I can talk to about this. So is all this stress, which is making me sick, and even my fellow students from stress, worth it?  You should do what you are good at right?  

Anyway, so what I am asking is, is teaching worth it?  Is it rewarding?  Do you get sick of the monotony or is it not really there?  You are some of the most under appreciated professionals out there.  I know the answer is going to be different for everyone, but I would really appreciate hearing about how you became a teacher and why you do what you do.  Thanks for reading this.  "

Pearce's pistol seems to be labeled a ""92-FS."" Google reveals that [this is an altered version of the Beretta 92](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beretta_92#92FS). Again, probably not significant.

The price of fuel appears to be $4.34 for a gallon of unleaded 84.

----------------------------------

That's about everything. Hopefully at least one of the random specific details will be important to the ARG. Even if not, at least I found some information such as protagonist background and the fact that this probably isn't too far into the future considering the price of gas doesn't seem very inflated."

I currently work at an engineering firm as an intern making 50k/yr. I'm finally looking into retirement plans ect. but I plan to become a professor later on with a teachers pension plan.


I know IRA wont be affected, so just want to know about a 401(k) plan.

If I invest in a 401(k) plan now, what happens when I become a professor at a university and use their teachers pension plan? I assume then, I cannot have a pension plan and a 401(k) plan?

Does the 401(k) plan get some how absorbed into the pension plan or do I keep it with my old employer, or merge it into a IRA?


TL,DR: what happens to your 401(k) when you switch jobs with teachers pensions?"

Apart from trying to improve wpm or filling out spreadsheets should they do some kind of data entry test, what should I be preparing myself for? And how?


Someone has already asked them what it might entail, however they replied that they would find out on the day. They had applied for a different position but have been given the same schedule, so it's possible they'll be testing candidates from other internships at the same time."

I already have about 5 or 6 abstracts published with my name cited as 3rd or 4th author interchangeably based off the first research project; a narrative is on its way. At this point the entire Cardiology department knows who I am and I have gotten nothing but praise and help from the research head for the division and the head from Cardiology to the extent of them giving me the opportunity to write my own first author abstract off the study (sadly didn't get accepted) and present a poster of the data I worked on. That all aside I was wondering if it would be worth it to stick to that Hospital for Med School, it might not be the best in the country but its one of the more well known Med Schools as far as internships go and I have a ton of connections/friends there already. Or would I be better off going to the best Med School I can get into and eventually make my way back there if I see fit to.

uqdrq,0,2012-06-07,I got an internship at Daytrotter! Help a fellow redditor out?,[deleted],Music,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/uqdrq/i_got_an_internship_at_daytrotter_help_a_fellow/,"Hello r/music! Long time lurker, first time poster. I'm a uni student pursuing PR in the music industry, and I'm pumped as hell to be working for Daytrotter this summer and hopefully next year. I see that people have posted [Daytrotter](http://www.daytrotter.com) links here before and a lot of you guys probably know what it is. Just in case though, I'll elaborate.

Basically it's a company operating in a studio in Rock Island, IL that schedules recording sessions with 3-5 bands per day. They play a few songs and then their session is put online for people to stream and listen to. You can hear any of the hundreds of recorded bands the way they sound naturally, so it's like going to a concert without any screaming fans, sweaty fat dudes, or crowd-surfers falling on your head. On top of all this, subscribers can use the free Daytrotter app for smart phones to stream music on their phones anywhere. It's pretty neat!

I read the rules, I know advertising is not really okay on this subreddit, there's a conflict of interest since I'm an intern. But, the reason I even attempted to get the internship is because I've loved the site for a couple years now, I'm a music junkie and find the site to be perfect for people like myself- constantly seeking new music, especially produced by artists who are genuinely passionate and talented.

I love it because it gives smaller, lesser-known bands a voice online, could even give them the start-up they need to achieve their goals as artists. They also have several more popular artists which are cool to hear in such a unique setting. Not to mention, you can hear thousands of bands live, not any edited, autotuned stuff. The owner of the site handpicks each artist and they're all great in their own way.

So I wanted to post about it because part of my internship is to attempt to network with people all over the country to raise awareness of this website. It's decently well-known but I know that there are so many music-lovers out there missing out on something they would easily love.

Here's where you guys come in (if you'd like to)! I'd encourage any of you to go check out www.daytrotter.com and even just peek at what bands have done sessions. Try searching some of your favorites in the search bar (by band name or song title). If you see some that you like, I can almost guarantee you that you'll find even more similar enjoyable bands as well. You can try a 7-day free trial using the button on the top right. They won't ask for a credit card, and you get unlimited access during the trial period. Then you can decide if you want to keep using it. If you do like it, it's only $2 per month. Since you can use it on a smart phone, iPod Touch, iPad, Kindle Fire, whatever else can access the web page or download the free app, you can pretty much use it anywhere. It's like adding thousands of songs to an mp3 player for way less than what it would actually cost.

Even if any of you only use the free trial, I hope a lot of you enjoy it! It's a really cool concept for a website and it would be great for the bands as well as all the music lovers out there for the site to become more well-known. Happy listening!

**TL;DR- Daytrotter is a music website that posts live sessions of cool bands for people to stream and listen to for cheap. My internship involves networking with people about it. If it sounds like your cup of tea, you should try a free trial! If not, no worries. Thanks for reading!**"
uqces,7,2012-06-07,I don't think I can complete this project (or start it),RandAcct,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/uqces/i_dont_think_i_can_complete_this_project_or_start/,"Recently, I was offered a 3 month Internship for a data visualization company. I am currently a CS undergrad, so it seemed right up my alley at the time. The posting asked for a few months of experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and a little bit of Java. Not really any problems there at all. 

The problems came when I was given my assignment. I was told that I have one month to convert a VERY dynamic flash data visualization to Javascript. I don't get any training either. I was given access to the system, and a developer's station, and that's it... So I started boning up on Javascript and some of the data libraries. Still not bad, right?

Well, I find out today (on my first week of the job), that I can't build this visualization from the ground up. They want me to look through every single Actionscript file on the old visualization and begin converting it. Unfortunately, I don't really know AS and the code is a mess. There are 8 different AS files with atleast 1000 lines in each. From what I can read, they all link out to Java commands as well (to pass data, and build stuff). This is where I am starting to get physically sick and scared. I have no idea how to read all of this Actionscript. I feel like it will take a month just to understand these files, and then it will be past the deadline and I won't even have a start.

I know this isn't really a straight forward question, as I didn't include any technical data. But how should I start something like this? Where do I begin? Does this seem like a typical thing for undergraduate Interns? Help?"

I'm finding it's been increasingly difficult to find a job. I've been working as a lifeguard for a private company with crappy pay, and can't begin to fathom the idea of working for them again this summer after having serious heat stroke and tachycardia due to the long hours last summer.


I've been applying for all sorts of internships, entry-level office type things, childcare jobs, anything in science... anything that will keep me out of the sun, because the paramedics said I really put myself at risk what with the tachycardia last summer. But to no avail. I'm becoming depressed from the constant rejection and lack of employment.


**So to those of you employed Torontonians...**
How did you find your job?
What are some tips you can give me in terms of applying for jobs and details that should be on my resume?
Do you know of an available position?


**TL;DR**: give me a clue as to how to get employed.



**Update** With encouragement from y'all and a little perseverance I scored an interview with a water filtration company. It isn't the academia-oriented job I want, but it's a step up from lifeguarding. Hopefully I'll land something in their chemical testing branch and put those chemistry prereq's to good use!"

Since starting the challenge ive noticed a large increase in my sex drive, and about every 3 days my morning wood returns. 

Anyway, on the second night here in Stratford I met a girl that is doing the same internship and we hooked up. We were both drunk, as im sure that had something to do with it, and I realize that it usually takes 4-5 months for a guy my age; but... I had been having incredibly strong random erections and thought that I would at least be able to get it up a little bit... no dice. Ill keep plugging away, but it is deterring me from hooking up with other girls here for fear of embarrassment.

upzff,0,2012-06-07,Finished MA in Psychology... I'm not 100% sure if I should go for my PhD. Advice?,[deleted],AcademicPsychology,https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPsychology/comments/upzff/finished_ma_in_psychology_im_not_100_sure_if_i/,"Hello all,

I just finished my MA Psychology degree in the spring of 2012. My concentration was Evolutionary/Social. Through my entire master's program I was all about research. I conducted and developed numerous research projects and was pushed by my colleagues and advisers to apply for PhD programs. They always said I'd be a success at the PhD level.

I am currently studying for GRE's to boost my score. Additionally, I have tons of research projects/experience, conference experience, some teaching experience, and I am working on getting a paper published. The thing is... after all the research I've done on PhD programs, I am not sure I want to go or if it is even worth it.

You see, I don't want to be professor and I know that's the expected track for PhD graduates. I enjoy research tremendously, and I know I could be an okay/good professor, but I know it would not make me happy. I find that I am happiest when I am either creating experiments or analyzing data alone or with close colleagues. Yes, I am an introvert by nature. I even find conferences somewhat cumbersome.

I do know that some PhD grads work outside of academia, but then I wonder if the investment in loans and time is worth it if my end goal is to work for a company, government, etc...? I am currently $40k in debt from my master's degree. After a PhD degree, the debt would increase between $100-$150k I assume. If tuition reimbursement and stipends pay for the program, I am still unsure if it's the route I want to take.

Additionally, I wouldn't start my career until my early to mid 30's. I am 27 right now. I also hear it is tough for PhD graduates to attain a job outside of academia because of the perception of being overqualified or less trainable compared to a Bachelor's or Master's graduate.

I still plan on taking the GRE's again, continuing research at my alma mater, and going to a few conferences this year, but I have been slacking on all of these things since I have come to to this realization.

I feel strongly about making a career out of human resources and perhaps if I want my PhD down the line, enroll in an online PhD program for I/O Psychology. I've also tossed around the idea of starting a career in law enforcement in the hopes of one day being a detective. That would be my second choice, though all law enforcement jobs in my area have been on a hiring freeze for years.

I have also considered going back for a bachelor's degree in stats. I think that would likely help me out tremendously. It is also a lot more economical than a PhD, and I could see a greater and quicker return on investment.

Then there's the fact of trying to get hired somewhere. I have applied for 500 jobs since mid spring, and have had only two interviews. I recently got rejected for a research position at a research hospital after two strong interviews. I am currently waiting to hear back from a human resources internship at a regional bank that has contacted me. I'm crossing my fingers on that one.

Any advice from PhD students, graduates, professionals or anyone of what I should do?

Thank you in advanced!

TL;DR - Recent MA Psych grad, unsure if he should apply for PhD programs. Enjoys research/analysis, but does not want to work in academia. Some ideas discussed above. Advice?"

I've looked up careers in the field, but hearing experiences from other people is always better than reading up online. Also, internships aren't really an option right now due to immigration processes. Thanks in advance!

Edit: I'd like to add that I'm (slowly but surely) building up my portfolio with small applications and games I've made. I've been teaching myself several languages that aren't built in my curriculum hoping that it will help open up more job opportunities for me."

They LOVELOVELOVE VATech because I'm in the Corps and do military stuff (although I don't have ambition to join the military, long story) which is why they don't mind that I'll be in so much debt. The alternative is to transfer (again) to my state school (UMD-College Park) where I'll be able to live at home and pay for in-state tuition. FWIW, my background includes majoring is geography (GIS) and plenty of federal internship experience and have extreme desire to go to graduate school (but not immediately after graduation; would wait after years of work). I love Virginia Tech but will not by the time I have to start paying that massive debt.


**EDIT** Thank you all for your quick responses, they've all been extremely helpful. To clarify: I've already applied to UMD-CP and am more than willing to transfer. I'm just playing the waiting game now. I truly love VT but not nearly enough to pay that much. My parents are funding 100% of my education which is why they're basically forcing me to go. The only reason why I chose VT in the first place was bc I was rejected from UMD-CP when I applied as a transfer last year. "

upuug,12,2012-06-07,Finished MA in Psychology... I'm not 100% sure if I should go for my PhD. Advice?,[deleted],psychology,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychology/comments/upuug/finished_ma_in_psychology_im_not_100_sure_if_i/,"Hello all,

I just finished my MA Psychology degree in the spring of 2012. My concentration was Evolutionary/Social. Through my entire master's program I was all about research. I conducted and developed numerous research projects and was pushed by my colleagues and advisers to apply for PhD programs. They always said I'd be a success at the PhD level. 

I am currently studying for GRE's to boost my score. Additionally, I have tons of research projects/experience, conference experience, some teaching experience, and I am working on getting a paper published. The thing is... after all the research I've done on PhD programs, I am not sure I want to go or if it is even worth it.

You see, I don't want to be professor and I know that's the expected track for PhD graduates. I enjoy research tremendously, and I know I could be an okay/good professor, but I know it would not make me happy. I find that I am happiest when I am either creating experiments or analyzing data alone or with close colleagues. Yes, I am an introvert by nature. I even find conferences somewhat cumbersome.

I do know that some PhD grads work outside of academia, but then I wonder if the investment in loans and time is worth it if my end goal is to work for a company, government, etc...? I am currently $40k in debt from my master's degree. After a PhD degree, the debt would increase between $100-$150k I assume, and I wouldn't start my career until my early to mid 30's. I am 27 right now. I also hear it is tough for PhD graduates to attain a job outside of academia because of the perception of being overqualified or less trainable compared to a Bachelor's or Master's graduate.

I still plan on taking the GRE's again, continuing research at my alma mater, and going to a few conferences this year, but I have been slacking on all of these things since I have come to to this realization.

I feel strongly about making a career out of human resources and perhaps if I want my PhD down the line, enroll in an online PhD program for I/O Psychology. I've also tossed around the idea of starting a career in law enforcement in the hopes of one day being a detective. That would be my second choice, though all law enforcement jobs in my area have been on a hiring freeze for years.

I have also considered going back for a bachelor's degree in stats. I think that would likely help me out tremendously. It is also a lot more economical than a PhD, and I could see a greater and quicker return on investment. 

Then there's the fact of trying to get hired somewhere. I have applied for 500 jobs since mid spring, and have had only two interviews. I recently got rejected for a research position at a research hospital after two strong interviews. I am currently waiting to hear back from a human resources internship at a regional bank that has contacted me. I'm crossing my fingers on that one.

Any advice from PhD students, graduates, professionals or anyone of what I should do?

Thank you in advanced!

TL;DR - Recent MA Psych grad, unsure if he should apply for PhD programs. Enjoys research/analysis, but does not want to work in academia. Some ideas discussed above. Advice?"

4.) Name the one food everyone who visits Switzerland absolutely must eat.

*If any of the candidates would like to give a paragraph or two about themselves and why they should be elected as a mod, they can PM me and I'll put it up in the post.*

**Candidates who are already on the list can only vote for one other candidate aside from themselves. That means you can only vote for yourself and one other person from the list.**

Please take the time to read the rules.

OK, so the idea is to elect two new moderators who will actually care about /r/Egypt's growth as a community.

I'm going to kinda pull a SCAF on your asses and add in an extra proposal for you guys to vote on.

I'm proposing that [**sidewalkchalked**](http://www.reddit.com/user/sidewalkchalked) be voted in as a third moderator so that he can help with the design and look of the subreddit, serving alongside the two other elected moderators who will be responsible for day-to-day management of the subreddit. He does seem to have a life, so he may not be able to be here on a regular basis to manage the subreddit.

So you guys get to vote on that too.

OK, here are the voting rules:

Each person gets to choose two candidates from the Candidates List below, unless you're already on the list in which case you can vote for only one candidate aside from yourself:

**Moderator Candidates List:**

* [**docmosis**](http://www.reddit.com/user/docmosis) **(Bio added.)**

* [**Masribrah**](http://www.reddit.com/user/Masribrah)

* [**daretelayam**](http://www.reddit.com/user/daretelayam) **(Bio added.)**

* [**~~Xivile~~**](http://www.reddit.com/user/Xivile) **(Withdrew)**

* [**sidewalkchalked**](http://www.reddit.com/user/sidewalkchalked)

Each person gets to vote **Yes** or **No** on the [**sidewalkchalked**](http://www.reddit.com/user/sidewalkchalked) proposal.

If you vote **No** on the proposal, you can still vote for him to be one of the two moderators.

If you are already on the Candidate List, then you vote for yourself by default and get to vote for only one other person from the list. 

*(The exception is **sidewalkchalked**. He gets to vote for two other candidates in addition to himself.)*


**Voting will start from now until the end of the 9th of June. Result will be announced on the 10th.**

I'll give my vote here to give you an example of what a vote/comment should look like:

&gt;**Yes.**

&gt;* wq678

&gt;* kingofthehill

I hope this isn't too confusing. If you have any questions just ask here or PM if you wish.

OK, start voting!

--------------

**Candidate Bios:**

Below are a few words from some of the candidates letting you know a little bit about them and why you should vote for them:

**MohamedO:**

&gt;I've been studying abroad for the last few years. Prior to that, I was born and mostly raised in Egypt. I'm an avid follower of the news, especially the news at home. I was one of the moderators of a small but fairly active message board for my university at home, so I have a little experience with that. I take a very dim view of censorship, but don't like feeding trolls either. I feel very strongly about politics, and loves me a hearty discussion. If I'm not elected mod, I still pledge to become an active member of r/Egypt. We really owe it to this subreddit I believe.

**daretelayam:**

&gt;I'm Egyptian, I've been a redditor for 4.5 years (pretty much addicted), I've been a mod of r/berserk for a year, and have seen it grow from 15 members to 600+. In short, I'm running on the 'experience' platform :D In the interest of full disclosure though, I have not lived in Egypt for a while, and most likely will not for the foreseeable future. I won't be able to organize meetups etc.
However I'd really really like to help in cultivating the growth of this subreddit and see it grow to be an intellectual meeting place for Egyptians online, even beyond the scope of Reddit.

**docmosis:**

&gt;I am an Egyptian born citizen who spent a number of years studying abroad but moved back to Egyptian shortly after the revolution take part in the political movement as well as complete my degree in political science. I love my country and I feel that as an Egyptian redditor it is my duty to make sure that this subreddit grows to it's full potential. The world as a whole has a very limited view on the reality of what is happening on the streets of Cairo and I want to make /r/Egypt an integral part in changing that. As a moderator I will work to my full potential to offer a domain where free and fair speech is available to those both inside as well as outside Egypt. Egypt is once again on the verge of immense change and I believe that this subreddit needs to follow suit to become a beacon of reliable information on what is happening in my homeland.

**ChutneyPie:**

&gt;Been living in Egypt for two years now, working in advertising. Fairly new to reddit compared to others, enjoy reading from the reddit community on the whole and also with regards to r/Egypt. If elected, would ensure a no tolerance policy towards spammers/anti arab posters as well as keeping a fresh environment that encourages new posts and comments.
Thanks,

**kingofthehill**

&gt;I am an Egyptian graduate student, currently based between Egypt and Europe. My research focuses on social media and public discourse in Egypt, and have a diverse spectrum of interests, from technology to endurance sports. I have lived in 'The City Victorious' all of my life aside from short stints in the US/Europe for one thing or another (studies, internships, etc). Reddit is a fantastic online community, and /r/Egypt deserves to as vibrant a subreddit as the country's rich history and culture. I plan on contributing to that as a member or a mod of r/Egypt.

**wq678** (I'm so sorry I took so long.)

&gt;I am an Egyptian college student who has lived most of his life in the Gulf, but who has lived the past 5 years here in Egypt. I had been living in the amazing city of Alexandria for the first four of those years, before moving last year to Cairo for my education. The first time I ever participated in a protest was when ElBaradie came to Alexandria to lead a large protest against police brutality shortly after Khaled Said's murder by Mubarak's Secret Police. I also participated in the Police Day protests on the January 25th of 2011 (the protests later turned into the Uprising that toppled Mubarak) in Alexandria. After the collapse of the Police, I decided to stay to close to home to help keep an eye out in my neighborhood and make sure my family is safe. We fought with thugs twice, and two of our neighbors were accidentally shot (one killed) by an untrained pistol-wielding idiot from our building. I voted No in the Constitutional referendum, voted for the Egyptian Bloc in the parliamentary elections and voted for Hamdeen Sabahi in the first round of the Presidential Elections. I won't be voting in the run-offs, because fuck both candidates. 

&gt;I promise to help grow this community by constantly seeking the opinion and consensus of the community and by being responsive to the community's requests. 

&gt;My aspiration is that /r/Egypt can eventually grow into being a highly-influential Egyptian internet community that will be a hub for Egyptians and residents of Egypt to organize non-partisan civic and political action for the greater benefit of Egypt.

&gt;I vow to respect everyone's right to air their opinions, no matter how hateful and morally repugnant they may be."
upmtx,13,2012-06-07,TIFU: Got fired from internship,Infernuzz666,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/upmtx/tifu_got_fired_from_internship/,"Well, actually this story is from a two years ago, and I thought I'd share it now that I had found out this subreddit.

I was still in high school, where we were obligated to do an internship of 25 hours at a non-profit organisation which were helping people in a way. Me and a friend decided to find one together to make it a little easier for us, and had some trouble already finding one. Finally we found a second-hand shop where the profit would be used to save countries with a bad economy.

So while we were happy to finally have an internship, we had to clean up really dirty shit from for example furniture and there wasn't even a single ""thank you"" from our 'leader' at the end of the day. It was just as if we were expected to be her personal slaves as she had the ability to judge us on our final review.

After a while my friend got a bit unfocused on the stuff we had to do and he started fucking around with little elastics. He got told to cut it out a few times but kept on going. After a while this bitch comes up to us and tells **we** have to stop doing this, she got angry at particularly me.

While I and another voluntary guy working there were trying to explain I had nothing to do with it, I was being treated like trash. She got angry at me and threatened to fire me from the internship *(she had threathened before)*, which would get me in trouble at school. I couldn't hold my anger inside any longer, called her a fucking bitch and told her to not be so fucking stupid. Then I was fired, my friend could stay though, because he apparently did nothing (according to her).

The worst part of it was that I had done **23** of the 25 hours, and then had to explain my supervisor at school what happened, while the bitch had already called school and made me look like an asshole. I had to look for a new internship and had to do another 10 hours.

Luckily my new internship was at my father's place and other workers in that area and I had to do all kinds of random stuff which were way more fun, I even got thanked to do this for them and sometimes got double hours from them for my hard working."
upkln,6,2012-06-07,Non-LA major (Engineering) applying for an MLA program.. please advise,yurtle,LandscapeArchitecture,https://www.reddit.com/r/LandscapeArchitecture/comments/upkln/nonla_major_engineering_applying_for_an_mla/,"I recently graduated in May with a B.S. in Bioengineering and had planned to continue with a Master of Engineering program in Chemical engineering in the fall.


During my last semester of college I had a change of heart and realized that a career in engineering was not what I wanted. I did a serious re-evaluation of my interests, and when putting together my interests in art, design, horticulture, and the outdoors, I decided that a career in landscape architecture would really be fitting for me. Doing some research of my own in the career fields involved in LA and meeting with professors and students in the LA department at my university helped solidify my decision to make the switch from engineering.


I plan to apply for MLA programs for the Fall of 2013, which means I have until November~January (5 months) to prepare an application, including my portfolio, which I have learned is the most important component. During those 5 months I plan to focus on preparing my portfolio.


My plan is to enroll in classes for Sketching, Photoshop, Illustrator, AutoCAD, and 3ds Max. I have some basic skills in AutoCAD and am pretty confident in sketching, but the rest I have no experience in. It's a LOT to cover in such a short period but does this sound like a good plan?


Also, I'd like to get some exposure of LA in action. Since I have no background in LA at all, getting internships in LA firms are pretty much out of the question. What other things are there that I could do? My main goal is to get some experience so I am more than willing to do unpaid jobs.


I’d very much appreciate any advice on applying for MLA programs with portfolio prep in particular and also finding work in LA. Thanks!"

This summer my roommate and I want to create a game. We're both programmers at a university, and want some fun coding to do after our standard internship coding. I've been in the video game developer's club here at my university for quite some time, but all projects get suspended during the summer. Our intended scope of the project is 2-4 months (but if we decide to, we can develop until we want to stop).

What I'm asking /r/gamedev is:

1. A game idea or mechanic scoped for our time frame

2. If anyone out there wants to jump onboard (mostly artists)

EDIT: I'd like to have 1 more artist on board! 

We have an idea right now, but we are open to creative input and have no quarrels with throwing out any of our ideas out the window. What we have in mind is a 2D puzzle platformer (I know, not another one...) where the mechanic is temporal dimensions. There are 3 times, the past, present and future, and all the levels would be puzzles involving the manipulation of them. For example, you're in the present and you encounter a bridge that is broken. So, to cross it, you must go to the past where that bridge is still in good condition. Another example, say you needed to go up a cliff. Nearby, you might find a seed that if you go to the past and plant it, then travel to the future, a vine has grown, allowing you to climb to the top of the cliff. Stuff like that.

Anyway, this would be a project just for fun. We're okay with trashing everything and doing anything else, really, as long as it's a good idea and fits our scope.

Before you all decide what to do with your life I thought I'd share some of the experiences that I had this year as an intern.  I am an internal medicine resident at a well respected academic East coast program known for its humanistic bent. 

Some typical experiences. I have...

-been over my duty hours at least 50% of the time, worked several 100+ hour weeks, been told to keep my mouth shut and me more efficient when I brought it up to my chief,

-stayed awake for six straight days on coffee and 5-hour energy drink because as a night float intern some attendings want you to be present for rounds after your night shift,

-had three separate co-interns endorse suicidal ideation in a single day and had at least one of those be serious (they lived),

-Coded three people in a single early morning, with crying family members in the room, and then got yelled at by an attending for not having my notes finished on time,

-saw a co-intern work with hourly vomiting/diarrhea (because the penalty for missing a day is to be placed first on the sick call list and this generally means missing 1-2 weeks of elective time), then place an IV in his own arm and give himself fluids while writing his notes at the end of a call day,

-been called to sub for a sick intern on my first day off in two weeks (it was a night shift),

-observed a co-intern who had 10 days off in a 4 month stretch of back to back floor months (post night days off count as days off),

-had a nurse not call me for a patient with active GI bleed until the tech noticed that their breath was shallow (Hgb 4.0),

-had a patient yell at me and call me some not-so-nice names for not giving him enough morphine after I recognized a silent NSTEMI on his telemetry and he had to undergo emergent cath,

Some funny things did happen as well. I...

-had a knife drawn on me by a patient in their room,

-had a patient leave the building to shoot heroin through their IV and then come back high,

-had a patient smoke crack in their room,

-had a patient's family member attempt to strangle another family member at the patient's bedside,

-had a constipated guy pass a poop as big as his head (he was a young man).


These are off the top of my head I'll think of some more in a bit, but I have to go to work now. Anyone else?"

My cGPA is somewhere around a 3.0. I still need to take more of the gen chem/ochem/bio courses, which would raise my sGPA (not sure what sGPA is at the moment, but should be around the same, maybe higher).

I am concerned about applying and matriculating in M.D. schools, although I will mostly likely be applying to both D.O. and M.D. schools to keep my options open. 

Some EC's about me:
I have been shadowing an ENT Surgeon (Otolaryngologist) for about 70ish hours so far, been volunteering close to 100 hours at the same hospital, and about to start researching with an upcoming graduate student in the same hospital (my PI is an M.D./Ph.D). I've seen how attendings/interns/residents/chief residents communicate with patients. I have some pretty good exposure to patients and their medical ailments while following around an attending anesthesiologist during rounds with the new interns. I have done martial arts for about 14 years, and in multiple styles (this has helped me stay disciplined academically and throughout life in general). Was the president of the engineering club at my community college (not sure if that would be considered significant at a community college). Helped tutor some java programming at my community college as well. I am in the Pre-SOMA club, as well as AMSA club at my university (might apply to become an officer in the club). I have some other EC's, but I believe this should be enough for now.

I am not sure how else to keep myself at the competitive edge. I am maintaining an upward GPA trend since my first quarter, and I plan on keeping it this way. However, should I look into a post-bac after graduating from my current university to help raise my GPA? Should i maybe try for SMP? What should I look into in order to keep myself on track towards success?

One other thing I wanted to mention. I am also a Palestinian (Greek Orthodox faith), I highly disagree with the notion of being labeled ""white"" under job applications, surveys, ect.. Would there be anyway to check ""African American"" if I come from a family that is 100% palestinian, but contain some family generations from Africa? I am pretty sure Middle Eastern/Palestinian will be labeled as ""white"" in the AMCAS application, correct me if i'm wrong.

I would write more, but this is more than enough haha. Thanks for reading!

I was treated for 5 months and came out with my tumor(s) in recession. I have checkups every six months to ensure my cancer is still in recession.

The job part: I graduated from a respected college two years ago with a solid GPA and four internships under my belt. I moved to New York City and worked freelance for a long time before holding a steady full-time job within my career path for six months. I was laid off a month ago, apply to ten jobs per day, and never get as much as a rejection letter/email.

Having cancer, especially at 16 years old, was a huge part of my life, and I came out of it a stronger person. Beating cancer was the greatest achievement of my life and I think because of that it may deserve a place on my resume. However, I'm afraid it's also somewhat out of place, and some people might label it as something I'm doing for sympathy, or a cheat in order to get extra consideration. For context, I went through four years of college and two years post-college telling only a select few people about my past with cancer because I don't want to be labeled as the guy who is a cancer survivor. I like being a normal person. But I also like being employed. "

However, my boyfriend, career wise, does not have very many options location wise. He's planning to go into the reserve units with the air force and right now, the ones that are the most feasible to him are the ones in California, and possibly Portland or Seattle.

There's a possibility that he'd be in Milwaukee but that's a long shot.

My story or whatever. Just thought a wrap-up is necessary. This is my new account for this subreddit. I will use an absolute scale for girls with 6.5 being my fuckable threshold and 10 being unobtainable. I can't put timestamps on these.

I made lots of good friends this year. It can be attributed to improving my confidence through improving my body and mind. Reading some Tolle, listening to RSD vids, going out and talking to men and women, kissing lots of girls, getting freaky, and doing well academically.


Did study abroad and kept my girlfriend back home. Did the long distance thing. I didn't cheat or anything even though I had plenty of opportunities. We broke up during my finals week and that sucked a huge one. I was really into her and it was pretty emotional for me. She wanted to ""be 21 in her city for her summer internship."" Yeah she wanted to do whatever and be guilt-free. 

My buddy had mentioned ""The Game"" to me about it was about getting good with women so I ended up reading it. It was entertaining enough but I wanted more. I searched Mystery and all those guys. They seemed kinda weird but were apparently pimps just not my style. Nothing really for a while but then youtube showed me a Tyler RSD vid that was suggested for me. This was October, the beginning. Watched quite a few RSD videos. Tyler is one crazy mofo (hilarious) but his talks made sense. I was hitting the gym and my inner game was pretty good. 

Halloween I meet a girl though a friend and I get laid (HB 6.75, busty redhead,my bed, awesome sex, we are still friends)

However, I wasn't 21 yet like all of my friends so there wasn't much I could do.

**I turn 21**

Birthday weekend I bring another girl home but then the semester ends. (HB 6.5, makeout, crashed at my place, I was drunk)

**Spring semester senior year**

Party at our house I flirt hard with a girl who is a sorority sister of
housemate's GF. (HB 7.5, fantastic body, makeout first night, become friends with benefits, 3rd base almost every other night, still friends)

Out at a bar soon thereafter, meet up with a friend, cute HB 8 in group, we talk and I make it to her sorority house and I get her number and we end up hanging out a few times. I never even get a kiss. I still regret not being forward enough.

I find out about Natural Game and I watch the Tim Method stuff.

**Level up time**

Go to a bar/club. Meet up with a girl friend who brought her friend. We end up hitting it off. Dancing hardcore. Grazing faces. As we are bouncing to another bar I pull her and against a wall. Makeout. Two hours later back to her place. (HB 8 redhead, freak, F-close, good times)

Hooked up with friends little sister. (HB 6, not that attractive, I swear she roofied me, 3rd base) 

So I'm still seeing the redhead at this point. An open relationship of sorts.

**Spring Break time (holy shit)**

Basically it's my university down in this spring break town. Level up time. 

7 or 8 total makeouts and one F-close in one week. 

One night in particular.

* Madeout with a HB 8.5 but she felt bad because I literally took her from a friend of mine who asked her to a formal (I didn't know), 
* 30 minutes later a HB 7.5 (tad chubby)
* 20 minutes later I told my friends I was in the zone. Went up to a HB8 we sorta know, told them I could makeout in less than 5 minutes for $5. I won.

F-close was the the next night. I had approached her (HB 8) and her friends (One 8 the other a 8.5) two nights before and got her number. I texted them, met up by myself with three girls. Left with all three. I thought I was gonna have a 4some. Two of the girls leave and my girl says she's wanted me since I got her number cus I was smooth as fuck and sexy apparently. 

**Back home**

I end up getting a new hookup buddy from a different sorority. HB 8.5. She's really well known by everyone on campus but she's a bit weird.


Then one of my close friends in my friend group reveals that she has had a thing for me. I've always liked her. Really awesome girl. HB 9, former cheerleader but a bad semester made her a bit chubby not bad tho. We end up dating for a while. First night we were seeing each other I was still in game mode. I accidentally picked up a girl and next thing I know I'm making out with this HB 7.5 or so and my hand is on her ass and she is wanting to bounce. I tell her no.

Continue dating HB 9 for next month till school ends. She is sad cus we are really good together, she finds out about my PUA side and is disappointed and disgusted but I respect her decision as she is truly a fantastic person.

And here I am now waiting to move down to ATL to start my new job.

I know I missed some hookups. There are more than I ever could have imagined. The best nights I had were the ones where I went out with friends and just had fun with them. This attracted others into our frame and they were aroused and by simply adding sexual energy we were all able to have a good time. 

That that girl I was dating when I was abroad? Yeah she now wants me back. Will I let her back in? No way! There are lots of amazing girls out there and once you realize that you are just as amazing you will be the prize and choose what you want. Don't settle.

up869,0,2012-06-06,Looking for advice. (6),tparrott123,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/up869/looking_for_advice_6/,"Background to story:
-Typical suburban male, age 20, living under parents roof. Car insurance/payments covered. Phone bill covered. Health Insurance covered. No rent. Free food. Occasional help with average items. 

I make roughly $8.35/hr and work 35-40 hours a week at work during the summer. 20-25 hours a week during the school months. 

I pay for gas and bud which turns out to be ~$350/400 month out of an average of $700/month total income after random taxes/stupid purchases. Leaving $300/month towards savings for books, random vacations, etc.

I appreciate my parents and in the current economy and situation I can't get it much more easy. I have 2 and a half years left of college before I graduate with a Bachelors Degree in Environmental Science. I would love to get involved and do some internships learning forestry work and sustainable growth patterns. I would love to one day own a tree farm and grow my trees so to help end the need for clear cuts. I have however, currently no experience except for what I have learned in basic introduction to Environmental Science courses.

The problem I am facing will not be for another two and a half years but I trying to plan ahead. Currently as seen above, I depend on my parents financially. And as much as I love them, I need my interdependency to grow. 

I have two and a half years to save and if I continue to save ~$200/month I will have ~$6,000. This is assuming I am barely saving any of the money I can actually make and save by minimizing my bud/gas/random fun expenses. I need advice and I come to the trees form with hope to future aid both 'our trees' and 'r/trees'. I live in Western Massachusetts and would love to live in a warmer climate with milder winters and rich forest job economies. Does anyone have any tips on places to live, people to contact, organizations that can aid me in becoming more educated, better financially independent, and can help me more quickly attain my end goal of living away from my parents with a college degree.

Side notes I feel important to add:
I plan to live with my parents and save money until I complete college. At the end of which I will have roughly ~5,000 - ~7,000 in debt. Jobs in my area are scarce and the best I will be able to obtain in a salary increase will be up to $10.00 an hour. I do not mind living in cramped living spaces as I lived in a college dorm room for 1 and a half years. I recently moved home so as to attend the local college to me and not graduate with debt from college. I will have no debt from college and simply the $5,000-$7,000 debt listed above. 

Basically what I am looking for here besides advice r/trees is a helping hand of guidance or connections I can contact that can help me in the future. :) Feel free to PM if you want to share any personal information. 

Areas I find very interesting: Northern California up to Canada (Never been, but I absolutely love old growth). Western-&gt; Virginia (Roanoke Area). Anywhere with a warm climate, old growth, forest jobs, connections, a spare closet I can live in for dirt cheap, or just random advice on what to do and where to go will be appreciated :). Thanks guys."

A few things about myself, i'm a 21 year old female studying film. I've only got one more project to do to finish my degree. The problem is, I'm terrified of failing it and it's stopping me right on my tracks!


A bit of background, I did this same project but I failed the first time due to personal issues (was in a bad relationship, broke up during a crucial time of the project, failed it miserably) After that, I did an internship that was completely awful. Imagine going to culinary school, training under a brilliant chef, then getting put to work packing pizzas into boxes for a year as your internship. That was basically it. I was going mad, I kept getting bullied by my boss and my work self-esteem is just not there anymore. Being told almost every day that I can't even pack properly (how many ways are there??) so there's no way i'd be any good at filming, is very draining. I got very depressed, and I still don't know how to get over that.



In a few days I will be doing over my project, and I'm terrified. I don't believe I can do it. The school/university doesn't believe I can do it. I have a wonderful support at home (family and SO) but that just isn't enough. No matter what I do, I think it's terrible. I get praises for work, I instantly pick up everything that makes it horrible. I don't know how to over come this fear!


Lately i've been getting very anxious about a lot of things; had an operation, went under general anesthetic and now i'm afraid to go to sleep cos I might die. Silly, I know, it's gotten a lot better but I still have sleepless nights. Also, i'm living at home with my parents and I can't take it anymore. I want to move back into the city I lived in last year (8 hours away drive) but because of practical reasons I can't figure out how to (money, job, school not sorting out my enrollment so I can't get a loan yet). I am a very social person and need to be around people (my SO is also in this city, and it's getting me down quite a lot as well).


This added anxiety isn't helping! But my main issue is getting over my work issues. I don't know how to. If it were up to me, I wouldn't have kept going with the degree. It was basically my parents 'bullying' me into finishing it, and now i'm here. I don't even know what I want to do yet! At the moment, I want to make wedding videos and wedding cakes and make a living out of that (yes, I bake as well), but then I think about everything else about film that I like, and i'm totally lost again. THEN I think about everything else I want to do in ife, and i'm even more lost!


I have so many thoughts and emotions in my head that I don't even know how to write them down (sorry if it's all over the place). Has anybody else had something similar, and how did you over come it? I know it isn't a HUGE deal; no one is dying, i'm healthy, I have supportive family and friends, but I'm just completely lost!!



Please ask questions, i'm sure i've left things out. Thanks!


**TL;DR: I don't know how to get over my lack of work self-esteem, and just want to give up**

My girlfriend got a job at Disney, and I wanted to go with her. I'm a freelance videographer, so I work whenever and, to some degree, where ever. I have been applying to stuff in that area, but obviously, it's uncertain. I've raised enough cash that I'll be safe for a solid 6 months, and my lease was for 7 months (6 months in FL is considered a ""vacation,"" and the taxes for the renter are different, so she was very specific that it had to be 7, which is fine as that's when my girlfriend's internship ends). So far, the landlord and I have had a few phone conversations, but mostly email.

I did the background check, I passed, I sent the deposit, I made her well aware that I wouldn't be there until at least the 15th as I have shoots schedules up to then. I moved out of my apartment and I'm staying with family for a few weeks until I move.

I have no service at my family's place. I went out for a shoot today and had a very casual voicemail from the landlord. I returned her call, and she told me, as if in passing, ""I terminated the lease."" I was taken aback; I asked why. She said because I didn't return her call, and because I sent a check with someone else's name (my mother's, I gave her cash and said ""send a check""), and on my background check I wrote ""(my name) II"" (I'm the 2nd) and on the lease I wrote ""(my name)"" (but I don't always write it out). Who gives a shit? Apparently, she does.

We went back and forth about how ""I wasn't there yet,"" when I plainly told her I wouldn't be, and she ""didn't even know when I'd get there,"" when I plainly told her I'd be taking shoots up until around the 15th, at which point I'd leave.

She questioned my finances, and what I did for a living, and a myriad of other things, like I was a criminal. I told her plainly that I passed the background check, and as long as I could pay rent, she needn't be concerned. I said I had saved up enough to cover the entire trip, if it were any of her business. She scoff and said ""is it illegal?"" like I sell fucking drugs or something. I'm a dude with a goddamn camera.

Anyway, no I'm screwed. I have nowhere to move to, and because of the ""vacation"" clause, if I find somewhere else, it'll be 6 months rather than 7, and Florida doesn't permit rentals of 6 months or less (so she claims).

What the hell can I do?"

getting your contract?",watchmejump,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/usamv/how_long_does_it_take_from_a_verbal_job_offer_to/,"After getting through many stages of interviews with a very large company, I initially got notice that I came in 2nd place for the job, but that there might be another opportunity for me. Then, 2.5 weeks ago, the HR person phoned me to say there is great news, and that they want to offer me either a 1 year contract or a full time position... but that they're waiting for one of the managers to return from a trip. It was supposed to take one week.

Last week, she called me again to keep me updated, and said he wouldn't be back until this week, as the manager's trip got extended. She said to expect to have all the details by about Tuesday. She also said that she was moving to another department, and that I was going to be dealing with another HR person instead of her. She re-stated that I have the offer, and she even sent me a brief email to say so.

When I didn't hear anything, yesterday I tried contacting both her, and her replacement, but I haven't got a reply yet.

I'm getting a bit nervous here, because after the initial excitement, it has now been 2.5 weeks since she said they'd like to offer it to me. Meanwhile I have no details :(

Is this normal? It's my first time applying for full time jobs (though I've done a bunch of paid internships when I was in university), so I don't really know the routine.

Oh, and something interesting.... the former HR person added me on LinkedIn today, even though she didn't reply to my email yet.

Has anyone had a similar experience?"
us99y,2,2012-06-08,"How do you cope with the unexpected loss of a loved 
one?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/us99y/how_do_you_cope_with_the_unexpected_loss_of_a/,"Even though it's just started, this has been a really shitty summer. At the end of May, my wife and I had to put our 20-year-old cat to sleep. Then, six days later, our 25-year-old niece died in a car accident this week.

**tl;dr**: Please just go read some other post. Right now, I'm looking for understanding and support, not half-informed, off-the-cuff comments that are only tenuously related to what I'm talking about. I'm not trying to be a douche, but I'm just not in a good place at the moment, so I'm kind of grumpy.

She was the daughter of my wife's sister, but I've known her for 11 years, now. She wasn't much younger than us (my wife is the youngest of 9 children--this niece was the same age as my younger sister), and a few years ago, she lived with us for a year while attending a local community college. She and I hung out together and became close friends. She moved away to go to a different school, but she spent a week with us in March when she had a short internship here in town.

I'm fairly introspective and self-aware, and I'd like to believe that I'm quite articulate. I'm not the stoic, emotionless kind of guy, and I'm not the type that suppresses my feelings or refuses to talk to others about them, or that can't properly express myself when talking about how I feel. On the other hand, I'm not particularly sensitive or emotional, either. I'm normally pretty laid-back and happy-go-lucky, and although I have a wry, sarcastic sense of humor, I prefer to look for positives or find the humor in a situation, or simply let it pass, rather than dwell on the negative. But this situation is affecting me in ways that I don't understand. It's not that I'm particularly hard-hit by it, although I'm obviously upset; it's that I'm not as distraught as I feel I should be. 

On an intellectual level, this loss occupies most of my thoughts, and I haven't gotten much work done, but if I want to, I'm able to focus on other things without obsessing over this. I'm not at the top of my game (and I'm sure that part of this is due to my current physical condition), but I don't think that I'm noticeably distracted or absent-minded, or anything like that. I've noticed that I've been occupying my time with low-priority, mid-range intelligence/focus tasks, such as beefing up the security of my home network, cleaning the house and rearranging all of the rooms, etc. To some degree, that's because I'm a little burned-out; I had paper deadlines in April and May, and then I immediately had to prepare for a professional certification exam that I sat for last week. So right now, I'm not particularly enthusiastic about jumping right back into the mentally-taxing tasks (i.e., more research, writing more papers, doing edits on others and trying to get them published, etc.) that are higher on my to-do lists. But I'm also aware that I'm not able to do my best work right now, so I haven't really been trying to tackle anything too complex.

Physically, I'm fairly messed up. My back and shoulders ache like I just climbed a mountain, and I've got a constant low-grade headache--both of these show up when I'm under a lot of stress, but usually these symptoms subside a bit once I recognize them for what they are and make a conscious effort to control my stress levels. That hasn't been the case (maybe because I have no idea how to limit this kind of stress), and I have other physical symptoms that are less normal for me. I can't sleep, although not because I'm up late dwelling on things--I just can't fall asleep. Insomnia isn't uncommon for me; I usually spend at least one or two nights each week tossing and turning, and even on good nights it normally takes me about 90 - 150 minutes to fall asleep on any given night. Now I'm lucky to fall asleep at all, and when I do, I wake after an hour or two. I'm also extremely tired in the morning. I expect that's primarily because I haven't been getting nearly enough sleep, but normally, I'm a morning person, and even if I haven't had enough sleep, I'm awake once the sun comes up. Unless I'm extremely sleep-deprived, I wake naturally 15-30 minutes before my alarm goes off, and I don't feel unduly tired throughout the day; I'm starting to cross that deprivation threshold, but I've felt abnormally tired and lethargic for the past week and half (basically since we made the decision to have our cat put down). My appetite has been disrupted, to: I'm able to eat if I remember that I should, but I haven't felt hungry at all, and I've been completely uninterested in food even when I do think of it. Alternatively, I'm occasionally--but rarely--ravenously hungry. Normally, I'm somewhat of a foodie. Also, I have a sore throat, and in general, I feel like I'm coming down with something (and I probably am--not eating or sleeping isn't good for you).

Emotionally, I'm not experiencing nearly as sadness as I had expected. I've had a few moments of intense sadness, and I've cried a few times, but most of the time it's just a generalized disappointment, like something that I was really hoping for didn't work out, and I haven't decided on an alternative yet. I'm familiar with the stages of grief, and I know that they're not as linear as they seem on paper, and I'm definitely experiencing some of them, but some of what I'm feeling doesn't fit into any of the categories, and some of what did fit didn't seem particularly significant (but I didn't notice a stage for ""not complying with the stages of grief"").

I know that part of why I feel the way I do is because it hasn't fully sunk in yet. After she moved out, we only saw her a few times each year, so I didn't have the shock of going from seeing her every day to not seeing her at all. Also, I've seen photos of her car after the accident, but I haven't seen her (and won't--she's already been cremated). I'm definitely the type of person who finds some measure of closure in seeing the body. When we had our cat put to sleep, I wanted to be there in the room, partially to comfort the cat and to be sure that it was as peaceful as possible, and partially for my own peace of mind, so that my last memories of her weren't of a stranger just taking my cat into another room. But I can't have that with my niece, and I'm actually feeling a little indignant about it, even though I rationally know that (a) it wasn't possible; and (b) as an uncle that married into the family, my wants in this situation are subordinate to quite a few others. In some small way, I'm also displacing some of what I feel about the loss and putting it into that--I feel cheated because I won't be able to see her one last time, but I haven't yet reached the point where I'm confronting her death directly.

Another part of my problem is that my wife's family is much more stoic than what I grew up with. As I said earlier, I'm not particularly sensitive or emotional, but my family (both nuclear and extended) was usually somewhat open about their emotions when it came to grieving, and we're the type of people that copes by talking about things. My wife's family, on the other hand, is much more guarded. Neither men nor women display much emotion. I don't think it's that they think men aren't supposed to show emotion, or anything like that; it's more that they aren't comfortable with emotions--for the most part, they're not even really comfortable hugging, which makes the first 10 minutes of every holiday with my side of the family particularly awkward for my wife. But because they're they kind of people that prefer to deal with their emotions privately, my normal support-giving/getting strategy doesn't work in this situation. (However, this doesn't make me upset, or anything, other than just feeling awkward, because the things I would normally do in similar situations don't seem appropriate in this one.)

Something else that really makes this hard for me is the fact that it happened so soon after we had to put our cat to sleep. First, the kind of comforting thoughts that I've cultivated over the months, knowing for a long time that our cat would never recover don't work when applied to our niece. I feel better about the cat when I'm able to say to my wife (or to myself), ""It's okay--she was 20 years old. She had a long, full, happy life."" And our niece wasn't much older than the cat, but thinking about the fact that she was 25 isn't exactly comforting. Second, I feel bad that I've hardly about the cat, because I did like her, but because this happened so soon afterward, I'm preoccupied with thoughts of our niece. And if I *do* think about the cat, I feel bad that I'm thinking about a cat when what happened to our niece was much more tragic. And third, I still haven't recovered from the stress or sadness of losing the cat--all of those emotions have just been pushed to the side, so I alternate between feeling like those emotions are going to evaporate before I have the chance to experience them, or they'll come rushing back to me much later. In the first case, I'll feel guilty about the fact that what I felt over the loss of our cat wasn't proportionate to how much the cat meant to me. In the second case, I'll either feel like it's unreasonable to be so upset about the cat so much later--and therefore won't let myself deal with those feelings properly--or I'll be upset because I'll most likely have forgotten little things, even though I cared about the cat.

But thing that I find most difficult about everything is the fact that it happened so suddenly and unexpectedly, and that the impact is so immediate and permanent. Apart from the shock, I'm still struggling to reconcile the intellectual facts that I know to be true with the emotions that I can't predict or control. It might be ridiculous or cliché, but I have to admit that I still feel like young people are relatively invincible--nothing seriously bad happens to us. People grow old and die, but that's to be expected. Cats grow old and die, and that's to be expected. But not only did I not have any time to mentally prepare myself for this loss, but a big part of me was successfully ignoring the fact that people under 30 are just as mortal as those over 70. This experience hasn't caused me to confront my own mortality, or anything like that, but it has been jarring to have my expectations realigned like this. And like I said, I didn't have time to prepare for this. I wasn't ready for it, and I hadn't been able to process the reality of the loss ahead of time, so it's hitting me all at once. But instead of being able to sit down and confront it, I feel like I'm so overwhelmed that I'm still just kind of in shock about it. In the meantime, I'm just sort of going through the motions of what I think I'm supposed to do, and trying to feel what I think I'm supposed to feel about this.

I guess the one positive thing I can say about losing our niece is that the realization that I'll never see her again or make any new memories with her has really pointed out how many happy memories of her I do have. Sure, I also have the memories of the ways that she annoyed me and the stupid things she did that everyone always comes to cherish after losing a loved one, but I can confidently say that I have many memories of hanging out with her that are geuniunely happy and pleasant, and that in the short time that she was in my life, she brought me a disproportiately large amount of joy.

I know this was a long post--I tend to wax prolific when I discuss serious matters. Thanks for reading everything. Although I _am_ asking for your thoughts and advice regarding coping strategies, I also wrote this post with the intent that it would serve a cathartic function, helping me to work through my feelings with my rational mind, rather than having a jumble of emotions playing musical chairs in my head. I guess to some degree, it has, but I think now I need some time to process everything, before I can make sense of it all.

To wrap things up, I'll leave you with a quote from my niece's About Me section of her Facebook profile. I know it seems a little trite--and stereotypical for a 25-year-old girl--but it seems entirely appropriate, if a bit painful:
""Some important lessons about life: What you see is not always what you get. Love always wins. Be true to yourself. Don't take a single moment for granted."""

I am currently intermediate to advanced in writing/reading, but I don't have a lot of confidence when it comes to speaking/comprehension. 

What are some effective ways to immerse myself whilst in France?

---------

My original idea was to volunteer in a francophone university. I received very attractive research internship offers in both France and Québec, however both ended up falling through due to administrative reasons - I am unable to get a Canadian work permit quickly enough, and the French university needed permission from my 'home' university who refused to endorse it in any way given that I am almost graduated.

So I am back to the drawing board. One of the obvious options seems to be doing an immersion course. However, I personally find things more gratifying when you can do them cheaply =) I am tempted to grab my bike and a tent and go touring. However, I am wondering how I can ensure using my French a lot while doing this?"

We dated for two incredible years in college, and he is truly my closest friend. He is moving to the west coast for work in a week, while I just arrived in a new city on the east coast for a summer internship before I go back to our home town for grad school in August.



We decided to go on a break for a number of reasons. We have done long distance before, and felt that it breeds contempt, jealousy, and anger, because you simply can't give someone the same love and attention that you can when you're living across the street from each other. We are also too young to be considering marriage, and both want to get settled with our careers first. What we decided for this break was it was not a break up, but a hiatus. He said he definitely wants to revisit this in the future; how soon, we can't be certain. 


I love him more than anything, and I think he might be the one. He feels the same way. So we're on this break as of yesterday when he kissed me goodbye at security at the airport, and to be honest, the past day was okay. I kept myself busy, going on adventures, saw some local friends, took myself out for a nice meal and got my nails done. We even video chatted last night, and it was normal; he told me I looked beautiful, said he loved me, and we even kissed the camera like we used to do. 


What the hell are we doing?! Here we are, so happy and still in love, but trying to give each other the freedom to discover themselves on their own and grow and become our own people. We even said that if we meet someone else, it would be okay to pursue it. So we're single-ish, but still in relationship mode. I lost my virginity to him. I can't imagine being with anyone else. It frightens me enormously, and just feels wrong. 

Again, it's been a day. But can anyone help me sort out my feelings, and give me advice on how to best handle this? It is really starting to hit me now, and I'm hurting. A lot. And feeling lonely and scared in a new city. Thank you.

People are telling me I'd be an idiot to reject a job offer if I got one at the end in this economic climate etc.. but I'm starting to think I'd be an idiot to take it.

I've decided that I have a responsibility to do something great with my life. I am amongst the richest households of one of the richest countries that exists.. I owe it to the world to not waste that. Relative to most I have unlimited support and opportunity. 

I'm also a talented fellow. At heart I'm a musician, but my technical skills due to lack of practice hold me back. I'm generally quite good at most things (sports, games.. yaknow). This is all said without ANY arrogance, trust me. I think the first step to doing something great is being honest with myself and knowing that I have the ability in there to do it.

But what is it..? This is what I'd like some help with.. is it too ambitious to want to be a musician? This subreddit would have me believe that if I put the hours in I can do it.. but can I? Is it realistic to earn a living from music like millions of people want to? Failing that I'd quite like to run my own business I suppose.. I'm really jealous of all the little ideas I see around on the internet (e.g. this chains.cc website). But anything like that seems so distant from me at the moment. I'm only a child really. 

..so what's my excuse? I guess it's the classic 'fear of failure'. I also have a strange fear about even mentioning something like 'I'd like to run a business' to my parents, even though they'd be supportive. Think about all the people who have to go against their parents to do what they want! I have an opportunity to do something good here. 
I'm having a year off after uni to go travelling. Looking forward to that immensely. But what then? How do I figure this out?

Sorry if this is very vague, any nuggets of wisdom about anything I've said would be highly appreciated, thanks wolves!"

I’m trying to figure out where I went wrong and concrete solutions to my perceived problems. 

********************************
Start TL/DR;
********************************

My current situation is as follows:

•	20 going on 21 years old

•	Zero living friends (will elaborate later in this post)

•	Dead end job that barely makes ends meet.

•	Occasionally do questionable at best for extra cash when the ends don’t meet up.
 
•	Stuck in a small town with a shattered economy where an open air drug market exists. 

•	Stuck in college with little to no financial aid that is rapidly evaporating. 

********************************
End TL/DR;
********************************


To be frank, I’m fucking distressed. To put things into perspective, I’ve been homeless as a minor and lost my mother when I was 7 and still never felt this bad before.  My view on the list above is as follows: 


Problem A) Zero living friends. 


Most of my friends were in Seattle, WA. The short version is that most of them overdosed on drugs of their choice or combinations of them. It still doesn’t change how I felt about them or still feel about them. They were all I had in the world that I knew I could depend on. These aren’t the friends that are only there on Facebook and whatnot, these were people that stuck their necks out for me. Since I started college I haven’t been able to make a single friend or contact. My existence is one of barely making enough money to continue, school  and having just enough sleep to avoid getting into a horrible car crash. 


Solution A) Find Friends.


Much easier said than done. I learned quite a few things about the character of people from living in austere conditions, but it turns out that most people are just as shallow as I remembered. The ones who aren’t still give me the same funny looks, so I eventually adopted an “I don’t give a fuck” policy and simply spoke what came to my mind. A prime example of this would be what we call “The Porch Kids”. There was a smoker’s porch at my old university and it had some interesting characters on it. I was homeless at the time (2nd time around, longer story involving a backstab and failed attempt to get me and my significant other to Florida). All of them cracked homeless jokes. Some even started rumors about me being homeless. I was asked if I was homeless. When I told them the truth, none offered to help. They bugged out, actually. Once I was on my feet again, I found that most of them have called for various favors, but out of 8 or so, only one has treated me decently, and I actually view him as a role model even though I haven’t heard from him in a month. Most people also don’t believe I’m 20 and that presents a barrier when trying to make friends and network. Either way, I used to approach situations neutrally, got treated like shit, decided to not follow social protocol, still get treated like shit so I opt for not following protocol because it is easier. 


Problem B) Dead End Job that barely makes ends meet.


I started at FedEx Ground where I used to live and moved up from a package handler to QA then to a management. The city I used to live in was so expensive even as a full time manager, I still got by on the skin of my teeth expense wise.  I had to bump down to a package handler again for the transfer to the city I’m in now. The positive is that I can barely get by on 15 hours of work a week due to the extremely low cost of living. The downside is that my work environment is terrible. It’s a lot worse than when I was a new hire in my old city. To get an idea, you have 6 guys including myself at this facility. I bust ass and am responsible for not just one door, but all 4 doors while we have one guy splitting (not as difficult as loading trailers but still hard) 3 guys unloaded vans and trailers (cake compared to loading one) and we have another guy that literally sits and does nothing. The QA does nothing either. The Manager is the same as QA. I find myself doing the shittiest and most difficult jobs in the shortest amount of time then doing the QA’s and manager’s job. To rub it in, when I’m pulling for the QA’s and manager’s slack; I then get told I need to increase my load rate. When I point out that one guy can only do so much (my average load a night is 3600-4000 packages, all industrial shippers greater than 75lbs a box) they tell me to only do my job. When I only do my job, then I get told to do QA and the Manager’s job. Tonight I went into their office to get a battery for a STAR III scanner and both of them were watching YouTube videos. I really hate my current work environment. It’s not the job, but the environment. 


Solution B) Find a Better Job. 


This is proving to be very difficult. I can’t find anyone that is actively hiring right now other than guys who are in the good old boys network. I’m still hitting the beat and will do my best to get out of there before December. 


Problem C) occasionally does questionable at best for extra cash when the ends don’t meet up.


I’m not going to go into what I do specifically other than I’m nothing more than a logistics guy. I don’t steal or sell anything. I have to do this sometimes to make sure I can pay tuition and other expenses if they get too far out of hand. I’m pretty sure I’ve lost part of myself or the ability to feel as much as I used to. I grew even more acute eyes in the back of my head and find myself checking the rear view mirror constantly, or if there’s a knock on my door, covering the peep while I stand off to the side. I also became even better in the woods and better at driving on a variety of surfaces ranging from tarmac to gravel. 


Solution C) Join the Army Reserve or Something.

 
I figure if I’m already damned good at evading trained personnel, have a little over half of a chemical engineering education, a wide variety of job experience ranging from customer service to welding, can move through the woods like a ghost, and get to elevated positions like roof tops that are inaccessible, I might as well make myself legitimate and serve my country. It would also get rid of my college money problems. I just can’t find a recruiter that doesn’t seem hell bent on fucking me over in any branch. 


Problem D) Stuck in a small town with a shattered economy where an open air drug market exists. 


It’s just a depressing environment. I go on a 2 mile run every night after work and it is painful to look at my surroundings. I try to zone out and not think, but I loop back to what problems I’m trying to solve, and many times I leave home with fewer problems than what I come back with. It’s a fucking self-destructive cycle. 


Solution D) Finish My Engineering Degree and get the fuck out. 


This is the only solution that doesn’t present more problems. It’s actually the only constant I have right now. 


Problem E) Stuck in college with little to no financial aid that is rapidly evaporating
Since day one, I have been fucked by financial aid. I have presented proof that I was homeless and independent as a minor in addition to paper work going farther back that I was in and out of state custody for a 6 year stint. It simply was an aide counselor not wanting to work with me and both institutions. I even wrote my senator about the issue and I got what appeared to be a generic response instructing me to fill out the FASFA. To rub it in, grad school and internships are a dead dream with my 2.2 GPA. People don’t understand that 8-10 hours a day working and full time school makes a C+ seem like an A+. With the fewer hours at work, I can focus more on school.


Solution E) 


See Problem C. It’s nothing near ideal and it creates the same fucking self-destructive loop. 
See Solution C. I just need to find a recruiter that’s willing to not fuck me over. Last one tried to tell me 88 mike was the same thing as forward observer. Airforce recruiter is so full of it his eyes are brown. 

The disturbing part is that I find myself wanting to die.  I’d rather have nothing than any of this. I mean what the hell am I loosing that is positive? I can’t even enjoy sex anymore the rare time I find a fuckbuddy. The feelings of distress and despair get worse when I start looking around myself. The average  20 year old college student appears to be happy. They have friends. They have a family. If they have to work they typically have high paying internships or a good part-time job that has little bullshit in it. They have great grades, and often don’t have to worry about making ends meet. It seems so alien to me. Almost like I’m an interloper and do not belong in what surrounds me. 


I’m looking for viable solutions that can help me achieve my goals- Not pitty. I’m going to be a Chemical Engineer one day. Please help me to do this. Anything. I’m tired of this and want it to be over

Parents Not Being Cooperative",AnonymousRebel,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/urt87/have_the_money_means_to_see_my_so_this_4th_of/,"First off, if you'd like to know the longer version of the story of my S/O and I, you should read my post in r/wemetonline where I asked for advice. I thought r/longdistance would be more apt to give advice for this issue. We have met before, and this would be our second time meeting.

Anyway, I have plans to see my LDR girlfriend (whom I met online) at her internship in Virginia this fourth of July. I can either go by car (which my parents are very opposed to based on the fact that my car isn't exactly in top shape, and because I've never driven nine hours straight), by Greyhound bus (more optimal, but just as expensive plus it'd take much longer) or by plane (haven't discussed it yet, but it would be more expensive, and I have a feeling my parents would oppose it as well). There's also the issue of lodging, which my S/O and I would split the cost of, so it wouldn't be as expensive. Keep in mind, the money I would use would be that I saved up from working, plus money I got from graduation (going to be freshman in college) but my parents want me to use it for paying for my college this fall.

Moreover, my parents are very conservative-Christian, and when the issue of my S/O and I having sex was raised, I simply said that I'm not a minor, and that it's none of their business. Well, they basically took that as ""We're going to have wild sex for two days"", and this only made their opposition more concrete. I got the talk from them about how sex before marriage destroys a relationship, how it's not what God intended (though they know I'm not Christian), and the slippery slope that could result from us having sex (pregnancy, mainly). They talked about it as if I didn't care about the risks, which made me angry, though I only really displayed that anger once during this conversation. Nonetheless, they said that, even if I were to take care of getting there, they'd still have reservations about trusting me to be responsible with her.

I'm not trying to hate on my parents here; I love them. They've been nothing but great parents to me for my entire life, and I've tried to be a great son to them. But I also love my girlfriend, and will do whatever it takes to see her again this summer. What would be the best way of going about this situation?"

I couldn't believe what I'd just heard. Trying to regain my professional bearing before tears began to flow, I pretended to have misheard him and asked, ""What was that?"" I hoped he would realize the offensiveness of his comment and change the subject, but he plowed right ahead. 

""You look like you're in great shape. Do you exercise?""

For 5 minutes I tried to endure the torturous conversation about lifting and fitness, and finally I could take no more. I excused myself to the restroom and cried in the stall until lunch time.

I was a custodial so I worked in a different country every day and met tons of awesome people! My first time working in France I wanted to try to learn a little bit about the language. I approached a French woman and started up a conversation. I then mentioned how I don't know anything about the language besides one saying.

I asked, ""What does ""parlez-vous francais?"" mean?""

Her: Do you speak French?
Me: No, that's why I am asking what does ""parlez-vous francais?"" mean.

New interns at work.,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/urou5/just_something_id_like_to_share_new_interns_at/,"Okay so I work for a government agency and we just got a fresh batch of summer interns in my department (IT), all male. There is a pretty diverse work force here otherwise and I'm proud to say there are a lot of women in management positions. I've been here a year and I have never heard that fact mentioned, let alone in a negative light. That gets me to today. 

A coworker was helping me format some reports and happened to mention something he heard the interns talking about, at full volume, in the hallway. They were discussing how weird they thought it was that so many women were managers, they were actually complaining. They were talking about how they're glad that their female manager isn't the emotional type, and how hard it must be to get work done with all the other female managers. I was so taken aback. This from 20 year old college students? I'm glad I wasn't there. God forbid if I had gotten ""emotional"". 

It stinks because they will be here the whole summer and I can almost always hear them carrying on and being loud. They seem to talk about women a lot, I've caught snippets like ""Ew! what if you had to wake up to her every morning!"" or "" yea I'd do her, she's a little old though"". Charming. I assume they are the types that hardly have contact with women, every time I've gone into their room (they keep the 64 bit test machines in there) they go awkwardly silent. 

So, these guys have more than two months left here. Lets hope they don't say something stupid in my presence. I don't know if I'll be able to hold back."

In half closed eye lids

And if i fall asleep its like momentary captivation

Or am i a captive destined to rot in the the hole

If sleep is a prison i got early parole

I might not figure it out

Why my eyes stretched so wide while time climbs by

This life is a protest, with eyelids convinced to occupy

Glued to the tip top of my skull

Signs waving in the air ""We will never let go""

And as the clock sings its melody of repetitive ticks

I view it as a metronome for my thoughts to take shape

I will wonder

What did sleep ever do for anyone

As the second hand swings and we are otherwise incapacitated to observe it

Did it really happen at all?

Its not insomnia its a goal

To fill every second of life with something

Remain stimulated, learning, entertained, observant

Breathing more then anything else

Cause if we all live to be 100

It will never be enough

And as the conductor ques the tocks in for this melody of recaptured seconds

I realize that its because I'm not with my dreams that i cannot sleep"

Thinking of moving with her.,hawaiifive0,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/urnmk/girlfriend_of_8_months_just_got_a_1year_job_on/,"Hi all.  Girlfriend and I are both 24.  We've been together since last fall and spend every waking moment together.  About a month ago she went to the other end of the country for a 1.5 month internship that could turn into a 1-year paid position.  There was much crying and sadness before she left.  We've skyped or talked on the phone every single day and obviously miss each other terribly.  She's coming back in 2 weeks now, but found out she's being hired for the year-long position, starting in August.  We both agree we can't stand to be apart from each other for a year straight, and breaking up hasn't really crossed either of our minds.  So we're discussing moving over there together.

This is only my 2nd girlfriend, and my 1st long-term girlfriend (I'm her 2nd boyfriend and 2nd long term boyfriend ever).  I also only got out of college a year and a half ago and only started working a few months ago.  It's not a secure or long-term type of job, but the point is I'm pretty poor.  So, for me, moving across the country to live together with my girlfriend is going to be a giant step, not to mention the huge cost of living associated with where we're going, and taking the plunge into job hunting yet again.  I love her and definitely want to move in with her at some point - the relationship is pretty serious.  But under more normal circumstances I'd have waited until we were both more financially secure before attempting something like this.  We're investigating the job market and budgetary concerns.

What advice can you give me for this situation?  Jumping back into the job market (on the other side of the country) after finally finding a job a few months ago doesn't appeal to me, and budget and finances would concern me too - she'll have a well-paying job, but I definitely want to contribute my part to the living expenses.  I also don't know much about living together and sharing a house with an SO.  What should I know before making any decisions?"

It's a bit discouraging when interviewers and recruiters ask why I'm not an art major or a design major and question my skills without even seeing my portfolio, and so I'm hoping to build a portfolio that's amazing enough to get past that doubt.

(I didn't do studio art or design at school because my school has a terrible, theory-only-let's-have-you-write-a-lot-of-papers fine-art kind of program and a design program doesn't exist here. was it a mistake to not choose an art major?)

What next?",gex80,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/ur6ih/supposedly_too_advanced_to_be_help_desk_not/,"So a while back I posted my resume on here to get opinions. The general consensus was that because I'm working on a Master's in IT, I worked 4 years as a tech at Best Buy, CompTIA: Net/A/Sec+(working on CCENT), and that I had a Help Desk internship with Viacom for a summer, that it would be a waste of time for me to work in help desk.

If I get a Sysadmin position it would most likely be a very junior position since I have no experience with things like AD other than a small project I did for school(set it up and add users). I'm not really seeing jobs out there that they would be willing to take me on and train me a bit.

I am 20 years old and yes I do live with them in an apartment. But I do make and give them my earnings. I couldn't find an intern job so I tutor 5 high school kids throughout the week. I do not keep a dime. I give it all to my parents and they would sometimes give me money but they would always need it back so I give the money back or don't even take it at all. I could live by myself but I feel like the family would break. I am the first born and in Korean culture the first born is usually the one to keep the family together. My dad however tells me to mature and yet orders me around like stop playing video games, study for your summer classes, and stop spending so much time on the phone. It makes it very difficult sometimes to live with them. So how can I tell my dad that he will not always get his way? I don't want to sound to harsh though.

So, for whatever reason, my boss and I were talking and the conversation led to Bill Clinton's impeachment.

She was an intern and thusly sort of like an employee, perhaps not directly under him but he could influence her position.

I made a new resume from the comments below. Thanks guys! 
http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/usdtw/update_resume_critique_for_recent_engineering/
------------------------------------

_-_

I am a recent graduate from an engineering double master's program looking for work in the US. I have gone about a month with only 3 interviews (despite 2 applications per day for the past 5 weeks) and no job offers.

The format I use more often is a one-page compact formatted resume with two columns. I blotted out the private information. Here I am applying for a mechanical engineering design position in the aerospace industry.
https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BxDkJqMrm1XhMkdJNUpLUnFLSXM

I like this format, as it got me the 3 interviews and manages to organize my information on the sacred one-page, but a recruiter told me it is confusing. He recommended I use the first portion to list the most relevant skills to the employer. Then he says to use as many pages as I want to list the next information, first the educational experience (as with 3 degrees, it is my selling point) then my internships and research experiences, etc. This is for a design engineer position dealing with the bodies of consumer electronics.
https://docs.google.com/open?id=0BxDkJqMrm1XhUU00U1hEUWNlckU

Which version is better? Two pages with one column, or one page with two columns. I have a feeling it comes down to personal taste.

It's called Carolina Cross Connection and is located in western North Carolina, if you haven't heard about it check it out. Anyway, my job for the most part consisted of living at a camp for 2 months during the summer and finding and working for people in need. Groups of youth volunteers would come throughout the summer and help us build wheelchair ramps and paint rooms and just generally be with people in the community that might not get that much interaction. It was an incredible experience and brought me so much close to God, those were the best three summers of my life so far.

Now, this summer I am an engineering intern at large corporation and spend countless hours inside working on cool projects, but projects that are only for the company. I am looking for a way to keep that close connection with God this summer. It was mostly easy at camp with it constantly in front of you but now I'm in the ""real world"" and am trying to hold on to those feelings I had. Are there any books I can read or studies I can get into that will fulfill this? I am also looking for ways to help the community out but that is a little more straightforward. 

I guess a more specific way of asking it is how do most people grow closer to God in everyday life when you aren't constantly planning worships or singing songs?"

I didn't even realize there were unpaid internships, but it's the only place that has gotten back to me (didn't realize it was unpaid when I applied).

Is this a bad idea? It's kind of either I do the internship this summer, or take classes. I'd much rather do an internship but I'm just slightly put off because I'd never heard of unpaid tech internships before.

Pretty much, I'm a student at UCSB who has recently become interested in pursuing I-Banking. As it looks, I currently don't have an internship lined up for this summer, which I know will hurt me, but I'm hoping its not THAT big of a problem. If I can't find an analyst position in the next few weeks, I plan on working my ass off over summer reading and researching what it means to be an I-Banker. 

I understand how competitive the industry is, and as such I decided to potentially sacrifice my social life and friendships I've made in exchange for the opportunity to go to a better school with more opportunities. I was accepted into USC (as an econ transfer, but will transfer into business if I go) and waitlisted to Vanderbilt as econ. My question for you folks is what you think would be the smartest option for reaching a BB after my undergraduate education? USC, Vandy, or UCSB? 

I'm aware that none of these schools are target schools, but I have heard good things about west coast banking at USC and east coast/south for vandy. I love UCSB, I love the people, the atmosphere, my fraternity, and the weather. However, I'm getting to a point in my life where the decisions I make are becoming much more important, and I am willing to sacrifice what I have developed at UCSB for more opportunities to break into Ibanking/PE/hedge funds 

If you guys could give me any insight on this issue I would be forever in your debt. Also, If any of you are currently in the industry, and looking to help out a hopeful student, I would GREATLY appreciate an informational interview over the phone. I've seen how great the reddit community is, and would absolutely love to talk to any of you who have gone through the life-path of I-Banking.

From a financial standpoint, USNA is a no-brainer. I will earn a salary while attending and graduate as an officer with a minimum 5 year commitment. My big draw to NYU is that I am interested in communications and in the future my dream job would be working for a media corporation, and for that NYU is among the best with its NYC location and many internships. However, I will have to take student loans of up to around $40,000 per year. I have heard many negative stories involving students having large loans that ruin many things. I am more than willing to serve and have a great respect for the naval academy, but its big drawback for me is that as a service academy, it only offers 20-some majors and nothing close to communications. If i went there, I would most likely choose economics as their only business related major. Do you think that I could major in something like economics at USNA and later be able to move back to my dream media field? Do you think that as a communications major at NYU, I will be able to get a decent job upon graduation? My parents told me to do communications if it was what I wanted, but felt like it could be one of those 'fluff' majors that wouldn't lead me to a financially stable career path. As far as reputation and prestige goes, is there much of a difference between NYU and USNA? I am more than willing to serve but do not see myself staying with the navy for my career, but rather completing my 5 years of commitment for the leadership and valuable experience, and then go back to the civilian world financially stable and a more disciplined person. However, the media industry is my dream field and I would prefer to be able to make a career within it. Is that still possible with a non-related degree from the naval academy? I would love to hear from any service academy grads on their experience past their military career in the civilian world. I feel that this is perhaps the biggest decision in my life so far and want to make the right choice. Sorry for the long post but I have read and thought about this so much I think I'll go crazy, and don't think I will make any more headway without outside input and thoughts.

My question is, what sort of places would be good for a healthy diet, and what sort of things should I be looking for on the menu? I'm not so much trying to cut weight so much as burn fat if that helps, so high protein type foods maybe?

Not even sure where to start...

We've been together a year and one month. He's 23 and I'm 21. He's from Europe and moved here to be with me. We just moved into our first place together..

Because he moved here from Europe he has lots of friends from all over. On of them though, has always not sat right with me. She's about my age and before he met me they talked all the time. He says they have always had a teasing/playful/joking relationship but had never had a sexual attraction or any kind of physical interaction except a hello/goodbye hug.

My first time being freaked out by this was a month into dating. I saw a facebook chat from here where they were joking and he randomly mentioned that his dick looked bigger when shaved. Didn't sit right with me. I got upset, cried, yelled. That's not an appropriate thing to say to another girl when you have a girlfriend.

In fact, when we first started dating we had the ""What constitutes cheating"" talk. We both agreed right off the bat that sexting/flirtatious messages was cheating.

Anyway this occurrence led me to ask him to please tell me when they were talking, not ask me if he could talk to her, just inform me.
Fast forward 9 months are so. We are living together in a temporary place. As far as I know he's always informed me of when they spoke. One day, at around 6:30pm he tells me again that they had been chatting for a few hours. Something led to me asking when they had started, he said idk, i said check the time stamp, and it said 10:30am. I dont understand why he would lie about something that trivial. Maybe it meant nothing. I'm just telling the whole story.

A while after we had a fight about me being controlling. I told him he no longer had to inform me of talking to her. He was on his own with that.

Fast forward again to last night. I went into his home office to get his tablet to play a game on. It was open on a fb chat from her. I didn't read it all, just saw something he said that looked flirty. I asked him about it, he said he was joking, and i dropped it. But it kept bugging me, so after he went to sleep I went and read the whole thing.

It started out normal, then got suggestive. She needs an internship and told him she was ""his"" if he could get it for her. He asked her things like what we he get out of it, she replied whatever, and he said sexual favors. It went on like that. There were plenty of this winky faces and ""haha's"" suggesting that the conversation had a joking tone. It reached its peak when she asked him what the favors would consisted of and he said: ""Generally you, me, a bed, or possibly some other random piece of furniture, maybe a third party if you are willing to agree to that.""

There was never anything more intense than that. Neither mentioned bodyparts or even referenced them, nobody said anything about getting hard or being wet, there was no descriptive text about licking, sucking, positions... nothing like that.

So I lost it on him. We talked for hours. He told me that he's been under a lot of stress worrying about money (I haven't been able to get a job since I graduated six months ago, so he is the only provider). He says that he has no friends here. He works at home and I'm always home, so we are literally together 24/7. I know that this can put tension on the relationship, everybody needs some alone time. He had never mentioned this to me before though. He said he always felt like that if he had wanted to go out along, drive around, go to a bar, play games alone, or whatever, that I would cry and react badly. He's right.

In the past I have overreacted about him leaving. I've found it hard to trust him because of the incidents prior to this one, and I know he could very easily cheat on me without getting caught. I'm worried that when I have a job he will be here alone all day, making it extremely easy to cheat. Anyway, the point is that I havn't been understanding about him needing his space.

He says he's felt pressured because of that. He says he doesn't know why he started talking to this girl this way. He was working while he was chatting, and says he wasn't even really paying attention. Whenever I ask why he did it his best answer is that he doesn't really know and that he thinks it may have been a subconscious lash out because of him feeling trapped in the relationship. I understand this, because I had a similar situation in my previous relationship.

Sorry this was so long.. I guess what I'm asking is what next? We have talked for hours and both want to work things out. I've told him that I forgive him, but i have not forgotten. I don't know if I can forget. The words just keep rolling around in my head. Probably worth mentioning, I told him it's me or her. He said me and I explained that that means he can't talk to her again, break off the friendship, no talking ever, no updates on life ten years from now. I said I want to see this message to her before he sends it and I want to be told if she ever tries to get in touch with him in the future. I feel bad about asking this of him, but at the same time I think I am within my rights to do so. He says he understand and would probably do the same if it was a reverse situation.

So what should I do now reddit? I'm having trouble letting go of this. I can't forget it. My trust for him is gone, and yet somehow I have to trust him to go out without me so that he won't feel trapped. Should I break up with him? Forget about it? Am I overreacting? Please Help...

**bold**TL;DR Caught boyfriend flirting by chat, forgave him but don't understand why he did it. Want to know what I should do now.

Edit: He just took the keys and went ""out"". Says he doesn't know where he is going or when he'll be back. This blows..."

I'm a computer science major, and just got my first internship at a small startup about a month ago.

The company consists of just 3 principles trying to launch their business.  Since being hired I've designed and configured their MailChimp, and am now building their site off previously established mockups, as their developer is no longer able to work on the project.

The principles are pretty computer illiterate and I am pretty much building the entire infrastructure of their web presence.  I recognize that they are at the very beginning stages of their business, and was told this in the interview, but...

I had hoped to be engaged in a learning environment, and I feel as though I am sort of being taken advantage of, and teaching instead of learning.

Is this standard for most internships? Should I look for something else or be grateful I am intimately involved in their business?

What doesn't make it easier is that it is a very exciting concept to work on, and the principles are extremely nice, cool people...

Any advice is greatly appreciated

**Edit:** Wanted to throw an edit in here to first thank the shit out of you guys for the advice and support it's been great.

Also wanted to defend my currently employers(?) to a certain extent.  They are nice, friendly, and smart people with impressive backgrounds.  But as noticed by the community, they are pretty disconnected from the actual process of implementation - even though they have mapped it.  

In thinking this over, I think it will be beneficial to both parties if I decline the web project in a manner where I explain the magnitude of the process in hopes that it gives them a better understanding of how necessary the employment of a professional developer is.

Really appreciate the advice, and opportunities that have resulted from this thread - you guys are great."

I know there are a lot of students in here looking for jobs and internships. I've been there, I know how it goes. I now run a shop in Los Angeles who's hiring people like you, so I thought I'd give you my perspective in hopes that it helps you land a job or at the very least, stand out in a sea of candidates. 

No one ever said shit about any of this in college, and it seems like they still don't, judging by the responses and interviews I've had for a summer internship I'm offering. 

Below is a wish list of traits that I look for in potential hires. 

**Learn how to write an email**
Loosen up. Show some personality. We're a creative agency, not a box factory. Starting the email off like, ""Dear Hiring Manager"" just comes off weird to me. Even if I was a hiring manager, I'd want to be addressed in a more casual fashion. ""Dear all"", ""Hello, ladies and gentlemen""… anything that hints that you're interesting makes me much more receptive to your message. 

**Be Assertive**
Ask questions in your interview. It sounds cliche, but you're also interviewing me, to see if I'm the right fit. ""What does the position entail?"" ""Is there room for growth?"" ""Does it pay?"" ""Do you think I'll have stuff for my book when I'm done?"" These are important to know. If someone asked me any of those, I'd interpret it as initiative. That's a good thing. 

**Don't second guess your work**
When you bring a portfolio in, please don't tell me about the stuff that's not in it or point out the flaws with the work that you're presenting. Stand behind it, have explanations for things. One of the biggest no-nos that I've seen are candidates telling me they did something because ""it looks cool"". You need to have reasons for everything – bullshit or not. 

**Be Positive**
Please don't tell me how hard it is to find a job.. or how long it's been since you worked. I'm sorry if you haven't been able to get a job, but the smell of desperation to me zaps any sort of enthusiasm I might have had for you. You need to be enthusiastic, appear hungry to do some great work, not just get a job. 

**Be Useful**
I'd say that about 20% of the people that have emailed me don't have portfolios. 20% of the people that do, it's full of photography and illustrations. That doesn't help me. I need to see examples of graphic design and how well you handle typography.  I'd love to know how someone handles hierarchy, etc. What you're presenting needs to have some relation to what the position entails. Showing me illustration/photography when I'm hiring a graphic design intern just doesn't cut it. 

**Be Normal**
More than anything, I just want to find someone that's normal. Someone who can hold a conversation, who has their own shit going on, who can add something to the culture at our office. 

**Be on time**
Please don't show up 30 minutes late and not say shit about it. We're busy and when we have to adjust things to fit your schedule, you're already starting off on the wrong foot. "
utjyf,3,2012-06-09,Tips for an EMS Student in his Pre-Medic school clinicals?,d3jake,ems,https://www.reddit.com/r/ems/comments/utjyf/tips_for_an_ems_student_in_his_premedic_school/,"Hello fellow EMS providers!

I'm currently in the pre-Medic school\'Core"" clinicals for my program. We have our EMT class, an ""Ambulance Operations"" class that helps us apply what we learned in EMT, and then the clinicals that I""m in now hat will help us be competant EMTs by the end of it. We're paired with a Paramedic who works in the field. Ideally, this person is who we do our clinicals with during the Core. (Our Medic school has students doing field clinicals along with some hospital clinicals throughout the last two years of the program.) This way, you have a single person with whom you've ridden with, and who knows what you've seen and how you act in certain situations, etc.

I've given the Internship (clinicals) a shot in this past Fall semester and logged ~170 hours. Due to a couple personal mental stuffs I didn't pass. Without going into too many details:
I am a very logical person, and don't like to be rushed; therefore I would quite often introduce myself to a patient, and then proceed to have a brain fart of what to ask. In these situations my mentor or his partner would end up hopping in. Leading to my second trouble:

Being assertive. If I wasn't the first in the door to a patient, I had a hard time getting back ahead of the curve; paying attention, thinking about my next question, and keeping in mind the flow of the call were all challenging to keep floating around.

I'm redoing the internship thus summer, and this time around, I have ~220 hours scheduled. I've already had a couple of shifts, the second one I lead a call that had faults, but was better than most from the last-time around. 

I think the improvements that I've made personally over the last few months, and with the number of field hours I'll be logging will see me through to passing. That said, does anybody out there have any tips, anecdotes or pearls of wisdom for a provider attempting to become competent at leading BLS calls?"

I'm working as an intern this summer for Seattle Tilth, helping them / the city of Issaquah inform the public about the importance of not dumping waste down storm drains (because storm drains go directly to local water bodies and don't go through water treatment - anything poisonous will harm the local wildlife).  Anyways, my main job for this project is to recruit volunteers to glue buttons down by all the storm drains that say ""Puget Sound Starts Here"", as a reminder not to dump.  I have until the end of August to get 2500 buttons glued down, so I'm going to need a number of volunteers!

This is why I'm turning to you - I'm assuming that, among the almost 800 of us, there's probably a few of you that would be willing to help me out.  Or, at the very least, who knows someone who would love to help me out.

Volunteering basically consists of spending a couple hours gluing buttons to storm drains, and you can do this in a couple of ways.

1. Join me on a Saturday afternoon - I'll be out buttoning with whoever I can gather pretty much every Saturday from now until mid-August, depending on weather and volunteer availability (I need dry sidewalks and at least 3 people)

2. Organize a group to go at a different time - I can lead you at most times of the week if you have a group who'd be interested in helping (do you have a student group? Scout troop? etc - anyone over about 9 years old is welcome).

3. Do it yourself - if you want to go out on your own, or lead a group by yourself, I can get you supplies and instructions.

[More information about Seattle Tilth and the project can be found here...](http://seattletilth.org/about/issaquah-watershed-project)

If you're interested in helping, please send me an email, my address is listed below.  While I'll probably manage to get any reddit messages you send me, email is much more reliable.

Thank you very much!

FYI: I've been around this community for a while, but using a throwaway for this because I don't want the identifying info connected with my main account in any way.

tl;dr: Looking for volunteers to help me glue stuff to streets.  Only a couple hours commitment, and time is flexible.  If you're interested, please email me: miacc (at) msn.com ... Thanks!"

Thanks!

I loved to think spatially and always had a curiosity of how the world around me worked. Even while very young, my teachers would mention to my parents that I would rather study the bottom of a toy car than play with it. After being exposed to physics in high school, I developed my curiosities for why a horizontal wire would hang in a hyperbolic shape or how forces transmit through structures. I have also always had a strong desire to create and can recall many hours spent making 3 dimensional computer environments, building my first computer, and Friday nights at the bookstore fulfilling my curiosities of such things. Following a desire to learn more about spatial structures and systems, I decided to pursue my undergraduate degree in civil engineering and planned on obtaining a graduate degree in architecture afterwards. However, after exposure to flexure theory, Müller-Breslau principle, and the likes, I had become infatuated with the analysis of structures. I found the understanding of their complex interactions to be the most beautiful and fulfilling of any kind. Wanting a deeper understanding of their engineering applications, I have decided to pursue a master’s of Science in structural engineering at “said” university.

While studying at the “ugrad school” I became involved in structural health monitoring research as an undergraduate research assistant for “mentor”. Having an interest in the dynamics of structures, the opportunity for exposure to sensors and data analysis, and coming from a summer internship in the space guidance and navigation department of “electronics company” aerospace, led me to become heavily involved. As the only funded undergraduate on the research team, I worked closely with graduate students. At first my tasks were simple and involved writing reports on market searches for wireless sensors, embedded computers, work on cad drawings, and publication formatting. Then I became responsible for larger tasks and projects and had an opportunity to solve open-ended research-related problems. I worked closely with two graduate students on the possible implementations of using infrared and high definition video cameras for more objective bridge inspection methodologies. With the aid of the two graduate students, my responsibilities included the design of a candidate bridge prioritization algorithm, the organization of the research report, and the operations planning for a bridge site visit. I made a presentation to the “state” Department of Transportation on how such nondestructive evaluation technologies could be implemented into the current inspection methodologies. I discovered that I have an ability to organize and implement an idea. Realizing a need for more structural oriented industry knowledge and exposure, when the “state” Structural Engineers Association was looking to start a student chapter; I contacted them and sought out the feasibility of starting such a student chapter at my University. When I noticed that I could improve my grades through organization and technique, I meticulously developed smart study habits and corrected inefficiencies in how I held a pencil or my typing technique. The benefits of this came to fruition when I made a 4.0 during a semester of my senior year with 4 upper level engineering courses. 

I see the possibilities of integrating computer technology to stream line the design process and hope to have an opportunity to influence its advancement. My intentions are to continue developing my skills and deepen my understanding of structural engineering with a Master’s of science degree from the “grad school I’m applying to” and then go on to have a unique impact on the field of structural engineering.

The job is good, pays ok, and Im learning a good deal, but it will only last for a few months. Its also 90% an office job, and Ive quickly learned that being in an office 40-50 hours is not exactly my cup of tea.

Basically, I was wondering what suggestions people had for types of jobs/internships to look for that would teach me a lot and get me outdoors. Pay isnt too big of an issue, as long as I can eat and pay rent Im cool. I was considering trying to be a construction inspector or get on a survey crew, but Im not sure if these would assist me in looking for future engineering positions or be that educational.

Perhaps Im being too picky and I should just apply to anything I can and pray I get a callback. Maybe Im not even in the right field and every engineering job just lands you in an office for the rest of your life. I have no idea, this is all so new and a little overwhelming.

I'm 22, a year out of college, been working for a (very) large tech consulting firm since graduation doing systems implementation (design to development, the whole shebang). It's definitely been a great experience so far, but I've come to realize I am not really interested in doing consulting long term so I've begun to evaluate different options. Long term, I'd like to move over to some form of product development. As such, I've really set my sights on Google's APM position for now.

Here's what I see as my options right now:

1. Spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the APM position and apply in the fall. I've got a solid background in design and programming, but I've already laid out an aggressive learning plan for myself this summer that I hope would prepare me in time. Despite this, I recognize it's a very competitive position and there's no guarantee of anything ever materializing.

2. An ex-coworker and friend recently transferred out of a team at Google where he was working as a Tech. Associate and offered to send my resume directly to the team. This doesn't seem all that glamorous of a position, but it'd get my foot in the door, get me some more hands on experience with Google products, and allow me to network within the company. Now, I'm fairly sure I'm qualified for the gig, but I don't know how Google is with people transferring internally and if I'd ever have a shot at landing a position in product development (and/or as a program manager).

3. Ignore Google, shoot for applying for an established (have already had two rounds of significant funding) start-up doing exactly what I had tried to do with a start up of my own, a field I'm definitely passionate about. They're offering a few interesting positions, but they're only internships which makes me incredibly nervous.

4. Disregard switching, acquire currency. Stick with the consulting gig, toughen it out for a bit, and wait until my prospects are better and I have a bit more cash tucked away. I'm not crazy about this option at all, though I recognize it being the safest. It could be a direct path to a MBA from a top-tier school which could let me move into any field I'd like.

5. ???

I really appreciate any advice anyone has. I know I'm only 22, but I don't think age or lack of experience should be keeping me on a path I'm not interested in.

TL/DR: 22, first year tech consulting looking to change.

Options:

1. Spend summer readying myself (and eventually apply) to Google's APM position. Unsure if qualified.

2. Apply for Tech. Associate position at Google. Have strong connection that would get me interview. Believe I'm definitely qualified. Not sure if I'd be able to transfer out to product dev.

3. Apply to interesting start up. Internship position, huge hit to income.

4. Disregard switching, acquire currency until I'm better prepared in a few years."
ut99e,4,2012-06-09,Are Apple hard drive failures common?,[deleted],apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/ut99e/are_apple_hard_drive_failures_common/,"I've always had Macs, and I seriously didn't know how to use a PC until a recent internship (yeah... still don't).  I come from a ClarisWorks era, ya know?  My problem is that my freaking old see-through iMac in the basement has had better longevity and fewer problems than either of my laptops.

* I had a black MacBook in college, and the hard drive died after about a year.  I replaced the hard drive, but someone stole the laptop later, and I got a new one.
* I currently have a 15"" MacBook Pro, and the Apple Store recently told me that I am having kernel panics (again... last time they said it was a faulty battery) because my hard drive is reapportioning itself in preparation of failure.  It's been a bit over two years.
* My mom's 13"" MacBook Pro, which is newer than mine and seldom even used (she really just doesn't know how), just had a hard drive failure.  What!

Can someone tell me what's going on?  I mean, I'm the first to admit I was a drunk college kid who smacked my 15"" a few times, and I took it to classes a lot (large Big Ten campus, so a lot of movement).  Apple said hard drives are moving parts, and just like cars, they fail.  I am unconvinced and sad.  Can someone tell me how to stop killing my computers so I can stop paying 200-some dollars for new hard drives?

tl;dr Why do all the MacBook hard drives fail in two years or less and how can I prevent this?

edit:  bullets

edit 2:  While I have your attention, is there a reason that a kernel panic would have zapped my old black 30 GB iPod so that it doesn't recognize it's a disc?  Also.  Is the best plan of attack to use Time Machine, then hit up the Apple Store and shell out the $215 to get this fixed?  And how to I be sure that I wiped my mom's external hard drive of... incriminating... things... when I'm done..."

ut8vq,4,2012-06-09,He broke up with me but isn't letting me get over him,LadyoftheWood,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/ut8vq/he_broke_up_with_me_but_isnt_letting_me_get_over/,"I just wanted to share my story with some unbiased parties (strangers on the internet-yay!).  I was going to use a throwaway and change some details so no one would link it to me, but seriously who is going to see this?  Plus, now is the time for complete honesty.  But I’ll leave out names I guess.




Start from the beginning- I’m a female, 23. He (J) is male 24.  We started out a year ago as friends.  He liked me, but knew I wasn’t interested, and he started hooking up with my best friend.  She realized that he liked me and hated both us of for it.  She and I had already started to drift apart because we just didn’t have a healthy friendship.  She started distancing herself from both of us, and J and I were spending more time together.  I develop feelings for J, confront my friend (E) and there is all kinds of tension all around.  I tell J I need time to see if I can work out my friendship with E, J is fairly patient but makes it obvious that he wants a relationship with me, not just a friendship.  I realize I want the same, and E doesn’t want to be my friend anymore, so I go for it.  

J and I are together for about 8 months, super happy, no serious problems.  We have so much fun together; everything we do feels like an adventure.  I tell him I love him, he doesn’t reciprocate at first, but later he tells me he loves me too.  More recently, he tells me he isn’t sure if he loves me anymore, but he is depressed, and he thinks he can get it back.  Then he gets into law school, and tells me he doesn’t want to break up, but that we might have to so he can focus on school.  I’m distraught and confused.  He is only going to be 2 hours away, that is hardly long distance to me.  I tell him we can still text all day long, I’m thinking we can have skype chats whenever he isn’t busy.  I can come visit him on weekends that work for him.  I thought we had something special, something that you don’t just throw away.  I start thinking that this is just my turn to be patient for him, that he will come around.  I actually believe that we might get even closer after this, after we both realize how we can’t live without eachother.  He tells me that he does love me, he just doesn’t know if he can have a relationship while he is at school.  I don’t believe that for those 3 years he isn’t going to get into some kind of relationship.  

So about a month goes by of this, we’re still together but it is constantly hanging over our heads that he might break up with me any day.  2 weeks ago he breaks up with me.  We don’t see eachother for a week but we’re still constantly texting eachother.  6 days later he says he wants to talk, so he comes over.  It is awkward at first, then he tells me he loves me and cares more about me than he realized.  So there I am, thinking yay! We are in love, this will work out.  We spend 10 hours together that day, just like we were dating again, and of course we have sex.  Normally I would like to think I’m smarter than that, having sex with an ex, but I thought we were getting back together.  So I ask him what this means for us, and he says he is still unsure.  But he wants me to come over his house the next day to watch a show together like we always do.  We’re cuddly, and we kiss, and his parents are even there.  It is like we’re boyfriend and girlfriend, so I’m just thinking I have to be patient and everything is going to work out.  

I try to keep it cool, a little bit of distance, but that doesn’t really work.  I make plans to see him 3 days later.  HE decides he wants to hang out with my friend (S) just like everything is normal.  We go over S’s place, go out to eat, hang out, S assumes we’re back together.  So when J is dropping me off at home, I ask him again, so are we back together?  He says no.  I say “but we’re acting like we are…”  He says “do you really need the label?”  I say “well no, the actual label isn’t the important part, but I mean all the other stuff that goes along with it is”  He gets scared that I’m hooking up with someone else, I assure him that I’m not.  Ask him if he is, he assures me that he isn’t.  The next day he doesn’t text me at all during the day… this hasn’t happened in a whole freaking year.  So at 7pm I give in and say “Its been weird not talking to you or hearing from you all day today. How are you?” He responds “yea a little” tells me what he did during the day, then says hes with a friend and probably going to another friends house and asks me what I’m doing.  I say “well its weird for me. I’m out now with E and other friends”  He says “no. it’s weird I agree.  Fun times with them?” I say “as always” and he responds “Good to hear :)”  This all happens in a span of 3 hours.  The next day he texts me to tell me he has an interview for an internship.  I text him “congrats!”  I wanted so badly to ask him more about it, but I know I sohouldn’t.   He responds with a little more detail anyway.  That was all he texted me yesterday, TWO DAYS after acting like he was my boyfriend again.  


This is just so fucking weird.  I feel like I don’t know him anymore.  We were so close, and (I believe) in love, I know I was, I was pretty sure he was but it’s hard to believe now.  Why the fuck would he tell me he loves me after breaking up with me, make me feel like we’re a couple again, then all of a sudden pull back?  This isn’t fair to me.  I swear part of me feels like he’s been using me, manipulating me.  But part of me knows that isn’t like him.  Maybe he just really is that confused.  But why should I make excuses for him if he can’t even show me respect?  I just don’t understand how it got to this point.  Also, I feel really hurt that he is letting me go just as things are going well for him.  That is why I feel used.  Like he doesn’t really care about me, I was just there for him while he felt like nothing was going on in his life, and now that something is, he doesn’t need me anymore.  I really thought we’d be together for a long time, that we’d be incredibly in love.


Mostly I just wanted to get this out there.  But I also wanted to ask if it’s a good idea to get closure?  I want to meet up and talk again, tell him all this, how it wasn’t fair for him to pull me back in like that if he doesn’t want a relationship still.  I want to tell him he has been a dick.  I want to tell him I feel betrayed and like I meant nothing to him.  Also, I want so badly not to want him.  I’m hoping he’ll tell me that there is no hope for us.  He is probably too chicken-shit to say that, but I feel like he is at that point now.  I think it will help me, but I still would like to hear perspective from strangers :)


tldr: ex is playing with my heart, need closure

I'm spending the summer in Germany b/c I have an internship, so I went ahead and got an EU account. On NA I'm a recently promoted Masters Zerg player; on EU i'm sitting pretty solidly mid-diamond. Not saying EU is necessarily harder; could just be that I got inexplicably worse somehow. Or maybe stylistic differences in the metagame are to blame. Seems like there are a lot more banshees over here. Maybe they're produced by BMW or something.

At any rate, I've been playing 6 to 12 games a day, and a few of them wound up being good enough (or funny enough) that I started setting the replays aside. The replay pack I am posting here contains 10 games that stood out to me for one reason or another. Although it is possible that no one is interested, I would appreciate some feedback on my play.

Weaknesses I am currently aware of (just to make clear that I recognize how much room I have to improve):
- bad macro
- bad micro
- horrible understanding of timings (this is an area I would love some help on)
- forgetting tech. durrr

This isn't a [H] thread because I can generally figure out why I lost in a given game by looking at the replay. 10 out of 12 of these games are wins anyway. However, they do show me playing at more or less my best — and I'd appreciate feedback of any kind on that.

I've got a lot of down time this summer, and I'm using it to try and get into shape for CSL in the fall 

My other hope with this replay pack is that it might provide some guidance for lower-level players, and to that effect I will be making myself available in this thread to anybody in gold or lower who wants to know why I do something in one of these games, or wants to know when a given strategy works, or whatever else. Sometimes (perhaps often) the answer to ""why did I do X"" will be ""because I'm a shit player,"" but maybe there's some stuff I can help you with too.

He's the hardest worker I know -- has been in school for 8 years straight, with one left, to get the degree of his dreams. During this time, he's done internships, externships, and worked a steady night-shift job for as long as I've known him. 

He's paid off over $40k *while going to school*. There's still more to pay, though.

I don't want recognition or payback in the future, I just want to take a weight off his shoulders by paying ~$2k of the debt. (It would make a HUGE difference to him, and I can comfortably go without it.) 

**Question:**
Is it even possible to anonymously pay off another person's debt? He has bank loans, as well as new school bills coming in. Would it be possible to contact the school maybe, and pay a portion of his semester before he gets billed? Does anyone have anecdotes about having done this, or words of caution? 

The last bit is: he's in another country. Does that complicate anything?

I thought about this carefully, and I'm not about to make any rash decisions. I just want to know what options I have. Thanks, Reddit!"

Need help escalating for when we do meet up.",[deleted],seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/usqp4/2_girls_both_far_away_need_help_escalating_for/,"Hey seddit, just got into this community recently so I'm still pretty new to all of this. That said, I'm in need of a bit of advice from you guys on these two girls that I'm interested in, but are currently too far away to physically contact. Here's each situation:


**GIRL 1:**
&gt; I met G1 while abroad several years ago, when I was around 17/18 (Currently 22). We were both from the US and happened to be abroad at the same time. We hung out every now and then for about a month before it was time for me to head back. 


&gt; Around 6 months after getting back, we managed to meet up at her place (We're around 5 hours apart). Problem is, I had another girl I was interested in at the time, and so she came along for the ride. We all hung out, and it was fun, but nothing happened. I feel like something could have, though, as she wanted to watch a scary movie, and when we did, she offered blankets for me and her. The stupid AFC I was (and am, I guess), I didn't do anything, because I wanted to stick with the girl I was interested in that I brought along. After heading back home, we would occasionally say something to eachother on facebook, but nothing big, and not often.


&gt; Flash forward to the present: I have 2 opportunities to go down to where she lives. I'm determined not to mess up like I did previously. I told her that I might be heading over there, which was met with enthusiasm. She's taking off work for when I'm coming and I got her number (I lost it since I last had it years back). 


&gt; I still have about a month before we meet up (although there's a small chance I'll be in the general area within a week or two with friends... but it's not set in stone yet, and she wouldn't have off from work), so what should I do until then? Nothing? Text her every week or so? I don't wanna end up friend-zone'd, but I also don't want things to die down. What's the best recommendation you can give me for this whole situation? Not to sound like I have oneitis, but I've had a crush for years on her: She's gorgeous and has a great personality and is just a fun person... So I want to minimalize any chances of messing up, even though I'm aware that rejection is possible regardless.


**GIRL 2:**
&gt; Girl 2 is a much simpler story. She was in one of my classes last semester. She's hot, but I never really thought of pursuing her. Nonetheless, recently she facebook IM'd me, sending me tons of IOI's (Saying next time she's in the city she's definitely gonna hit me up, claiming she ""likes to have fun ;)"", inviting me to the bar she's going to try to get a job at, etc). Even in my state I was able to pick up on this, so I got her number and said that we should definitely do something when she's back. Every couple days she'll text/message me. 


&gt; The problem with her is that she's currently across the country at an internship, and won't be back until August (when she'll be back for the entire school year). What should I do until then? Should I text her every now and then? Should I just wait for her to text me? Do I ignore them sometimes? Any advice at all that you can give me on this situation?


Those are my two situations right now. Thanks for taking the time out to read through them, and thanks for any advice you guys give. I'm heading out to a party tomorrow so I'll be sure to try out what I've been reading up on since subscribing to this place :)"

usoeb,7,2012-06-08,Initial thoughts as a hospital chaplain intern: Ministry in a multi-faith context,madcowbomber,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/usoeb/initial_thoughts_as_a_hospital_chaplain_intern/,"I started working this week as an intern at a large hospital in Atlanta.  My background is PCA evangelical (somewhat conservative, white upper middle class, in my experience.)  I have a BA in Biblical Studies and am working on an MA in Chaplaincy, just to give you a bit of background on me.  

With the exception of a couple Catholics, I'm probably about the most theologically conservative person in the group of 16 interns, which includes Christians of much more liberal denominations, Rosicrucians, Buddhists, Sufis, as well as gay Christians. 

What I've come to realize is that in this context, theology becomes more of a barrier than anything else (at least for me).  It distances me from real people with real, authentic, valid life experiences of their own.  I have to let go of almost all my theology - and almost all my religious heritage and tradition - in order to be an effective minister.  One of the verses that has been rolling around in my head has been from 1 Corinthians 8, where Paul says, ""Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies.""  My knowledge may or may not be superior; it may be more theologically rigorous and Biblically accurate - but that will not help me convey God's love to my fellow interns, much less the hundreds of patients we'll see.  

The reason I mention this here is because one of the ongoing undercurrents of conversation here at /r/Christianity is the tension between Christian liberalism and conservatism, and verses and doctrines get thrown back and forth.  As a chaplain, if I got involved in a conflict like that in the hospital - with anyone - I would be wrong.  It's too easy to get sucked into theological shit fights, where no minds are changed, no hearts are softened.

One of the approaches we're learning about through this internship has to do with encountering another person, in the model of Martin Buber's I and Thou, recognizing that each person isn't an homogeneous object, but a complex mix of thoughts, feelings, and experiences that is deserving of recognition.  Part of encountering the Thou (especially when it's a patient or patients in conflict) is letting go of the outcome.  I'm not there to make sure that orthodox practice is established and followed.  I'm there to help people understand each other, make decisions that need to be made, and process their feelings in a healthy way.

Where do you draw the line?,Toddtodd,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/usn0f/facial_piercing_in_an_office_setting_where_do_you/,"I work at a small non profit, in administration.  My nose is pierced and usually I wear an almost imperceptible stud.  Today I was feeling a bit adventurous and wore a golden nose stud with white and red stones on it (sort of like [this](http://www.amazon.com/BombayFashions-Indian-Ethnic-NoseRing-Pierced/dp/B0071BC8QA)).

Shortly after I arrived to work I had a brief meeting with one of our summer interns.  A few hours later I noticed that she had taken down her septum ring (up until this point she had always kept it hidden).  

For some reason her septum piercing seemed totally out of line to me (I too have my septum pierced but would never show it in the office).  I felt that it wasn't my place (I'm not her supervisor or an HR professional) and I didn't have the right to tell her that wearing a septum ring is frowned on in our office - while I am wearing a visible stud.  I also felt guilty that I might have set a bad example for her...and maybe should not have worn a flashy stud to work.

I can't quite put my finger on why, for me, a septum ring is professionally inappropriate and a flashy nose stud is acceptable.

What does reddit think?  Where do you draw the line on facial piercings in the office?

uslog,12,2012-06-08,Can't believe that I've actually started to think of suicide....but the thought almost gives me peace,wtfiswrongwithme999,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/uslog/cant_believe_that_ive_actually_started_to_think/,"Some backround: I'm a lifelong underachiever. The kid who would have multiple teachers tell me that all I had to do was try and that I would be hugely successful. Well. I guess I didn't try.


Where I'm at now:

School:
I've just been rejected for my 200th internship application. I go to a state school, and my grades aren't through the roof, but with a gpa above a 3 I figured it just wouldn't be so damn hard. In the industry I'm in (finance), not getting an internship after junior year is pretty much considered a death knell. So, I'm facing an already rough employment scene with 2 strikes on my name already. I literally stay up at night worried about what I'll do when I graduate.


Personal Life:
I'm very loud and sort of cocky and have a very...mean sense of humor. I realize that 2 out of those 3 are under my direct control, but I just don't know how else to be. I had literally 0 friends in high school but sort of had a little more luck in college. I don't have any close friends, but I've got a couple guys I can call friends. All of them have one thing in common-unending patience for my bullshit. I honestly feel like a giant fucking burden.


Girls:
Most people assume I've got a ridiculous sex life. I am loud, brash, and cocky as discussed earlier. I also lie a lot. However, I've only had sex with one girl, who is quite literally a nympho and will quite literally sleep with anyone. Shes very heavy, not even close to good looking, and the only way I can get it up is to turn the lights off. I tried reading some stuff on r/seduction, but I'm just way too much of a pussy to actually go up to random girls. I'm 20, short, brown, and have a receding hairline. What shot do I have compared to 6'2"", white, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, muscled up frat boys? Again, I'm just aware of how inadequate I am.


Honestly, mostly due to my cockyness, I always told myself I'd be able to turn it around. That it wasn't too late for me to get my life on the right path. But....I may have hit that point where its too late. I can't figure anything out, and I'm trying so fucking hard right now. Today I literally caught myself trying to figure out ways to kill myself without making it look like suicide. I don't think I'll ever actually go through with it, because I'm a giant fucking pussy, and my mom is a softie and I wouldn't want to fuck her up for life. But the though is so....appealing. Like I'd finally be done waiting for life to get better even though it won't. 


Which is also fucking ridiculous. My parents make good money, I live in a very nice house, I've had so many advantages in life, and I  haven't been able to make anything out of myself. I'm afraid I'll spend the rest of my life living right here at home, and even though I'd have a better existence than many due to the fact that my father has a good job, I just....wouldn't be able to face my ego. My father came to America with $7, worked his way through college and a masters program, and sacrificed every day to make my life easier. Meanwhile I can't even get a fucking UNPAID internship.


I can't even believe I actually typed all this shit out. I'm so fucking pathetic. What kind of bitch does this sort of shit?

I stopped to see if he was okay, he had just ran out of gas. I figured I could help the guy out, ran to the gas station and picked up a gas can and filled it up. Long story short, the guy I helped out used to be the president of engineering of the department where I work now, and has since moved on to another independent company. He offered to take me out to lunch this next week, and said he'll put me in touch with people who will likely offer me further employment opportunities.

I worked for about 6 months to save up 3,000 dollars to make sure that my time in Paris was fantastic, and it was. Now, I have about 500 dollars to my name, left over from my trip. 

I had small get-togethers with a French native once a week for ten weeks while in France, with two randomly chosen classmates of a similar French level. We regularly went out to get drinks (a glass of wine or two) before our conversation sessions together, and it slowly dawned on me that the two kids around me were rich: I never said anything about the obvious differences between our lifestyles and passed it off as if I didn't notice, but these kids would spent 20-30 euros on a midafternoon snack while I stuck with my 4 euro glass of red wine.

During one of these conversation sessions, my horrible luck showed up to bite me in the rear: after making one overlarge gesture with my hands, I sent my glass of red wine flying onto my own white pants, and the white pants and baby blue shirt of the rich guy next to me. I apologized profusely for an hour and I paid for his drinks, and made sure to say that I would pay for his dry cleaning, although I stopped short of saying that I would pay for what was probably a thousand-dollar outfit. 

For four weeks, he says nothing, occasionally joking to third parties about my clumsiness. I figured that I deserved it and laughed it off, appreciating that he was being such a nice guy about it--he hadn't even asked for the money that I offered him for dry cleaning, so he must recognize our slightly different socioeconomic backgrounds (that, or he didn't want to be rude). 

At the end of my stay in Paris, as he was off to Provence, he sends me a message, saying that he ""didn't know what [my] financial situation is"" but that he believed it was fair that I compensate him for the shirt he lost, saying nothing of the pants (leading me to believe that the stain came out and he never asked for the money that I offered him). I saw the linked shirt via the website that he copy pasted into the email--135 euros, or around 170 dollars. I don't even have the money to waste dry cleaning my own white pants from that day, even though they were brand new--when I got the message I straight up flipped out, and finally told him I could only afford 50 euros, and he said that it's alright, he can wait until I am working this summer to receive payment. I don't have a summer job (instead I have an unpaid internship), and even if I did, at minimum wage that would take 17 hours to make. 

What can I do? Are there any legal steps that he could take? I've never dealt with anything like this before, and I seriously don't want to sacrifice 2/5 of my net worth to a guy who is, as I see it, being completely irrational. 

What would you guys do in my situation?

TL;DR: Spilled wine on a rich dude, I've got 500 dollars to my name and no job (broke ass college student). He's asking for payment for a 170 dollar shirt, mailed to his address. I need help and advice.

Edit: I've already replied once with that 50 euro offer--it seems strange to ignore him now, although that might be my best option, but I'm really looking for all of the possibilities. Also, he's gay! So no spurned lover kind of situations are happening here."

What I want is advice about job and career opportunities in UK. What are some good paying careers, what are the requirements and that sort of info.

A bit about myself. I'm an immigrant in UK (yes I know I'm hated for it and I'm sorry, but it's not my fault I was born in a country where I couldn't afford to even feed myself if I tried to find work there). I came here about a year ago when I just finished secondary school and was still 18.I couldn't decide what I wanted with my life and my parents couldn't afford further education for me (which would be pointless abroad anyway, my countries education isn't recognized here) so I moved to UK.

I've got no idea what I want to study in a university, which is the main reason why I didn't apply anywhere. I live in a small town not very far away from Birmingham. All my work experience is factory and warehouse related. I couldn't find a stable job for a long while and most of the jobs I had were simply horrific (imagine standing on a line in a factory with a conditioning unit blowing cold air on you, while you drop spinach in salad trays, had to quit when I almost lost consciousness from the cold) up until my current one which is FLT driver. 

The pay is really bad, basic is somewhere around 900 per month and I can work all week for 12 hours and still won't get more than 1200 per month.The job itself is really stressful and really quick paced, but I still like it considering what I've been doing before. Now the problem is I can't imagine myself doing this all my life. I want something more, I simply need something more.

This is where it gets difficult. I tried searching for office jobs online but I just get really lost, there is such a huge variety and choice I simply don't know where to start or what to do. What do I write in my CV? The only noteworthy experience I have is this FLT job and the fact that I know 5 languages, that's about it. Maybe there are some agencies focusing on office jobs that could help me get started in one? Where do I apply, how do I apply, what should I do? Maybe there are some courses that would help me land a normal job or I should try some internships or something? I'm really lost and I have no one but reddit to ask for help since all of my acquaintances are doing the same or even worse jobs than I have now.

I'm saving all the money I can, my fridge is almost always empty, I never buy any new clothes (my only shoes have holes in them already). I saved up about 3000 pounds this way already (would be a lot more but I have an ill girlfriend I have to help out from time to time) and am willing to do anything, I can move anywhere and do any job as long as I actually get a chance to do it.

TL;DR; 19 year old immigrant in UK.Only secondary education, know 5 languages. Looking for any career opportunities or any advice at all to land a normal job.

Thank you  to anyone who read this, honestly a really big thank you. I'm desperate and really have no idea what to do or anyone to ask for advice. If you need any other information just ask, feel free to share your experiences as well, anything can help me now."

Alright, I had to jump in because this one hit really close to home. I'm the guy who posted a few weeks ago about the job with Insomniac. I've been working for the last three weeks mostly on new business development, planning future events since this one just had execution left.

 I have to say, I'm really disappointed in all of you. I would hope that of all people, redditors would be reasonable enough to understand that in these type of disaster scenarios, people in charge have a DUTY to err on the side of responsibility. It's the difference between a type I and type II error. If they let the show go on and they're wrong, people die. If they make the show stop and they're wrong, some people didnt get to party all night. Are you all so incredibly dense that you can't understand the wisdom behind prioritizing safety?

As far as execution: there was undoubtedly chaos. Whenever there is an abrupt, fundamental change in an event of that size, there is chaos. However, they had a contingency plan in place in case of high wind, because it was a risk. They did everything to minimize that risk in advance. They met with meteorologists to determine what kind of wind was likely and for what period of time. They then took that information to the engineers behind the rigging and worked with them to double and triple check safety. Due to Insomniac's insurance, we are required to have t-tests conducted on the spot based on the conditions and known actuarial tables of risk. Anything with a p value &gt; .01 is considered statistically significant enough for us to deem it an imminent possible threat. In layman's terms, if there's a realistic chance people could die, our priority automatically becomes to protect the safety of everyone there. This system is in place so that human judgement is not tempted by making money.

Traffic sucked, people were uninformed, and things were unpleasant. The guys on the EDC 2012 team are working even right now to make it up to the attendees and fans. I am not on that team this year, and am in charge of general festival marketing, but I see what these guys are doing right now, and I am so impressed by how much they care that I am inspired to work harder on my own stuff. Not only did they come up with a festival experience that is literally second to none in this country and possibly the world, they did it within the confines of intelligent business practices to make the event financially sustainable. Events of this quality on this scale are unheard of, and take it from someone in the business: the beauty and sincerity of this festival experience is nothing short of a miracle.

As far as allegations that Insomniac only cares about the money: shut the fuck up. The armchair fucking business executives and sleuths on this subreddit think that by researching something for 15-20 minutes, they can make authoritative claims like that. It's ridiculous. To put it in perspective, I offered a solution to the EDC team for the traffic situation: have a low power, local fm station that is broadcasting a DJ set and some MC pump-up commentary about EDC, and instruct everyone to put that station on. You can call it the EDC parade. That way people won't notice as much, and they're less likely to complain. This is a common tactic in marketing. You can either spend money making a product better (product development) or spend money making people think the product is better (advertising). Often it is cheaper to go for the marketing solution. Pasquale immediately shot it down, because it wasn't totally honest. He said that if we have problems, we need to fix them, not dress them up. I disagree with him from a business point of view, but I developed an immense amount of respect for his conviction in improving the quality of the event, and giving people the maximum value for every dollar.

That brings me to another thing: the price of the tickets. I have seen repeated mentions on this subreddit along the lines of ""herp derp I spent hundreds of dollars and how dare they cancel anything give me my x amount of money back"".First, Insomniac is out the money too. You think the performers don't get paid just because they didn't perform? Not their problem. There's no one sneaking out the back door with bags of money. Second, the tickets are so expensive because of **you**. Yes, you specifically. We (specifically, I) just conducted a behavioral marketing experiment to determine what features of a show are most highly correlated to how much you enjoy the show (satisfaction of attendance) and how likely you are to go (percent chance of attendance). Without getting too mathematical, in nearly 93% of cases, the popularity and ubiquity of the artist was the single most important factor for people in judging the quality of their experience at the festival. Also, based on our calculations, you're willing to spend approximately $1.50 for every $1 we effectively spend on an artist's booking fee. That means if we spent $3million on talent, you'd be willing to spend about $4.5million on tickets, leaving only $1.5million (a pitiful amount) to build stages, install art, have water stands, bathrooms, security, marketing, etc. etc. In only 15% of cases did the promise of ""experience-enhancing"" amenities influence desire to spend. 

So, the only choice to give you the quality of event we want to provide is to increase the quantity of the event. In economics we call this phenomenon an economy of scale. In other words, **to give you the experience that we have statistically proven that you want, we have to operate EDC at the price and size that it is at**. So, if you want cheaper tickets, get your friends to stop being mindless celebrity-enthralled sheep that want to listen to whoever the crowd is listening to. You won't succeed, because of the effect of social proof, but hey, crazier things have happened. Basically what I'm saying is that you have no one to blame for this specific issue but yourselves.

I could go on and on about the ways in which Insomniac tries to do right by its customers: free water refilling stations rather than charge $5 for water, not allowing cameras and charging for photography that is harvested and planned for data collection, shortening the hours, exploiting attendees with sponsorships and product advertising...and these are just things that I have *personally* presented in the last month or so. They would unarguably increase profit, and make the people behind Insomniac very wealthy. Once you have a successful business, it's very easy to make it into an ATM. Time and time again, I have had ideas shot down because, ""That's not what Insomniac is about. We owe everything to our customers and fans, and we are not going to deceive them, even if they won't notice. They trust us and that's worth more than anything."" Imagine being in front of a blind man that sitting next to his two million dollars of life savings in a briefcase, with no one around. Insomniac is not only the person who would not take your suitcase, they're the ones that would sell you a hot dog, take your money, count out the correct amount of change, and stay there entertaining you with stories until someone came to make sure you're safe.

I have a bachelors degree in applied mathematics from MIT, during which time I started, built, and then sold my own EDM promo company. I have an MBA in marketing from the Kellogg School of Business at Northwestern, where I graduated #3 in my class. I did my MBA internship at Disney. I had job offers where I could be easily be making a very healthy six figure salary, and retire young and wealthy. I joined Insomniac because I care about EDM. Rave culture changed my life. It taught me that if people who are different classes, races, religions, genders, lifestyles, and personalities can coexist in a celebration of life and happiness, even if it's just for one night, then there is hope for our future as human beings. 

Insomniac is full of capable people like me that are doing this because we believe in something. I hope you can find it within you to believe in us, too.

This is a beast of a computer that I'm not sure I quite need (if you guys remember my old post about me hesitating to build one in the first place). However, I just landed an awesome summer internship so I thought I'd treat myself to something NICE. 

I mean I could probably swing 1400 but I don't want to pay that much for something I'd only use for school and *some* gaming (nothing too heavy either). I think ~1000 is more my price range. Where are places on this build that I could trim some fat?

Also, is it possible to make a Hackintosh *easily*? I despise Windows, and would like to dual boot Mac OSX with Windows. I might just end up running dual boot Windows/Linux if that isn't possible though.

uus4f,1,2012-06-10,Facebook Ads for Greek Life,4DaWin,GreekLife,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreekLife/comments/uus4f/facebook_ads_for_greek_life/,"I decided Reddit was probably the best place to ask this question. I go to a school of about 1200 students. We have 13 Greek organizations and are approaching %50 student involvement in Greek Life. In the Fall of 2010, one house was shut down by it's national headquarters due to lack of size. I noticed one day on Facebook adds showing up talking about being the founding class of a fraternity at my school (I was not in school at the time, as I was taking time off for an internship). This house's national office sent in recruiters to restart the chapter and had paid for targeted ads for students of my university between certain ages.

Recently, my house has been doing a lot of experimenting with social media and it's possible uses for rush. Having a page for our chapter has proven to be quite useful. In the past few months, we've looked to that aforementioned example as reason to experiment with using adds to drive freshmen traffic to our page.

My question to the Reddit community is, has anyone tried this before? Was it effective? Does having an ad make your house look desperate for new members or is it in fact a smart way to reach out to potential members?"

I'm utilizing the 6 month grace period before I have to start making payments.  Currently, I'm working as an intern with an engineering company making basically enough to pay rent, buy food and put a little aside for entertainment and savings.  The internship will end in about 3 months.  People tell me that I shouldn't have anything to worry about - that I'm a smart guy with a good degree.  But still, everyday I have a gloom-and-doom perspective that I won't be able to find a job and that I'm going to be broke and unable to pay my loans my whole life.  I know this isn't the case but I'm having a hard time looking at the situation with anything but a pessimistic mindset.  

Is/has anyone else been in a similar situation?  Is it all going to work out okay?  What is the best way I can manage my loans and change my mindset about being broke and unable to pay for the things I *need* to and, to a lesser degree, afford the small luxuries for myself that I would like to have.  I'm sick of eating eggs and rice all day.  I want to be able to go to the movies and out to the bar with friends without being ""that guy"" who brings up money all the time.

I'm a 24 year old proud atheist, musician and Industrial Engineering graduate female born and raised in Turkey. I'm not here to complain about my country but as you can anticipate I'm looking forward to moving to a place where the society is matured to a point that transportation, income, gender equality, freedom of speech are the least of your concerns as an educated person. Since some of you guys have this as granted you may say that there's no such thing. What I'm talking about here is of course not an utopic country, but a relatively more livable one. To my experiences developed countries such as USA, Canada, Australia and Northern Europe countries are huge leap in general for someone from a developing or a 3rd world country in terms of such qualities. Making a decision and moving forward is another story. 

So apart from searching and reading from internet for a decision I felt that travelling to the potential country should give you a broader range of what you can expect from that country. This idea led me to a summer vacation where I became a lousy backpacker (ha! then I took an arrow on the knee-will tell you about it later) to get to know developed Northern Europe countries such as Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Belgium etc. And I have to say, to my disappointment I had decided that I can only live in Germany or Netherlands. Other countries and cities I visited seemed too tiny/modest for a girl from Istanbul like me(Fricken city has 17 million people on it). Also I had a chance to visit Chicago for 3 months after graduation and my backpacking adventure to see my beloved cuteling whom is a Robotics Engineer. And this trip, I should say, lifted a lot of USA's bad reputation about these qualities too. I have to say before that it was the last country I would consider. 

So before me and my SO finally decide things and settle down, I decided to apply for jobs in Netherlands for some more time. You probably already know pros and cons of it so I'll pass that. Grass is definitely greener and obviously Netherlands job market was less competitive. During the job hunt process I used Linkedin and several expat list to catch on jobs which does not require Dutch.

Finally an IT company from Amsterdam got back at me twice and wanted me to have a face to face interview with them. They are saying they'll pay half of my travel costs, and in case of hiring reimburse all of it. So everything's alright up to this time. Packed my sharpest business girl suit along with my hopes and had to manage to get a tourist visa(struggling to get it on time, duh!) and will be flying to Amsterdam on 14th June. My only concern is I only have 15 months part time internship at IBM(Istanbul HG)+Industrial Engineering degree and a certificate handful for the position. I'm hoping that it will be enough for me to enter the European job market as a non-EU citizen. So my fellow redditors any tips or useful info about interview or the non-EU employment process is welcome. Also shoot your developing country&gt;developed country stories!

TL;DR I'm an Industrial Engineer from Turkey(non-EU country) with 15 month IT internship experience and will be interviewing for a position in Amsterdam in less than a week. Shoot me your Non-EU employment or developing country&gt;developed country stories and some tips for expat job interview! Also wish me luck! &gt;&lt;"

~~[Resume Here](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/20237974/Resume_review_scitech_June12.pdf)~~

My target audience for this is engineering/research organizations that are searching for interns, entry-level temps, or part-time workers.  (I am also applying to some business and some communications positions, and the content is slightly different + I make the relevant skill--leadership, communications--the orange one).  The purpose of this work is to make an employer do a slight double-take during resume review and offer me an interview to find out more. 

I'm not a graphic designer by occupation, so I would be very grateful for any feedback you could provide on the design.  I'm particularly suspicious of the following items:

* Font in general - I'm a bit unsure of the Raleway/Calibiri pairing, and I think I might have too many different typefaces within the document.  I know that Raleway could be difficult during printing, and I have yet to test that. Thoughts?
* Layout/whitespace on the first page - something looks a bit off, but I don't know what.
* Timeline on the second page - I'm trying to figure out how to integrate slightly more information to make it much more useful (education, positions, etc.), but I'm at a loss.  At the moment, it is supposed to show how much time/energy I put into each area over time.  Any ideas?
* This is intended to be web/double-sided color print.  I'm making more versions for other situations - a b&amp;w one colored with black/grey/white and one that has easier margins to print.

Thank you for your time!

My name is SiIence, and it is late at night and this is clearly a trollsome post. What follows is a collection of letters and quotes submitted to me from a number of users, protesting the recent spike in violence and killing in our community. I hope you consider this, and hopefully come to the realization that in a harsh society such as ours, violence is not the answer.            

Recent HungerCraft winner Scoola states ""I don't know about all this killing, man. I mean, it may be the point of the game and all, but I'm not sure that we are making the right choice as a gaming community, you know? There is so much we could accomplish in our hour and a half if we all worked together for once.""            

Scoola's point of view is one of growing importance and popularity throughout our community. In protest to these senseless deaths, he and several others have begun building up towers at the corn and jumping, rather than continue the violence.            

""Dear SiIence,
       Regarding your recent message to me on Reddit, I must say I agree with you on all points. As a whole, picture all we could accomplish! We could build grand cities, create lavish mines, but instead, we pilfer, plunder, and murder. Is this the way we want to live? CAN we live with ourselves this way? I know I've done things... Things I don't want to talk about, all over a porkchop midway through a game. The friends I have betrayed just to stay alive will never trust me again. Can I live with that? I don't know. I just wanted to thank you for being there for me through all this. It's been tough... (EDITOR'S NOTE: Parts of this letter were edited out due to unneeded declarations of love) And through all this, you've been there. Where was I? Oh, yes. The killing. Yeah, it's bad. We need to band together, now or never to choke this evil at its root.             Sincerely, Sup13r4367na787554327584732597289562439t43al            

Interview with Yamata4TW, dated 6/8/12, 8:43 PM.      SiIence: So, what are your views on the violence in our community?      Yamata4TW: Erm, what? I thought you asked me in here to see if I wanted to join the map building team.      S: No, I... Wait, what? Why on earth would we want you? You suck at everything! Erm, pardon. Most things. Back to the topic. What are your views on the killings?      Y: Uh, they are bad, I guess? I mean, I've never thought about this before, but it is sort of pointless. We have to stop the violence and bond together. It is our only real hope if we want to stay sane throughout the harsh enviroments we voluntarily put ourselves into. It's wrong.      S: What do you think is wrong about the killings, and how do you think we should stop them?      Y:Well, what is wrong with them is obvious. Killing in any medium is murder. We need a court system in our games, so that those who are murdered can be sentanced and tried fairly, rather than an eye for eye, tooth for tooth approach. I don't support the death penalty. Game in prison, maybe? I don't know. But as for stopping the killings, the murderers must be publicly punished. A harsh reaction is our only option here.      S: Thank you for your time.      Y:Wait, I don't even get a reward for doing this? Screw you, man, F--- *END INTERVIEW*

I'm working as an intern in NYC, my first time here, and I'm going through a bit of a hectic time.  Just broke up with my first real girlfriend, halfway through college, standard feelings of aimlessness and woe that I won't think anyone really wants to read about

Anyway, today I decided to take a solo day trip to Staten Island, one of the 5 Boroughs of NYC. Right before leaving my apartment, I posted on facebook, ""Staten Island for the day! I'll bring the Billy Joel."" This will be important

At the time, I thought this was kind of stupid.  It made sense to me because one of my favorite Billy Joel Songs (Everybody Loves you Now) briefly mentions the Staten Island Ferry, but I didn't really think anyone else would get it. Oh well, worse things than dumb fb statuses.

Anyway, in this spirit, I listened to two Billy Joel songs on the ferry on the way over: [Everybody Loves you Now](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrirVgYw58E) and [The Entertainer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu9xfEf3OFI)

The day is fun, but kinda strange in a lot of ways. I just see lots of things that strike me as odd: A largish turtle chilling in a little puddle on the side of a street near the bay, wind up in a sketchy abandoned basement beneath a museum, etc.  Finally, I'm walking through this park called snug harbor, and I pass by this Russian wedding.  When I first walk by, they're playing, you guessed it, Billy Joel.  Specifically The Entertainer. Following this song? Everybody Loves you Now. The same songs (and only songs) I listened to on the ferry, in reverse order to the order I listened to them.

Now I know that Billy Joel's a popular guy, but those aren't exactly his two most popular songs. They're from different albums, and I have no idea why they would be bumping Billy Joel's unsung hits at a Russian Wedding. Add to this the creepy park on what, for me, had been a really bizarre day. I'm no mystic, and I hardly know what supernatural force would use old Billy songs as their magical mcguffic, but its been on my mind all day.

How about you, every experienced a coincidence that just seemed a little too coincidencey? "

I have given deep thought on what I want to do with my life. And like I said before, I have always loved the amount of passion and work being put into coding and programming software and games. I have always wanted to learn how. Such as C++, Java, an Python. Now for the real question. Where do I start? Any recommended collages?

(o no, female FA)",pun_about_throwaway,ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/utwy8/breaking_down_today_o_no_female_fa/,"I can't handle it anymore.  I can't take the sheer lack of contact with people.  This sounds desperate, but maybe I am.

When I was younger (read, up until I was about 20), I had more friends than I knew what to do with.  I had moved several times when I was a little bit, but I thought I had everything under control.  I had a boyfriend who I was convinced I was going to marry.  I moved to another country for him (not as if I hadn't met him before or anything like that).  I had made friends in his home country, and in my own.  Then I lost my bestie due to my own anxiety issues manifesting as pure-asshole-bitchiness.  Then a few months after my visa expired and I moved back to the US, the ex told me he was cheating on me and we were over.  Of course, all the friends I had made in his home country left me.  

Then, I just slowly crashed.  I thought I solve my problems with xanax.  The ex toyed with me, telling me he was sorry and we would get back together.  A family member got ill, so I balanced a part time internship, a full course load, and taking care of my family.  (I'd often only sleep 3 hours or so a night).  The summer I turned 22 was the start of me really crashing.  I was working 40 hours a week, living on my own, having this ex tease me, and often rushing to the ER with the sick family member and spending the night(s) at the hospital with her.  I found a boyfriend for a month, but it failed.

It was then that I stopped going to classes.  I failed semester and lied to everyone about it.  I stopped leaving my apartment, unless I had to.  I was put on anti-depressants which put me in a weird manic episode where I paced around my living room and threatened to kill myself.  I stopped them cold turkey (but still took the xanax and beer to numb everything out).  It was then that I could only sleep with the benzos, and could hardly function at all.  I lost the few friends I had left, of my own volition.  (Agoraphobia is a bitch)

Somehow, I forced myself to snap out of it enough to finish my classes (with one major relapse).  I found two jobs that I enjoy, and have generally been happy with my life. It's been two years (I'm 25 in three months) since any major problems.

**tl;dr: Went a little crazy, no friends.**

What's the point of this?  I have noone around anymore, and I feel like I'm starting to fall back in to my depression.  I have no ""peers"".  I don't know anyone in the area, and I don't have any real hobbies any more.  I lost a lot of my confidence after my breakdown.  I have no real family in the area.  I have co-workers, but most are either in their mid-30s with kids, or in their 40s and 50s.  Nice enough people, but still nothing.  I gained some weight during my depression (went from a size 12 to a 16-18ish), and just feel like no one would want to be around me any way.  I don't drink any more.  I just... am alone, obvs.  And I needed to just tell SOMEONE, because I'm afraid if I don't I'm going to do something stupid some time soon.

Sorry for the throwaway."

Background:

I graduated school about a month ago from the University of Connecticut with a BS in mechanical engineering. During my last semester I was sure that I would be able to get a job in one of my ideal locations (baltimore, boston or philly) given some time. Because of this I used the schools career fair as more of a practice as 90% of the jobs were located in CT (which I had decided I did not want to live in). However, after 100+ emails and applications, I have very few leads. I have expanded my search to any seemingly interesting places for a few weeks now. I value my social life my social life greatly, and don't want to be stuck in the middle of nowhere living a miserable life.  I only seem to get feedback from manufacturing engineer positions. This is likely due to the fact that I have a good GPA (~3.3) but no internship experience. I also had limited CAD experience in school. Because of this I have being trying to teach it to myself. I feel that I have gained a basic understanding, but no company sees that as legitimate. I'm a blue collar manual labor worker at heart, so I'm considering applying to field engineering positions as well.


Questions:


1. If I venture away from mechanical jobs and go into manufacturing will I be able to transition back if I do not think it's for me?


2. My perception of field engineering that the job itself is interesting, however you are generally in boring locations and asked to travel to more boring locations often. Is this perception correct?


3. Given that I don't have internship and little CAD experience, how do I get companies to give me a chance in a mechanical field?


4. What are some interesting places within the US that I could apply.


5. Any other tips?"

The conversation went really well, and I learned that I won't have to wait to take hormones. All I need to do is schedule an appointment, talk to either her, or her intern, have them write my letter, then I can get hormones. So, I didn't think I would be this close to starting HRT this soon, and I have to say I'm feeling really euphoric. Really happy. But I'm still concerned. Is there anything I should know before I jump into the deep end and start HRT? I've been wanting to start HRT since I learned about it. It's something that I KNOW that I want to do. I just want to know if there are any tips."

If anyone on this subreddit has any information that could help me, I would be extremely grateful!

UPDATE: I am currently volunteering at the American Cancer Society!"
uwtsm,13,2012-06-11,"Reddit, I'm 18 and my parents are threatening to throw me out because I can't find work for the summer. I've applied to tons of positions but nothing's worked so far. Can someone help me out?",tenoz,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uwtsm/reddit_im_18_and_my_parents_are_threatening_to/,"I'm an 18 y.o. college student (currently studying Mechanical Engineering at a school in New Jersey) and, basically: I've been applying for internships, full-time labor, and part-time labor since February. NOTHING has come through, not even rejection responses for the most part. I've send out countless copies of my resume to a menagerie of different positions on Craigslist, company job portals, and the like.

I normally wouldn't bitch about this to Reddit but my parents are gradually threatening to throw me out of their house. They're pissed about my unemployment and my college performance (apparently a 3.0 is not good enough). I don't think that they'd ever go through with it, but the stress alone from them yelling at me daily is enough to drive me into depression. Economically, if I could move out, I would.

So, yeah, if anyone here can help me out - is an employer, knows someone, associated with a business, etc; I would appreciate it so very much.

Here's a link to the ad on Craigslist I made, should be helpful and shows what my skills are:

http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/res/3065705945.html

tl;dr: Can't get a job for the summer. Parents not understanding, threatening to throw me out. Need to find something soon."
uwtmy,3,2012-06-11,Got some spare time. What should I do with it? ,DownVoteQueen,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uwtmy/got_some_spare_time_what_should_i_do_with_it/,"I'm 25, female, and a recent transplant to the SF Bay Area from the East Coast. I kept my old job and now work east coast hours, from 6a-2p PT, Monday through Friday. Working on an East Coast schedule leaves me with some wide open afternoons. I'm looking to do something challenging that won't become full-time. Also, I get bored easily, so it's important that my chosen activity is engaging and provides some sort of long-term value. 

My question to you, Reddit, is: ""What the hell do I do with this spare time?""

Here are some ideas I have. Can you think of anything else?

- volunteer at an animal shelter
- take some academic classes for fun (I have a B.S. and M.A., but I could use some sharper math skills)
- get an internship in my field (marketing/advertising) where I could learn some additional skillsets
- do some consulting work (does anyone need some online marketing work?)
- sleep (i hope it doesn't come to this!)

Crowdsource me some ideas!

uwr3o,3,2012-06-11,"AskReddit, how does one decide on a career? I'm finding that ""process of elimination"" wasn't a good reasoning. Give me your stories and advice on choosing careers and changing careers as well!",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uwr3o/askreddit_how_does_one_decide_on_a_career_im/,"**My situation:** May 2011 I graduated with a degree in civil engineering from a decent state school. Even though I didn't really WANT to be a civil engineer, I picked my major because it seemed at least moderately interesting. For the ~18 months leading up to graduation I wasn't too enthusiastic about my major, but I figured I'd go with it.

Graduated with an internship, 3.7 GPA, and EIT designation (passed FE Exam junior year). I also worked throughout college to pay for my education (no help from parents or anyone). I have pretty good social skills and interviewing skills for an engineer: I was ""runner up"" in my first interview out of 20 candidates, and at my second interview was offered a job 15 minutes after leaving. 

Not trying to brag with that last paragraph (anonymously on Reddit with a throwaway, yeah right), just trying to say that I am a capable worker and I think I can do anything I set my mind to. The only thing is that my mind isn't set to anything.

13 months removed from school and I have had a temp job for 3 months and a job as a structural engineer for 9. I have no desire to succeed in my profession or get my PE license. I know I'm lucky to have a job, but should I be satisfied for the rest of my life with the thought of just having a job? I don't think so.

I'm only 23, but I'm getting a little panicky that I have no idea what to do from here on. Everyone says ""oh, you'll know what you want to do, don't rush it"" ... But what if it never comes? It seems like any path I might be even slightly curious in is a huge risk (see: money) for something that isn't even CLOSE to guaranteed? I know engineers often become teachers (summers off maybe, not much money) or bankers (big money, 100-hour weeks), but both of these would require me going back to school. $60,000+ more in education is so steep for just something so unsure.

**So, AskReddit, I would love your input.** I am looking for advice on my situation, or your own stories of how you chose your career and the risks you took to get there. Did you just ""know"" what you wanted to do? Are you happy with your choices? Do tell!"

I go to a very small college that does not offer academic credit for internships, but the company requires that all interns must receive credit from the school in which they are enrolled due to insurance purposes. I am pretty scared that I might lose this opportunity because of this fucking stupid policy that my school, for some reason, holds. Do you have any experiences similar to this or are you aware of any ways to circumvent this requirement? I'm at a loss.

I have very good grades (ranked about 20/400 in my highly competitive high school) but my weakness is my extracurricular activities. I play varsity sports (captain of 2 teams), speak 4 languages fluently, play an instrument and I'm a member of the National Honor Society, have 200+ hours of volunteer work, and I'm a member of other school clubs such as Mock Trial and Model UN, and other clubs and I can assure you I'll be writing a great essay and receiving glowing recommendation letters. I'll probably be at least a National Merit Semi-Finalist and a Presidential Scholar Candidate. I won't post my test scores or classes but I've taken a couple of AP classes and I've scored 4 and 5 in all of them.
 
My SAT II scores have also been 750 and more. As already stated my problem is EC's and leadership positions, because I really want to stand out, but there are some highly qualified people in my high school who will be candidates form leadership positions so it's gonna be tough. What do you guys think I should do to stand out? (What leadership positions, internship opportunities (I'll probably be a lawyer), if any, because I doubt I'll get one, can I work on? What clubs can I start? My high school has all your typical clubs, tutoring club, etc. 

Anyhow, please help me! Yeah, I'm an overachiever and what not, but leave those comments to yourself. I know I have good chances (Ivy's and good colleges reject people more qualified than me), but I'm fighting against my peers for leadership roles. If your going to comment with the usual ""be yourself"" and ""there's no ticket to getting in"", don't comment. I've heard that a thousand times and I don't want to hear it again."

I thought finding a job might be rather easy. Eighteen freaking months later, I finally got a job.

As most people graduating from college nowadays will tell you, you run into the ""You can't get a job without experience and you can't get experience without a job"" Catch-22 HARD and very quickly upon graduation and it can be annoying and discouraging.

This post is to try to encourage those out there who have yet to find a job (there is hope, I can tell you from experience!) and to ask for any pointers from those smarter than me on good habits to get into during this difficult phase of life. Some quick pointers from me that I picked up during my 18-month stint to start off:

1) As discouraging as it gets, *always* keep working to get a job as hard as you were when you started looking. It can get incredibly discouraging, especially when you start hearing the seemingly condescending ""So....why haven't you worked for a year?"" or ""So...what have you been doing for the last year?"" questions, but don't ever slow down.

2) Don't be embarrassed to collect unemployment if you're following pointer #1. Collecting unemployment can come with the negative stigma that you're being lazy on others' dollar, but don't let that stop you. If you're legitimately looking for work, that's what unemployment is there for.

3) Some people, maybe even your friends, may start talking to you like you're not doing your best. If they aren't giving you *constructive* criticism (ie if they aren't just talking to you with a ""You're being lazy"" tone), ignore them and keep working your hardest.

4) Stay busy. And I don't just mean ""play video games or watch movies all the time."" You won't be unemployed forever, use the enormous amount of free time that you have to do productive things now, while you can. Try starting a business if you have the money in savings (but of course, be wise!), try writing a book, or try using any of your talents/hobbies to make some money. If it doesn't end up making you any money in the long run, at least you were able to do something with your time that was productive. And, on top of that, you'll be able to (honestly) tell your interviewers that you've been doing something other than playing video games all day!"
uwlgv,1,2012-06-11,"Bosses that browse Reddit, I have a question for you all",thebakedone,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uwlgv/bosses_that_browse_reddit_i_have_a_question_for/,"I am a mechanical engineer intern at an automated assembly business.

The times that I have been given the opportunity to do the harder work, I worked diligently and I did a good job on all my projects.

So my question is, What would be a good way to approach my boss asking if I can be given more responsibilities? Or is that an inappropriate thing to do as an intern.

I'm a 21 year old guy about to enter my last year of college. I'm going for a degree in my school's fairly new IT program with a minor in English. Anyway, since I didn't land an internship this summer I've just been thinking about what will happen when I try and find a job in IT. Anyway, I have some questions:

1. If you work in IT, what do you do? Do you like your job?

2. What kind of things should I be searching for when looking for an IT job?

3. My program kind of exposes you to everything but doesn't make you a master of anything. For example, I just took a class on Python last semester, but it was mostly just basic stuff. Next semester I will take a class on Java but it will also be basic, as well as a basic database tech stuff, etc. Anyway, when I look at job postings I see a lot of people want someone who is a glorified computer programmer so how important is it to be really good at something like Java to get a job in IT?

4. Anything I can do to spice up my resume this summer?

Thanks for any help reddit."

Looking at the friends I've made since grade school, two of them just got married, a couple of them started their own business (Kinesiologist, records company, architectural firm, one of them even plays in a band that gets quite a lot of attention throughout Canada), all of them moved out of their parent's, and some of them are already out with real full time jobs (lawyer, doctor, engineers, IT, etc). I'm almost the only one that hasn't *made it out* yet and it's demotivating... I'm 25, I still have one year left in engineering, still live with my parents and I have no job. I've been trying the past few years to apply for internships or jobs but no one ever calls back and for a lack of a better word, I'm starting to feel like a loser, because I haven't accomplished anything... I can see in the way my parents talk at me and look at me that I'm nothing more than a disappointment. I really feel that my life up until now hasn't added up to anything meaningful yet. For instance, my dad when he was one year younger than me he already received his bachelors in engineering, and when he was my age, already had a house, car, was getting married to my mom, and next year he had his first kid.

Also, I'm the only one that time has not been kind with. Whereas all my friends look really great for their age, I'm the only one that took on 50 lbs since high school. Right now I'm training to lose weight to regain confidence and better shape, but still it doesn't change the fact that I always thought that I'd be further in my life by now...

I don't usually use this much language but Alan is a terrible human being. There isn't a classy way to express my distaste for him. I apologize if I offend you. 

Fuck you, Alan. Hard. Working with you these past 7 years has been terrible. You are a terrible co-worker and the entire organization thinks so. Do you know how hard it is to induce the scorn of nearly 300 employees? Pretty fucking hard, but you did it. 

What exactly is it that you do? I know that you lurk around our office like you think you are important, drifting into conversations like you have business there. You don't. We will let you know when something pertains to you. Promise. 

You float into meetings you aren't invited to and steal the extra lunches. Fuck you for that. I take those extra lunches downstairs to the interns, who can use all the help they can get since they are working for free, and Will, whose entire paycheck (nearly) goes to pay for medical treatment for his disabled child.Fuck you for taking their lunches when you make triple their salaries. What in the hell are you even doing at the meetings? You have been told repeatedly that you aren't to invite yourself to them but you still do. 

Our CEO is a man who loves to hand out second chances to you because you did that one spectacular thing 7 years ago when you first started. OMG, you totally brought us a supporter! I will admit that it was much needed . But when he turned his back on our organization four years ago because of you, you should have been fired. Now our non-profit is barely scraping by because you are too lazy to go out and do your actual job. You have one job, Alan. One fucking job. 

How dare you go into my office and log on to my computer when I wasn't there. You don't think I know. I do. Fuck you. You don't even work in my building. You work in the office across town. Why in the hell are you even over here? You didn't think I would reported you to HR, did you? I did. They were appalled. It is part of the reason you are under review now.

I recently got a lock installed on my office door. Good luck getting in now. What the hell were you looking for anyway? 

Also, fuck you for calling me repeatedly while I was on Maternity Leave for things that weren't emergencies. Debbie was fucking handling my stuff while I was out. You got the fucking email I sent out regarding it because you replied to it. I don't even deal with anything you would need to contact me about anyway! "" Do you have a copy of the report from last year?"", you said in one voice mail I received shortly after giving birth. No I don't fucking have a copy of the report from last year because I don't handle the reports. I don't fucking handle the reports. You aren't new. You know this. The second and third calls ( I was still in the hospital) about how the break room was out of paper towels was just fucking mean.  

Coming back after maternity leave to 200-something emails from you was wonderful. I didn't answer them because you don't need that information. It isn't even your job to know that information. 

Fuck you, Alan. Fuck you and how you take Carrie's parking spot when you visit our location even though you know she has to park there because of her recent surgery. She had fucking cancer, Alan.

Also, how dare you come to my baby work shower (that was after fucking hours) and eat the majority of my awesome cake. That was my cake. No one invited you. How do you even find out about it? You don't even work in our office. Did you just decide to stay until 7pm one day at the office you don't work at for some reason? You just stumbled into my closed office with that stupid look on your face and said, "" Er, look! Cake!"". Fuck you, Alan. I was pregnant and I was going to eat that cake. I said one piece, Alan. Not the whole rest of the cake.  

You really hurt Noah's feelings when you made fun of the way he speaks. He has a fucking speech impediment, you asshole. Not to mention you work for a fucking non-profit whose job it is to help people like Noah. 
   
Tomorrow you have a review with the Board and the CEO to determine whether the department you run is up to standards. I hope you fail. It sickens me to think that because the jobs of the individuals with disabilities who work at your location depends on your success, but I can't help but delight in the fact that you are failing. 

I will dance, Alan. I will dance and I will celebrate with cake - my cake, not yours- (quietly and alone) when they pull your expense records and find that you are mismanaging funds, and finally fire you.

Fuck you, Alan. 

You are the only thing I hate about my job.  

Edit: Thanks for the words of support and the sympathy anger, everybody! You are too wonderful. It is 8:04, my time (CENTRAL), and Alan just arrived for the meeting. My office is usually pretty quiet this early in the morning, but everyone is buzzing around conversat-ing about what is about to go down in that conference room. I will do a update post when I have the news. 

Again, thanks so much for all your comments!

uwhxz,25,2012-06-11,"I'm a hiring manager at a well-known non-profit, with lots of strong opinions about applications and the job search. Ask me about it!",robertgfthomas,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/uwhxz/im_a_hiring_manager_at_a_wellknown_nonprofit_with/,"I did an AMA a while ago, but I don't really want to answer questions about my penis size again. I'm happy, though, to answer any questions about the hiring process!

Please take my answers with a grain of salt, because every organization and business is different and looks for different things.

Off the bat, let me say that I see there being two main ways to market yourself to a potential employer: you can market your expertise in some particular skill or area of knowledge, OR you can market your individualism and personality.

You can try to market both personality AND expertise, but your résumé's only a page long and effectively making both of those come across in such a tight space is really, really difficult.

Instead, pick one, and commit to it like there's no tomorrow.

If you're applying to a job where you're going to be doing pretty mindless number-crunching all day, then the employer is going to want to see expertise over personality. If you have a BA in Accounting, really flesh out all the stuff you studied, and any practical experience you might have had. This isn't the place to say you were the star of your college's performance of 'Evita'. DO include a few things that paint an image of you as a human rather than a robot, but limit it to a line or two of ""hobbies/interests"" at the very bottom of your résumé.

On the other hand, it seems the vast majority of people on Reddit are 20-somethings who are fresh out of school. Odds are you've had a couple jobs here or there, took some relevant coursework, and were in a few clubs. (If you've already published a novel and you revolutionized Goldman Sachs' finance department while you were an intern there, then you probably don't need to be reading this because you already do what I'm talking about.)

Do NOT take the approach I see in 75% of the hundreds of applications I read every month and try to make your position as Publicity Chair of Alpha Beta Gamma or your summer job as stockboy in Walmart sound like something more than it was. 

You were NOT an Inventory Management Specialist; you were a stockboy. I was hired to this position in hiring because I sniff out bullshit like an Irish setter, just like every other hiring manager in the world. There is no shame in saying you were a stockboy. There IS shame in trying to disguise that fact, because it's basically lying to me.

So what the hell are you supposed to do?

My sister's an actress. Casting directors, like hiring managers, get those jobs because they're great at sniffing out bullshit. Most people when they go into an audition try to anticipate what the director wants. They think, ""OK, they're looking for someone funny, but not TOO funny, and someone whose voice sounds like this,"" and so on. Basically, they're trying to read the casting director's mind.

The problem here is that the casting director is human. This means a three things: 
First, they're looking at hundreds of auditionees that day most of whom are trying to be mind-readers and who are probably all going to assume more-or-less the same things — with the result that they'll all look exactly the same. 
Second, the director probably has a vague idea of what they're looking for, but they won't really know it until they see it. 
Third, the director really does NOT enjoy sitting through hundreds of auditions. They want the first person who walks across that stage to be IT. Second-best would be for every person auditioning to be at least be an easy ""yes"" or ""no"".

When you're auditioning — as with when you're applying to any job — don't assume you know who the director wants. You don't. Instead, think about who you already are. Think about a specific personality trait or style that is quintessentially You, and then just commit to that personality or style 100%.

Get a piece of paper or sit and stare at a wall and marinate in these two questions, until you get answers that are as specific as possible:

1) What are you doing when you're most ""in the zone""? What activity is the easiest for you to get lost in? ""Looking at cats on Reddit"" is a perfectly acceptable answer.

2) What are the things you're mildly ""obsessive compulsive"" about? For example, I HATE having unread e-mails and I HATE being around people who are giving each other the silent treatment, and I'm going to get really frustrated and anxious and worry about all that until I've done something about it.

Then, look for patterns in your answers. What you're going for are the behaviors that are most fundamentally and sustainably You.

Working for a non-profit, I see lots of people who ""just want to give back to the world."" That's very nice, but the reality is we're far more sustainably motivated by the things we DON'T like than by the things we DO like. You might really care about ending child poverty now, but your interests will probably change in the next year or two. However, if the concept of child poverty just drives you crazy to the point that you lie awake at night and worry about it and just want to solve it so you can get a good night's sleep — THAT would be appealing to me.

When you're writing your résumé, think about the things that you just don't have a choice but to do or to be because they're fundamentally who you are. They might not seem like strengths, but they're a tremendous asset in that those are most likely to be constant sources of energy. The things that drive you crazy now, or in which you can lose yourself now, will probably stay the same for a big part of the rest of your life.

As an employer, I want to see that. I don't want you to walk in wearing a banana costume — unless tense situations are one of the things that drive you crazy and you'll do anything to dispel them. If I'm looking for a technical editor, then sure, I might not hire you for the job — but I'll DEFINITELY, definitely remember you and feel much more of a connection to you, and since you showed me a clear picture of who you are — instead of a fuzzy picture of what you think I want — if I'm aware of something else that might match your style I'll be far more likely to refer you to it.

At any rate, I'm rambling.

TL;DR: You don't know how I think. So figure out how you think and commit to it 300%.

Ask away!"

uwecg,0,2012-06-11,Why is google giving me crappy search results?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uwecg/why_is_google_giving_me_crappy_search_results/,"Basically anything I search for is going to give me exactly what I wasn't looking for, no matter what I type, as if I somehow landed on the 500th page of search results instead of the 1st. Search for Carl Sagan, and his Wikipedia page, which you'd expect to be one of the first results, is nowhere to be found. In fact the Wiki for ""Carl Sagan Memorial Award"" comes up as one of the first results but not his actual Wiki, like I'm being trolled with mediocre/loosely relevant search results. Sometimes putting it in quotes works better, but not everything I search for is an exact term (e.g. ""cincinnati reds espn schedule,"" which yields something about a local Cincinnati sports intern, but no link to the Reds' schedule on ESPN as you'd expect from my reasonable search.) 

I've run various spyware/malware tests and I honestly don't think that's the problem. I've cleared cookies/etc., and on the left side of google it's seemingly set to the defaults (""any time,"" ""all results"") What the hell is going on?"
uwe8i,0,2012-06-11,Why is the world so slated against introverts? ,introvertedandscared,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uwe8i/why_is_the_world_so_slated_against_introverts/,"Regularly, people tell me that not having a job by 23 is pretty fucked. Quite a few have gotten angry with me, like I haven't followed the rules of growing up. One of my friends (thought we haven't spoken in months, she's one of the last people I've talked to) mocked me for a long time, talking about how my family pays for everything for me, I can't take care of myself, that I'm spoiled/lazy, etc. 

The truth is that a job or internship or whatever would require me to spend a lot of time out of my house and around people I don't know well. The idea of spending 8 hours somewhere I don't particularly want to be is so foreign. School has always been fine. I've always liked school, and not having social skills hasn't been a big deal. However, I'm told a lot that if I can't properly socialize, I'll never be able to ""fit in"" or whatever. Basically, why do I have to? Why isn't there a place (besides the eccentric old lady pile) for people like me? Being around other people makes me unhappy. How come the extroverts have taken over so thoroughly? How did you other introverts learn to deal with this bullshit? Becoming an extrovert (or at least faking it) seems crucial to most of adulthood, and I'm not sure I can do it. My introversion has kept me from getting any job related experiences (because if I can at all possible stay home, I will), and at this point, I've resigned myself to a life of poverty, feeling that no one will ever give someone so out of touch as myself a chance. Graduation is coming up, and I just can't make that leap into ""putting myself out there."" Help. Such despair and hopelessness can't be good for a girl my age. "

uwdr4,1,2012-06-11,Turning part-time offer into full-time?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/uwdr4/turning_parttime_offer_into_fulltime/,"I applied for a job at a consulting company in an industry I am really interested in. I got past the phone interview with HR and am going in for an in-person interview (most likely with the person I'll be working with/under)  in a couple days. 

I currently work part-time, 2-3 days a week, ~10-4 as an unpaid intern and the rest of the week, including weekends, work another job for ~$20/hr unrelated to what I want to make a career in. 

The internship I'm applying for is paid, part-time 20 hours/week. The HR person I spoke with over the phone said the position usually pays between $13-$16/hr. Even at $16/hr, 20 hrs/week isn't really enough to pay the bills alone. I really don't want to work my current paid $20/hr job at the same time as this new internship. 

How do I tell the company/convince them to take me on full time? Even $10/hr at 40 hrs/week would work for me.

The position lasts through the summer and when I asked the person on the phone today, the said it *may* be a *possibility* that it could become full time *later on*, but no promises. 

Any advice?

Addtl info: I have a BS in engineering, 3 months experience in this field from my current internship and 3.5 years other work experience in college."

I am just kind of wondering what sorts of things I am able to do in order to give myself a better chance at finding a decent job coming out of school. I know everyone hopes to find one after graduation and that may not happen for most, but what would help someone in order to at least have a good chance?

What I'd like to do as a career in the long-term would be to work in the gaming industry within the fields of either Communications, Public Relations, Marketing or anything else related to those.I would like to get into the actual game companies or even just gaming magazines as well. I'd love it. Technology was another thing that had caught my interest as well - computers, phones, hardware etc.

I have gotten into writing for a gaming website and I have been doing that since March. I also did a little writing as a Digital Marketing Intern for another company. I'd like to further my experience and skills so that I get a good start. I was also trying to think of ways to gain experience in regards to skills in web or graphic design or even programming a bit, because I feel that maybe that'd help.

A friend of mine mentioned to hand-write letters saying that I am interested in getting into this field and ask what sorts of things do they look for in a potential employee and just go from there. It'd show that you are dedicated and interested from what he had said. 

Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks!"

My supervisor has asked me to come up with a few ways that we can motivate and reward our operations staff. They really don't do much, and I don't know how to get them to do their job. Do any of you know of any good incentives that have worked for you, or that you have received that motivated you to do your job?
I really should specify more on what their job is. They have mostly janitorial and constructive responsibilities for the venue (stage set up and change over, etc.) I'm also looking for ideas other than monetary rewards. We can't afford to raise their pay."

I am writing to you today to offer my services. You see, I am in a bit of a spot, as so many of us are. I graduated two years ago from my beloved OSU with a Major in English Literature and a Minor in Women's Studies.

Unfortunately, I was sick for the last few months of my degree and failed to consider an internship or my after school employment. I have since moved back home with my parents, and have been half-surviving on odd jobs unrelated to my schooling. And that is how I have found myself here.

I need to have experience in order to have my resume looked at by employers. I didn't get that experience in college, so I have been trying to find freelance work. A lot of that freelance work also requires experience. What is a girl to do?

I am looking to break into the editing and/or publishing world. I have the beginnings of a keen eye which will only grow sharper with... you guessed it... experience. I read constantly (I carry a book in my purse at all times), am working through writer's block and I do the odd editing/proofreading/brainstorming job for my friends.

I have a passion for learning and personal growth. My time as a substitute teacher has taught me that, while I may be good at it, I am not cut out to be an educator long term. Literacy is very important to me as well and I think that it is something that has sadly fallen out of style. I would love the opportunity to put my talents to work at a great company with similar interests. The opportunity to help women grow and prosper would be a big bonus for me, but who am I to be picky in these times?

And so I shall conclude this letter by saying that I will gladly accept any constructive help. Maybe you would like to help me through networking with me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/connections?id=55823772). Maybe you have some sage advice, which I will consider even if I've heard it before. Maybe you are in the same boat as I am and would just like to talk and share some resources with me. And just maybe you are in HR at a company in the great city of Columbus, Ohio, and you would be willing to take some sort of chance with me by letting me get my foot in the door, even if it's just getting coffee and lunch for editors. I shall accept it all.

For one reason or another, I didn't do any internships, and wasn't very active my last two years.

Is there a way to get an internship without being in college? How do I get the one to two years of experience that companies are looking for without having done an internship?

My degree was in English Literature, and have started looking into freelance work, though I don't know how that will translate into relevant experience. I am looking to get into editing and publishing. Help!!"
uw207,0,2012-06-11,Good Morning Reddit! Does anyone know how much the base pay is for a Merrill Lynch GMO/MO position?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uw207/good_morning_reddit_does_anyone_know_how_much_the/,"There's someone I’m trying to encourage to apply to Merrill Lynch’s middle office finance position because I feel that he’s wasting a lot of his talent on his current position as a retail manager. 

Does anyone know an approximate base pay for back office finance? I asked my co-workers and they said 40K, my internship is a projected 45k and online it’s between 57k so I don't really know what to tell him. I think the base pay maybe on the lower end of things, but I’d like a better answer from someone who’s actually in back office/middle office finance. 

And ... if you have any advise I can tell him about back office, I'd love your input. You may not think back office is the best place to be career wise (some people think is a dead end), but in commparisoin to being a retail manager, trust me that it is. 

Thanks so much!"

uvynr,1,2012-06-11,How do I reach black boys?,AnthonyZarat,racism,https://www.reddit.com/r/racism/comments/uvynr/how_do_i_reach_black_boys/,"Sorry for the stereotypes and generalizations.  I am too tired to find a polite way to say things.

I run a workshop on Long Island that introduces high school children to science.  The community is racially and ethnically divided, and consequently some of the schools I work with are 90% minority (eg Freeport High School).

Observations:

1) Hispaic boys and hispanic girls are highly respectful of authority, and respond enthusiastically to opportunity.

2) Black girls home-in on opportunity like a laser.  I get the attention of black girls easily the moment I show them ""careers in innovation: roadmap to success"" slide.  They don't walk, they JUMP at things like laboratory internships and various science competitions.

3) Black boys are out of reach.  It is like there is a glass wall between us.  The more I tell them about opportunity, the more hostile they become.  By the end of the workshop, some black boys will throw things (eg tic-tacs) at me when I turn my back. 

What is happening with black boys?  How can I reach them?  Why does the message ""look at all these opportunities for YOU"" make black boys so angry and hostile?

Again, sorry for generalizations.  I had a 10 person group on Saturday, and it fell apart badly.  I hate it that I feel dread when I see a black boy step off the school bus."

I have been accepted for MS in CS this Fall. 

I don't have plans on continuing to do PhD, as of now. I plan on cruising through my MS - working hard, keeping my grades up throughout, try to get a good internship and eventually taking up a good job, that pays around $70-75k atleast or more. 

I want to know if I am taking the right step ? How were the internship and jobs offered to the graduating class of 2012 ? Are the grad students happy generally about their placements ? What is the median salary package offered to an MS grad ? 

thanks guys! looking forward to joining here!

uvssa,1,2012-06-11,In what unexpected way did you end up meeting and dating/marrying your SO despite the odds?,fbea,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uvssa/in_what_unexpected_way_did_you_end_up_meeting_and/,"I'll go first. I met my girlfriend while working at a fashion internship with a start-up fashion site. She and I were both interns at the company. This was my first internship ever and wanted to impress so I would typically walk into the office dressed in skinny jeans, a tight dress shirt, dress shoes and the whole nine yards so that I'd ""fit in"" as a fashionable guy. My girlfriend didn't quite dress particularly in feminine clothing at the time, but rather chose to wear t-shirts and boy shirts (not fashionable at the time), which I understand the reasoning for now that I think about it. Our job was to interview people on the streets and hand out promotional material (essentially bitch work), and seeing as how our job required us to walk about 20 miles a day from one end of the city to the other looking for stylish people while baking under the sun. Gf was smart to wear comfortable clothing. I on the other hand was not as bright (pun intended).

More than half the other male interns were gay, so my girlfriend assumed that I was gay. I can't blame her considering that I was painting a mannequin's fingernails during a marketing project, which was part of an idea that I was responsible for having come up with. For some reason or another, I thought my girlfriend was lesbian. Two months of the three month-long internship passed and we didn't think much of each other. Apparently she didn't quite like me at the time and I shared the same sentiment. We may have butted heads a few times during projects. It ended up that in the final month, myself, and my girlfriend were the only ones left working on the mannequin project. The other interns had dropped out. Every day my girlfriend and I would walk around New York City with a mannequin in tote. We'd take pictures and coming up with story lines for a page that would go on the website. Eventually, we became friendly because we'd end up talking every day and we'd chat via text about work and non-work related stuff. During this month I began to develop feelings for her when I began to realize that she wasn't a lesbian after all. We'd take long walks around the city, and on several occasions she talked about the guys she dated in the past and was into. Funny enough, she (she's Asian) explicitly mentioned that she had only dated white guys, and here I was a socially awkward virgin Korean American guy who had never had a legitimate girlfriend (I've had teenage flings), trying to figure out if she liked me. All signs pointed to NOPE, but I was hopeful. I asked my friends, painted a picture to them of the situation where she was calling me ""dude,"" despite spending quite a significant amount of time with me, and every single one told me that she wasn't interested in me. I then in my final effort asked one last friend, who told me that my yet-to-be-gf seemed to be interested in me. Not sure why she came to that conclusion honestly, but it was good enough for me. 

The last day of the internship, my yet-to-be gf and I hung out till the wee hours. We decided to say our goodbyes, walked into the subway station, was about to swipe my Metro card, when I said fuck it. I was extremely nervous and socially awkward as fuck, but asked her if she wanted to grab drinks. I was one month into my 20th year of life at the time and toted around an obviously fake and blurry international ID card, but I thought to myself, hey, why not? I was naive and look like a 14 year old (I'm turning 24 and I still get carded for purchasing lottery tickets), and the thought that I'd get rejected with my ID never crossed my mind. I went to one place that a couple of older friends had told me about. I presented my ID to the bouncer at the door and he laughed at me. My girlfriend was two years older than me so she had no issues. I stood my ground telling them I was 21, which was obviously a lie, and the bouncer decided to call a manager down. The manager took my card, looked at me, looked at my fake ID, looked at my girlfriend, looked at me, looked at my girlfriend, and then handed the card back to me. He waved us in. In 99% of cases I'd never allow a minor into a bar myself, but I'm going to be a hypocrite and say that I'm forever grateful to that guy for letting me in. To my hypocritical defense I also did shell out a decent chunk of change that night. My yet-to-be-gf and I chatted about life, love and got drunk that night. We left the lounge buzzed, and while we're walking and my brain couldn't formulate rational thoughts, I thought to myself, FUCK IT (for the second time). I asked her if she wanted to be my gf. She said that's nice, but unlikely. She was going back to college in the East Coast and I'd be back to college in the Midwest. Of course I didn't think that part through. It was pretty awkward for about 2 minutes while walking silently next to each other. Then a third FUCK IT moment came to me thanks to alcohol (and no I don't condone underage drinking, but I'm going to have to be a hypocrite here). We ended up waiting for the light to turn green on a corner while cabs and people were whizzing by, and I mustered up the courage to take her in my arms and kiss her like I had watched in the chick flicks (I dipped her and everything). 

We kissed for a while, and eventually she invited me to her place, where I finally lost my v-card. I GFed her that night.

We decided to undertake a long distance relationship for almost 2.5 years, and after my graduation I lived with her for about 6 months. She actually recently moved overseas for a job, while I'm working in the states, so we're going through another long distance relationship, but I think we're managing. Of course it's not easy.

**T(fucking)LDR; Met gf at internship. Gf thought I was gay, and I thought she was lesbian. Worked on long project, got to know her better, I was socially awkward as fuck so I didn't know if she liked me. Decided to listen to the only friend who said my yet-to-be-gf liked me. Final day, despite my shitty fake ID, I was accepted into a lounge where I got drunk, got enough liquid courage to ask her out (twice kind of), and I lost my v-card. Now she has been my gf for nearly 4 years**

Any one else have any fun stories with meeting their SO despite the odds?"

I'm a film major who signed on to a year long lease on an apartment in the beginning of the year but now I'm going to LA for the summer for internships. If I can't find someone to live in my space here at University Crossings, I'll be paying rent in LA and in Philly and that will suck.

Rent is $589 a month, but I realize that's a lot so I'm willing to make a deal. Agree to live here for summer semester and I will give you $400 in cash, effectively bringing rent to $389 a month. If this is still too high, I'm willing to make a deal.

Let me know if you're the least bit interested or if you know anyone. I've been all over Craigslist and Facebook but everyone who expressed interest disappeared.

I have been trying to find out as much as possible from the MCC alumni webpage and career options online, but they don’t seem to really show what MCC grads go on to do. I saw a post from one alumni who credited her MCC degree and internship experience in getting her dream job working for the WWE corporation. Recently, I have heard opinions from people saying that there is not much of a job market for communication majors and the jobs available are very menial and far from ones expectations. A lot of people seem to think that communications is a ‘fluff’ major and not one that will land a decent job. I have always dreamed of being able to work for a big media corporation and see NYU as the perfect place to attempt to achieve this, and I just wanted to know your opinion on what jobs realistically available to MCC graduates. I see all these great sounding internships on the department site, but I was wondering how hard it is to actually get accepted into these internships. Also, is it actually realistic to get a good internship with a good company and then get hired by them or a similar corporation? I just don’t want to have these huge expectations about how my future job might be and then graduate with a communications/media degree and barely make a living. Do you know MCC grads that have gone on to be fairly successful in the field? Sorry for the long post but I wanted to be thorough with what I am asking. Thanks your advice and thoughts are greatly appreciated! "

I got my tickets after skyping with her for the first time (because she is just as adorable as I remembered, and up until that point I was on the fence, and she gave me that extra push). But, we don't talk very often. We never really talked before I got the tickets, but afterwards it seems like I'm an afterthought. And I'm not that girl who needs constant texts all day every day, phone calls, and a shit ton of skype dates. It sometimes makes me feel like she's not that interested, and I can't tell if I'm just blinded by infatuation. If we ever talk, it's because I initiate the convo. But when we do talk, it's still flirtatious and I get butterflies. I want to somehow bring this up, but idk how to do that without sounding crazy needy. I just love talking to her, even if it is for a little while. I know that she is busy with her internship, but I guess I've always been the type of person to make time for someone I care about, and not simply think of them when I'm not busy doing other things. I have work, obligations, and distractions also. I don't wanna sound like some girl whining because I have nothing to do and my crush doesn't have time for me. It would just be nice to get random texts sometimes to know that she's thinking of me. Is that bad?

tl;dr: bought tickets to fly to DC to visit crush, but crush is sucktastic in the communication department after knowing I got tickets, and idk how to fix it, or if I can."

It all started with me slowly coming to terms with the fact that everything I was doing in my life was a sham. In reality, I had virtually little to no interest in finance. The mere fact that I wanted to do it for money made me despise who I was and who I was becoming. The pressure brought on by others such as my parents to ""Get my head together"" hardly helped. By the end of the year my GPA dropped to a 3.5 and I had no internship. With my credentials I could have received an elite internship but I didn't apply to a single one. Currently I am without any internship, still with money left over from my last summer of working, but without direction. I would love to start my own business, but I have no idea in what. Also, I don't really have any particular skills, such as computer skills, where I can use to help me in being self-employed. My ONLY passion in life is soccer but I'm struggling to think about what I can do with that and make a living off of.
Most of the time I'm happy I didn't take an internship I don't want, and sometimes the fact that I could be making plenty of money right now gets me down. I feel like I let my parents down and that one is tough to deal with. I think I'm more upset at their way of thinking more than the fact that they're upset with me. My parents are very simple people that immigrated here from Europe and I think they became disillusioned when their ""Star son"", whom they told everyone back home great stories about, was second guessing school and a promising future in banking. It's tough to deal with that.
In comparison to contemporary teens/young-adults obsessed with having ""things"" I don't care too much for money. I enjoy nice clothes, and stuff like that, but I can get by with very little money and be pretty content. When people found out the opportunities I passed up they said ""Damn, but think of all that money!"". Most of me thought, ""Who the fuck cares if I'd be miserable/ have no time to spend it?"", but a part of me said ""Yeah, shit, that would be nice, huh?""
I also detest when people tell me ""Hey, everyone hates their jobs!"" But why? Why does everyone have to hate their jobs? If we have only one life, why do so many people subject themselves to that? I know many grab any chance they get because some people need work to survive but why do so many people, such as those in my shoes (with so many opportunities) subject themselves to a job, for money, they know they're later going to hate? It's so ridiculous/pathetic/depressing.
I realize life is far too short to do something I hate and to follow a boring life. I also realize I'm still in a situation where I can hopefully change all of that, so if anyone can give me advice, whether it be things you've personally done in a similar situation, or ANYTHING, please share.

I'm making the most of it by getting outstanding grades, involved on campus, and meeting intellectual professors and students, but I can't help but still feel in love with the schools I was rejected from. I tried transferring and thankfully got accepted, but because I'd be entering in as a transfer, I didn't receive any financial aid and therefore had to stay at my current school. I'll be a junior this fall and although I have made every effort to like this school, it just isn't working. Graduate school is always an option but I still feel like I'm missing out on valuable resources that undergraduates are offered that my shitty school doesn't provide such as a great alumni network, school-specific internships and study abroad programs, etc. my school literally lacks all of that."

My degree is in engineering but I am working as a technician atm. I have been doing very good work which I feel has been over looked for the past year. Because of my degree I am able to do the work of an engineer and the technician which makes me twice as productive at times. However I feel my boss does not see this. I have been working twice as hard as many of my coworkers so I was given a really tough project. In the year I have been making big strides on the project which has brought its completion to realization. I feel that my boss is not letting me leave my position now because of the work I did for this project. ( Because I am more valuable where I am than someplace else.) However because of that I am not given the opportunity to progress my career. So I missed out on this years intern program because my boss wants to keep me on this project. Now I have absolutely no chance to move from my position at this company because I missed out on the opportunity to become an intern and get an entry level position. What should I do to help my boss see that I should get an entry level job there. Or should I just look to leave?

I recently got a position as a systems operations intern and I start on the 18th, after finals week. I'm very excited, I love the environment and the people I'm going to work with seem awesome. However, I feel like I don't know enough as this is going to be my first sysadmin-related experience as an EE student with some CS background. They assured me during my interview that I shouldn't be too worried and that they would be training me, but I want to be a little prepared.

I have a couple of questions, hope you don't mind me asking. I've been poking around this subreddit for general intern info and also to immerse myself, even if I don't understand 90% of the terms used. I just google to get an idea. All I know is that I don't know anything, but I'm willing to learn in time.

1. What's the difference between systems operations and sysadmin? Random question, but I've been looking it up and I haven't found a clear answer. Just wondering.
2. What do you consider to be a valuable skill/trait that a sysop intern should learn?
3. Any good books/tutorials you can recommend?
4. If I were your intern, what's the best piece of advise you can give me about this field?

I know I'm going to be doing a lot of googling throughout, but I would appreciate it if I could get some direction on where to start looking. I've recently picked up [Essential System Administration](http://www.amazon.com/Essential-System-Administration-Third-Edition/dp/0596003439) and I'm reading through this chapter called ""Filesystems and Disks"" since my job states that I'm going to be doing data migration. Something they mentioned that would be useful to have knowledge on is RAID, which I've read up a little on.

Not only will it give you practice in clarity and conciseness, but it will also make this reader happy!""

Here's what I had:


**About the Guide**

*Content*
This guide contains an array of Internet resources for starting Penn State architectural engineers to use when in need of information. In it, databases, websites, and journals are presented along with an abstract to make it more comprehensive. Tips are also provided to make it more user-friendly. 

*Audience and Assumptions*
This guide has been tailored for starting architectural engineers and architecturally-oriented civil engineers attending Penn State University. More specifically, this guide is for junior and sophomore-year architectural engineering majors who might need research for internship, projects, or planning for their major. It is expected the user to have basic engineering mechanic knowledge to use this guide.

*Arrangement*
This guide is arranged following the following structure: degree-concerns and research. Since websites usually aren’t used for research-intensive purposes, they will be provided for degree-concerns. Under research, government publications, journals, and databases will be provided. First, government publications and journals will be presented, as these are usually first stops, and finally database, in the event that more research is needed.

*Tips for Using the Guide*
This guide covers degree issues to researching for project or internship purposes. It is arranged in a way where degree-issues are first, and research is second. If you only want to research your curriculum, go to the website section first. Otherwise, if researching, go to the government publications and further. Use the description and tips provided for further understanding of each resource.


I don't think it would make sense to write all of that in **1** paragraph, since the things I need to cover wouldn't flow too well. But I did try putting it all into one single text (instead of divided by sections).

Here's what I wrote:

uypff,0,2012-06-12,Parsing an XML properties file with Java,brandnewaquarium,java,https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/uypff/parsing_an_xml_properties_file_with_java/,"I'm currently at my first internship, and I've been fighting with a new project.  The other developer I was working with got pulled onto other things, so I thought maybe this would be helpful.

I want to parse an XML document using Java.  The purpose of this application would be to create a very basic in-house file archiver. 

Structure of XML Document:
http://pastebin.com/6tyj8LsD

So, the ""special properties"" for the sub directories would be able to have all of the same properties as any other directory, but they wouldn't necessarily be REQUIRED.  Instead, we would have the parent directory overwrite any unstated properties for the subdirectory.  Normally, the only thing to be overwritten would be the archive location, though occasionally we may want to add a file to be ommitted or limit the amount of time for the subdirectory to be worked in.

Breakdown:
* Each directory will have its own thread from a threadpool.

* Each thread will be fed from one main function.  Basically, I'd like to have each thread be spawned per &lt;directory&gt; tag.

* But how to parse the XML document?  I've so far tried doing this recursively, but recursion isn't something I'm very well practiced at.  Should I be parsing the XML document into a NodeList or a CopyOnWriteArrayList?

* How would I pass each collection to the thread?  I never learned very much about collections in school, but I've heard things like map and hash thrown around.

* What kind of collection would be best for this type of tree?

* I'm a little but unsure of how I should be handling the XML document.  Should I be using SAX or XOM or DOM?  I'm not even entirely sure of how to use any of them - perhaps an example?

* Any other useful references, or stuff I should be aware of?"

Around 3 years ago, I moved from the midwest to NYC in order to pursue a career in a field that I was passionate about. I went to school and right after, landed an internship at what is probably the most famous venue for this field in the country, some might argue the world. The place where I work is incredibly historical important in its context and I know for a fact, without hyperbole and not attempting to brag, that there are redditors that would be absolutely flabbergasted at just the opportunity to set foot inside, as we're open to the public. In the last two years I've worked there, I've had the opportunity to be around the absolute best in the business, people that are household names and people whose work is encountered almost on a daily basis by the majority of people in this country, not just people in the industry. It has been, honestly, the most amazing experience of my entire life. It's been incredibly challenging and incredibly rewarding.

It's hard to quantify all the energy and time I've put into this place. I've cancelled too many plans to count, taken my relationship with my girlfriend to near its breaking point many times, disappointed countless people in my life and missed out on who knows how many other opportunies because I've put everything I've had into this place. We're essentially on-call 24 hours a day. Each time the phone rings or I get a text, any text, or an email, my heart drops because I'm afraid it's something from work, asking me to come in immediately. When I was first hired (also, bear in mind that the first 6-8 months of my time there was an unpaid internship), I was made promises about several opportunities for advancement that still have yet to materialize. And now it seems that I'm being passed over for people with less seniority, who have been sneaky and selfish to secure those opportunities. Not only can I not be that sort of people, I can't bring myself to work with them and maintain any self respect. I'm tired of constantly being on call, I'm tired of not having time to have a personal life or a second job, yet still only logging 20 hours a week at minimum wage in one of the most expensive cities in the country. I'm tired of being scared every time my phone buzzes that I might have to cancel plans to go into work or that I'm getting yelled at for something trivial or that I had no control over. And even if those opportunities do present themselves, I'm not sure that I even want them anymore. At almost 30, working even more hours for only marginally less pay just to have some industry recognition doesn't necessarily seem all that important to me anymore.

So I'm really struggling with the idea that this place is at absolutely the top of the industry and before I even considered moving or changing careers, it had already played a big part in my life. And now I get to be there all the time, get to have conversations with people that I idolized growing up, get to be friends with people that others put posters of in their bedrooms, get to see the best in the business. But I'm not happy with it at all and I think I might be insane for wanting to leave and move on to something else. I'm insane, right?

**(WAY) TL;DR - I work at my dream job at the top of my industry but I want to quit. That's nuts, right?**"

I have always loved listening to music, especially thumpin' some songs with great beats over a great car audio sound system with friends or just driving.


anyways, I just got my first car pretty recently, a [1994 Toyota 4runner](http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1990-to-1995-toyota-4runner-6.htm) that [looks somethin like this](http://www.google.com/imgres?q=1994+gold+toyota+4runner&amp;um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=N&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=775&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=lAeOhpYekascNM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.expeditionportal.com/forum/threads/73331-94-4-Runner-Build-newb-thread&amp;docid=t5lTJXNLC7adQM&amp;imgurl=http://a8.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/421988_241147235966333_100002131760963_534983_107055691_n&amp;w=960&amp;h=720&amp;ei=X57XT-vQDaP42QXVp9iFDw&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=1148&amp;vpy=433&amp;dur=282&amp;hovh=144&amp;hovw=194&amp;tx=119&amp;ty=75&amp;sig=103651068722960306348&amp;page=2&amp;tbnh=135&amp;tbnw=182&amp;start=25&amp;ndsp=30&amp;ved=1t:429,r:11,s:25,i:189). I love her so far. Her name is Roxanne. She needs some work and some love, but I want to fix her up (not only with engine work but also with my audio).

I'm pretty positive the front speakers are blown, but that's alright because I was probably going to replace them regardless. the problem with those is that they are in the dash, so if I install them myself I'm guessing it won't be easy. just judging from the size I believe the front speakers are 4"" speakers. I would also like to put subs in the back, most likely two 12 inchers. I've done some research over what brands are better than others, but I figured it would be pretty helpful to figure out what I would like to do on here. basically I'm looking to get a new stereo deck, front speakers, subs in the back (I have plenty of room), and an amp if it's going to help. I would like to spend enough on this system that I can keep it and place it in the next car I own (probably after college if this 4runner will last me).

Another note: I have a company car, a [2010 Chevy Tahoe](http://www.google.com/imgres?q=2010+chevy+tahoe+ltz&amp;num=10&amp;um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=775&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=shPT4Z3TjIBxoM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://beautycarsden.blogspot.com/2010/02/2010-chevy-tahoe-ltz-suv-pictures-and.html&amp;docid=Fmj_E8ycuT-d2M&amp;imgurl=http://assets.clickmotive.com/ail/stills_white_0640/4484/4484_st0640_046.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=480&amp;ei=tp7XT4n9Foui8ASl5bG2Aw&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=rc&amp;dur=324&amp;sig=103651068722960306348&amp;sqi=2&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=117&amp;tbnw=156&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=28&amp;ved=1t:429,r:1,s:0,i:115&amp;tx=110&amp;ty=62), that I get to use all summer and I will be driving around a lot in (hour long drives at a time). it's a hell of a fun drive, it already has a built in Bose system (I know I know Bose, everyone hates Bose) which has a pretty good sound, good bass too when I crank it up. it's pretty crisp, and it would really thump with some subs in it. if I'm going to do a lot of driving in this Tahoe over this summer, so I figure it's worth looking into buying subs and installing them in this Tahoe, and then moving them into my 4runner at the end of the summer. if this is indeed feasible, let me know. it would be awesome to do, but if it's too complicated let me know. I also realize that the 'runner will have different power outputs than a pretty new Tahoe, and I feel like that's what I would have to worry about most.
so yeah, I appreciate any and all help / advice I can get from you guys.

**tl;dr** I own a '94 Toyota 4runner that I'm looking to trick out my audio for, and I'm entertaining the idea of putting subs temporarily in my Tahoe.

He works about 2 days a week and goes to school for, I'm assuming, the rest of it. But he still has time to clock in amazing hours on games. 150 on Mass Effect 2; 500 + on Skyrim; 200 + on Fallout: NV; and a few others he mentioned. But they were *all* above 100 hours.

Obviously, there comes a point in a gamer's time with a game that they get tired of it. He is *sick to death* of New Vegas. And undoubtedly so. I haven't even passed 60 hours on it, yet. And I've had it for almost eight months (it was a gift from the wife around Thanksgiving last year). I'm still loving it and I haven't found that much to dislike about it. However, he has (along with the other games, too) and he went into great, nitpicking detail about it and began bashing the developers for the little things.

My question is: does playing a game less help you enjoy it more for what it is?"

I was a senior in college.  I had just gotten done with the internship of a lifetime, saved a massive amount of loot and decided to put a high fidelity audio system in my 2003 2 door Honda civic.  

During the selection process I had decided from reviews and from friends experiences to go Alpine for everything.  I was not interested in pounding bass from a subwoofer but sought incredible ear splitting quality. 

My set up was awesome.  
[Alpine CDA-9887](http://www.alpine-usa.com/product/view/cda-9887/)
[SPR-60C](http://www.alpine-usa.com/product/view/spr-60c) front speakers
[SPR-69](http://www.alpine-usa.com/product/view/spr-69) rear speakers
[PDX-F4](http://www.alpine-usa.com/product/view/pdx-f4) Four Channel Amp 
I took full advantage of the imprint system with this [KTX-100EQ](http://www.alpine-usa.com/product/view/ktx-100eq-1/)

I had it professionally installed and I definetly spent a pretty penny on the set up.  I did the imprint system myself and LOVED it.  I am sure some hearing damage resulted but what can you expect.  The clarity was incredible and I had an awesome time with the system.  REALLY obvious discrepencies in quality between CDs and iPod connections.  I absolutely loved that head unit and was tickled pink.

Anywhoo to the sad part.  I was woken up on the morning after my birthday, to a police officer knocking on the door of my apartment.  Panick instantly set in. *What did I do last night that I don't remember?* After answering the door I learned he was there because my car had been broken into early that morning.  This was a despicable smash and grab theft.  They smashed the window, ripped out not just my deck but the whole center console/climate controls.  They ripped the wires out of my amp but thankfully they did not have the correct screwdriver to remove the amp from my trunk mat.  To top it off I lived in Michigan and my birthday is in January, my car has a smashed window and I could not even turn on the heat.  

That was a sad sad day.

Both offers felt a bit underwhelming on the salary side but I can feed myself and still afford entertainment on it and that's all that really matters.

I sent in the first application and just got an email asking me to send in a few addendum forms. The reference verification sheet is saying that my work-experience reference can't be a professor unless they were in charge of an internship. I had a professor fill out a reference sheet because, frankly, I didn't know who else to have do it originally and didn't realize it wouldn't be acceptable. He was the professor of a capstone class, meaning there were only 10 students in this particular class and he worked very closely with each of us for the semester. 

I've only had one job so far during my junior year of college, and since then my two managers have moved on to different jobs and I don't have contact information for them. I didn't take on any other internships because I was a chair for my GLO and I was teaching ESL two to three nights a week. The supervisor from my ESL teaching is who I had fill out my volunteer form.

So what can I do? I know I can go back and delete his recommendation and send a new one, but I'm at a loss as to who to submit. Please, if someone could give me a little advice I would really appreciate it. I want this so badly!

EDIT: I should also mention that I just recently got another job -- retail, something to pay the bills -- but it doesn't even start until this Friday and I need to submit my recommendation verification form by the 25th.

(Throwaway used)",TossedAwayForReal,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/uy56x/27m_i_really_feel_like_im_taking_a_risk_here_but/,"What I mean by taking a risk is that there is a new intern that got hired where I work. She's going into her last year of college this coming fall so I assume she’s around 21 or 22. I've been in plenty of relationships, just never one where I met the person at work. I work in IT and I setup her PC and made some smalltalk. I took my sweet time because I was really attracted to her. I guess you could say we  ""hit it off"" (IT Crowd fans: It means she kept talking to me after I'd fixed her computer) but I couldn't really tell if she was being flirtatious or just friendly. I pretty much just asked things to get to know her like: ""Where do you go to college?"" ""What's it like so far up here?""  ""Where are you staying while up here?"" ""Do you travel home on the weekends?"" etc. She smiled as I asked away and didn't really ask me anything back. After the couple minutes of conversing she says ""thanks for your help"" and we go about our work and business. 

I then get to see her again because she had some general questions and just wanted some things setup on her desktop. She asks me about a home internet question and of course I give my best answer. I catch her looking at my junk and then she looks up in my eyes. I'd imagine that's a good sign, you ladies will have to help me on that one. I then just talk a little bit more about anything I can possibly think of. I ask her how it's been again so far, now that she's been here for two more weeks. I learn a little bit more about her. She seems to like being outdoors and  she said that she reads a lot. We start discussing bicycles and I talk a little bit about mine  and she seems interested in what I'm saying. Once again, smiling, and once again she thanks me for my help and sends me on my way. She seems to keep pretty good eye contact with me as well.

So far these have been my only interactions with her and I'm trying to be as detailed about it as possible. Naturally, I'm scared to death to ask her out. My biggest fear when asking a girl out is that they are already taken, it just makes me feel weird for some reason. I also don't want any awkwardness at work if she says no for one reason or another. I'm the only IT support in her area so I have to face her if she needs anything and I was never good at interacting with females that reject me.

What I want to accomplish is finding out if she's already in a relationship. Is there anyway to  figure this out without sounding awkward or making it obvious I'm trying to find out? She has no  personal photos at her desk, and doesn't wear any rings at all. That's about the best detective work I could do. If I can get that far, what would be the most appropriate way to ask to do something outside of work? She lives by herself while interning and I'm sure she would like some social interaction and a friend. I don't wanna ask her out right away anyway, I really want to get to know her first and be friendly and do friendly things and take it from there. 

TL;DR: I’m interested in an intern at work, and want to find out if she’s available and how to ask her to hang out.

Any advice would be nice! :) Feel free to AMA as well.


EDIT: Thank you everyone. I'm extremely thankful for all the advice! I'm concluding that I will just let this one go. I'm in a ""career"" more so than a job, so I want to keep everything as clean and rumor free as possible, even if it's just an intern. Other office workers know about how some people talk, so I feel I'm good. If she asks me out, maybe I'll try it, but I don't wanna be the weirdo that tries to get with coworkers. As I stated, I have no experience with dating coworkers and for a damn good reason it seems. I always felt it was a bad idea, but this girl was really different and special to me. There will be many more outside of work. Once again, Thank You :) "

I was stupid enough not to go for really competitive internships during school and did one only where my dad worked which didn't really help much with finding a job after college.

Anyway, now I got this job basically as a LAMP developer (having come out of college knowing Java/C++) with a salary of 45k. It's a very crappy salary, and it's slightly depressing especially knowing a couple of friends are working in Apple and Goldman Sachs making over 90K straight out of school. I live in the NYC area as well, so I know for a fact that this salary is crap for where I live.

The thing is, I know for a fact that I'm worth more, but I am honestly learning a lot in this company, and we are at a phase where we are building a new product from scratch which is actually pretty exciting. I've built custom frameworks using various libraries and basically learned more about web programming in 3-4 months than I have my whole college career. 

My development to maintenance ratio is probably 9:1 which is the best part. The environment is also very relaxed, and we joke around a lot. But there are also days where I have to stay late and get work done, although it's relatively rare. 

The job is great, the only problem is this awful salary. Should I stick it out and suck the company/developers around me for all of their knowledge and then switch? Or should I wait another month or two and try to ask for a raise? Any other tips would be appreciated as well (or similar situations/stories and how you guys have handled them)

The only problem is I really don't see a future of us, its sort of reaching a point where its becoming leaning towards futures together and becoming more serious which I really just don't want to think about right now. The word ""love"" was thrown around pretty early and I know she feels more deeply about me then I feel about her.

I feel like by staying in a relationship longer is honestly leading her on because I don't really see too much a future while she does. But there's nothing really wrong with out relationship at all. She's a great girl and I wish the best for her, but I just don't know how to break up with her.

And to make matters worse, we work at the same company, same department in an internship over the summer, which she got for me. I just don't know how to break up.

:--|:--
[What's your favorite DAW and why?  - Any preferred VST's? - Did you have experience in music before going electronic?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zbop6?context=5)|I use Logic Pro to produce and Ableton to DJ. As of lately though, ive been working on a lot of collabs with other artist that use Live. Its starting to grow on me. I like the how certain features get right to the point like tossing in audio and being able to transpose/stretch/manipulate it in seconds, when in logic there are other steps you can take to do the same results but I cant do them as quickly. Ableton seems like it has a better work flow in my opinion. That could be just me though. Ive always used Logic so its just what I use. I work quickly in it, I like the built in effects (maybe just because I have used them for so long). It works for me. I like to tell people though that its not the DAW that you use that matters, they all do essentially the same thing, Its how just you use it.
 |Ive always been a big fan of Native Instruments (obviously Massive). I have a whole arsenal of vst/au's. I guess it depends on the track im writing what vst I use though.
 |Ive loves music my whole life. I listen to basically everything. When I was younger around high school I started playing guitar and that became my main instrument that I played. Ive always been self taught on everything I know. When I made the jump to electronic music, I had to use my guitar to help teach myself Logic. I didnt know how to play keys yet, so I would use guitar to play the riffs and learn how to program drums behind them. Slowly I taught myself how to play the keys and keep progressing at the programming at the same time. 
[Ooh, another Logic user! Do you use any of the built-in instruments that come with the software? If so, what are your favorites?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4znyw9?context=5)|I honestly dont but should... They are crazy good!
 |I use a lot of the built in effects though. Delays, Reverbs, EQs, Compressors, ect...
[Bounce to audio vs. keep it as midi?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4znjk8?context=5)|You should bounce to audio. It sounds better.. but I have some bad habits when producing... :/
[I don't really bother buying a lot of VST's so most of my stuff is made with built-in instruments. Still sounds pretty good for the most part.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c50awft?context=5)|The thing that took me the longest to learn. That it doesnt matter what synths you have, the all do the same thing (depending on the synthesis). Some are just flashier then other or might have different features that set them apart. 
[What got you into making/producing dubstep?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zbo3p?context=5)|Ive always like melodic experimental styles of electronic music like Aphex Twin, Venetian Snares, Telefon Tel Aviv, Wisp (I can list for days). Before I was producing my brothers best friend was a psychtrance producer named Torin. Hes been a family friend since I was a kid. Hes a well known producer that goes by Bird Of Prey now making his own unique style of bass music. Im very proud to know him, hes an amazing person. So I saw him doing his thing and thought I would give it a shot. I started producing experimental music just for fun as a hobby.Then I started going out with friends to underground parties where they were playing dubstep. It incorporated all the elements of heavy bass and aggressiveness that I liked. I was hooked. I figured I would take a shot at it. I didnt understand how to produce those sounds, so I sucked pretty bad at first. Then Torin invited me to go to my first festival in late 09' called Symbiosis. He was playing. It was pure inspiration to see him on stage in front of all those people. I decided right there that this is what I wanted to do. When I got home I just started writing and pushing myself to progress. From there it was really intense how fast my music got out to people. It was mostly word to mouth through Soundcloud and blogs but people took notice. It was surreal to see how my music resinated with people. I guess the rest is history leading to this point.
[Any tips you have for me, because im a fan of dubstep/hardstyle and would like to start making some tunes so any advice would be great.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zcesk?context=5)|Put as much time as you can in the studio. I got to where I am not by reading tutorials but by sitting there and understanding how everything works. Thats how you develope your own style. There are to many producers out there that just copy the same sound design of someone that has already done it. Find your own sound and never give up.
[While we're on the subject, favorite TTA album and/or song?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zchvx?context=5)|Fahrenheit Fair Enough.
[Hey, CED from facebook here.  Thanks for doing the AMA.  We love you!  My question: who do you want to collaborate with most?  Who has contacted you about doing any collaborating?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zbnhw?context=5)|Thats a tough one. I honestly dont listen to too much dubstep anymore. I know that sounds weird, but a lot of my inspirations come from other forms of music. I think a lot of people put me up on a pedestal on my productions, or maybe im too modest and dont give myself enough credit. If it was a dubstep artist right now, probably Seven Lions. The even crazier thing about me saying that is I listened to his music before I found out hes roommates my friend Torin (Bird Of Prey). I really like his melodic epic style. I think eventually I will slowly be moving away from dubstep and get into different forms of bass music. If I could collab with any artist right now, I would love to work with Machinedrum, Starkey or Rustie. They are just hands down amazing producers. I would be honored to be able to work with them.
[Do tell, are you romantically involved? Best music festival you have been to thus far? What are your backstage requirements when you play a venue or festival? Food, drinks, anything weird?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zbq0o?context=5)|Are you asking if I have a girlfriend lol? I do not anymore. Im single. I was in a long term relationship but it didn't work out.
 |Festivals... umm, this is my first year really hitting up the larger festies. As for me playing I want to say Coachella 11', that was surreal how many people were there. Waka was fun too this year. My favorite festival that I attend would probably be symbiosis 09' in Yosemite.
 |As for the rider, Nothing crazy. When I was picked up by AMonly they made a rider for me. Its just tons of booze, veggie platter w/ hummus. Nothing crazy. I usually let my friends, or cool fans I meet back stage to drink it all for me lol :)  
[Just wanted to say I love your music. I would really like to see you live sometime. My favorite song by you is This Old Heart. As for a question, who are your biggest musical influences? At what age did you discover your love of music? What do you think of performing live? Are you happy to see live performances becoming more popular over studio work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zbpa0?context=5)|Thank you for the kind words :)
 |My musical influences.. Wow thats hard to answer because I have so many. I listen to all different types of music. I guess it all depends on what genre you are talking about. I would have to say even though its not electronic music, Circa Survive would be my biggest musical influence. From the progressive song structure, to the emotion, lyrics and stage presence. I try to apply that same formula to my music and energy on stage.
 |Live performing is intense. When I first started producing I remember telling my friend I would never play my music live... I guess I was completely wrong about that haha! At first few shows were very hard for me, I was terrified. I only play my own productions and you start getting inside your own head ""what if they dont like it"" ""what if they dont dance"" ""what if I fuck up..."" I was my worst enemy. I would constantly over think everything. I finally got to the point a year or so in, I came to the realization that people enjoyed my music, they dont notice the small mistakes or even care. They are there to have a good time. Once I was able to accept that, I was able to just have fun and wig out on stage. Its all about having a good time. If you are in the crowd watching a DJ, you want to vibe of him/her. If you arnt moving, crowd isn't either. Thats something Ive learned over the past few years.
 |Im both in the studio and playing out live so I guess I enjoy both. Its crazy to see how many people listen to electronic music now. Its great. 
[What advice would you give to an aspiring producer?  Did you have a long run of frustration with production before it ""clicked"", or has it always been easy for you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zbpso?context=5)|Let put it this way, im still frustrated with my own productions. Im my own worst critic. If you arnt pushing yourself to the best of your abilities constantly, your not going to progress. But one day you'll be in the studio in the zone and finish up a track and go ""holy shit this is good"". The satisfaction in that moment makes it all worth it.
[Like any electronic music artist, you know that at any given venue, a sizable portion if not a majority of the crowd is on some psychoactive substance besides alcohol or cigarettes (you think I ran on stage and hugged you because I was *drunk?*\). This certainly makes the crowd easier to please!  As far as past experiences and occasional or rare instances, what sort of psychoactive substances have you personally become familiar with?  Additionally, do you feel like your audience being high cheapens their appreciation of your music at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zdmrf?context=5)|If you're a responsible adult, and choose to take a substance at a show. If you know your limit, and you are not hurting anyone, or infringing on anyones free will, or ruining anyones good time. Then its none of my business what you do. You are an adult and can make your own decisions. Im not saying its right or wrong.  But when I finish a set at an all ages massive, walk out side to get some air, just to see paramedics tossing a kids limp unconscious body onto a gurney. When that ambulance door slams shut, your heart falls into your stomach. All you can think about is the phone call that kids parents are about to receive.  That being said, when I play shows to an older crowd (18+) I dont feel it devalues their appreciation for my music. I know they are my fans. Just like fans of any other artist, of any other genre of music. They are looking to go out and have good time. I owe it to them to play the best set I possibly can.
[If you do not condone drug use, why did you name a song after a drug?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c50b5uj?context=5)|Because I was young in my career and I didnt know any better. If I could go back to the beginning with the knowledge and the things ive seen, and how it has affected people, I would have made different choices of naming those tracks. I dont have any regrets, those were interpretations of my own experiences. But I never thought I would someday have 30,000+ fans either. When you are in the public eye, you hold a responsibility and owe it to your fans (especially the younger ones) to set a better example. People are going to do but you can only hope that they do it safely and responsibly.
[I think you are really one of the most underrated artists out there, your stuff is so epic and emotional, it's great.  Have you ever considered doing production for a more...how do I put this...have you ever thought of doing soundtracks to movies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zbp7e?context=5)|I dont think I have the proper musical education to write scores for movies. That takes a lot of experience. I have had some of my own music licensed in movies, television, documentaries and commercials before. So its neat to know that my music has credibility to be a part of a movie. It gave me a sense of accomplishment. I would have never thought my music would have made it this far.
[Hey, I have never heard of you but I checked out your music and it's unique and sounds good. I like your comment about not hoarding your music (somewhere up in the thread\) haha. I'm a beat hoarder :/ anyways, do you have any tips on getting one's music liscensed out? Suppose the music is already sounding good. What is the next step?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zyeo5?context=5)|All the licensing that I have got contracted, usually the company contacts me. I know that their are companies that work for artist to help get your music out to television,movies and other advertising outlets though. That might be something to look into if you are looking to get your music licensed.
[Would you consider doing an AMA over on reddit.com/r/edmproduction, for production only questions? We'd really appreciate it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zcdut?context=5)|Sure. Im self taught though, I dont know how much technical information I could give but I could give insite on how I make my music if it helps.
[I was thrown out of Arcata Theatre Lounge 4 times trying to get in to your show.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zc3q4?context=5)|Thank you for being a huge fan and being persistant in trying to get into the arcata theater!  Let me know the next time im up north I'll try and get you in to my next show ;)
[Hey dude, aspiring producer/DJ here;  How did you/do you deal with smaller crowds, and is there any size you won't play because of low turnout?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zbqod?context=5)|On my last tour with Two Fresh we played Montreal on a Sunday. It was right after this huge city festival they had the night before. There was literally like 8 people that showed up. Let me give you a better idea, we have a full light production that could put any venues lights to shame, It was amazing to say the least. im playing to 8 PEOPLE! To most people thats a swift kick in the balls to your ego, but all I could think about is trying to blow those 8 peoples minds the whole time while playing. After my set two younger guys came up to me and said they drove 6 hours to see me play and It ment so much to them. That right there meant so much to me. I dont care if its sold out or the only person in the venue is the bartender. Im going to always play the best set with the intensity I try to bring to all my shows. Those people that show up to the show want to see you play and want to have a good time. So as a producer/DJ, thats your job to throw down so they can have a great night. I will never refuse a show just because it has a low turnout, It just inspires me to go harder :)
[What are the best places to go to for decent bass and sound system culture in San Jose ... know anything about the Santa Cruz area either .. ???](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zbpbc?context=5)|Honestly San Jose doesn't have shit for clubs. SF and Santa Cruz do. I think my favorite club for sound would be The Mighty or Mezzanine in SF. Santa Cruz we have the Catalyst, but they usually need to bring in extra subs. Its a bigger venue tailors more for bands then edm parties. Thats just off the top of my head. 
[Who are the chillest and most fun artists you have met?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zbq6y?context=5)|Thats a hard one. Usually those artist become my friends and we see each other or talk on a regular basis. (NastyNasty, Stephan Jacobs, Gladkill, Freddy Todd... I can go on and on...)
 |I want to say one of my favorite experiences with an artist was with Brenden (Eskmo). I am a huge fan of his work and when I found out I was playing a show with him in New Orleans a few years back, I was blown away. Hes the most humble guy you'll ever meet. I was still new to the scene, so this was huge for me to be hanging out with someone I idolized. He kinda looked after me that night. He took me out to dinner. He showed me Burben st. Dude was just an amazing guy. I hope our paths cross again soon.
[What has been the high point of your career as an electronic music producer so far? Like your greatest memory, favorite show, or something like that.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zebmy?context=5)|You know that feeling when your stomach turns and you realize shit just got real. That hit me in spades. I was terrified. It was a sea of people. I never played to that amount of people before. AND im wearing blue basketball shorts with paint stains and a sweaty beater to top it off! So you know they are just staring at me like who's this guy? So I get on the mic and say, Hey im nit grit and just started my set. I opened with bomber :) Thank god I opened with bomber hahaha! The intro came on slow.. everyone was just standing there...Then the drop!!!! :) People went nuts! Ive never seen so many people rockin out in out to my music before. I would put my hand up and you would just see a sea of hands go up following mine. It was incredible! The whole set went flawless. The crowd was amazing the whole time! I finish my set and start packing up, girls flashing me in the front row (which had never happened to me till that point, and I think has been the only time its ever happened in my career lol). I felt like a rockstar. People wanted autographs and pictures. It was just an unbelievable experience on such an epic level. Ever since Wicker park, Chicago has the most NiT GriT fans in america. With Denver in a close second. Just a great time and memory.
[Also, as a fan, you're easily one of the best producers out there in my eyes. Your stuff is so unique and your show with Two Fresh in Asheville was one of the best electronic music shows I've ever seen. I'm looking forward to hearing the new song! I hope you swing by Knoxville soon!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zebmy?context=5)|So its during that heat wave last summer. I had two shows lined up for that weekend, ATL and Chicago. (I love both of those cities!) I fly into ATL and its like 96 degrees 100% humidity... One thing you need to know about me is I dont wear those beaters to look cool, I wear them because I sweat profusely. So right of the bat im sweating... Im literally going through all my clothes that I packed for the whole weekend. So I play ATL, it goes off! Great show, great crowd. Get back to the hotel at like 5am. My set for Wicker Park was 6pm and I have to be on a flight at 10am. so I have to be at the airport at 9. I get to the airport (im soo tired) and im wearing these old shorts that I used to wear when I worked construction. They have paint stains all over them. I look trashy to say the least haha. Go to get my ticket. The flight is canceled... The next flight isnt till 3 something. I wait till 3 and its late... Im calling everyone I can to let them know im probably not going to make it. Flight FINALLY shows up. I board we take off and go. I land and its like 5 something. I dont know how the driver did it but got me there minutes before I was supposed to be on stage. So I get out of the car and run to the stage, Its hot as hell, im out of clothes. Im thinking in my head, who cares, this is just some small street fair. So Im grabbing my gear. Ana Sia is CRUSHING IT on stage. Im thinking in my head ""I have to follow this?? shit..."". So I tell myself, so what its probably only a few hundred people at most. I walk up the stage to start setting up and this is what I come out to...
[How do you respond when people label dubstep as ""not real music"" or peg Ableton for doing all of the hard work of in producing music?  You know, the argument that producers/DJs just ""hit buttons"" and ""aren't real musicians"" - what say you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zbs26?context=5)|I guess it all depends. Truthfully it is music. You are still tapping into that same creative space if you were to pick up a guitar and play a riff in a band. If anything you are doing more work as a producer, your a one man band. you are conductor, playing all the instruments, you are the sound engineer and on top of that you are the DJ. I do se the other side of the argument as well. I think thats why a lot of electronic acts are gravitating towards a more ""live"" performance these days.
 |But personally I dont really care what other people think about what I do or how they label it.
[Hey man. I think you've made a pretty nice impact on the scene in general with the decrease in, you know, the nastiest-bassline-ever dubstep and instead making something that's actually melodic and pleasant.  Anyways, my question is basically how did you get to where you are now? After you get a few solid tracks, or a solid EP or two, do you just send them to labels as a form of cold-calling essentially?  I'm guessing you're part of a booking agency, and how do you get into something like that? Did you contact them or did they find you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zc5nj?context=5)|It just happened. I started making tracks and I hit the wave of people who started using Soundcloud when it was still new. I think that helped. I was on a few small labels but I pull my music from them and became kinda anti-label. The agency I am on now picked me up. It all just kinda fell together. It pretty surreal to be honest lol.
[I guess my question(s\) to you is: Why so? and whatever happened (will happen\) to Sloth Logic?  I still appreciate you sending me that link btw, it opened me up to another awesome side to your music. Underground-like.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zcemv?context=5)|Its not that I dont put my heart and that intensity in NiT GriT, but with Sloth Logic there were no boundaries. Experimental music can be whatever you want it to be. Its whatever your mind can come up with. Ive been trying to incorporate they into a lot of nit grit, but with dance music you have to have some sort of a constant to keep people moving. So I had to find more creative ways of expressing myself within those walls. I put a lot of it in my sound design. ""This Old Heart"" is a good example of that. Its trying to find that balance between a constant and chaos.    I do plan on going back to my Sloth Logic project and making a new EP soon. Its something thats been on my mind. Hopefully soon I will be pushing those endless boundaries again.
[Just wanted to say thanks for taking the time to answer my questions, Can't wait to hear the new Sloth Logic. I wish more artists did these AMA's, or atleast contributed more to Reddit... This made my day :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zqzyo?context=5)|Anytime my friend 
[Dude, such a huge fan. Your set at Wakarusa was ILL. And it would be amazing to see you lay it down in Houston!  When your making music, is there ever a point where you say to yourself? ""yeah this is definitely done"" or do you feel like you can always keep improving a song?  I always wonder this for every artist but you especially have a very unique sound... what is your inspiration for you kind of sound?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zbru8?context=5)|My sound is just me. I dont know how to make my music any other way. I always try to find ways to progress and take my sound design to the next level (which is a lot of trial and error for hours till you find something that works). Every artist works differently. When im inspired, I work quickly. Ill get the bulk of a track done in a day. Go back the next day and hear it again, fix or change things, then start working on the mixdown. Im not one of those artist that hoards his music. When I make something and send it off to get mastered. Once I have it back its immediately on soundcloud to share.
[Hey man. I saw you play at the Westcott in Syracuse, NY. I'm sure it was a much smaller show than you're used to, but you still played hard as ever and I fucking loved it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zbpbe?context=5)|That tour was rough to be honest. It was put together and not promoted well. It definitely took a hit on my confidence to see these giant venues and some nights have less then 100 people show up. Granted it was a monday or tuesday during finals week.. but still. There were so many variables of why it turned out that way, but it is what it is. I dont care if im playing to 20 people or 20,000, Im going to put everything I got into that set. If people are amped to come out and see me play, Im just as stoked to put on the best show I can.
[Here's my question though...do you ever feel less inclined/pressured to play a better/longer set depending on the size of the crowd?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zbpbe?context=5)|As for the length of the set. I usually only play 60 minutes for a reason. I feel that after an hour of playing your own productions you might start losing people. It might get stale. Thats why I try and keep progressing and keep my tracks diverse. 
[I've always felt like mixing and mastering were my weaker points, could you give any tips on how you learned to mix and master?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zch86?context=5)|It took me a long time to learn how to mix a proper mix correctly.
 |Separate the idea of mixing and mastering. They are two completely different artforms.
 |When you mix, always do it at a low volume. This is where new producers make the mistake. They want everything to be loud and heavy while you are mixing it. Try something... Take your kick to 0db. Shits loud right? Now lower that down to -12db and turn up your monitors. Sounds just as loud doesn't it? Do this and it gives you enough headroom to add any other synths or instruments without cluttering the mix. Make sure all your instruments sit nicely in there freq range. EQ everything, Pan your synths (even if its just slightly). Dont ever put anything on the master until your mixdown is complete. When your mixdown is complete its ready for mastering. Then you can add your compresser/limiters to bring your mix up to 0db and everything sounds clean.     I personally get someone else to do my mastering because they have an unbiased ear and can help me fix my mix if there is something sounding off in it. Thats just me, some people master their own tracks themselves. Thats personal preference.
 |I hoped that help a little bit. Keep making music my friend :)
[Kind of an odd question, but I feel like the reason you are one of the best dubstep producers out there is because you make actual songs, rather than buildup--drop--filler--another drop--filler--fade out. Do you have any specific method (or order\) in constructing your tracks that helps you achieve the much more interesting types of music you make?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zbxv9?context=5)|Its just how I write tracks. I think it came from me playing guitar. You would have your intro, verse, chorus, verse bridge, outro. My song are always structured differently though. Its just how I write em I guess.
[When performing at events (clubs,festivals etc\) - is your setlist preplanned to a certain extent or is it all improvised?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zbth1?context=5)|I usually rehearse my sets beforehand and form a set list. Some of my tracks dont work well with others and I like to keep a flow to keep people interested. Over the past few years my style has changed and so have my productions. When I build a set, its kinda like a puzzle and im fitting the pieces together to try and make it seamless. I usually like to come out strong then go back to the more melodic slower tracks and then end strong.
[Where could you see an intern (aka free employee\)  fitting into the business that is, for example, NiTGriT?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zbshr?context=5)|If you are looking for an internship you should find a credible management company that can teach you the ins and outs of how things work in the music business. There is so many things that even artist I know have no clue about when It comes to management. If you were to go to and artist directly to work for him just to be his intern/assistant, you couldn't benefit too much.  Both would probably be the same job tasks for an intern. Interns generally would be the ones keeping track of contracts coming in from the agency, filing those for records, booking the flights, keeping track of receipts (tax time is a bitch), writing up the itineraries which would be a breakdown of all the information the artist needs from the moment they land in the city they're playing. Flight times, pick up times, drivers #, promoters #, hotel w/ address with conformation #, sound check and set times, amount owed at show, and the info for the next day to get back home or to the next gig. You would keep track of updating shows on websites and other tedious things of that nature.  My suggestion If you want to have hands experience with artists and how to manage them, you would have to go to a legit management company, with a legit manager. That way you will be able to understand and learn the other responsibilities of a management group. For example, licensing music, contracts, lawyers, labels, What companies to work with for music and clothing distribution, or with graphic designers, web designers, sponsorships, publicists, CPAs...the list goes on. They are all entities that are managed by the company for the artist. Thats if you find a good one.
[I am going to school for music management, and need an internship.  What aspects of the industry would an artist in your position benefit from from a ""free employee?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zbshr?context=5)|I have to dissect this question a little more. Are you looking to work one on one with an artist? or be part of a management company that works with artists for your internship?
[What makes dubstep different from other types of electronic music?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zjrac?context=5)|Dubstep derived from dub music (branch off of Reggae that uses a lot of effects. check out Lee ""scratch"" Perry for example) and 2-step/garage. It was created in London. It sounded a lot different then what it does now. It didnt get that popular till it hit north america where It started getting extremely heavy LFO (wobbling) basslines. A lot of Drum and Bass artist contributed to that. It kept evolving to what it is today incorporating all styles/genres of electronic music ,all based around that heavy bass lines and a hard hitting 2-step beat. To a lot of people it sounds like overwhelming noise and very annoying. Just like anything these days that gets popular, people just want to hate it to hate it. Every generation has there own form of ""dubstep"" that people dislike.  It definitely pissed off true fans of dubstep/garage in europe when it hit north america because we destroyed the roots of the genre and started cross breeding it with all different styles of EDM music.

Are you going to be on tour in the US anytime soon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zbx7e?context=5)|Im in the studio everyday still trying to find that next nit grit sound. I notice as I progress the sound does too. I never really know where its going to take me.
 |There have been talks of another tour, but nothing really set in stone. I think for the time being im just going to be playing individual shows across the U.S.
[Serious question, how do you feel about internet piracy?? How do you think the industry should deal with it? Do you download?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ux26f/i_am_nit_grit_electronicdubstep_producer_ama_2/c4zgi3n?context=5)|This is my personal opinion and thats all. Im not trying to start a controversy. I think music should be free. Thats why I give away all my music away. I made the music so people can listen to it. A lot of musicians get caught up in album sales and being #1 on beatport. I can give a shit personally about being on any chart comparing my music to someone elses.
 |And If I want to check out an album I think I might like, I will definitely download it. If I like it a lot, I usually go and buy it because its better quality and It does support the artist, but truthfully we make the majority of our money playing shows. I personally feel that people are going to pirate my music either way. I might as well give them a good quality 320 other then some garbage quality file some guy ripped from my Soundcloud. I actually have to pay to give away my music for free.
 |I can see why its a touchy subject with other artist though.

Honestly its up to my agency and the promoters. I dont really have much of a say on where I play anymore. They just let me know whos booking me where and I go play it.

I think the most universal track I wrote that im proud of would be my remix of ""Prituri Se Planinata"" by Stellamara.

I look up to the senior engineers in my group and they seem to know how to solve any problem out there. It is a bit daunting since there is so much information in electrical engineering and there are many re-occuring topics that I know little about. Do people ever feel confident?

The thing is I don't know what schools are truly good and worth their money for I/O programs.  I've already crossed-searched to narrow it down to these and could narrow it further: CSU Long Beach, CSU San Bernardino, CSU San Francisco, San Jose State, San Diego State, Chapman University, and Claremont Graduate University.  Yes? No? I should just travel back in time and start over?

I am firm about staying in California for grad studies and if I/O doesn't work out, maybe MBA might?  I would only stick around for my 4th year to buy time with getting research, internships, and minor in business administration.  Would it even work out if I get a really good GMAT score with a minor in business administration?

I have a bunch of questions regarding a ticket I received for speeding on a freeway (11-15 mph). 

Details:

First off, my car (silver 2001 ford escort) and license have Illinois registration and I was driving East on 43 in Walworth County on Saturday afternoon at 3:40.  I was heading back to my college town from my internship site in northern WI to give a speech at an opening of an exhibition I curated at a museum, and had been driving for about 2 hours.   I was running a bit behind because of a housing emergency and water was leaking in and needed to wait for a plumber.My car does not have cruise control.  While I do not know how fast I was going when I got pulled over, the officer (a state patrol officer) showed me the laser radar at 87 in a 65.  I do not believe I was going that fast, but he was positioned halfway down a fairly steep hill.  He lowered the speed to 80 on my ticket, stating that he normally lowers the speed for people who cooperate.  I did tell him I was running late for an opening that I was headed to, but I did not admit to speeding (though I realize now this could be considered an implication of guilt). 

My fine is for $200.50 with an estimated 4 points on my record. This is my first ever violation on my record and I am 21 year old female and have had my license for 4 years.  I honestly can not afford $200 at this time as I am living off of grant money and I do not want this getting back to my insurance in IL as I can equally not afford an increase in my rates there, nor do I want to have to deal with my parents about it.  It will be difficult for me to attend my court date as I would need to request the day off and require me to drive 2 hours again, but there is a chance I could do so.

My questions are:

1. Should I contest the ticket in court or just pay the fine and be done with it?
2. If I contest the ticket, what should I plead in order to increase my chances of not paying/reducing the chance this will end up on my record?
3. I've heard of people writing to the judge, like this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/i9r34/speeding_ticket_advice_needed/ . Is this a viable option in the state of Wisconsin? 
4. I've heard Wisconsin is one of the few states not required to tell other states of your driving record in state.  Is this true?
5. If #3 is true, do I have to worry about the insurance rates increasing?  I have Allstate if that helps.
6. Should I worry about mail being sent back to my parents house (residence as listed in IL)?"

They didn't advertise an entry level position but I decided to shoot for it anyway. The interview went phinominal. Not just because I thought I did well but because I was impressed with the company. They valued the things I value. And I felt they could truly take me down the career path I want to go down. During the interview the hiring manager mentioned there might be an entry level position available and he would try to find a place and contact me soon.

The next day he contacted me and told me he wasn't able to secure an entry level position and all he could offer was a summer internship. 2 months. full time. With the possibility of an entry level position at the end of it. The pay would be crap but I could feed myself on it. I'm definitely going to try to negotiate better pay but it will likely still be crap compared to what I should be making. 

The only reason I'm even considering it is because this company impressed me more than any other one I've interviewed with. And the work environment is a million times more important to me than the pay.

The way I see it is it's only 2 months and it might end with working at an awesome company.

But it might backfire and I might be in the same position with bad finances and only a minimally more impressive resume.

He was walking with another intern on my team and we walk into a conference room.  He sits us both down and closes the door.  We, at this point, think we had done something wrong, and he proceeds to ask us 'do either of you have a passport?'. I personally do have one but the other intern was not sure, so we respond with our respective answers. My boss then proceeds to say 'would either of you be willing to go to Belgium tonight, completely paid for, and stay for a week?'. For the first time in my life, I was actually speechless.  At this point, the third intern on my team comes into the room and asks what happened.  Both the other intern and I let our boss explain.  After a long argument with my parents, I actually end up being allowed to go.  So I was flown first class over to Belgium with a senior engineer from the company, all expenses covered, to fix a defect in some products that needed to ship by the end of the week.  I am currently in Belgium and am still in shock.  Does anyone else have crazy internship stories?"

I pay my own bills and I haven't lived with my parents since I was 18. 

I like to be concise and get my point across here and now - I am not interested in playing mind games. I like building up a relationship with someone nice and slow, but I know what I want in someone and I know what I deserve. 

I like to do pretty much anything:

* sail
* workout
* mountain bike
* swim
* drive
* talk 
* read books together
* cook
* eat
* [insert any activity besides shoe shopping here]

I have no age range since I've dated across the spectrum. I believe age is just a number. PM me if you want to exchange pictures, details, etc..."
ux85d,2,2012-06-11,To the people who graduated college (undergrad): What is your biggest regret from college?,teddybearhug,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ux85d/to_the_people_who_graduated_college_undergrad/,"I am currently in college and I extremely enjoy the times as a young adult and as a college student. College has been great but I want to know what you redditors wish you had done in college that you did not end up doing? Maybe study abroad? Internships? Significant other? Study more? Increased GPA?

I want to study abroad, and I plan on going to Singapore for this fall semester to do so. But it looks like I might have to bail on it because of no scholarships granted and no money. Yet, I know in retrospect I think I might regret my decision.

Let me know!!

ux809,1,2012-06-11,"Reddit, have you ever volunteered? How has the experience affected your life and career afterwards?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ux809/reddit_have_you_ever_volunteered_how_has_the/,"Bonus: If you have any stories about long-term volunteering in a field unrelated to your college degree, those would be great.

I'm primarily wondering about all of this because I'm a recent college grad without any internship experience. I'm thinking about volunteering for a year (e.g. AmeriCorps) but am getting surprisingly negative feedback from people. They see it as me giving up on the job search and think I should be more focused on doing something in my field. My degree is in Biomedical Engineering. I chose the field because I want to do and make things that help people. I think volunteering would be fulfilling, but unfortunately I don't think there are many organizations looking for people to do lab or engineering volunteer work. People have frightened me into thinking that volunteering would be a poor decision and I won't be able to find an engineering job if I spend a year doing things unrelated to my field.

So, I'd like to know what you've done and if you thought it was a good choice or not. "

ux7jg,1,2012-06-11,Grad School question.  Is it worth it?,klin324,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ux7jg/grad_school_question_is_it_worth_it/,"So I have read and heard from multiple sources that if you can't get into a top 10 or 20 (I hear different thresholds) compsci grad program then it is not worth going between the monetary cost of the program and the opportunity cost, especially considering how hot the job market is now for compsci grads.  I'm only talking about a master's program, I have no interest in working in academia so I'm not even considering a Ph.D.  I love computer science and I would thoroughly enjoy studying it (and conducting research) for two more years in an academic environment.  I recognize that getting a master's typically means a pay raise, and that is appealing to me.  I'm not looking for the typical response: ""If you're doing it for the pay raise you'll be miserable in a M.S. C.S. program"".  I'm just looking for someone to shed some light on the validity that there is some sort of threshold when it comes to going for a graduate degree.

Also, realistically, how many undergrads obtain research experience?  I know this is a primary factor during the admissions process, but I'm curious what the typical 'competition' looks like for the various levels of grad schools, top 5, top 20, top 50 etc...

Do internships hold any weight during the admissions process?

Thanks in advance for any insights."

I'm not looking for a relationship, just someone to hang out with so the weekends aren't boring as hell.  I'm living with my aunt and uncle in NE Portland, and I'll be up there by this Saturday.  I'm leaving in the middle of September, so I'll be there for about 12 weeks.

A little about me:

I'm currently a junior at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.  I am majoring in Industrial Engineering.  That's what my internship is for.

I like video games, especially Super Smash Bros, Mario Kart, Call of Duty, and other multiplayer games.  I also like Skyrim and Zelda, but that's mostly on my own.

I am 5' 11"" 160 lbs.  If you want to see what I look like, just shoot me a message.

I have all original 151 pokemon cards.  Not really that special, but I like it.

Chipotle is pretty awesome.  I'll probably be eating there a couple times a week.

I like soccer, and running, so if you like doing that then that could be fun.  I'm kinda out of shape, so don't expect too much, haha.   I was pretty good back in the day.

I'm not a big partier, but I like to try new things, so if you're into that, I'd be down.

Um, I can make weird noises with my body... alright, that's enough info ;).  Just send me a message or reply here if you're interested.

Oh, also, I'll have a giant 3 story house all to myself the first couple days I'm up there, so keep that in mind."

But I'm wondering whether how big a disadvantage this might be, because I'll be forgoing a whole semester of participating in clubs and most importantly, internships. Since I hope to work in public health, most probably with minorities or in developing countries, studying in France doesn't seem like it woudl really be much of a benefit in that regard. (At this point its mainly for a great experience.) 

Does anyone have experience, advice, or guidance here? Thanks a lot."
ux3mx,0,2012-06-11,Love Triangle. Need perspective. Please. ,phantacount,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ux3mx/love_triangle_need_perspective_please/,"24(f) and 35(m)

I started working at my current place of employment 3.5 years ago as an intern. I quickly moved up and have been working closely for this guy (my boss) since January (by closely I mean that we were the only people in the office). There has always been sexual tension, but one of us always had a significant other so nothing but flirting ever happened. 

Fast forward to the end of March 2012 where we wind up getting drunk together and hooking up. I thought it was just something to get out of my system but when I saw him the next day he continued to be affectionate and treat me differently (in a way I wanted). BUT, and this is the kicker, he had a girlfriend. Has a girlfriend. Yet, our relationship continued to evolve. 

We both tried to stop, but felt so strongly that passion always won. Eventually it felt like an affair: going to hotels in neighboring towns, campsites in state parks, etc.  We talked about the future and how we would be together. His relationship with his live in girlfriend suffered and I was told it would end, but there were 'things [he] had to take care of first'. (By suffered I mean they grew distant, became roommates and stop communicating. She wanted to get married and have children and he didn't). 

Meanwhile, work is amazing. He's still my boss and I get to interact with him during the day. We both get there early and run errands together. We leave early for the day so we can just drive around together. Being together is what we start waking up for. 

(I realize how naive I sound, but I believed him and still do. The things he said to me were sincere. I just believe he is a weak person and can't pull the trigger on his current relationship)

But his girlfriend got suspicious (as she should) and confronted him. He told me he needed to figure out what he wanted because he wasn't being fair to anyone involved. (His girlfriend started to fight for their relationship) I thought this meant we would continue to communicate, but it basically stopped. 

So I tried to move forward. I figured that there was a choice in front of him and that he chose her. I stopped waiting for a phone call. I stopped waiting for e-mails. I hooked up with a girl and told him. His reaction was anger. He said that he had not been hooking up with his girlfriend and wasn't wanting to. He said that me choosing to hook up with someone made him reevaluate what we had. 

Needless to say, I these feelings that I tried to get past have resurfaced. I want to be with him more than ever. More than anything. I've never been this committed or happy with someone before. 

I love him, and I can't change this. These feelings have been cultivated since 2009 and the one thing we have between each other is honesty.  

I guess I just want perspective. I want to know what to say to him to make him understand where I stand. 

Sorry this is long. 

TL;DR I'm involved with my boss, who has a girlfriend, and want him to leave her which he said he would. "

I hope to learn a lot here. My (fiction) writing background is pretty sparse. A few stories and poems in college. I've always enjoyed writing and really enjoyed seeing other people read what I write. I'm especially looking forward to the challenge of being forced into writing with a group of folks who might actually cast a critical eye at what I put on paper.


I'm a graduate student in philosophy, so I write a lot of nonfiction. I'm finishing up the research on my thesis now, which is a historical work on Augustine's Theory of Forms. I don't know that I have a current ""must-read"" author or book. I read a few at once - right now I'm reading Neoplatonism by Pauliina Remes (history of philosophy), a collection of science fiction short stories (of mixed quality) called Far Horizons, and an old collection of Poe's stories called The Fall of the House of Usher: And Other Tales and Prose Writings of Edgar Poe.  
.  
**nichole123**  
I hope to learn more about my writing style, and what others think about my writing objectively. I write YA Fiction, so I tend to read a lot more YA than Adult. I'm also a romance and fantasy junkie, so that will color my book suggestions.


I've written ever since I learned how (I wrote an award winning book in 3rd grade, woop!). I love telling stories about honest people that evoke real emotion in people. I love writing in general, and the way it can transport you somewhere you would never think to go.


Adult must read is Kelly Armstrong, specifically her ""Bitten"" series. Great voice, and the first ""action"" books that I actually enjoyed. YA must read is Maggie Steifvater. Anything by her. She writes very poetically and draws you in to the characters.

**hack1690**  
Hi all. If you had told me I would pursue a career in writing a few years ago, I would have laughed at you. Growing up, I was always an avid reader, but I excelled in the technical and math classes. The last four years I've spent my time working towards a computer science degree. Through an internship and subsequent job making iOS/Android games, I found that passion was for story development, not programming.


I am now majoring in Journalism and Screen Studies and should be graduating next spring. I want to continue my career in story development/ worldbuilding/ narrative design in the game industry.


I have had no formal training in fiction writing (the first will be a 400 level script writing class in the fall, yikes!), so I am hoping to learn some of the finer points and experiment with different styles.


For fantasy writing, Tolkien is probably the most influential. For science fiction, I am particularly fond of a less known author, Dan Abnett, who writes in the Warhammer 40k universe, among others. Recently I have been on a sci-fi streak with Snow Crash (Neal Stephenson), Ender's Game (Orson Scott Card) and The Hunger Games trilogy (Suzanne Collins). I am currently enjoying World War Z (Max Brooks).  
.  

**CunningB**  
I currently work as a copy writer for an SEO firm and fictional writing is my way of escaping the tripe that i have to force out on a daily basis!


Personal ability wise: I was a pretty poor writer at school but an avid reader, mainly of fantasy works, which eventually inspired me to give writing a go. I've been 'seriously' writing for around 6 months now, and I'm interested in breaking out of my fantasy home to meet some of the neighbors; as i feel working around a cliché would be much easier with a larger tool box.


As for authors i love, Steven Erikson, for his convoluted plots; Elizabeth Moon, for her absorbing female characters; and my latest love affair, Patrick Rothfuss, for his voice.  
.  

**scienceisgayokay**  
I hope to refine my writing and take it to a higher level where writing is more incorporated into my daily life. i've always been somewhat of a writer, though i didn't write much on my own until recently. when i was around thirteen i started writing a short fantasy novel and got to about twenty-five pages of completion before stagnating on it and before it got deleted by an unknowing mother.


i really liked cities of the red night by william s. burroughs, and plan on reading the rest of the trilogy. this is the first book of w.s.b. that i've finished, and i know it won't be the last. his writing is so beautiful and so carnal. it's always pleasantly intoxicating to dive into his stories. i also liked snowcrash by neal stephenson, because he did an excellent job at creating a fun and believable sci-fi story. one thing that i like about it is how under the superficial layers of the story are his ideas on how symbols and language can activate latent parts of the brain.


my inspirations in terms of authors include henry miller, william s. burroughs, chuck palahniuk, and david foster wallace.

Hi.


I've been writing for about 5 years but I've yet to write anything that I feel was really substantial or worth creating. I've never completed a peace of writing that I've felt was as good as it could have been. I don't think I've ever experienced anything worth writing about either, though perhaps I'm wrong about that. I joined this course because I want a reason to write something worth reading. Also, I like Irvine Welsh and at the moment I'm reading his book Filth.

Hello everybody, my name is Jacob. I have no professional writing background, as I'm only still a student in high school. I don't doubt that I'll be the youngest of the 14 of us to actively participate in the class. I sought to join this workshop because I need a metaphorical kick in the ass to my writing. A year ago, I set the goal of finishing the rough draft of my novella I had been working on by the time I graduated. Since that day, absolutely zero progress has been made toward that goal, with me instead just whimsically writing short stories and poems with no real direction or end-goal. I feel that this workshop will help give me the motivation I need, as well as providing honest, objective critiques of my writing.


I am a fan of dystopian novels, such as A Clockwork Orange and Brave New World, as I feel they provide a sobering look at many of the problems in society. I delight in surrealist writing, as well as nonsense poetry, though I don't confine myself to absurdity alone. I also enjoy philosophical writings, ranging form the more modern works of Bertrand Russell to the classic Socratic Dialogues, and cheap paperback novellas of the 1950s, like The Green Odyssey and Strangers in the Universe. I look forward to conferring with you all and growing as a wordsmith!

Hey everyone! I'm an English major and about to be a senior in college. Some of my favorite authors are Henry James, Oscar Wilde, Poe and George Orwell. Most of my work is critical analysis and comparison of works, but I've always wanted to get a bit more creative. Hopefully this class will give me a chance to share without the fear that comes along from sharing with people you actually know.


I just finished The Puttermesser Papers by Cynthia Ozick and I wholeheartedly recommend you check it out. Puttermesser is an amazing character and the book lends itself to a TON of analysis. If anyone wants to talk about it then let me know!

I have always enjoyed writing but only started 'seriously' writing near the end of my university career. 


After 4 years of my creativity being slowly sapped I decided that a change was needed and I began the whole ""Morning Writing"" thing as suggested in The Artist's Way. This really helped to inspire me and I have been trying to write as much as can since. 


Though i just started writing prose, all throughout University I have written sketch comedy and comics. This has made itself evident in my writing as most of my stories seem to be comedic. My favourite writers are also reflective of this; Douglas Adams, Kurt Vonnegut, Neil Gaiman, basically anyone who can make me laugh well still telling a story.


I just want to create writing that motivates and inspires people.

v0qic,1,2012-06-13,How do you balance work and fun? Is it okay to have fun?,FightingCats,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/v0qic/how_do_you_balance_work_and_fun_is_it_okay_to/,"I know my question may sound absurd, but it is something I am really struggling with. I am an undergrad college student (currently out of school for the summer) who is working around 40 hours a week doing custodial work to save up money for school. I am also doing an unpaid internship for a business in my college town, writing a proposal for an original research scholarship grant, and studying for the GRE. 

All that said, I feel like I no longer have time in my life for ""fun."" Anytime I do something fun (be it playing a video game, hang out with friends, watch a movie, read, play music, etc.) I always feel like I could, and therefore should be working. I am scared that if I choose to have fun instead of work I will fail and end up losing any opportunities for the things I have worked so hard for already. This leads me to become extremely stressed out and anxious, and it probably also reduces the quality of work I produce when working. 

I am kind of having an existential crisis I guess, I feel like life is pointless, and that basically all it amounts to is working hard all the time until you die because you have tired out. 


Any advice on this? What should I do? How can I get back to enjoying the little things and not worrying so much?"
v0org,1,2012-06-13,WWYD ; How would you handle family pressure. ,[deleted],whatwouldyoudo,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatwouldyoudo/comments/v0org/wwyd_how_would_you_handle_family_pressure/,"Hello,
So I believe I am a pretty competent individual. Got a good head on my shoulders I'm told by most people (outside of my family). I am attending a university towards a commerce degree.


But honestly, living at home blows donkey dick. I am the youngest of many siblings, all of which already have their lives set out (ie. married with children). I constantly feel under pressure to meet their expectations, when I fuck up, I hear about it from 20 different sources. This has crippled me and made me quite insecure in my mind, on the exterior however, I'm still the happy go-lucky kid.
I want to move out and just spend the summer away from home working and doing my own thing. I've even accepted an unpaid internship just to have an excuse to leave.


I'm all down for disobeying family authority but here is the tough part. My parents are retired and getting above in the years. 70+. Its not like I have to physically take care of them, they are (thankfully) healthy and wealthy.


To them, my departure is taken as an abandonment rather than a way for me to develop some independence. They help me financially which I appreciate to a certain extent. It has also stunted some skills which I believe I have to develop through my own struggles. I cant better myself without a struggle. 

I try to explain this, they don't get it (cultural differences). Looking for an outsider perspective on how to be able to be independent without being too harsh on them.

TL:DR Controllingish parents. Large amounts of family pressure / analysis. Want to get the fuck away and do my own thing without doing it on bad terms. Also, cultural difference. I'm a born and raised Canadian, they are from the Mid.East."

When I was in University, I frequently went to Nashville, Tennessee for an internship. I've been there about 7 times and I CANNOT believe the friendliness, hospitality, and generosity of Southern people every time I'm there. I'm from Canada (Asian Canadian) and we are under the impression that Southerners are backward, rude, racist and messed up in the head. 

My car needed a new set of tires so I walk into this small shop and the guy actually recommends me to Firestone because they have better tires for a cheaper price. 0_0 They said they have the tires I needed but the model was different so they didn't want to sell me something that I was going to replace down the road anyway. In Canada, they completely lie to you and rip you off (don't go to budget brake and muffler). The guy on the front counter just looks me dead in the eye and tells me of the situation straight up, calls me sir, and point across the street to their own competitors just to assist me. 

And when I'm on the elevator of my hotel, I exchange smiles with people, and everyones just extremely friendly every time I was in Tennessee. Even the 18 year olds working in McDonalds were friendly enough to make small conversation and be a little more professional I haven't met the rednecks from the outskirts yet, but you Southern people are quite awesome. 

Also during the time I was there, there was a BIG flood and I found out that the city raised millions of dollars including Taylor Swift to clean up local houses, property damage and Opry Mills this big mall and convention center. Just thought it was cool. 

TLDR: Horrible stereotype of Southern people until I actually go there and meet them. "

I'm F 20, college student.
For the past few months my anxiety has gotten really bad at work. I work for a lab on campus and this summer I will be doing an extensive research internship (which is amazing!), but I'm really starting to freak out about it. Whenever I feel pressure at work, like if someone is watching me perform a task or showing me how to do something new, my hands (and sometimes whole body) start shaking uncontrollably and I'm barely able to keep it together. I'm constantly thinking ""what on earth is wrong with me?"". I really need some tips on how to relax and not get myself so worked up. Does anyone with a similar problem have any advice? 

As a side note I have never been diagnosed with anxiety or anything of the sort but I am considering seeing someone in the future if I can't figure out a way to manage this anxiety and stress. "

I work as an intern in the manufacturing engineering dept of an auto parts manufacturer. I'm frequently on my feet on concrete flooring for a good portion of 8 hours a day.

I worked out sunday and It was my intention to work out yesterday(before work) but my legs and feet were so achey and sore from the previous day that doing anything involving standing seemed stupid since I was in pain already and I still had a full 8 ahead of me.

First of all, is it normal to be bone tired and sore all day long just from being on your feet for some portion of 8 hours? Is it exacerbated by my weight? I honestly don't know how our shift workers do 12 hour shifts. 

I'm not meaning to be whiney here I just wonder if it's normal for my legs and feet to hurt so much even after a night's rest. "

I really need your help!  I just started an internship at a mobile app startup, and my boss has asked me to find some college students/recent graduates in order to research their opinions on product concepts and design.  I thought, ""No big deal!  I'll just post on Facebook and ask my family!""  However, now it's been awhile, and I still haven't been able to get anyone.  It's probably because I'm pretty poor in social currency.  =(.  


Basically, we need people to sign up for a 30-minute phone interview (by the computer) where we ask questions about their tech habits, how they use different products, and what they think about different products.  I thought it was a pretty cool process when I listened in on one of the interviews, but I guess I'm into that sort of stuff.


This internship has been amazing thus far.  They answer all of my random questions about what they are doing and why and who they are meeting with and why.  It's unpaid, but I'm learning so much and that's all that I wanted.  So if you help me out, you will be at least be supporting a group that provides great internships and an excellent learning environment.


What you get:  Only a $15 Amazon gift card after completing the 30-minute interview (over the phone &amp; computer).  You also get the awesome feeling of helping me out, which I will really really appreciate!



If interested or for more information, please sign up for interviews through the following link.

Thank you for considering helping me out!  It's okay if you don't want to do it; I totally understand.  


If you have questions, just respond!  I'll watch this post and answer as best as I can.



About me:  This is only for people who care; feel free to skip this section.  I start grad school in September and had pretty much given up on finding an interesting job/internship during the summer.  I've been particularly unproductive since D3 came out.  Luckily, I heard about and landed this internship.  I don't have any cats.  I like to make bread.


Always worried,

Me and my girlfriend (both 20) have been dating for a little bit over 2 years now. We both attend the same university, and have 1 more year to go before graduating. We both had our own rooms, so we were able to spend a lot of time alone together to talk, hang out, nap, have sex, whatever. We were very close, and talked throughout the day on the phone.

Enter summer vacation. I had to stay on campus for an extra month for a work contract, and she went home. She visited me on campus at the end of the month, but she was noticeably different as far as her attitude went - she was quieter, and didn't really connect with me like I thought she would after some time apart.

I'm back home now too. I live out of state, so now we are an hour and a half away from each other. She has started an internship, and I am working from home for my father. 

Last week, we video chatted and everything was great. Ever since that day, she has not been responding to texts or calls, and said a few days ago that ""she needs some time."" She said that she feels overwhelmed with things, that there's too much happening too fast, and that she will ""keep me posted.""

Fast forward to today, and I am sick of being chumped waiting for her to decide on anything. I left her a voicemail saying I have something relatively important to talk about, which led to our video chat that ended 10 minutes ago as of this writing. She and I are now ""on a break.""

I don't know exactly what this means, and neither does she, really. I asked what I'm supposed to tell people when they ask my relationship status, and she said I can say whatever I want to say. She said that she still loves me, and that I'm the only guy that she does love, and I told her I love her back. It honestly comes down to the fact that she really just felt that she needs ""me time"" for herself.

Just as it all ended, she texted me saying that she is changing her Facebook relationship to where only see can see it, so technically it's still there, but nobody will know about it. She said it's because ""we are not completely together or single. I know this sounds silly, but I just don't want to take it off.""

I guess what worries me is what she wants to do. We've been on a break before, last year, where she went on some dates with another guy to figure out if I was what she wanted, which I was. I don't understand why she would want to do that again, but nonetheless, I would still feel cheated on if she were to do it.

Did I do anything wrong with how I handled things? We ended on good terms, and agreed that whenever we want to talk to each other, we should just call and talk like it's no big deal. Also, should I be worried about anything that she might be planning on doing that would further distance us? I really feel that we are good together and would like to do something to not lose her, but I also don't want to overstep.

I might be talking / worried about nothing, but I would really like to hear some kind of feedback about the situation. In the end, I'm a paranoid parrot when it comes to relationships, and want to know more rather than less. I really didn't want to be on a break, but she wanted it, so I felt it was my only choice.

Thanks.

tl;dr: Girlfriend and I just went ""on a break,"" I wanted to stay together. Confused and worried about why she wanted ""time."""

I worked hard in high school and was admitted. I was ecstatic and at the time exhibited far too much hubris. My family was proud of me for being able to attend this well known school in a program that they were known for.
The program in which I was admitted was rigorous (all math and science with no space for electives), but I figured I could handle it because I had done well enough in those courses in high school and that because education is incremental, it would be harder, but that it was still manageable. 
Although I studied a fair amount, it was a game of catch up. The courses had similar grading schemes, consisting of two midterms, one final, and either lab reports or online assignments. While I did well enough on the assignments, the exams worked towards my demise. Needless to say, I performed awfully the first semester. I was throughly angry at myself and my performance. I wasn't a partier, yet I had the grades that one would assume I was. In retrospect, I definitely should have withdrawn and traveled or worked, but I know that ""what if?""s are not productive, so I'm trying to ignore this.
I re-evaluated what went wrong and tried to take a much lighter course load, while still maintaining being ""on track"". Despite doing better in the next semester, I failed one of the courses. It was quite frustrating, considering I had done everything I could to prevent this from happening (organising a study group that met a few times over the semester, meeting with my professor every week to go over the assigned problems in the book, seeking out assistance with a guidance counsellor and getting extended time during the exam for my anxiety). It would be callous to blame my grade on my professor: I had written the exam and I had earned the grade. 
My grades were low enough to the point that the school asked me to leave. I pleaded and the school said that if I were to take a few courses over the summer, they would factor that into their decision should I re-apply to the school. So I stayed over the summer, took two non-science courses and did well in them. Despite this, they suggested I take a year at another school to ""get better"".
This past year, I have been taking courses at another university as a student with an undeclared major. This means that I've had to take whatever courses I can squeeze myself into. I took a slew of random courses and despite maintaining a study schedule, I've still managed to only bump my gpa up from last year by a few points. I can say that I haven't failed anything, but I was striving for way better marks than what I earned. I met with a therapist and met with tutors and went to all the free tutoring services offered at the school and still managed to scrape by with cruddy grades.
Now I feel that neither school (the one I'm at currently and the one I was originally at) will want me. I know that the four year university standards is a socially constructed phenomenon in that it doesn't apply to everyone, but I'm angry at myself that it's taking so long for me to get back ""on track"" while all my other friends are off doing internships and are going into their third year of school. I also am angry at the fact that I have so many blessings in my life, but that my feelings vacillate between feeling hopeless and unwanted to feeling content. I know I should be happy. I'm a very healthy individual and I have a very supportive family, but I can't help but feel like a spoiled fuck up. I'm in the process of finding a job so that I can feel a little useful, but naturally, it hasn't gone too well. 
I try to tell myself that time heals all, but it's hard to keep going when I feel like I'm barely seeing any results.

my gf is potentially doing a one year internship for her psychology phd in Hawaii. And I'm thinking of following her for that one year. If people can please comment on how realistic it is for me to find a job to support myself and supplement her meager intern income, that'd be greatly appreciated.

She's got US citizenship and I'm Canadian. Her placement will probably be in Oahu.

My credentials are: 

-Bachelor in Materials Engineering

-Master's in Business Intelligence

-Master's in Sustainable Energy Policy (will be completed)

-&gt;2 years experience working as a lobbyist in Canada for the electricity sector

-Fluent in English, French, Chinese Mandarin

-Willing to take service industry jobs without hesitation


From above I do have things going for me but I'm concerned that:
1. I don't have US citizenship (this is the big one)
2. My experiences are all over the place, perhaps this would discourage people from hiring me for long term serious positions.

We've both been to Hawaii before and both loved it, and like I said this would be like a sabbatical for me so I can do service jobs no problem. I do have lots of savings but would prefer to not dip into them if possible, especially considering this would be for 1 year. We're both very frugal but it never hurts to not live under the poverty line.

Any advice/suggestions would be very helpful!

Are these types of fights normal in a relationship?,BearBacon,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/v01q7/girlfriend_and_i_started_getting_into_weird/,"My girlfriend (19, F) and I (19, M) have been getting into weird fights. A little background:

We had been dating for 4 months at the time (and were friends for 6 months prior) when I left to go halfway across the country for a great internship. The internship lasts for 3 months which is basically the whole summer. Despite this, we decided that we wanted to stay with each other and keep the relationship going. We have a very good relationship, GREAT communication, and we solve problems very quickly when they arise. we are very aware and willing to compromise constantly for each other. I could see myself spending the rest of my life with this woman and even though this has been a relatively short amount of dating time, I feel like we have been dating for much much longer.

Its been a month since we've seen each other and yesterday we skyped and had this really weird conversation. We started getting really moody with each other. First me, then her. And we would have these conversations where one minute we were really happy and the next we were either annoyed or just turned off with each other over stupid things. We have had 2 conversations that have gone this way and it kind of concerns me at this point. I think its a result of our not seeing each other because we have NEVER been away from each other this long. I also think that skype conversations are impersonal in that I can't actually be talking face to face with her and things can be misinterpreted easily. I feel like if we were in person and had the same conversation, we would not be in the same position now.

Is this normal? What are your experiences?

A little about me, last December I graduated with a BS in Biotech. While completing my degree I had a difficulty with Bio- and Analytical Chem (also only took one semester of each) C's in both which is unlike me since I tend to get B's or better in all of my classes. The internship I had (turned into my current job) involved working with polymers and biocomposites, and sparked a great interest for material and polymer chemistry. Originally (not thinking it through completely) I applied for and about 10 Chem E PhD programs figuring I would get into at least one (I had a strong GRE score). Reaching March with no letters, I decided that I should be pursuing a different path. I then started to apply to Chemistry Masters programs that were still accepting applications. Finally I was accepted provisionally to a masters program meaning I have to complete a couple undergrad courses (I'm assuming P. Chem and Analytical) before full admittance to the program. My last chemistry course was during my Junior year in college so its been a little over a year since I have studied any chem. 

Upon arrival to school I will be taking assessment exams in Inorganic, Organic, Analytical, and P. Chem (ACS standardized type). I'm worried about how poorly I will do on these exams which must be passed to officially get into the program. I will be going to school in the end of August so I have about 2 months to prepare myself (aside from working 40-50h a week). I'm planning on reviewing the textbooks I have in General, Organic, and Analytical. Is there any advice you could lend to help me out or any good places for inorganic, organic, analytical and p chem I could go to review? I know it isn't going to be easy, but the rejection letters left a sore spot that I'm determined to fix! "

As the title says, I'm looking for a way to lose weight while I sit at my desk, either at home or at work.   
Right now at work, I spend 80% of my day at my desk, 20% out in the field (I work for a power plant). Particularly something that's not terribly invasive to my work, and as I'm only working here temporarily (engineer intern) I don't want to mess up the work space too much for the next person.       
At home is a different story. I spend a lot of time on my computer for work at home, and would love to do something like a stationary bike or similar. However, I live in a very confined space, and don't have much to work with. And being in college, I don't exactly have a lot of money to buy a $700 stationary bike.        
With that in mind, any suggestions would be super helpful, thank you so much!"
v004r,4,2012-06-13,Step mother issues,asher8,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/v004r/step_mother_issues/,"Here's the backstory:

I'm 20 years old, and 3 years ago my father married a woman who I literally can not stand. She has some severe mental issues, including what may be bi-polar and borderline personality disorders. I could go on and on with what hardships she has caused this family. Because of her instability, she and my fathers relationship has been volatile and almost ended countless times, which started to become a problem even just a few weeks after they started dating 5 years ago.

I dislike everything about her, even when she is acting normal, I can't stand her personality. She analyzes and judges everybody, and sees me as somebody who needs her help and advice every time I open my mouth. I have so many problems with her that I will not go into further detail for the sake of making this easy to read.

So, because of my feelings toward her, I have done the bare minimum to remain civil and somewhat normal with my family. This includes saying things like 'hello' and 'good morning', and answering her when she addresses me, yet I never seek her out, or have friendly discussions with her. Basically, I pretend she is not there unless I am forced to interact. I should make it clear that our relationship has not always been this way, but after years of dealing with her and the problems she has caused, I can't bring myself to feel or act differently. My treatment of her seemed to be going fine, as things were fairly peaceful.

So here's what happened: 

Last night she called a family meeting with me and my dad, for which I had to leave a dinner with friends for. It was not so much a meeting as a full on attack on me, the way I conduct myself, and how I am not pulling my weight in this family by making her feel safe and welcome in our home. I was being treated as though I was openly disrespectful to her, or even violent. My dad told me that I need to stop disrespecting his wife or else I cannot live in this house. They both took turns saying insulting things to me, about how I am ungrateful and need to grow up and account for myself. I don't feel that I have done anything wrong, and I am really insulted by what they had to say. It is hard for me to accept the idea that I am the problem. I don't understand the approach they took with me, and how they could expect to finish the meeting with no hard feelings. I cannot change the way I feel about her, and this meeting has only made me hate her more. My other issue is with if I decided to do what they say and be friends with her, how could it ever be taken seriously, as it would be fake and forced. 

I am incredibly frustrated, and thinking about what my options are. I can either do what they say and treat her like a friend, or move out completely and become independent, which I feel capable of doing. I am renting a room in an off campus house, but I am home for the summer because I have an internship nearby and need access to a car. I think I should be able to become completely independent without too much trouble. So, should I swallow my pride and make peace with two completely delusional people, or should I drop everything and leave? Sorry for the long post, although I could make it ten times as long with details, I hope that I have explained enough."

I don't have any passion for it, so I'm looking elsewhere. From all my searchings on a new career, finance seems like it could be challenging, use my mathematical mind, and (ideally) pay well and recognize my individual achievements.

Only problem: I genuinely don't know anything about finance, accounting, business, or anything like that.

I grew up in a very poor family, and we always lived paycheck-to-paycheck. No one I ever knew growing up knew *anything* about business - it wasn't until I got to college that I thought ""hey, I think I'm missing something here..."" and now I feel I'm far behind.

So is it worth it to take courses at a university, or should I just save my money? I live just outside of Philadelphia, so there are a few decent schools here. I highly doubt I could even be accepted to such a prestigious school (any insight here?), but I was thinking something along the lines of [this program offered at Wharton.](http://executiveeducation.wharton.upenn.edu/semester-programs/wharton-programs-for-working-professionals/certificates/finance-and-accounting-certificate.cfm) 

&gt; The Finance and Accounting Certificate Program provides working professionals with the fundamentals of financial management using the resources of the Wharton School, one of the world's recognized leaders in business and finance.

And the courses offered:

&gt; ACCT 411: Financial Accounting

&gt; ACCT 412: Managerial Accounting

&gt; FNCE 411: Monetary Economics

&gt; FNCE 412: Corporate Finance

$13k+ is a little steep though, but I know it's an investment (lolz) in myself.

Would someone in the hiring process look at this positively or brush it off since it's not an actual *degree* in anything?

Dear [Name of Intern],


Firstly, welcome to the family of professionals here at [Company Name].


To start, you'll be shadowing one our most esteemed team members, [Name of Employee that poops a lot].  [Nickname], as we affectionately refer to him, participates in a lower colon cleansing each morning promptly at 8:15am which lasts anywhere between 10 to 15minutes.  Your first order of business will be to catalog the length, girth, color and weight of any chocolate bananas [pooping employee] might birth into existence.


I understand the requirement for your summer internship to be about 20hrs.  So doing some quick math, I estimate you should be able to gather a solid month's worth of daily data to eventually plot and report on to the team toward the end of August.

As for the other 15hrs, I suggest you simply sit in the background of the office and see who's pushed to snap first.  It turns out, IT is less about technology and more about having thick-skin and enduring the taunts of your colleagues.


I sincerely hope you enjoy your time here at [Company Name], and on behalf of the team including Mr. [Nickname], we hope you find your experience 'fruitful'.  


Yours in technology,

So here are my five questions:

1) What types of jobs other than tour guides, curators and security are available? Also, if you know the level of education/experience expected for each that would be great.

2) Do most museums accept high school graduates for guides or would they prefer college graduates? If they do want graduates, is it safe to assume a degree in History is sufficient?

3) This may be a bit too personal, but on average what is the pay? Is it enough to live off of, or do you find yourself needing a second job? Are the hours stable?

4) Are there any internships or scholarships available that you would recommend?

5) Are there any other jobs that you know of or are actively seeking yourself that involve knowing/understanding history outside of museums?

That puts a lot of pressure on me to do well on finals.

First, I was offered an internship during my first final.  My entire job in the presentation was to keep my mouth shut and I did so.  During the question and answer session afterwards, though, it seemed as if my ideas really wowed them.  I was pulled aside and discretely told that if I was interested in interning, they'd be happy to have me.  Unfortunately, when I attempted to get in contact with them afterwards, they said their position had been filled, but I was welcome to join during the fall.

The rest of my finals went great with my lowest grade being a C, which was actually much better than I was expecting and my highest being an A+ which I have never received as a final grade.

Next, my first car, a hand-me-down, 11-year-old Lexus, had begun to randomly violently shake, lose traction, and become all-around unsafe for me to be in.  Although the problem was fixed, my parents had realized that this was the straw that broke the camel's back.  They had spent too much money over the years on that car and it was time to trade in.  Although my new car sounds like a step down from a 2001 IS 300, I'm very happy with my new Versa.  The MPG is great and has a ton of features I was missing, not to mention I don't feel as anxious driving it, considering the massive cost difference, but I won't turn this into a Versa commercial, I'm just happy that it worked out.

Shortly after finals ended, my macbook pro of 1 or 2 years stopped taking a charge(the remaining battery cycles had reached 0).  I took it into the genius bar, knowing I was safely inside my warranty timeline.  I gritted through the drive that was about an hour longer each way than it should have been as my local Apple store was closed for renovations.  After waiting for around 45 minutes, I was told that I had liquid damage(it took me a few minutes, but I remembered what caused it-not me, but a klutz from a few months prior) and although the battery was able to be replaced, they could not return my computer with a new battery without charging me for repairs(I had immediately dried my computer, started using what I call a ""keyboard condom"" and kept it safe, and there were never any problems in performance) which would total $1200.  I walked out, thinking I was sans computer, which I saw as needed for someone who wants to get into advertising, not to mention a student.  However, my good friend offered to build me a brand new computer from scratch without limiting me to OSX.  Using $200 less than the cost of the replaced MBP, he built me a mini-super computer(16GB of Ram, TB of memory, and the dual-slot video card which was able to run skyrim and assassin's creed 2 simultaneously with almost no blur).

After a few years of cycling between loneliness and futile attempts to create a romantic relationship, I made friendly conversation with a gorgeous Subway employee who had caught my eye.  She made a damned good sandwich while giving me some sort of feeling that I needed to talk to her again.  I came back a week or so later(trying to seem nonchalant) and she suggests I come back on a weekday morning since she works every weekday and there are fewer customers, which I thought implied she wanted to talk to me personally.  I came back another week or so later as the only customer in the store.  I couldn't see her in the front, so I was wondering to myself if I should ask another employee if she had called in sick or something until she popped her head out of the back and waved.  We shot the shit a little, nothing too personal.  Once I was done eating, I tried to gather my nerves to ask for her number, but couldn't do it(That would have been my first time to ask).  As I got up from my chair, she told me not to go just yet, called me over to the register, and wrote her number on the back of the receipt, swearing she doesn't do this often.

To make a long story a little shorter, that was 2 fridays ago.  I didn't know before our first date that she had a three-year-old son and a few months ago, that might have turned me away, but my willingness to see where things led allowed me to meet this amazing kid that is impossible not to love.  This part might sound dishonest, but I love that I'm proving myself wrong when I say that I portrayed this adventurous personality who loves the outdoors and physical activity when before her, I might have spent half a day online gaming, smoking cigs(a pack a day at the worst), pot(if I could afford it) and drinking alone to excess(not that there's anything wrong with that).  But now that I've met her and given that impression, it's like my life is starting to become what I said it was, which I've found is much better.  I've almost stopped smoking cigs(1 cig every 3 or 4 days at most), pot(For some reason I'm drug tested now that I have an ADHD medication prescription) and drinking(once every week or two, and usually not alone), I've started working out and I'm getting more active to play with Owen(I forgot how much energy a 3 year old could have).

Finally, just this past Monday, we shared our first kiss.  Not 30 minutes later, I walked into my first class for bartending school.

I apologize for the wall of text, but I feel ecstatic to be who I am where I am in life.  If you made it this far, thank you for taking out the time in your day.  

tl;dr: finals looked scary but I did pretty well.  My first car got dangerous, my parents bought a cheaper but better one.  My computer broke, my friend built a better one.  I was stuck in a rut romantically, I clicked with a girl at Subway and found out that she and her son are awesome people.  I had a sedentary lifestyle but told her that's not who I want to be, and the person I want to be is coming to me easier every day."

This led me to rushing to find housing and I heard of all the good neighborhoods in NYC and I was scouring padmapper for days when I stumbled across a place in Boerum Hill. I heard really only good things about the place and I even asked some family who was staying in NYC and they reassured me it was good. 

Somewhat of a problem is that I am out of state and unable to check out the area, but we did do a digital tour of the house! Everything seemed fine until I did some more research of the area tonight, me being my paranoid self about doing anything is now terrified.

I found out what surrounded the street I am living on. Projects.

TL;DR Apt I'm subletting is surrounded by projects, what do?

I'm at my college for an internship. I live by myself at my apartment which normally has 2 other roommates, 2 best friends since HS. At first I thought ""Wow! This is going to be great! I have an apartment all to myself!"" A few days in I was desperate for somebody to hang out with.

This is really the first time I am by myself to really get to know me. I'm not liking what I'm seeing. I'm desperate for interaction with people, but my anxiety limits that.

I've only talked to my physician, but I couldn't be 100% truthful as my doctor is also a family friend and well, its was awkward. He put me on Zoloft 5's, then a little later 10's once a day. At first everything was better, I guess. There were times when things looked bright and interaction was natural and I felt good. Then everything turned to shit I guess. I was apathetic about pretty much everything. I kept to myself even more than usual. My grades suffered, and eventually I wanted off. I got off, weaned off after speaking to the doc again.

I abuse alcohol. I justify it by saying I'm young and everyone drinks this much in college. But when it feels unnatural for me to go to bed sober some nights, that's when I really think its time for some self reflection. Basically if I don't have work early the next morning, I'm going to have a few drinks. I don't drink to get drunk, I drink to get numb.

I've been in the worst shape I've been in my entire life. I'm the heaviest I've ever been. I keep saying get in shape, but the motivations hard to come by.

My self diagnosis is that I'm cripplingly lonely. I shouldn't be, I have a big family who would do anything for me, and some great friends around me, but I don't trust anyone enough to actually talk to them.

I've never had a serious girlfriend (22). I've had serious friends who were girls where everything was there, but my low self esteem/ social anxiety (or whatever), just couldn't take the leap. I'm living in major regret because of it, like every time I see her I hate myself.

I feel like no one actually *knows* me. I put on a good pokerface.

[This Link](http://imgur.com/bXFEN) actually hit me pretty good. Right now I'm the first image.

Well tonight I booked an appointment through university health services to speak to a shrink or whatever her title is. I'm really looking forward to it, as I've never actually *talked* to anybody before.

I apologize for the length. Didn't expect this to be that long. Hell I just wanted to vent a little. I appreciate any advice.

uzctt,0,2012-06-13,"IAmA intern at an A list recording studio in Hollywood.   Working near the likes of Drake, Steven Tyler, etc. AMA",[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uzctt/iama_intern_at_an_a_list_recording_studio_in/,"Flew out for school credit for the summer to intern in California and landed one at a huge recording studio. Axe some shiz. I'll post some pictures as proof in a second.

Here's an album of some pictures I've taken around the studio with my iPhone. http://imgur.com/a/59WtU I've only been here for about two weeks now so I haven't been around that many A list people yet but what's really amazed me is getting to look in on an actual professional recording studio and see just how much detail has been put into literally everything to make sure the customer is satisfied. 

Here's an example of my routine and how it went this morning. This is exactly what I did today. I got to the studio at 9:30am, and talked to one of the other interns at the studio who told me he had checked the whiteboard in the office and seen that Steven Tyler was coming in for a session at 10:30am. This was a problem because there's a lot of stuff we need to do first before the studios are ready. There are two studios, A and B. Steven was recording in A with Julian Lennon, John Lennon's son. (Hey Jude) We need to go into the studios in the morning, vacuum, empty any trash, refill the candy, refill the chips baskets, turn on the flatscreen televisions (plural) using an iPad that literally sits in a dresser and is only used as a remote, and sweep the area clean, Everything needs to be orange glowed, windexed, etc. There need to be pads of paper and in the pen holder there needs to be exactly 6 sharpies and three pens. The sharpies need to be two blue, two red, two black each color having a fine point and a regular version. The client bathroom needs to be cleaned, the fridge needs to be filled to the brim at all times etc. There are specific things you need to say when you answer the phones in the studio, and specific things you need to write down. Before an artist gets to the studio for a session we need to run to the grocery store and get hospitality for them. This includes only the most top notch, grapes, (red and green) bananas, celery, carrots, cookies, strawberries and brown sugar, etc. The food is arranged in a restaurant style way meaning everything needs to look pristine. Our job as interns is to do runs for the artists also when they're in the studio and want something. We need to go get whatever they want. They're paying so much to record they pretty much get anything they need. 

The studio is underneath an amazing hotel connected to the valet parking garage. There are ridiculous cars parked in it all the time. Most importantly is Steven Tyler's Hennessey Venom GT which is the only one in the world I think. http://www.gtspirit.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Steven-Tyler-Hennessey-Venom-GT-Spyder.jpg The studio is known for its convenience. Since it's under a hotel the artist can stay in the hotel and just go down to the studio to record whenever they want and since it's underneath the hotel and in a valet garage, no one will ever know the artist is there if they decide to drive in to record."

I'm allowed to post some new insider information, video clips, interviews, or highlights from Inside The League that I think Reddit might like. You guys would help a Redditor impress his boss!

For instance, here's a little nugget regarding the NFL and what I was doing today.. A memo has been sent around the NFL that they will no longer be hiring NCAA football players as interns. However, at this point, I cannot confirm or deny that foul play is a reason (I posted this on CFB as well.. but I figure karma whoring is okay on ITL's first day, especially if it is for a good cause..  Yes, I believe giving Reddit 'inside information' is a good cause; word will probably get out faster than if Adam Schefter tweeted it)

Anyways, if this is really your thing, you can follow the company on twitter and get some inside stuff regarding NFL, players, free agents, draftees and everything in between @insidetheleague

I landed an internship in Seattle with Microsoft and I'm from Iowa. Flying is boring and I love my motorcycle, so I decided to spend 24 days and ride 7260 miles to start my summer. I ride a 1997 Kawasaki Vulcan 800 that did a great job on the trip.
 
Low points:

* I crashed in Pennsylvania when I locked both brakes stopping fast in heavy traffic. By the time it highsided me though, the bike had slowed to somewhere around 10mph and I landed running on my feet. My left mirror and blinker were less lucky.
* When I rode through Death Valley, it was 110 degrees in the shade and I was in the sun wearing a very warm black jacket. Got sick from heat exhaustion and had to cool down for quite a while.
* When I rode from Boston to the bottom of Maine, it was really wet and my rain gear hadn’t been well tested yet. The jacket I was wearing started soaking through after an hour and enough waterproofing had torn off my vinyl rain pants to make them fairly useless. By the time I finally found a hotel, I was as waterlogged as a wet sponge.
* Strong headwind for two days as I rode interstate across the south. Mindless driving just made more exhausting.

 
High points:

* Yosemite was INCREDIBLE to ride through. Huge park and traffic that let me pass.
* The Pacific Coast Highway was exhausting but a joy to ride.
* Riding through Pennsylvania forests and rolling mountains at 2am with the “super moon” overhead while the light fog across the countryside glowed was magical.
* Redwoods were unbelievable.
* Zion National Park was beautiful, and I almost skipped it.
* Put $100 down on red in roulette in Vegas so that I’d have a good Vegas story. Turned out to be a great Vegas story, because I got red.
* Saw the Annular Solar eclipse from the Grand Canyon.

Additional notes:

* I switched between staying in hotels, with friends, and camping. One night was spent out on the ground outside a fireworks store in Michigan north of Toledo because I didn't feel like pitching the tent. Another night I pitched my tent next to a random field in Kansas. One day I met another touring rider heading to Flagstaff and we split a hotel room. I almost crashed with a Redditor in Cleveland but I was running behind schedule and stopped early.
* Replaced my front tire about two hours southeast of San Francisco.
* Visited Reddit HQ to get a photo with their logo.

So, the next question is, what is another trip that is equally epic? I’m hoping to come back to Microsoft next summer and, in August after the internship, ride from Seattle through BC to Alaska and ride the Dalton Highway up to Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, then turn around and head back to Iowa. It would be over 6000 miles and would probably take about 3 full weeks.

I'm in college and will be a senior next year - and while most of my friends have internships, I don't. I emailed 20+ companies and haven't had any luck. So I was talking with the head of my department the other day, and he suggested a company for me to contact, and to give  him as a reference. 



This is great, the only problem is that there is a girl from school that interns there as well. A girl whom I had (and still kind of do) a crush on. Over the past school year this girl and I had become really good friends (maybe we still are?) - until I asked her out about a month ago. Now we hardly talk anymore (whereas before we used to talk almost everyday), and things just feel awkward and weird now with her. 



So now I don't know what to do, the company is fairly small so I'd probably see her everyday. I don't know if I should tell her that I'm applying there, or if I should just apply and show up out of the blue. I feel like either way it'd make things weird, uncomfortable and that I'd come off creepy to her. 



And the thing is, I'd REALLY like to have an internship this summer -and so far, this is the only promising lead. Though not getting an internship this summer isn't the end of the world, in my profession - not having one leaves you at a serious disadvantage once you graduate. 




TL;DR - I have a potential internship opportunity at a company where a former crush who rejected me interns as well, and am unsure how to proceed. "

My grandfather died last easter. Both my parents were so busy when I was young I was basically raised by my grandparents (on both sides). I had exams around then and I fucked up. It was my first year at uni and I could retake without too much consequence.

This year things started ok, but went downhill fast. Nothing had gone well for me for a long time now (typical underachiever) and I started not doing work and just being apathetic overall. 

Recently, thanks to my dad, I managed to bag an internship over the summer. This really hit me and I realised how much of my university life I have thrown away. Exams are looming and I get more anxious every day, and more and more disappointed with myself for this year. With the amount of marks I have thrown away by not doing work, I am needing a very high average to merely pass.

During a phone call recently my dad heard the distress in my voice and turned up to chat with me. My whole family have always been so supportive of everything I do, even spending large amounts of money for me to go to a public school for a period of time when we were quite poor. I don't know how I can go about repaying my parents. I have been given every chance and I've failed them every time.

I haven't told anyone about this because I didn't want to be a burden. I wanted to be the guy that was mature and could handle everything, and be successful like so many others. Unfortunately it turns out I have been the most naive person around and I've lost a lot of confidence.

I'm looking at internships for fall, and I'm interested in a few which are more geared towards art/art history and definitely in the ""art world."" For example, like an auction house or antique dealer? My basic question is, do you think I would be hire-able as a history major rather than an art history major? More broadly, how does the concept of ""history"" connect to its specialties and how far can these connections go?

More details:
I interned last summer at a museum, I did a lot of work with objects in the collection (including art, mostly paintings) as the focus of inquiry for programs. I do like art, and have a basic knowledge of styles, periods, major artists, etc., so I'm not going to confuse Monet and Manet, but have not really studied at the college level. My school offers art/design history courses through the art school, not liberal arts. I can take these courses but the focus may be different.

In my mind, since this is an undergraduate internship especially, I think specialty is second to willingness to learn, and my major is not COMPLETELY unrelated to the matter at hand, but I could be wrong. **TLDR** would you consider hiring a ""regular"" historian for an art history job, or is the ""art"" part non-negotiable? How are all the specialties connected by the ""history"" tag?

Edit: I should add that the postings don't explicitly state or list as a requirement that applicants must be art/art history students, but some allude to it."

I've been watching a show where the protagonist breaks down and starts smoking (the Killing, it's a pretty good show) so that has something to do with it, but I think more has to do with a lot of guilt around something I did this weekend.

I was rambling about how I can't do this anymore, then I just sank to the floor where I sat sobbing and whimpering for a while.

As I write this I am lying in bed, unable to sleep, despite it being almost 3am. I feel like giving up. I don't know what more I can do. Nothing I do yields any positive results. The main thing that kept me going today was watching Firefly on Netflix. I just can't handle these feelings of failure and worthlessness anymore.

Edit: I just want to say thank you to everyone who took the time to read this post and to leave comments. Whoever and wherever you all are, thank you so much for your kind words and your support."

Im going to be moving to Vancouver from July - September for a nifty marketing internship. It doesent pay too well so I would probably need to stay with a roommate to be able to afford life in Van.

Wondering if any ents have a room to spare or know of any friends looking for a roommate. 

About me, Im a pretty chill guy. 21, Male, business student (fucking suit eh, I know)  If you want a room mate that will fuck off and just do his own thing, thats cool. If you are looking for someone who would be down to haze a j and play some fuckin games, I could be that guy too. Sports, fuck yeah. Watch some documentaries on quantum physics, OH HELL YEAH. 

Honestly, I'm easy going and could fit with most personality types. Even non-ents that you know of I would be happy to move in with.  

Thanks for reading, I appreciate any help

I need help thinking of what to do (description inside).,OnlyGoodIntentions,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uz1g0/im_living_in_an_apartment_for_the_summer_and_have/,"I'm doing an internship this summer, and came from where I was in college to stay in this apartment with my mom. Initially my mom said the place was great except the people above her ""walk hard"". Not only is this a vast understatement, but it's only the tip of the iceberg. They don't just walk hard, it usually sounds like a 350lb person is running around up there. It shakes the ceiling and light fixtures throughout the apartment and this goes on until the very wee hours of the morning. Although, this is not what annoys me the most. With the way the complex is set up you can see everyone's balcony from the back of the apartment. The balcony is right by where I sleep, and said person's balcony is obviously right above mine. Thus being right above where I sleep. As you guessed it she is usually out there until the wee hours of the morning talking/yelling at somebody. This is a daily occurrence. I know there is no possible way that I am the only one in the complex that is this annoyed by this as she has other neighbors. Just yesterday at 2:30 AM one of the people a couple balconies away came outside to  tell her to shutup because it was 2:30 and people were trying to sleep.         She listened right away, but all that meant for me was that she went back to stomping around. I could just make a complaint, but that's lame. I'm not looking for anything too malicious, but won't ignore any suggestions. I was just thinking of maybe writing a friendly passive aggressive letter acting like I was somebody important that worked with the complex, but wasn't exactly sure what to say. Reddit the floor is yours.
tl'dr: Very rude, inconsiderate person lives above me and I need to do something about it."

I would do a summer course but my program's fees are ridiculous, esp when adding summer courses to the mix. I've been searching for a clerical/data entry job for a while but nothing.

uyy5w,0,2012-06-12,Free Feasibility Analysis from a bored MBA candidate,[deleted],Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/uyy5w/free_feasibility_analysis_from_a_bored_mba/,"I’m bored, so help me help you!

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feasibility_study](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feasibility_study)

A feasibility study is a rough prototype for a business plan. It is significantly shorter, but it helps highlight specific challenges that a company may face. If you are creating a new product line or starting a new company, you need to start with a feasibility study. I've written a few, and I want to share my experience with others.

I am an MBA candidate, and I am halfway through the program, focusing on General Management and Entrepreneurship. My summer internship experience is… well… underwhelming. I am looking for ways to spice up my summer while gaining valuable experience to help my job prospects upon graduation.

I am offering to examine your feasibility study (or business plan) and provide at least 1 page of constructive feedback. This analysis will touch on operations, marketing, economic feasibility, corporate strategy, and any other relevant topic. If required, **I am willing to sign a confidentiality and non-compete agreement. If you don’t have one, I can provide a form.**

In return, I ask for the ability to advertise my contribution to the public (while respecting your privacy). If I do a great job, I would ask you to write a recommendation that will appear on my LinkedIn profile, among other locations.

A feasibility study should include the following information: 

* Concept overview/description 
* Executive Team 
* Marketing Plan 
* Operations Plan 
* Financial plan (if available)

If you would like me to review your feasibility study or business plan, or would like some help creating your own, please send me a message. I hope to complete 10 of these over the summer, and I hope that one of you become large enough to afford an MBA when you graduate.

They really are fun to write, so I hope you take the time to write one out and help me help you. 

Good Luck!

I've been depressed since High School, I was actually sent home because I ""frightened"" a classmate with how anxious I was.  I managed to get one degree from a community college and transfer to a real university. When I moved into this godforsaken college town it got even worse. I had cognitive slips, hallucinations and I tried to kill myself after losing an apartment (long story).  

I've posted in r/depression before, but now I think I just can't go on anymore.

I've concluded that life is in fact not worth living, but we keep ourselves alive chasing dreams and other people's expectations. I want out. I want no part of  this. I don't have any real dreams, none that I can realize anyway. I am totally incompetent in anything I try to do. I'm a lackluster student despite everyone saying I'm so intelligent and other things I can't believe. They are just lying to me to stop me from realizing how horrible I actually am.  But I already know. This month is anniversary of the first time I held a gun to my head. I've tried a few more times since then.

I'm bound to fail because I fear success, I think not trying to avoid failure is somehow better than risking it. But that is failure in itself. I feel like I can't even reason properly anymore. I'm walking around brain dead.

I have an internship too, but I'm being shouldered with way too much for just an intern (it is a small NGO, I'm literally one third of the organization). I'm so close to finishing this degree and this internship and all of this but I feel like I'm already out of energy to do anything with my life.

One day I'm afraid I will wake up with the world asking too much of me, and I will have nothing more to give. You could tell me that this is not resilience works, that this is not how effort works, but I can't believe you. I'm sorry reddit, but I feel very stuck, very confused right now.

I have been seeing a counselor but I think it has lost its effectiveness. I'm not motivated to change my behavior or my thoughts so I'm damned to sit here until I decide to improve things right? Right?

I can't. I don't want to. I want out. There is nothing to look forward to. I will never get married, I will never have kids because I can not bare the thought of anyone else being subjected to someone so terrible and unavailable as I am.

Maybe I'm just afraid of what happens next, but I've been afraid of everything, every waking moment of my life anyway. I don't know how I'm still alive. 

So tell me not to do it? Tell me to stick out this torture and wait until I graduate to do something?"
uyxv0,22,2012-06-12,Donating some older parts (Just pay shipping)d,neotriple,buildapcsales,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/comments/uyxv0/donating_some_older_parts_just_pay_shippingd/,"Well, apparently I destroyed my own post by clicking the Edit button!

Anyway, I'll attempt to re-add what I had before:

Hello everybody,

Unfortunately, my second computer that I ever built has recently broken. If this were 2-3 years ago, I would have attempted to fix it and bring it back to life. Unfortunately, as a college student with an internship and a waning interest in computers at the moment (though I am pursuing a similar path in college), I've decided rather than trash it / work on it, I would rather donate some parts to those in need.

Here's a little backstory before I get started; recently, the computer refused to boot up. My mother said (this was used for them), that they came back downstairs and one day it just wouldn't turn on. I replaced the PSU and video cards to no avail, so I narrowed it down to the motherboard as there was no POST error codes or warning beeps. As I took it apart, post throwing away the case and PSU, I decided I could just donate some of the parts as long as people are willing ot pay shipping. I have more computer stuff than just the computer that I will end up getting rid of, so I might update the post or start a new one as soon as things are organized.

For now, I will start with the RAM. It is a pair of OCZ nVidia SLi ready RAM: http://www.ocztechnology.com/ocz-ddr2-pc2-6400-sli-ready-edition-dual-channel-eol.html

They are DDR2-800 and they are 2 x 2 GB for a total of 4 GB. Like I said, they may actually end up being broken, but if you're willing to pay shipping and they work, they're obviously yours.

Next up is the HSF (sans F):

(Updated with pictures) http://imgur.com/a/eSagm

I believe it is a THermalright Ultra 120 Extreme HSF. Unfortunately, I don't have the 120mm fan, so it's just the Heatsink at the moment. It also only has the socket 775 adapter and the mounting screws (no backplate if it came with one). 

Please let me know if you're interested. I'd also love if they went to a place where someone would take care of the parts as they did, and still do, mean a lot to me.

Thanks :)"
uyxsm,5,2012-06-12,GRRRRR...,Recamen,MyLittleSupportGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyLittleSupportGroup/comments/uyxsm/grrrrr/,"So uh, lemme start off by saying that... I think people who say that you don't need luck to be successful are full of shit.

Why, you ask? See, a month ago I was getting ready to graduate. I had a full-time job lined up with the company I'd worked with part-time over the past year. The supervisor liked me, my coworkers liked me - hell, one person there, a lead analyst, gave me a recommendation on LinkedIn. I was happy. Everything was alright.

...Then next Tuesday rolls around. ""Sorry, but ah... we had a budget miscommunication. Your position's been cancelled."" I feel like the rug was fucking yanked out from under me. Sure, the other intern who worked in the same group gets a position (albeit elsewhere), but I don't!? Don't give me that ""luck doesn't matter"" bullshit.

Since then, I've been throwing out a grand total of 48 applications over this past month. Of those, you'd think that companies would WANT a guy who worked his ass off through a Master's program in Applied Mathematics WHILE WORKING PART-TIME FOR BOTH YEARS! You'd think that after the first year of being a statistical consultant for a whole bunch of thesis and dissertation students (and even one client from the nearby medical center!) and after the second year of working for said company above, I'd be set! WRONG, WRONG, WRONG. Sure, I get callbacks, maybe some even lead to phone screen interviews. Hah! I had three such screens between last Thursday and Monday, and what do I get? ""..."", ""..."", and ""Oh no, because you screwed up on ONE MEASLY PROBLEM you can fuck off.""

I'm just - maybe I'm overreacting. I realize it's only been a month, and there's plenty of time left, but I am beyond frustrated at the moment, and pretty much all on my own, and add it all up, and I'm not quite right in the head. No, I'm not a danger to anyone, but I can't think straight. I just feel like... like it's pointless! I sent out all these online applications, contacted people back if they didn't get back to me, and for what? Nothing! And this lease ends in August, and what then? I wind up living back with my parents? God, that would just crush me! I didn't go through six fucking years of school just to wind up back with my fucking parents and be put through all this bullshit!

And I can't help but feel like someone out there, somewhere, is lifting a giant bird to my face and jacking off to my anger. It-it's just... argh! It all makes me so furious, and I feel like all I'm doing with all these online applications is wasting time. It'd be great if I could do some actual, face-to-face networking, but I don't even know where to start. I'm going into my former university's career center on Thursday, but that involves waiting, and I absolutely despise waiting. And I still feel like even the network I DO have is letting me down. It's just... this wasn't supposed to happen to me. Someone's fucking with me, and I want to find them and punch them in the face."

-Should I include that I have authorization to work in the European Union due to having a UK passport? I was born and raised in the US but my dad was born in UK which entitled me to apply and get a UK passport. Most jobs I am applying for are in the US though. (I have been considering this something that I can answer if asked on the application, and can give this information if selected to go further in the application process, but not sure if necessary on the actual resume)

-Should I rethink the objective line? Should it be something I tailor to the requirements of the position I am applying for?

-I've been applying to entry level positions in the last couple of weeks, but based on my resume, should I reconsider and instead focus on applying for an internship despite being done with college? I.e. am I out of my league for what I am applying for?

I also have a cover letter which I start by saying that I am writing in response to X posting for Y position that I feel I would be a good fit for, and then second paragraph about how my experiences have demonstrated my abilities to communicate with all levels of an organization, my strong organizational skills, my leadership abilities, my strong attention to detail, and my ability to follow directions.

Too many people know my everyday account, so I'm using this one. 

Okay, so... Here's a run-down of some necessary facts:

* I graduated college recently with a Mathematics/Economics degree and $50k in loan debt.

* I currently make $35k/year and only work about 30 hours a month. I live outside of the city in the south, so $35k here is more like $45k-55k elsewhere. 

* My job is very easy, the people are laid back, and everyone loves me. I love everything about it except the pay.

* The corporation at which I am employed has a lot of opportunities for advancement.

* I really want to travel the world for 4-6 months.

* I have saved up about $11k since October '11, and I have another $10k in CDs. I know it isn't much, but it's what I have.

* I want to travel the world.

I started working at the company I'm at because it was convenient (my university is right down the street, and I started as an intern), and I ended up accidentally falling in love with everything about my job. I've never been paid so well for doing nothing all day, and I only have to go into the office 2 or 3 days per week.

I am severely underemployed. I know that; my managers know that; my co-workers know that. I turned down a job making $52k/year because I value(d) certain aspects of this job. Aside from those mentioned above, the corporation allows us to ""work from home"" whenever we feel like it. I saw this as an opportunity. I planned on establishing myself here as an asset. I wanted to see if I could ""work from home"" for 4 months while I traveled the world. I asked yesterday, and received my answer today: No. 

The answer wasn't simply ""no."" It was more along the lines of ""you haven't worked here for for a long time"" and ""if you were a [job position right above mine, same job description], then we could probably get away with it."" I'm not happy about their decision, but I have to respect it. 

I have been updating my CV/resume since I got my answer this morning. Right now, I'm deciding between the three choices in the title of this post. I don't know how much of a problem I'll have finding a job when I get back, but there is a strong possibility I may have a worse job.

I'm currently thinking I will keep working here, try to get that promotion, and ask again. Working from home while traveling the world is the ultimate opportunity for me right now. I have this idea that I'll put in my resume at a few other firms and I will only take another job if I make more than the equivalent of $55k/year where I live now (I will adjust for difference in cost of living). That's how much I value ""working from home"" and the atmosphere at the office. 

**TL;DR: At least read the damned bullet points before commenting. If you can't read that much, you won't have anything relevant to say.**

There's no karma for self-posts, so only downvote this if you must. I'd like to get a lot of input on this.

Ask me anything you'd like more insight into, and I will reply and edit this post to include the info."

I'm a 20-something WVU (West Virginia University) student; or I would be a student if I could still afford it. I had to withdraw from school for a year because I can't pay. I had hoped to re-enrol next year, if possible. I would be the first person in my family to graduate college. My mother didn't even graduate high school, so it's a big deal to me that I accomplish this.

I was (mistakenly) diagnosed with clinical depression about a year and a half ago, and put on meds for that. The meds did much more harm than good and for about a year I fell of the face of the earth. I didn't talk to family or friends, didn't leave the house, barely ate. I lost a paid internship working for the university as a writer (my dream job)

I'm now off the meds and trying to figure out how to fix my mess. My student loans are now going to collection and I can't even pay rent. I'm being evicted next month.

I am working a part time job, pick up every extra shift and double that I can, and I spend a couple hours every day walking around town applying to various places and visiting places I've already applied to, but no luck yet.

I owe $200 in student loans and $1500 in back rent.

**What I need:**

Mostly, I just need advice on how to fix this. Has anyone bounced back from something like this with a story to share? Are there any insiders from Sallie Mae with tips to deal with them? How do I avoid becoming homeless in a month? How can I make it back to school in a year? How do I become a functioning human again?

v21wu,18,2012-06-14,My personal experience on a polycultural farm.,clickapedia,Paleo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paleo/comments/v21wu/my_personal_experience_on_a_polycultural_farm/,"I recently returned from a brief stay and work internship on a polycultural farm and i figured you all would be interested in hearing some stories and analysis of what i observed.  Anyway the farm at which I interned was one that raised 100% grass fed beef, in addition to ""free range"" laying hens and broiler chickens. (preface, this farm was heavily modeled on the familiar salatin method, so comparisons are appropriate)

I'll start with the beef.  The cows were rotationally grazed, and allowed 1-2 days on the pasture before they were moved.  The cows had great health, and great physical stature.  I see grain supplemented cows on pasture near my house and they are lethargic and don't seem to graze as much, as a result of the grain satisfying their caloric desire.(this is a trend i noticed much more prominently with the chickens)  These cows were active and during moves and transfers to new pasture they would run and buck and expend all kinds of energy.  It was really entertaining to watch.  The pastures were allowed to recover fully before the cows returned, some to where the grass was up to shoulder height, of varying density, but always enough to keep the cows satisfied.  If they were reaching outside the fence line consistently, we knew it was time to rotate.  While this keeps them from lingering around their own manure for too long, it didn't entirely keep the cows free from disease.  Cows have a terrible lack of awareness when it comes to their bowel movements and it was not uncommon to see brown streaks down the side of cattle, and very rarely cases of eye infections, which i believe were comparable to pink eye, as a result of fecal matter getting in there.  However in all, the health of the heard was spectacular. It was not uncommon, so they informed me, to go a season with no losses due to health issues, although it had happened.  The cows were also fed a kelp mineral supplement, a salt supplement and another vitamin mixture.  Can't comment too much on the nature of that.

The Chickens and laying hens.  This is where i feel the community may benefit.
The laying hens were brown heritage varieties, and were allowed free range during the day time and penned in a mobile coup at night( yes this is very similar to the salatin method)  The laying hens were given 24/7 access to a grain/soy based feed.  This is what made me stand back and begin to look at things objectively.  At first I imagined foraging birds eating lots of bugs, however the reality of the situation is a bit more variable.  Often the birds spend large portions of the day inside the coup, or underneath seeking shade, forgoing the opportunity to forage.  Not to say some birds aren't very active and foraging, however it is not uniform.  It is safe to say that the persistent presence of supplemental feed diminished the desire of the hens to forage.  In this respect, i had higher expectations.  This was reflected in the overall health of the laying hens.  Deaths and illness were more common than in the cattle, but less so than in the meat birds.  It was expressed to me by the farmers that the feed seems to leave a lot to be desired and could be a cause for illness. What i've learned, and what i was originally suspicious of, is that birds labeled ""free range"" still strongly resemble factory raised eggs and chickens, in that the majority of their diet is grain/soy based and high in PUFA.  While forage may contribute to a more balanced quantity of polyunsaturated fats, i fear it may not be what most of us hope for.  Some would consider this nit-picky, and i myself feel it is as well, however i don't want to shun the opportunity for progress just by being placated by the ""free range"" title.  

The broiler chickens.  These birds were the standard cornish cross, meat specific birds.  They would receive large batches of several hundred chicks, days after birth and raise them in a confined room until they were big enough to pasture.  The broiler room, they called it, was required to be kept at a warm temperature, and the method for doing this, much to my dismay, was with propane burning lamps.  I was slightly concerned about the issue of burning large quantities of propane in a sealed room( about this i would love to hear more discussion, in addition to the possible nutritional shortfalls of a solely grain based diet for birds. ex: do they have the same requirements for SFA as we do?).  I would not have been so concerned, had it not been routine to wake up and find 5 or 10 dead chicks in the morning, out of a batch of several hundred.  I have heard it said that the cornish cross is a breed with which you can expect those kind of losses.  Their feed, from birth was also a standard grain/soy combo, and i feel this may have contributed to the losses.  When they were finally out on pasture in the salatin inspired cages, they were packed about 45 chickens in a square about 12x12 feet.  This was another concern.  At each move, which occurred daily, the chickens would have access to fresh greens and however many bugs can be found on a 12x12 patch of pasture.  However they were also given 24/7 access to the grain supplemental food, which for many of the birds altogether eliminated their inclination to forage.  It's also important to note, that as the chickens matured, and the space grew more limited, so diminished the quantity of forage per bird, and so increased the accumulation of waste.  Often by morning the square was caked thick with waste, in which the birds lingered through the night.  Casualties were not uncommon as a result of general illness.  It should be noted that these birds, upon harvest, carried a sizeable visceral fat deposit, more reminiscent of a factory farmed bird than a wild bird.  

I know this is not news to most people, that farms fall anywhere on a spectrum in terms of their dedication towards profit seeking or market vaibility, versus their desire to create the highest quality product.  I really hope to prompt more discussion of the differences in the market, to make people aware that sometimes the ""free range"" title is not what the label hopes to convey, and to acquire input on what people feel the ideal diet is for poultry, based on the assumption that foraging for bugs and greens can only fulfill a certain percentage of nutritional and caloric requirements for poultry or pork.  Does anyone have any studies in a similar vein to the tokelaun study, where they observe the effect of diet on the end composition of poultry/pork/(even beef, as it would be nice to be able to enjoy a marbly steak without the pufa concern)  I remember reading that their pork was unusually low in PUFA as a result of their feeding tubers as a primary calorie source.  

TLDR open discussion about best livestock rearing practices, staple feed crops and the quality of the final product."

You know the story:  ""I just moved here from a place blah blah blah no real crime blah blah.""  

I live in the Mt. Pleasant area, and the locals here don't seem very intimidating or threatening.  But by locals, I'm guessing mostly Hispanics of different types with a sprinkle of white and black folk.  Though, sometimes there looks like a sketchy type of person.

Unfortunately, due to my work (having a job is fortunate, though!) I always look professional with nice shoes.  It makes me look like I have money, and therefore, I think, a target.  Hopefully I just come off as an unpaid intern, though.  

What I'm doing so far:
1.  Minimize pulling out my smart phone.  It's in an otterbox, so it looks like an older iPhone.  

2.  Keep my eyes to the ground, not making eye contact.

3.  Have an angry-face/""I'm not in the mood for shenanigans"" face.  

4.  Not look like I just moved here/am a tourist.

5.  Not go out at night on rarely traveled streets.  I tend to go only where there's lots of people walking, and I'm not out very late.


I keep reading around on safety, and the general consensus is ""don't be a moron and you'll be okay.""  Well, instructions on not being a moron seem pretty vague to a person who's never really had to worry about being mugged.  

Is there anything I'm missing?  Or is what I have incorrect?"

",ClairdeWhimsy,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/v1ojn/tifu_by_going_21000_miles_without_an_oil_change/,"My car has been making this weird noise for a couple of weeks, you see, and when I was Advanced Auto with my husband yesterday buying a new battery for his vehicle, I asked the nice man if he wouldn't mind taking a look. I turned the car on, it began making its death rattle, he popped the hood and said, ""You ever seen those sludge commercials on TV?"" And proceeded to show me exactly how much sludge my engine had accumulated. My husband asked, ""When was the last time you got an oil change?"" I looked at the little sticker in the window. ""Um...last May...."" The mileage when I had it changed last: about 128,000 miles. The current mileage: about 149,000. The Advanced Auto man suggested I go to Snappy Lube first thing in the morning to get everything flushed. 

And this morning the Snappy Lube people didn't want to touch it because the death rattle was coming from the bottom of the engine. He was nice, though; he didn't charge me for the three quarts of oil he put in my car. He said that I had bigger problems to worry about. So I took it to the garage next door where a gentlemanly mechanic with a rough face and sympathetic eyes told me that the timing belt was about to snap off and the cam shaft was totally warped. **Fuck. Me. Sideways.**

*Why can't you just pay to have it repaired?""* you ask. Good question. I have a **2001 Saturn.** And because Saturn decided that GM parts simply weren't good enough, I can only use other Saturn parts, which doubles the cost of ALL repairs. My repair cost would be upwards of **$2600** for a car that is literally only worth **$500.**

*But what does this have to do with an oil change?* you might ask. Well, boys and girls, oil keeps all the little parts in the engine from rubbing against each other, and when there's no oil they grind together. The heat of the friction raises the temperature in the engine and things start to warp. The bright side is that my car doesn't have enough power to pop a piston through the head. 

*And why are you so fucked?* you ask? Other than the fact that I'm 100% responsible, I don't have the money for another car. I make enough to buy groceries, gas, and to pay my student loans each month. My husband and I will have to empty what little savings we have to get a car. My father-in-law, who is a fucking *genius* at negotiating, is in Mexico visiting family for the next three weeks. My husband just finished the school year (he's a teacher), summer **just* started on Monday, and this is the first thing he has to deal with. I'm almost three weeks into a new internship (paid, thank God), so this looks brilliant to my employers. And did I mention this is **100%** my fault?

-----------------------

I'm from Hong Kong, China. I just finished high school last year(graduated in 2011). Didn't end up going to university due to financial reason. I starting working at an mobile app company as an intern getting paid below Hong Kong minimum wage(roughly 2 USD/hr), improving my programming skills. Ended up making the first iOS app for the company within my 2 months there. I was then later hired as a freelancer to make several other apps(Based on existing Android apps). 

Skip toward Dec of 2011, the company's boss approached me asking if I could develop an audio equalizer app for his friend's company. They had hired a freelancer(probably from Asia too) but ended up not making anything that worked despite working on it for 2 months. The catch was they needed it done fast because they already put the app's screenshots on the packaging for a new brand of speakers they were going to sell in the next month.

I loved a good challenge, and since I had no idea how to do it, decided to tackle it. They offered 5,000HKD (645 USD) and being a rather novice programmer and not 100% certain I could pull it off, I took the offer and started working on it(From scratch). The time frame was roughly 13 days. I overall spent 11~15 hours working on it. And was able to finish it before the deadline. Client wasn't happy with the fact that it had several bugs. I spent another day fixing it until they were satisfied. It's on average the top 150 free music app on US App Store.

Skip towards last month, they wanted an Universal(iPhone/iPad) build,a new UI look, custom playlists, shuffle and some other basic features. I gave them a quote and it later became a 6,800HKD project. (874 USD) Now I'm supposed to done, the project's deadline has past. But the client wants some bugs fixed, which some are the result of my doing, thus I fixed them. 

I'm also taking part-time distance learning courses in a local university to continue my education in Computer Science. And giving most of my income to my family(Dad got laid off from his previous job during my senior year). 

I'm at the point where I realize I'm seriously charging too little for what I do. Although the local wages for a programmer is around 10~15k HKD (1300USD~1900USD) per month. So it already seems lower than what one would get if he/she was in the States. I've also realized how working in this environment is going to give me bad practices. Due to the time constraints and lower pay, I can't afford to spend time to write any documentation or keep up with good practices for programming. 

Being in Asia seems to be one of the factors I charge a lower price as everyone around the area seems to be charging low. The clients I have are all located in Hong Kong with foreigner bosses. 

---------------------------------------

So my question is how much should I be charging? I'm considering looking for other freelance opportunities outside my region just to get a higher pay. The downside of that is I'm slightly hesitant in making deals with people I can't see face-to-face. 

As to the audio equalizer apps I've made. It's free on the app store. Just search for Sonic _____ Equalizer. (Don't want to put the full name to reduce a bit of searching) There's only one app with the names Sonic and Equalizer together, so should be an easy find. The current version on the app store has memory leaks every time a new song is played. (Leaks 0.30mb every song) It also only plays at a sample rate of 441000 thus any audio files not with that rate would have skipping issues. It also creates an unnecessary amount of buffer (160mb of virtual memory created for a 3 min song). Those issues are fixed in the version I'm working on. 

PM me if you need links to any other apps I've made for my clients(Or proof). I find myself unable to get my own ideas into actual polished products, but I can do so for others, thus I haven't yet made any apps myself. 

------------------------------------

Would love to have some critque/advice on my situation. (First time posting a submission)

EDIT: **TL;DR Built app that is in top 150 music US App store on average for 645 USD, is wondering how much I should be charging considering my abilities to make such an app**

I might as well put the link to the app I made to save everyone's precious time. http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sonic-junky-equalizer/id493494025?mt=8

v1cjv,7,2012-06-14,"Looking for a place to live (for trade/barter/low rent, etc.) More info on the inside... [potential wall of text]",dwinian,memphis,https://www.reddit.com/r/memphis/comments/v1cjv/looking_for_a_place_to_live_for_tradebarterlow/,"So. . . I am a Memphis native who moved out west for college. I recently returned to Memphis because I believe in the potential of the city in improving its environmental friendly-ness and growth of the small-scale agriculture sector. I was worried about crime rates, having to live at home with the parents, etc., but because of my sector (green living and sustainability) I moved back because I feel our wonderful city is at a tipping point of becoming more ""green"" for lack of a better blanket term. 

Also, I got a kickass internship at an urban farm of sorts, and its a great way to get my foot in the door of the green living and buy-local infrastructure. 

The problem is that this is a no-pay internship, and while I really enjoy certain aspects of living at home (free food, free rent, relatively chill parents), there are others that I don't like ( not being able to bring a girl over to spend the night, having to go to church with my softcore-fundy parents, less freedom, having my wonderful parents nag me about my bedtime even though I'm 22, etc.). 

I would really like to find a fellow Memphis resident who I can work out a living deal with in exchange for goods, services, etc.. That is to say, if you are elderly(etc.) and need help with yard stuff, or getting groceries from time to time, we could trade services. I could help getting those groceries, doing those chores, etc. 

OR if you own land outside of memphis that you would like watched over to ensure that no dumb teenagers go mudding in your fields, and you would also like a vegetable garden planted, etc., I could be your grounds keeper of sorts if you allowed me to put up some sort of temporary structure like a canvas tent or yurt. 

OR if you are a kind soul who would like to trade the shitty garage in your backyard and have me turn it into a low rent ($1-200 a month) place to live in, that would work as well. 

Point is, I'm looking for an unconventional housing arrangement if any of you kind, kind, kind redditors would be willing to accommodate a fellow hard-working, responsible, low-key Memphian find a place to live/stay for between 3 months and a year (or maybe more). 

I would love to speak with you.  

TL;DR- I would like to live on my own, but because I'm working an unpaid internship, I can't. If there are fellow Memphis folks who might be able to help me out and give me a stay for trade, barter, or labor, the power of reddit would once again be confirmed.

Sorry if any of this is incoherent. Long day at the farm. "

However I am stuck in the states with my own summer job and I was curious if you girls and boys had any suggestions/ideas for a surprise I could do for her while she was over there??

This is what I was thinking up, 
I was going to mail here a card and in it would be a letter,  gift certificate for both dinner and so that she could go out to a bar with her friends, I was also thinking about getting flowers delivered to her the same day. This is the first website i stumbled on that delivers in London, http://www.serenataflowers.com/. 

The idea behind this would be being able to take her out to dinner and buy her a drink in London even though I am not there, all this would also be explain in the letter.

So my question is WHAT ELSE CAN I DO AND OR DO YOU HAVE SUGGESTIONS, and what do you think of my current idea?

EDIT: she is just there for the summer for a JOB she doesn't go to school there"

The ad said I'd learn about some online marketing graphic design, and html. I did barely any html, which is what I really wanted to learn. But that's ok, things were going good, and I got hired! I've done a decent amount of graphic design since then but only because no one else was available and we had deadlines, but my boss doesn't like me doing that because he wants me to learn SEO. Ok, sure, it's great to know and I'm trying! But I'm really really struggling. This isn't what I expected to be doing and my boss seems to think I should be on top of everything.

I've been given 14 clients, and I'm freaking the fuck out. I haven't been given a day to collect the information about the clients or organize shit. But still I'm supposed to know exactly what they all need from me and how to do it. This week my boss somewhat jokingly threatened to fire me(he said something like it might not work out if I don't get it), and my coworker was there and she was like, ""you don't have to threaten her like that.."" and she keeps telling him to cool the fuck down because he's pushing me to know everything when I just started. I don't know about SEO. The two months I was there the most I did was some content writing for the actual employee's clients and uploading new pages and shit. I didn't get a good lesson on SEO, or any text to study from them(which is ok, I should do that myself) but I need time to get shit together! 

I'm scared I'm going to get fired. I almost cried at work today because my boss seems so shocked and frustrated with me when I don't know how to do stuff. Which is stupid, he saw my resume, I know illustrator and photoshop and some html. Not SEO. My coworker is nice, at least. She wants me to look up better ways of doing things because she's not too informed about SEO stuff either(and she's the only SEO person..) but she knows it's difficult to learn and doesn't make me feel like shit for not magically knowing all this.

Fuck. If i lose this job I don't know what I'm going to do. I need this job.

Right now he's away at an internship for the whole summer so we're long-distance again.

Last night, even before this morning, he suddenly only started responding to my IMs every fifteen or so minutes, while I was talking about how nervous I was for my job interview, and when I asked him why, he said he was video chatting with his friends. I said, ""You could've told me that so I'd know now isn't a good time,"" and got a bit upset.

I've had good responses from my cover letter format, so I figured I would share it with you.  By ""cover letter"" I mean ""what I put in the body of my email when I send over my resume""

Example 1:

&gt;Hello!  I saw your job listing on LinkedIn, and it seems very interesting.

&gt;I've spent my first year out of college at [a company similar to your own] out in the suburbs [*this application is for a job in the city; getting out of the suburbs is a goal I have, and helps explain why I'm job hopping after just a year*], and thus I already have some experience with the business needs of [this type of company].  

&gt;Almost the entirety of my programming experience has been [applicable to your requirements], and when it comes to the ""Mac vs PC"" debate, I'm certainly on the [side you favor].  Although I've been out of college for a year, I try to continue to learn, through fascinating TED talks, more structured events such as the [local industry applicable event 1] or the [non-local industry applicable event 2], and small free-time projects to deepen my understanding of various [industry applicable] concepts.  I love the idea of being able to [reference from the job description]; whether it's [general accomplishment], or on a snazzy [project that the company mentions on their website].  And, apart from the oft rambling nature of my emails, I think that I am a precise and efficient communicator.

&gt;The job listing noted that a sense of humor is a must.  This is rather difficult to portray through formal email, especially since I'm particularly fond of puns, which tend to work better when communicated verbally.  Because this position looks so exciting, I'm sure you will be getting lots of applicants, many (or most?) of whom will have cover letter skills superior to my own.  So, as incentive for my resume to not be discarded too hastily, I'd like to inform you that I know a really fantastic joke about tea.  If I get an interview, you may get an opportunity to hear it.

&gt;Thanks for your time, I look forward to hearing from you,

Example 2:

&gt;Hello! I saw your job listing on LinkedIn, and it seems very interesting.

&gt;I suppose I ought to be blunt: I don't yet have phenomenal [technical skill crucial to the job] chops. 

&gt;But I am extremely eager to learn.

&gt;I've spent my first year out of college out in the suburbs at a [semi-related company], but I'm looking to work in the city, and continue my personal and technical growth.

&gt;I've been told I'm smart. I went to a top engineering school that has impressively low name recognition. Although I've been out in the ""real world"" for a year, I try to continue to learn, through fascinating TED talks, more structured events such as the C [local industry applicable event 1] or the [non-local industry applicable event 2], and small free-time projects to deepen my understanding of various programming concepts. I love the idea of working on a team of people who [reference to description of how their teams work], and who [more of the same]. And as for humble [*which they are looking for*], I suppose my tendency to talk about group accomplishments, rather than individual ones, points to some sort of impressively humble spirit.

&gt;Although I probably wouldn't be the rockstar [previously mentioned undeveloped technical skill] you need right away, I would certainly try my hardest to quickly become an important member of your team. I've already had some experience with [unusual technology mentioned in job posting], I really enjoy [technology from job posting], and almost all of my experience has been with [technology from job posting].

&gt;Thanks for your time,

&gt;NAME

Example 3 (and the first one I wrote, probably the weakest)

&gt;Recruiter name,

&gt;This job posting popped out at me because it deals with the [industry my job would be supporting]. I believe that an understanding of the industry you are supporting is important for a [job title], and I think that my interest in [field related to that industry] makes me a bit more knowledgeable than the average candidate in this far too [industry] illiterate world.

&gt;Although I have spent my college summers doing internships, I have only spent one year being a developer in the ""real world."" However, I do have experience, both in my professional life and in my free time, with the technologies you've listed, and so believe I have the skills necissary to fill a [that position], and the passion required to continue to learn and excell.

&gt;Thanks for your time,

&gt;NAME

You can send out resumes willy-nilly without much effort, and hope one sticks, are you can carefully craft your cover letters to ensure that your resume will at least be looked at by a recruiter.  I hear stories of people who send out 50 resumes, and hear back from 2.  I've only sent out 5 or so, and I've heard back from **everyone**.  After all, you don't need interviews with 15 not-quite-ideal companies.  You need offers from one or two.

So, put some thought into the search, and good luck!"
v10it,9,2012-06-13,Medium business LAN issue forces restart of router 3-4 times a day,niwtsol,networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/v10it/medium_business_lan_issue_forces_restart_of/,"**TL;NGR**I have ~50 people on a LAN through a cisco router. It works fine most of the day until a random blackout knocks everyone off and I have to unplug the router to reboot and everyone is fine for a few hours.  


I am so stumped by this issue and I have stayed many a nights at the office trying to fix this to no end: I really hope you guys can teach me a lesson on this one. 

Background: I just moved from a large company to a small start up. At the large company I had nothing to do with networking, so I am definitely a little rusty on this.  I was an MIS major and have dabbled in home networking (mostly just LANs for gaming and a few labs on networking in college). I helped fix the network when it went down about a week into the job and I am now unofficially dubbed the network administrator. 

Scenario: The company was about 25 people large when I started, we are now at around 50 people. Additionally, we have around 5-10 interns that can come in and out throughout the day. We have 40 people on one floor and 10 people sit on the 2nd floor. We are a tech startup so everyone has at least one computer connected and using the internet all day. 

Current configuration: We have business class internet 50 down/50 up (I have already made the argument we should upgrade, but I do not think that is the problem). The main router is a Cisco WRVS4400N. I have one wireless network (call it wireless1) running off of this router. The four ports are then wired to the following:

*  25 foot cable connecting to a Cisco SG 100-16 gig switch. I have 15 laptops connected to this switch. 
*  10 foot cable to a board that powers a ethernet port in a conference room ~60 feet away. I then have this power a NetGear prosafe 24-port gig switch. 5 computers are directly connected to this. Another cable runs off of this switch to another Cisco SG 100-16 switch - 11 computers connected.
*  10 foot cable to closet to power a distant ethernet port. This ethernet port is connected to a 10/100 switch powering the only desktop -light usage - this desktop has a Static IP Mapping of 192.168.1.5 and a Wireless Access point (ip 192.168.1.3). This wireless access point is a Cisco WAP4410N. I put this on a new ssid (call it wireless2). 
*  10 foot cable connected to closet to power distant ethernet port. Then a ~120 foot cable to get to the 2nd floor workspace. This is connected to a NetGear 10/100 16 port switch. All users in this workplace are wired (some of them leave wireless on, but it is spotty connection through cement floor). 

Router settings - took off security to speed it up, 1 static ip address mapped, DHCP enabled starting at .20, maximum dhcp users 200. client lease time one day, internal reserved ip 1-10. 

Problem: The LAN has an uptime of about 95%, the problem/main frustration is that at least 3-6 times a day we have a blackout. It can start on wireless or wired and within 1 minute of someone saying ""internet is out"" everyone losses their connection. Everyone is still connected to wireless1 or wireless2 and people still have DHCP supplied IP addresses. Trying to ping the router results in a time out. 

Solution - Since I can not access the router's admin page, I have to manually unplug the router, plug it back in - forcing a reboot. Once it is back up, we are good for a few hours until it flips again. 

Other things to note:

* When I am in the office late at night, I never experience a blackout. The majority of blackouts happen when there are a lot of people on the network, but this is not a 100% true. Today, everyone left early for an event and with only about 14 people (7 in main room, 7 wired in the other room) it blacked out. 
* When I first arrived the entire network was on 2 wireless points and no one was wired. Wireless got really bad so I started trying to wire everyone (40+ people downloading and uploading on two WAPs seemed like a bad idea). 
* Some of the cables were really shitty cat5 cables that the Cisco switches could not recognize, everything is now 5e or 6. 
* I changed everything one night to mostly wires and then 4 SSID networks. When a blackout occurred in this setup, I could still access the router's admin page and reset it from the web interface. We then got the Cisco switches, made some changes, and now we are back to blackouts. 
* I try to monitor the LAN and ARP pages throughout the day to see if we are encroaching the 200 IP limit, but it does not appear we get close (I am a little hesitant to believe these maps show all ips connected). 
* Twice I have seen the ""the ip your computer is using is already in use on the network"" message. I hit okay, grab a new IP and everything is fine, no blackout. 

My main question - wtf is happening? I feel that everything is set up correctly as we fly for most of the day (it does not gradually slow down and then off, just poof, off, no warning just gone). I have turned on the logs but I do not know enough (do these stay populated through a reset?) to understand every line in them. Additionally, with 50 users it gets bloated fast. There is no indicator light on the router to let me know what is up. And the quick reset makes me think it is something really stupid I am overlooking. 

Any help, guidance, thoughts, anything is greatly appreciated at this point.

so my boyfriend and i are both in college and he is leaving for the 3-month period. not too long of a time but it goes from being able to see each other every day to not at all. we're also not the best at communicating online/through phone.

i really don't want to ruin things again because of my insecurities or dependency and want things to stay as great as they are, but i can feel myself start to get clingy about everything. i do have an internship and job that will keep me relatively busy, but i am staying in the town where my college is so most people i know are gone for the summer, so i don't even have many friends around to hang out with. anyone have any advice?

TL;DR - boyfriend is leaving for the summer, as well as friends and am afraid of being too clingy and ruining the good relationship because of the summer."
v0xn3,0,2012-06-13,"My parents are not paying my education anymore. As an international student, what can I do?",severedlimbs,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/v0xn3/my_parents_are_not_paying_my_education_anymore_as/,"To give some background info, I'm a Canadian of Asian descent studying in the USA. First semester of freshman year, I made close to a 4.0 GPA. I was depressed and miserable in high school so I really tried to make an effort to motivate myself to have a fresh start in university and I guess I succeeded in doing that. The second semester, I retreated back to my high school depressed state and made a 2.55. I was unable to sleep, unable to get up, unable to concentrate on anything. I admit that it felt easier to use alcohol and weed to escape from my problems instead of dealing with it personally. From my marks, my parents have come to the conclusion that I am spending tuition money on drugs, sleeping around, having multiple boyfriends, getting STDs, making terrible friends, etc. Truthfully, I haven't even had a real relationship yet nor am I desperate for one. But they're jumping to all sorts of conclusions about me. Whenever my mom questions and I answer truthfully, her reply is ""Maybe you are, maybe you aren't, only God knows."" It's absolutely infuriating. 

My parents never really pushed me in my education in the way Asian parents stereotypically do. They didn't know much about SATs or AP tests, I just asked them to write me a cheque to pay the test fee. Now  my mom has been trying to educate herself about college and asking other parents. Basically whatever her suburban mom/white baptist church friends tell her, she takes as the truth. Oh, the school my daughter is attending is a party school? She must be doing hard drugs and sleeping around like everyone else then. Oh, your son worked his way to pay for college? Well I guess my daughter should too. Oh, your daughter is in charge of her church group? My daughter is a disappointment and needs to find God to set her life straight. 

As an international student, my options are limited. Last year, my visa did not allow me to work at all. I recently changed to the student visa where I can only work on campus (part time) and at an internship in my relevant major that's approved by the school. Of course I'd want to work for my own money, but part time jobs aren't going to generate enough income for me to pay tuition and housing and still support other expenses. I guess if i didn't screw up my second semester I wouldn't be in this position. But alas, I can't take back the past and need to find a solution for this before my first tuition payment is due.

I probably won't get financial aid (although I did apply just in case). Aid packages should have been posted in May but I still haven't gotten any notifications online so I think the chances are slim. I did some research about loans and I need a co-signer who is a US citizen but I don't know anybody who would be willing to accept such a position. I contacted a previous instructor in my university who says I could possibly do some lab work for $10/hr part time next year. In the instance that I could do 20 hours a week, that's only $800 a month. My tuition is ~$9000 (I pay in state) and housing is ~$7000 for the entire year. The part time job would provide me with $4800 if I worked 2 semesters. That doesn't even cover half. 

Before anybody suggests that I try to talk things over with my parents and explain my side, they are very clear and very stubborn about how they view me. Believe me, I've tried. Anything I say will be responded to with ""Maybe you do, maybe you don't, only God knows"". '

tl;dr: Gotta support myself for 3 years in school. International student. What are my options?"

I am currently an undergrad planning on applying to D.D.S. programs in a couple of years.  

The schools I am interested in attending dedicate the last two years of education to the clinical environment, with students performing procedures on patients.  

My question is this (and please excuse any potential naivete or ignorance here):

As these last two years serve as the student's internship (akin to a doctor's internship), is there any fee-for-service generated which benefits the student aside from the educational aspect?  

I know that the schools must charge patients something for the procedures, and even though I have a feeling that those fees go to the school and the doctors overseeing the procedures, I thought I'd ask.

Thanks for your help!

Got a good head on my shoulders I'm told by most people (outside of my family). I am attending a university towards a commerce degree.

But honestly, living at home blows donkey dick. I am the youngest of many siblings, all of which already have their lives set out (ie. married with children). I constantly feel under pressure to meet their expectations, when I fuck up, I hear about it from 20 different sources. This has crippled me and made me quite insecure in my mind, on the exterior however, I'm still the happy go-lucky kid. I want to move out and just spend the summer away from home working and doing my own thing. I've even accepted an unpaid internship just to have an excuse to leave.

I'm all down for disobeying family authority but here is the tough part. My parents are retired and getting above in the years. 70+. Its not like I have to physically take care of them, they are (thankfully) healthy and wealthy.

To them, my departure is taken as an abandonment rather than a way for me to develop some independence. They help me financially which I appreciate to a certain extent. It has also stunted some skills which I believe I have to develop through my own struggles. I cant better myself without a struggle.

I try to explain this, they don't get it (cultural differences). Looking for an outsider perspective on how to be able to be independent without being too harsh on them.

TL:DR Controllingish parents. Large amounts of family pressure / analysis. Want to get the fuck away and do my own thing without doing it on bad terms. Also, cultural difference. I'm a born and raised Canadian, they are from the Mid.East."

As a college student during the Great Recession my income and job opportunities are sporadic and hard to come by. I live mostly on loans and savings from these few job opportunities. My university classes require a lot of time and internships that sometimes make it impossible to work for pay. I have one of those ""recession proof""/""smart"" majors (at the university U.S. News ranked #5 in the nation for teaching it) so in the long run I am not too worried about this debt.

Should I stay in [Grad] school, considering that I'm pretty sure it's not what I want to do with my life?",genericwit,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/v0sch/im_at_the_end_of_my_rope_should_i_stay_in_grad/,"So here are the details.  I'm currently in school to get my MSW at a fairly rigorous university.  I originally wanted to be a therapist, given that I've struggled with depression/anxiety/dysthymia/substance abuse in the past.  I excelled in my undergrad program, and majored in Psychology.  I take a full course load and work at an internship three days a week.  

And it's making me absolutely miserable.  The only thing I've really learned is that I don't want to be a social worker.  I don't want to be responsible for other people's benefits, entitlements, happiness, or lives in any way shape or form.  Part of this has to do with the fact that I'm still struggling with my own issues.  I thought my depression and anxiety were better controlled, but being in this program have caused them to come back full swing.  I can barely get out of bed, and more frighteningly, have been thinking a lot more about suicide.  Fantasies of suicide have become a comfort [this is not new for me, and I'm not going to kill myself--they're just fantasies].  Oftentimes, I can barely concentrate due to stress.  I've completely lost my passion for this--I thought I'd be able to help people with problems like mine, but I'm still far from well, and what's more, I've lost the will to help others.  I don't get any fulfillment from the counseling I do within the bounds of my internship.

The problem is, from time to time, it gets better.  For a few weeks at a time, usually, I'm not miserable.  Not happy, but not miserable.  What's more, I feel like I'm trapped.  I'm 24, and I'm terrified that if I don't get my MSW, I'll have no other means to support myself--and social work isn't a profession to get into for the money.  I have no idea what I'd do to make a living otherwise, though.

My parents are supporting me, and paying for school, so I also feel guilty that if I don't end up getting my MSW then I'm wasting my parents money.

So, Reddit, what do you think?"

I thought I'd help the time pass a bit faster. Ask me anything you'd like about my experience working for the Broncos, about the NFL in general, or your favorite team.

Some good notes about my time with the team to start things off:

1.) I was with the team in 2004, and it was a heck of a club. We had some great players like John Lynch and Rod Smith, and a great coaching staff.
2.) Although the job was an internship, I did all the same work as the two other guys who wrote for and worked the web (Mike Sarro, who's out in Boston now if I understand correctly, and Andrew Mason, who runs Max Denver Sports). This included locker room media sessions, pressers, and day to day web updates. I was the only video photojournalist. Though Andrew helped me with some editing duties, for the most part I shot and edited all practice and gameday footage (including all on field footage during games).
3.) My office was at the team headquarters at Dove Valley, just down the hall from Mr. Bowlen's.

As proof, I give you a pic of my preseason security pass for team headquarters.

I got to know her a bit and she's really nice and friendly and had a lot to say, but I guess her initial demeanor (not just my boss, but other colleagues have mentioned too\) was a bit of a turn off to people as she just sort of expected you to talk to her.

My first interview went well:

- He said I was really prepared (I wrote notes of various talking points and questions to ask)   
- He noticed that I was shy and commended me on overcoming my shyness   
- He said it was great that I can write (I wrote for my school newspaper)   
- When I asked, ""What makes you think I'm a good candidate for this position?"" he responded, ""The fact that you just asked that question.""

I'm switching fields straight out of college so I didn't even expect to hear back for a paid internship in my new field.

Besides delving more into research about the company and maybe coming to the interview with some sort of writing portfolio, what specific things can I do to impress them?"

I am a recent graduate with a bachelors degree in International Studies/Government with a minor in Political Science looking for a meaningful job in the Tampa area to start off my career. I have been doing things in the community that have me happy to do, but they do not pay the bills.

I currently have a job, never went a time with out one in the past 6 years; No criminal history, and I am able to attain security clearance. While as I was a student, I had internships with my local Congressman and with the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General

What sort of jobs I would be most interested in doing is work in Intelligence, a government office in town, or as an executive assistant where I can flex my knowledge of our international world but not exclusively pertaining to.

I am a very honest, hard working, and tenacious 24 year old looking for some sort of break.

I'll be glad to receive some direction.  :)

v3oe2,8,2012-06-15,Accurate Estimation Methods with Small Sample Size,DeathbyToast,statistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/v3oe2/accurate_estimation_methods_with_small_sample_size/,"Hello r/statistics!

I have an interesting problem that I have been told is nigh impossible to solve.  I feel like if anyone on the Internets knows how to do this, its you guys!

I am an intern at a software company that works with data.  Lots of data.  I am talking about analyzing petabytes of data.  Reading in all of the data simply isn't an option for me because it would take days to complete that task.  I have been given a few hours for my script to run which means that I will have a sample size of at most 5% of the population.

My challenge is to use this 5% of the data on a specific hard drive and predict what the contents of the rest of the hard drive are.  For simplicity's sake I've modeled the ""data"" as random integers (for NDA reasons I can't go into why, but just trust that this is an accurate assumption for the data on the drives).  My job is to count the number of duplicate integers in my sample, and come up with a % that represents the % of duplicates on the entire hard drive.

I've made a basic simulation of this in excel, the file is [available here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0br99qhfvmnk42k/4B23NLVyhn/Example%20Data.xlsx)

There are two sheets in that file, the first is my analysis on the ""population"" aka the entire drive, which has 71% duplicate entries.  In the second page, I ""sampled"" the first 500 integers and ran the same analysis (sorted the entries in column B, then removed the duplicates in column C).  The trouble is, my sample results in 7% duplicates being counted.  This is...well...not correct.

That's where I'm hoping someone here can help me out.  I was looking at [Wikipedia's estimation theory entries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_theory#Estimators), and that was just plain confusing.  For my background, I've taken AP Stats (tutored it for a few years) as well as two college level Statistics courses, one was Probability Models for Economic Decisions (lots of excel modeling) and the other was Probability and Stochastic Processes for Electrical Engineers (I'm a Computer Engineering major from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo).  Anywho, I have a solid, but basic, understanding of statistics.  I have not however, done any sort of estimation theory (which as far as I can tell is where this needs to go).

I am not looking to hire a consultant for this project, I am just looking for some pointers as to what methods I should be researching (I have the next 10+ weeks to figure this out, I just need to know where to start my research!)

Thank you very much in advance for any and all help that you are willing to offer :)

And for those of who with short time (I can't blame you for not reading the above essay)




**tl;dr**
Need help with estimating population with a sample size of &lt;5% of the population.  Trying to count duplicate integers as shown in [this excel sheet](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0br99qhfvmnk42k/4B23NLVyhn/Example%20Data.xlsx) 





**edit**
Thank you everyone for the responses!  I'll take a look at the methods suggested and post any feedback questions that arise.  I've tried to answer/respond to everyone, and please feel free to post any other questions you may have.  I greatly appreciate all of the help!

Also, my primary focus right now is getting the model in my excel sheet to work.  With the knowledge I have about my problem as it is right now, this is a close model to the actual data I will be analyzing.  Thanks again!

**SOLVED**
Turns out those who mentioned the birthday problem were on to something!
By solving for ""d"" in the equation given here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem#Collision_counting and then doing 1-d/total, where total is the total amount of numbers in my population, I can get within 5-10% accuracy the number of duplicates that exist in my population from my sample.

Example: My range of numbers is 1-4444, I used a sample size of 500, and a population size of 10,000.  Then d was estimated by my program to be 3992, and thus 1-(3992/10,000) = 60.08%.  The actual duplication rate should be 1-(4444/10,000) = 55%.

**THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR YOUR COMMENTS!**
I will be posting again soon, as this solution assumes that my data follows a uniform distribution, which it doesn't..."

v3h8j,6,2012-06-15,I'm struggling to break into the game industry as an artist. ,madmuffin,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/v3h8j/im_struggling_to_break_into_the_game_industry_as/,"I'm not 100% sure this is the right place to ask but at least its tangentially related to game development. I'm an artist, I specialize in 3D but I can do pretty much anything art-wise. I took two years of college learning 2D and 3D, and after that worked on PEI for three months doing game development as an artist in an internship-like thing, followed by a year and a half of modeling tanks and guns and stuff as an intern with the military for training simulations and stuff.

But that's where my story ends. The internship ended, and now I can't get a word out of anyone, anywhere. I've applied to pretty much every game company in all of Canada I could get the email address for, and gotten a grand total of a single reply, saying no. The rest never even gave me the time of day. I don't know what I am doing wrong. 

I'm not here to plug my portfolio or anything but I don't think I am a bad artist or anything like that so its not that. I haven't exactly got 5 years senior experience under my belt or anything that every job wants but I figured what I had was SUPPOSED to be the whole 'Once you get your first job its easy to find more from there,' that everyone told me, but clearly that didn't cut it.

I'm worried I'll never find work and have to give up on game art and go back to school and retrain as something else. How do I find a work/a job? Is it normal to never get replies from anyone ever? What am I doing wrong?

Edit: People said I need a public portfolio, and I have one, I just didn't link it. [If you want to see it, its HERE.](http://samb-folio.blogspot.ca/)

~~EDIT EDIT: It looks like the consensus is: Your work is shit, your rendering is shit, your website layout doesn't matter (but its shit too), why do you even try? =/~~ I struggle with emotional problems on top of this so I'm sorry if I bit anyone's head off."

What happened?",CookiesandCandy,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/v3fuy/redditors_what_are_your_unrealized_or_failed/,"When I was 10 my family took me to New York City and on a tour of 30 Rock. It was the best day of my life, and the day I decided I wanted to work in television. I spent my life working toward getting back to NBC. I bought my first camcorder at 12, worked in the newspaper in middle school, and took Video Journalism in high school. My senior project was a video yearbook. I moved to Washington, DC for college and majored in Media Studies in college, holding internships at CosmoGIRL! Magazine (lots of video and web content), CNN, a film festival, and a production company.

In 2009 everything started going south. I had another internship at Sesame Workshop I had to turn down because of graduation (no one's fault, just disappointed that another great love went unfulfilled), and an unofficial job offer at CNN was rescinded because of the bad economy causing a hiring freeze. No one else was hiring, either. I submitted my resume to the page program but never heard back.

Around the same time, I fell in love and when I didn't immediately get a job I moved back to North Carolina, since I could at least be happy with him while I looked for work. I applied everywhere - I didn't care where I went, he promised to go with me. About 10 months after graduation, after nothing but retail work, I was finally able to get a job at an amazing local news station. After about a year of working there I applied again to the page program. I was completely willing to leave my loved one to go to New York to follow my dream. He could follow me there - I was always more ambitious than him.

But the page program never happened, and I was unable to support myself on the minimum-wage rate I had at the television station. So I left, taking a salaried position in the sales department of a publisher.

It just hit me last night that I'll never be a page - I'm getting a bit old for it, and now I've spent about a year out of the TV business. I'll probably never live or work in New York like I had dreamed my whole life. I have a great life anyway, so I'm not terribly upset, but I'm definitely mourning the lost dream. I did everything right, but it can't work out for everyone.

*So, Reddit, if you've gotten through that novel, I'd love to hear about your missed dreams or opportunities. What happened? Do you have regrets? What are your new dreams and ambitions? Are you happy anyway?*"

Without wasting time, lets get to the point. I need help.

This summer I need to write and defend a thesis and take final exams all while doing an internship at the Smithsonian. The problem is: I am addicted to smoking weed and playing video games (which is killing my social life), and I have very little motivation to get things done even though I know I NEED to.

Please help me with stories, comments or even memes to motivate me! I don't know who else to turn to"

We're a small talent company based in London and our goal is to promote video games and tech things in general to females and make these male-dominated jobs more balanced. We're hiring both girls and boys. Right now the social media/marketing department are looking for an intern who knows how to write, likes technology and games and is interested in the cause. It's NOT A PAID internship, but it's an extremely good experience because we have big clients (you can check them out on the website under Clients) and we meet them, they know us, we know them and these are potential connections, which you can later on use to get a really good paid job. It's ok if you're still in highschool or college, it's for the summer (unless you're a graduate and we like you, then you can actually get a paid job with us).

v34ov,2,2012-06-15,How to help/what to say to a friend who recently graduated from art school and is very bitter about her current job-searching experiences thus far?,nagoooyin,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/v34ov/how_to_helpwhat_to_say_to_a_friend_who_recently/,"So my friend recently graduated from a BFA program at a very well known art school in CA.  She's definitely already disappointed and discouraged because she was not able to land an internship with a major studio, as a result of the senior portfolio reviews (or whatever you call them).  So now she's looking for basically any job, and the job market is already as shitty as it is, much less for someone with a degree in art/illustration.  She's gets more and more discouraged each day she does not get a desirable response to a job application.

Whenever I talk with her, it ends up going back to the topic of ""I paid $100K to go to this school, and I havent gotten any response from companies.  This school was a scam, they should have given us more help and informed us of companies that are hiring blahblahblah."" 

I personally find this to be a very self-entitled attitude, HOWEVER I do feel for her at the same time, and I remember what it was like when I was job-searching as well.  I remind her to keep searching, don't be discouraged, you will find the right place, don't take it personally, job searching sucks, etc.  But it doesn't seem like shes in a place to hear these things, and just wants to stay negative.  She's only been out of school for about a month, and has already been talking about how she may need to change careers, or go back to school for a second degree.

Any have any tips on how to help a friend not get so discouraged?"

So I met a very cute girl on the bus. We were face to face for about 15 minutes or something. I gave her strong eye contact, which she returned. So naturally, I smiled, and she smiled back. We got out of the bus at the same stop.. I (sorta) ran after her to talk to her.

Small handshakes, names and occupations were exchanged, but since I was late for my internship, I had to close quickly. I asked her if we could meet again and she replied, well I don't know. Without missing a beat, I replied (with a huge grin), well I know! B-a-m, she smiled back. So I asked her for her number, which she gave without hesitation, and called her right there to give her mine before leaving.

So I texted her (I know, I know, never text first.. but I did), and found out, after hundreds of texts, that she has a boyfriend and in a supposedly ""serious"" relationship. 

If you are in a serious relationship, why did you even bother giving me your number ? I can't get my head around that..

i just keep telling myself that i need to just kill myself and get it over with, but i am scared of doing it for some reason. i just wish i could think of one or two people who would actually give a  shit if i died. i've been feeling this way on and off since 2009 (and before that, really), but it feels like it is getting more and more intense. i'm just really scared right now, and i thought maybe someone'd be able to talk to me for a while. i don't know.  i'm sorry that this is shittily written.

v31yn,0,2012-06-15,"[Was told to post this here]Known this girl for about six months, need an outsiders opinion on the situation.",[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/v31yn/was_told_to_post_this_hereknown_this_girl_for/,"I (22) met this girl(21) last October at a dinner function, I barely said Hi to her and the next day she added me on facebook. We started to chat and we hung out in a group of friends twice before she left for holidays/home for about 3 months. In this time we continued to chat on facebook amounting to approximately 2500 messages exchanged between us. 

The highlights of this exchange in chronological order:
* She invites me to come and visit her on holiday, I decline (a) I can't afford it (b) I don't feel comfortable doing that as I don't know her well enough at this point.
*She came back briefly for an interview she had for an internship, and we got to see each other at a friend's party. I was nervous as hell and also intimidated by her. While I was conversing with someone she comes over and asks if you want to come with her to a friend of hers at a slightly different location in the party. She then asks me to hold her drink, which I do, then asks me to hold her phone; I cannot as I am holding her drink and also my own, so she slips her phone in my shirt pocket, links arms with me and begins walking to her friend. On the way I say jokingly ""Did you just make me your bitch?!"". She responds with ""You love it..."". When we walk over to the friend seconds later she says ""So you two just met at that dinner and fell in love?!"", I thought this was very forward but obviously this girl had been talking about me to her friend with romantic intentions. I decided to play along and say ""how can you not"" while gesturing at the girl. Her friend then goes on about her mess of a dating life and how she is taking a break from the scene, to which the girl, who is right next to me says ""Oh I don't want to date anyone for like a year"". I don't say anything. They then immediately decide to go and hang out with some more friends and the girl says for me to come a long. I don't go with them and just socialise with other guests of the party until I have to leave early without saying good by to anyone since my friend got in a fight and we decided it was best to leave. She calls me the next day with the topic of how she didn't get to say goodbye to me, I was upset and I think my tone conveyed that, only pleasantries were exchanged and we hung up.
* She goes back on holidays so that chat continues, about after two weeks after she leaves she asks me to come visit her. I decline (a) I don't know her well enough to burden her with my own entertainment (b) I can't afford it.
*After new years she tells me about how she is feeling down about one of her exes and I console her about it. I feel like at this point I was seen as more of a friend, which is fine, but sudden and thus felt rejected, but clearly this girl had stuff to work through.
*I ask what she is doing, she tells me that she is telling the guy she drunkenly made out with at new years that she only wants to be friends.
*About a few weeks before she comes back she tells me how she doesn't want to date anyone for six months. At this point it is clear that I am only her friend, but it still felt as though the door might be open for me in the future.
*When she comes back she says we should go clubbing, I cannot as I was sick at the time, but also I admittedly had a hard time adjusting my feelings for her.


So before her birthday party, which I was already well aware of and had rsvp'd, she calls and asks if I was coming, perhaps because I hadn't really kept in touch as I was back at uni and also because I was trying to readjust.

When I get to the party she seems slightly nervous around me, and this is a very social girl, so it was unusual for her to be like this. I still don't know what to make of it.

We then chatted on facebook occasionally for a few weeks before we organizes a dinner with a few friends, which did not go well as I didn't speak at all. But she was trying to get me to talk anyway. As we walking back to the station she linked arms with me again, she is generally a touchy person so I didn't think much of it.

Two weeks later I meet her and her friends for some drinks, during which she lets on that she is seeing someone and also implied that she had slept with him(I may be wrong about the last part, not sure). As I am leaving she gives me a tighter hug than normal, which made me think that she must know something about the way I was feeling.

A few days later she impulsively throws a houseparty, I attend, she had invited the person she was seeing but he had plans with his family. I didn't really talk much with her and had generally good time socialising.

Few days later she initiates a chat on Facebook and we discuss the anecdotes of the house party, I tell her I was glad she invited me and that I was glad that it happened. She initiates chats with me approximately once a week for the next three weeks, then suggests a group dinner because she hadn't seen me 'in so long'. On the night I ask if its still on, she says she forgot and thought it was tomorrow, we reorganise for tomorrow but she cannot make it as she lost her bank card. We talk generally for a bit on the night of the dinner.

A few days later I post a picture on facebook of a beverage I made at home, this beverage is also one that the girl claimed to love. She then jokingly posts about how I should of made her one. Then invites me to meet her at a club for some drinks as a few of our friends are going there anyway. When I meet her she says she wants one of those drinks that i posted on my facebook; bewildered, I suggest to her that she make it herself, to which she retorts I want you to make it. The rest of the night she is blatantly flirting with me, I was flattered enormously, but also upset, I felt like a doormat, I don't know whether or not I am justified in feeling this way or not.

What I want to know is this girl flaky? Is she just going to hurt me when she has gotten what she wanted from me? Am I wrong for feeling like a doormat.

v31eg,8,2012-06-15,Question about food I had in Saudi and career options. ,mellonandenter,saudiarabia,https://www.reddit.com/r/saudiarabia/comments/v31eg/question_about_food_i_had_in_saudi_and_career/,"So first of all, I was born in Jubail and grew up in Saudi Arabia. When I was a kid my dad would bring tameez home for breakfast along with something called fool. I've tried searching online for the recipe but none of them sound like the fool I would eat. It was orangy-brown, had a thin layer of some sort of liquid on top (I imagine butter). Basically its texture was like hummus but hot and served in a 3inch diameter by 3inches high container. If anyone can post a link to how to make it that would be amazing. 

Also a second recipe I'm looking for is for some sort of wrap we'd buy from a tameez bakery store in the evenings. All I know is that it was square fried bread 6 inches by 6 inches with some sort of egg inside it.

Third thing, so I just graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering from Canada. I've tried searching for a job in Saudi but EVERYWHERE says that you need at least 7-8 years experience. I'd love to start my full time career in Saudi Arabia and was wondering if anyone has leads to which, if any, companies would consider a new grad with 2 years of internship experience?

I don't really know her that well, but weve spent quite a few nights together studying and coding up CS assignments, to the point that it became a pretty regular thing.  And over these study sessions, id begun to develop a crush on her.  We never hung out outside of that though.  We'd had tentative plans to go see a movie together, but those kinda fell through because of finals. 

During that week, I told her that I'd be going to Albuquerque for an internship, and she said that ""I should come visit you there!"".  I had thought she was joking at the time, but it turns out she was not.  I got a text from her the other day asking about hotels, and two days after that, she had bought her ticket.

I have trouble believing she has any kind of romantic feelings for me, mostly because this girl has seen me at my absolute worst. Unshaven, wearing dirty clothes, half asleep, etc.  But at the same time, there's a lot of evidence suggesting she does.  For example, she talks to her mom about me quite a bit.  She even told me her mom thinks I'm handsome.  And just yesterday she was lamenting the fact that I ""didn't give her a hug before I left"".

So how can I make sure we have a good time together?  I'd love for this to turn into something romantic, but I've never been too good at those sorts of things.  Any advice?

I'm a 26/M and she is a 26/F, we started dating last year when she was on exchange from Germany for the year, while she was here I organised an internship for her to come back to Australia in 6 Months time. After I organised that. I got a job 4000km away on a 2 year contract, so even when she get's back I'm still a 4 hour flight away.

Because of this we both said let's just see what happens as having two years with minimal contact is a big ask on any relationship. We've been apart for nearly 6 months now and she gets back to Australia in August.

I 've been waiting for her this whole time and we've stayed in contact through out this period and we were planning when to see each other again ect. I asked her where everything was going as I missed her and didn't understand were I stood with her.

A week later she sent me an email saying that I had hurt her a number of times last year and she doesn't want me to wait for her, when we talked she then said she doesn't love me or see a future with me.

She says this was based on her looking back at our relationship and seeing that what we had wasn't love. We did have a few issues when we were together which I thought we had worked through, she is now saying that is wasn't enough. I don't understand how she can complely change how she feels about me.

I poored my heart out to her in an email and tried to explain the issues she was concerned with from my perspective and what she was thinking wasn't my intentions, I apologised for any pain that I caused her last year even if it wasn't intended. In the end she said all she can offer me is, when she sees me again if she feels something then maybe.

I fell like that's a huge amount of pressure to have on me as I'm only going to be able to see her for max 1 week and it seems as if she has been playing a select few bad things over and over again in her head.

How do I show her the person she loved from the other side of the world? How do I show the issues that she has had in the past with our relationships won't be an issue in the future? Finally How do I show that the person that she currently thinks I am isn't how I was in our relationship or how I will be in the future?


Edit: I'm afraid that I will hold on to this feeling of hope that when we see each other, she'll want to be with me again.  When ever I've had a relationship end. I've never been able to accept that it is over and move on, I've always held on to a hope that I'll find a way to fix the issues? So I guess my question has two parts, how do I save the relationship and if it can't be how do I move on from her how do I not hold on to the hopw that I can save it.

v2s1y,0,2012-06-14,"international couples, how do you deal with sometimes inconvenient and irritating immigration laws?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/v2s1y/international_couples_how_do_you_deal_with/,"I'm an American woman in a relationship with French woman for almost 3 years now. We met while studying abroad in Prague while still in college (I'm 23 and she's 22) and did long distance for pretty much 2 years, until my girlfriend was able to come on a J-1 visa this past year to do an internship on her gap year while pursuing her Master's degree. We've been living together in NYC for the past year and it's been amazing. 

Initially our plan to stay together was that after her internship ended, she'd try to get her company to sponsor her for an H1-B visa for January 2013, which they were willing to do, but their immigration lawyer was irritatingly slow to respond to calls and emails and lo and behold, now the quota for January 2013 H1-B visas is full. So she'll have to now either try to apply for the october 2013 H1-B visa, or do another J-1 at some other company (while having to prove that this is a completely different kind of job experience than her previous internship on a J-1).

So I'm just really disappointed and discouraged right now. I've also been drinking, as you do when you find out these sorts of disappointing news. I could use some success stories of international couples overcoming these immigration obstacles and sticking out long distance again for a long period of time, after being together for a while in the same apartment, or even city. It totally sucks that same sex couples dont' have the same green card privileges as straight couples, or I would totally marry this girl. Even sober, I'm quite certain she is someone I would love spending a lot more time with, in the same place (if not the rest of my life).

Edit: I know we're young, but I should add that we've spent a lot of effort to stay together despite the distance and the obstacles with foreign immigration laws and the like. I went to visit her every holiday break I had while in college, she took a summer program in NYC to be with me for a month, and I spent a summer in Paris interning at a startup so we could be together before she came to New York for her year long internship. I just feel like after all this time and effort, and the fact that we're so good together (when I saw [this comic](http://i.imgur.com/Gdna9.gif) on Reddit the other day my gut reaction was: 'but we diiiiid') this last roadblock just seems like... it 'd be a waste to just give up now, when time and time again we've proven that we've been able to overcome these obstacles and make it work somehow."
v2rv7,5,2012-06-14,I'm interested in a girl at work. . . ,nobody2000,askagirl,https://www.reddit.com/r/askagirl/comments/v2rv7/im_interested_in_a_girl_at_work/,"I will do my best to keep it concise, but detailed. 

Also, please ignore the fact that we're at work. The company is fine with intra-office romances, and we currently work far enough apart that post-relationship ugliness (if it ever got there) would only be a minor inconvenience. My particular role never crosses into her territory. 

1 year ago(ish), while I was an intern, our company (huge company) hired a girl to our department as an intern. I'm in Marketing, she's in Finance. 

Her first day was on the day that the HR dept. had a company cruise on the river. She sat with me and some of the coworkers, but it was mostly her and I that talked. 

Next day all my coworkers mentioned how we had hit it off, and that she was cute (she is). I had avoided relationships for a while and I recently decided that it was time to explore the possibility again (took a hiatus from dating due to shitty relationship).

So I did what you're supposed to do. Stop by her desk and chat her up. Asked her about what she was working on, talked about my stuff...just continued the conversation. 

I did this for a number of days when I realized ""Fuck this, I feel like I'm spinning my wheels, she oughta stop over and talk to me."" She didn't, so I figured that maybe she just wasn't interested. . .

As the months went on, I stopped visiting so frequently. I'd stop by to say hi and shoot the shit maybe once a month whenever I was thinking ""I gotta talk to her."" 

Down the line, they moved my desk 2 down from her, and that was cool. We talked more often about stuff, but this one dude another department chatted her up a lot. 

I Kinda put 2 and 2 together, and realized what was going on. Kept it friendly, but kinda realized that she must've been into uncomplicated men (this dude is . . . super uncomplicated. . . if I have to put it in a PC way). 

By November 2011, I kicked the ""intern"" label, and now I'm a full blown associate. 

By March 2012, I've dated numerous women casually and started getting serious with another - who dumped me. While talking it over with some of the ladies at work, I casually mentioned ""Is finance intern single?""

I learned that not only was she single, but she wasn't seeing the fella from the other department ever. She DID have a boyfriend in the previous months, but she dumped his ass. 

So I resumed my ""crush"" and I had no choice but to not be a fucking idiot here. I started talking her up - daily. Good conversation and all that. Learned she was applying for a job in the department. Nice!

So I cockily told her the news she wanted to hear - ""Everyone loves you, the old VP talked to me and spoke very highly of you (she did), they wouldn't have to train you, you'll get it.""

And so I offered ""You and I will celebrate when you get this job."" As she questioned herself and her confidence waned, I told her ""Don't let me jinx you, we're going to celebrate your first paycheck.""

This is really risky stuff. What if she didn't get the job???

Sure enough, she got the job. 

I didn't see her in the office, so I emailed her ""Congrats blah blah, I told you I was right, I'm always right."" (she knows I'm joking around). 

She replies: ""Thanks, I'm just nervous of all the work I'll have to do. . . we have to go out and celebrate my first paycheck!""

So that brings us to today. . . 3 or 4 paychecks past when we were supposed to go celebrate. I mostly blame logistics - she's been pulling 12 hour days, I've been pulling 10-12 hour days, been busy on fridays. It sucks (I can't even go out with friends or other dates because of this shit - being in a band AND pulling a 50-60 hour work week blows). 

***

You have the story from my perspective, and I am honest about the whole thing. I'm not a looker - 26, a little bit balding, dry skin (dermatits), and overweight, but I've ditched 30 lbs since the beginning of 2012, so I'm really not looking too bad (could always lose more). I'm very charming, smart, funny, and actually great in bed (when every girl you're with gets to see the back of her orbital bone because her eyes roll back that far, you don't need to be told you're good). 

I do have a confidence issue sometimes. I don't trust others when they praise me. I was recently asked by another coworker I'm close with why I wasn't together with this girl already. 

**TL;DR I'm 26, she's 25, Been flirting on/off for a year. Both went from interns to full-associates. I feel like I'm more interested than she is. I also am mostly a prize in terms of brain and personality. Looks need work that I'm providing them as best I can**

1.)Would you say that she's interested in me from this? I only ask because I've offered opportunities here and there to take the lead, and  she's only taken the one ""we gotta celebrate"". My other female friends (not from work) tell me that it will make her day when I ask her this. Are they correct?

2.) Is this the type of thing that I'm better off exploring as friends with no outward romantic intentions and let it get there in time if it's supposed to? (again, ignore the fact that we ""sorta"" work together)

3.) Do I need to just bite the bullet and flat-out ask her to drinks some Friday? She sits in a crowded part of the office, and I just don't want to ask her there because it's not anyone else's business but ours. I'm tempted to shoot her an email, but that's lame. Thoughts?

4.) What other thoughts might you have? 

Thanks!"

I had an internship, supposedly, lined up through my neighbor for a big aerospace company. Things were looking up, I'd be making $14/hr being only a year out of college. I had talked to the employer and things looked like they were decently set in stone...however, about a week before school got out, I got a call from HR. They decided to, just now, tell me that their internships are for Juniors and up. This, honestly, doesn't surprise me, but they could have FUCKING TOLD ME WHEN I FIRST APPLIED. Instead, they chose to dick around with me and fuck me over.

So, here I am. Finals week and I have no job setup for the summer. As most of you know, it is typically too late to find something at this point, but I set about trying my hardest. I had summer plans, damn it!

I am a big car guy so, naturally, I had quite a few plans for my car. I was quite looking forward to getting some of this stuff done. But, now that I couldn't find a job I figured I would just be giving up a new set of wheels. That set of wheels passed, and another few weeks, the majority of my list has been canceled out.

I can't find a job anywhere. Not even fucking Domino's will hire me. It's not like I don't have work experience, I have been working for almost 3 years. I have good grades, I maintained a 3.533 my freshman year despite taking Calculus 2 and 3, Chemistry 1 and 2, Engineering Physics 1 and 2, Psych and some other bs classes (spread across 2 semesters, of course). I have references... It's just no where is hiring.

So, now I have no money. I don't know what the fuck I'mm gonna do next semester. None of my summer plans are going to happen. I feel worthless. I'm a white male, putting myself through college at a very reasonably priced school because my parents are too rich to qualify for any help and we're too poor to just send the college a bag of money. I feel like I'm just getting fucked over for being a decent person.

I still have Reddit, though. Feels somewhat decent to get that off my chest..."

If not, our rooms are carpeted and we have a living room, so no worries there. 

We're located at La Scala, so its super close to the bus/shuttle stops to take you to school or anywhere. We've got a pool, a gym, and an office center where you can get access to free printing.

A little bit about us: one student (lit major) going to summer school at UCSD, one doing a computer-science-y internship, and another that works from home. We're all easygoing, relatively quiet, and pretty chill, so it'd be nice to have someone that fits this profile as well :) Also if you like board games, that's a plus!

I'm committed to operating Rocket Lease  as a very open startup, so here is what's going on in the life of Rocket Lease right now. Consider this a diary post so that there's a public record of the struggles and successes of Rocket Lease.

The last 2 weeks have been devoted primarily to development efforts:

1. We are working on making entirely customizable application forms. Customizability is the number one request from customers.
2. I'm working with the very amazing Ryan G (www.dribbble.com/rglover) to do an entirely new UI / UX facelift. He has been AMAZING. If you need some polish, he is THE person to go to and adds a ton of business value. Once we deploy these changes, I'll post before/after's of all the screens in the dashboard.

In the mean time, we've gotten 4 amazing interns who are really motivated.

Due to a communication issue with our credit vendor, our credit reports got turned off. Unfortunately, during that time, we had our highest ever volume of credit reports requested (13. Admittedly not a lot, but its just stressful to watch customer requests come in and not know exactly when you can fill them.)

After getting it resolved, within an HOUR, we were evicted from our office, effective immediately (that was yesterday). We are still homeless, and today we worked from Panera Bread (I guess this will be a fun story to tell if we ever make it).

How do I show the issues that she has had in the past with our relationships won't be an issue in the future? Finally How do I show that the person that shwe currently thinks I am isn't how I was in our relationship or how I will be in the future?"
v2lk6,0,2012-06-14,Preparing for Internships,HerpMasterFlex,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/v2lk6/preparing_for_internships/,"Fairly common question I imagine, however I may not be using the correct search terms, my google-fu is lacking. 

Intro: High school student, going to an engineering college with few basic pre-req courses complete. Studying Computer Engineering, hoping for a minor in Economics. 

Question: It is common knowledge that freshmen internships are hard to come by, and things don't start getting ""interesting"" until Junior year, when the pre-requisite course work applicable to the position is completed. What I would like to know is what should I do to prepare for the various tasks ahead for internship application. Are there any specific materials I should be going over in preparation for the various interviews? Starting a collection of any projects I'm working on when I go to college for presentation. I realize this varies greatly from job to job, but I'm not sure where to start. Anything that I should specifically work on that will help me from the get go? Any adjunct material I should cover on top of my coursework that will give me a clear advantage or distinguish me from other candidates. 

What I know to do or have done: 
- Visit the career webpage of my university
- Prepare and revise a resume 
- Create a LinkedIn Account 
- Got to the career services office often, and meet with an occupation counselor 
- Go to career fairs held at the university
- Visit prospective company internship pages and understand the requirements for each position
- As with above: watch any supplemental material for preparation for internships
- Maintain a 3.0 GPA. 

Prospective companies I've thought about (of course this list will change, I'm just giving my naive and inexperienced look into a very competitive field which is engineering internships): 
- Freescale
- Marvell Corp
- Micron
- Texas Instruments
- Qualcomm
- Intel
- Nvidia
- AMD
These are highly competitive fields, I don't expect to land a position without proper preparation. Obviously, this isn't all the companies with internships for Computer Engineering. I don't have access to the internships board at my university (maybe I haven't looked correctly), so this is prior to actual ""investigation"" 


I'm rather ignorant in this regard and appreciate any help in this matter provided by fellow redditors. Thank you for your help. "

They also mention that, because of that, it ends up sounding both formal and informal at the same time. 

Is this a good thing, or a bad thing? If it's a bad thing, is there anything I can do to fix it? I have always thought that your writing should sound like how you speak, assuming you speak somewhat eloquently. I'm in my fourth year of University, if that matters. 

EDIT: I should mention that this is always in regards to some sort of formal paper. The most recent paper I wrote that received this reaction was a report describing my recent two-year long internship. This also happened with pretty much every paper I wrote for the humanities classes I took. "

v5ksa,0,2012-06-16,"[20/m] Ok internet strangers, I can't get over her [20/f]",soupisgreat,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/v5ksa/20m_ok_internet_strangers_i_cant_get_over_her_20f/,"Rewind 2 and a half years to senior year of high school. We dated for about 9 months. Everything was great. When it was time to leave for college I stupidly told her that it probably wasn't a good idea to continue the relationship even though she was all for it. We went to schools that are about 4 hours away from each other and I didn't feel that a long distance relationship would work well. Neither of us had the means or time to get to each others' schools to visit. 

So we broke up. Despite this, we talked/Skyped almost every day that first semester. She even came with her dad to visit me one weekend. During our 5 week winter break through the next summer we hung out and had sex quite often. During these times I asked her repeatedly to date me again. I really loved being with her and I felt that we could work through the distance. She refused. I feel that she was extremely hurt by me breaking it off before that first semester of college. It was not my finest hour. 

When this school year (2011-2012) started, she said that we could be friends because she ""really cared about me"" and ""doesn't want to lose [me]."" So we'd text each other frequently. I started to feel that she was becoming distant but I'd keep texting her. When the last winter break came around I took her to dinner, the movies, and lunch several times. We'd have fun but if I ever tried any time of intimacy, holding hands, hugging, kiss on the forehead, she'd pull away. Again I feel that this is some sort of punishment for breaking up with her a year and a half before. She always was willing to go and she even invited me to do a few things. 

So I once again asked her to date me again. This was towards the end of winter break [Mid-January 2012.] She got upset with me. She kept saying that ""we obviously can't be just friends."" So instead of dating me again she told me that we needed time apart. She said maybe a year or so of no talking. As a way to follow this through she blocked me on Facebook and wouldn't answer my texts. She even said ""Even if we were still dating I probably would have cheated on you."" I was stunned. This wasn't like her at all but she really knows how to hold a grudge. If it had any truth to it I don't know. This really hurt me but I accepted and we didn't talk.

That was 6 months ago. Since then I have only texted her once asking to catch up over lunch right when summer started. (Might not have been my best idea but I couldn't help myself.) Unfortunately she told me that she'd be staying at her school for the summer because of an internship. I wished her luck and we haven't spoken since. 

The problem is that I continue to think about her constantly. I have been with other girls (not dated,) but I still can't get her out of my head. Its been 1 and a half years since we actually dated and about 10 months since we were last intimate. Today I saw a picture of her on a mutual friend's Facebook. She was tagged but I obviously could not go to her profile because she had blocked me. This picture really tore me up because I haven't seen her since January and she was looking as beautiful as ever. I don't know what it is, but I can't get over this girl.

On a side note, she was absolutely amazing in bed. I've been with other girls since her but they don't even compare. This is definitely one reason why I continue to hold on to hope of getting her back but not the only one. 

Also, her mother adored me and still continues to text me once in a while asking me how I am. She obviously wants us back together but whenever she (her mom) brings it up to her she gets upset.

I now have a car at my school and I'd love to try and make it work but I don't know how to get to talking to her again. Should I even try?

**TL;DR** I have been on and off with my high school girlfriend. Mostly off now a days but I cant get her out of my head. Should I even try to rekindle that fire?"

The problem is I already moved home, 5 hours away.  I'm wondering if it would be worth it to change all my summer plans and go back for the internship.  I would have a place to stay.  The main reason I would do it is so I can put it on my application when I apply to the ME major next summer.  An adviser told me I'm near the bottom of the average GPA accepted into the major, so I'm wondering how much this internship could help me out?"

v5afj,1,2012-06-16,AF Reserve vs. Active Duty Pilot,jwolfer,AirForce,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/v5afj/af_reserve_vs_active_duty_pilot/,"So here's my dilemma.  I have one year left of ROTC before commissioning.  I already have a pilot slot so I will be going to UPT following commissioning (granted I pass my flight physical, get Security Clearance, etc).  I am currently interning at a C-17 AF Reserve Squadron and I am starting to think that may be a better option for me.  

There are pros and cons to both the Reserve and Active Duty.  Reserve has a guaranteed air frame, a stable location, but lacks a steady paycheck without going on trips.  Active Duty has a steady paycheck, you get the 'active duty experience', but there is a chance I can get stuck with UAVs or another Air frame I don't want.  

I want to fly the C-17 by a long shot and working at my internship is solidifying that desire even more.  I am trying to have an open mind going into UPT because I don't want to be unhappy if and when I get something other than C-17s.  The Reserve just seems like a great option because I could go to UPT knowing I have a C-17 waiting for me when I get done so I won't stress about busting a check ride as much.  

Any insight out there or is anyone going through the same thing? 

TLDR Should I join a reserve unit or go active duty as a future pilot?  I want to fly C-17s."

been lurking this community for a while, figured I'd post a question and maybe you guys could give me an answer. Here it goes: 

I'm an Engineering Physics student, in Canada, graduating in 2014 and with some exposure to finance. With that I mean that I'm doing an internship in an investment bank, doing quant research kind of work, in an European city (not Paris nor London). I'm also probably going to get recommended by a few people to WS firms for an internship next year, to gain more experience. Added to that, I'm in the investment club at school and we do a lot of networking activities, and I know a few people in Toronto and NYC. What I'm wondering is, after I get my undergrad, should I go for graduate studies or try and get into the job market right away? Would my undergrad + work experience be enough to get a job? If I do need further education, what diploma should I get? A Master of Financial Engineering or a Ph.D. in some sort of economics field?

Thanks guys!"

So I am currently a rising senior, interning with a leading aerospace company (company A). Towards the end of the summer, my company will interview people for a leadership-rotational engineering program. Here's the problem, they extend offers and expect decisions before our college's career fair. Normally, I would LOVE to get this job and it is very likely that I get it. However, I have a girlfriend who is on the other side of the country, working with another leading aerospace company (company B). If I had my choice, I would go to where my girlfriend is, but that is a big gamble - I'd have to decline the job from company A and hope that I get the offer from company B. However, I am talking with recruiter's from company B, they know who I am and like me, and I was offered an internship with them for this summer.
Finally, here is my question. Should I accept the job from company A and then cancel it if I get the offer from company B? Do you guys have any experience in this? Are there any better alternatives?
Thank you for the advice."

I thought it would be a good idea to get some job experience in a different city. 

The problem is I want to be alone but I'm not. When I was looking for housing I signed up to live at a house with 4 other people. Its only been the first day and already I'm afraid to leave my room to go get breakfast. I wish I could see this place as a home but I feel like I'm trapped in my room and when I leave I'll be confronted by strangers.

The only two people I can say I would feel comfortable living with is my girlfriend and my old roommate/best friend back in my hometown. I need help. I have no where else to live but I want to avoid these people. But then on the other hand I don't want them to think I'm antisocial and never come out of my room. The feeling of not being at home in your home is killing me. I can feel all my old anxiety I thought I had under control rushing back and I just don't know how to deal with it.

EDIT: I finally made it downstairs for breakfast and one of the roommates was there. Made small talk. And I ate and came back up. I'm starting to consider keeping some food products in my room so I don't have to leave it so often."

At first, I was just happy enough that I will get some ""real"" life experience before I graduate (this upcoming December) so it will definitely boost up my resume (and it's nice to have a paycheck coming to your mail).

I applied as an part time electrical engineering in the GIS Dept. during spring semester. After few weeks later, however, it got really mundane and unchallenging (my work, I kid you not, consisted of drawing squares all day). I asked several times if I could do different task, but HR did not respond to my email until the very end of my termination. But I decided to stay with them because it was close to school, they were flexible with my schedule, and again, that small paycheck are what made stick with them for 14 weeks.

Now, after HR finally responded my email, she apologized and mentioned that there was a summer intern position (full-time) available and she sent me an email about it. It looked promising since it gave me a description of applying engineering skills (even though the pay rate was lower than my previous job, I value more on experience). So I applied and got the position.

Just after working in my new internship in my third week, I feel miserable. Here are the cons:

-My job ended up being as mundane and unchallenging as before. I basically just help organize files onto to computer. No engineering skills is really needed
-Prior to going there, my boss mentions that HR still wants me to the same task that I was doing during spring (why???)
-The facility is much further away from I school, so gas-wise, it's not helping (35 min drive vs 15 min drive)
-I am taking senior design this summer semester and I feel I should really spend more time on it than I am currently right now
-In addition, I should really spend time studying GRE (working full time really wears you out)
-Lower pay rate (significantly lower now that I've realized with tax included)
-no real engineering experience

The pros:

-Very laid back work environment
-I got my own office with a window (wooo!)
-A job is better than no job
-In the end, if I stick with them, I can possibly get a good letter of recommendation (I hope)

So what should I do reddit?

If I do end up quitting, I do not want to leave it in bad terms because I may use their resource when it comes down to reference and letter of recommendation in the future.

I need some help.,breakUpHasShockedMe,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/v4txm/im_single_again_after_a_5_year_relationship_i/,"My now ex girlfriend(21f) and myself(20m) have just broken up. We had been dating since we were 15. She knows my Reddit account and I don't want her to kick me anymore while i'm down. I need to vent, I have no one to turn to. If you don't want to read the story I understand but there are questions at the bottom I would really appreciate answers to! Here is the story:


It started in 7th grade(about 13 years old) when I met her. I was an extremely overweight kid. No girl had ever given me a chance to really talk to them at this point in my life, no girl would even look at me. She did. She gave me a chance, she rolled the dice and I still don't know why. From that day on I wanted to make sure she was happy. I had a crush from the first day I met her, but this girl was completely out of my league. We quickly became best friends from then on and I would give her advice on everything she struggled with, which was mostly guy problems. I was essentially friend zoning myself and I didn't even realize it because I was only in 7th grade. But I continued to be there for her through anything. This continued for about 2 years.


We get to high school and it's a new and exciting time. I have lost around 70 pounds from training to play football at this point. Our friendship is as strong as ever. Within the first month of high school she has her group of friends tell me that she likes me. I didn't believe it for a solid month, she had never given me signs of that. I thought this was a cruel joke that her friends were playing on me. I was thinking they just wanted me to ask her out so I would be embarrassed in front of everyone in the school. I mean... A GIRL wanted me? A GIRL had feelings for me? THE GIRL had feelings for me? Well after that month I grew a pair and asked her.


She said yes to my complete surprise. People thought it was a joke that she was dating me. From then on I made sure she was the happiest girl in the world. We would get made fun of everyday because of how attached we were. We would literally be holding hands the entire time we were together. She became my first kiss about 3 months into dating. I was too nervous to make the first move so she did. I had never been happier after that though.


Well after about a year she ""cheats"" on me. She kisses an ex boyfriend who I had given her advice on. It crushes me but we remained friends. I couldn't live without her. Me dating her made other girls curious about me. I had more girls texting me and calling me than I could believe after we broke up. I ""hook up"" with a few (if you can even call making out hooking up). About 5 months pass since we broke up. She apologizes in tears for everything.


We start dating again. We lose our virginity to each other during this time. But sadly the relationship only lasts for 3 months. A 21 year old who helped out the teacher in one of her classes started chasing after her. She apparently tells him everything and he convinced her that I was only dating her to get into her pants. He told her she was going to get hurt dating me. So she breaks up with me again.... And of course starts dating him.


Well we stop talking after that and she dates him for about a year. I still love her after all this time, I'm envious of what this other guy has that I don't. She comes crying back to me again after he breaks her heart. We get to know each other again. And me being the sucker I am took her back again.


This is when the real relationship begins. We were starting our 3rd year(junior year) in high school. We were both determined to make this work. About 10 months of us dating pass and something we were never ready for came up. She had gotten pregnant. We made the toughest decision in our lives to abort the baby. We both decided we couldn't provide the life a baby deserves. It cuts me deep but I have to stay strong for her. I still to this day carry around the ultrasound of the kid everywhere I go. It has been my inspiration to become a better person. No one besides us to this day knows about the abortion. After the abortion our relationship grows so much closer.


We continue to be the happiest couple throughout high school. We communicate, we laugh, we go on dates, I would get excited to see her texts and calls come in. High school finally ends and I get a summer internship offer at Google and 3 universities offering a full ride scholarship. The closest being a school about 2 hours away. She didn't perform too well in school so she decided to stick with community college in the town we had lived in. At this point we decide we were going to stay together throughout college. Because of this I decide to stay as close as possible. I go to the college that is 2 hours away.


This is where our relationship starts to strain. I move out for the first time with roommates I don't know. My original roommate was supposed to be a 27 year old bank teller. But he didn't really live well with others so I end up with the only other apartment they have open at the time. This apartment was co-ed. I was going to be living with 2 girls for my freshman year. Imagine my girlfriend's excitement when she heard this. I can tell she's hurting at this point. She wants to move in so bad with me but I didn't want to put her in a bad financial situation. I told her it wasn't worth the debt to get the same community college education 2 hours down the road. (I understand how dumb that sounds now but if we were truly staying together long term I wanted to keep us in good financial standing. I regret that decision still to this day.) I drive up each and every single weekend during the school year to see her. I wanted her to know I love her and cared about her. I still surprise her with dates and flowers. Over the summer I would stay at my parent's house and bring her lunch at work everyday.


We go another year of doing the same thing except I live alone this time. This next year we had planned to move in together. I still drive up every weekend in order to see her. And In order to show her I love her. Well because of this and because I have to keep a high GPA for my scholarship I don't and still don't have a social life in college. I work hard all week so that I don't have any homework left over for the weekend. Our relationship is still strong this entire school year.


This last month when summer started has been where it got bumpy. She starts to tell me she doesn't want to go to my school anymore. She wants to follow her dreams and go into fashion merchandising... This kind of saddens me but I tell her to go for it. Shoot for the stars. The problem is that the fashion school she wants to go to is 8 hours from my school. We definitely would have to have a long distance relationship at that point. No more seeing each other every weekend. This puts strain back on our relationship. I tell her I still completely support her with whatever she wants to do though. We have been dating continuously for one month short of 4 years now.


Well then comes the past few weeks. She starts to ignore my calls and texts. She bails on dates I had planned for her. I learn from a mutual friend that she has been hanging out with other guys in our group when she would tell me that she's sick and can't go out. This makes me saddened inside but I didn't know how to confront her about it. She becomes moody with me all the time. She doesn't know that I know what she has been up to.


Then this week comes. The week that has crushed me completely as a person. She tells me that she has fallen out of love with me. She doesn't get happy when she sees me anymore. She gets annoyed when she sees my face. She hates how I love to spend time with my family and that I am a mommy's boy. She tells me that she hates that I give my dog so much attention. She hates what I wear. She tells me she wants to see other people. She says that she has been in relationships all of her life and she doesn't even know who she is. She doesn't know if I'm the best she wants to see if there are better guys out there. She wants to make stupid decisions and live with them. She wants to hook up with a random guy and regret it. She wants to ""find herself"". And after that she ""finds herself"" we should get back together and get married. I told her things don't work that way. I'm not going to sit here and wait while she hooks up with a bunch of guys and then just take her back. You can't have your cake and eat it too.


Mind you this all came within a couple of days. She built all of this up and just exploded these past few days. I told her she needs to tell me these things and not let them build up like this. I can try to fix things but I can't fix everything at once. I've always been fine with her talking to other guys and making new friends. I never breached her privacy in any way. I trusted her. I loved her. I tried to continue to surprise her as much as possible. I took her out on fun dates. I loved to make her happy that was all I ever wanted since I met her. I had tried my hardest at that point to be the best boyfriend I could be.


For the last few days she tried to end everything over text. She didn't even try to do that with our shorter relationships. But I told her our friendship is worth more than that and she knows that. I couldn't just let an 8 year friendship end over a text.


Well tonight ended our relationship, but more importantly it ended our friendship.


We met up at the park where we first started hanging out 8 years ago. I hadn't seen her since a week ago. This part may sound weird but I had decided I wanted to end our relationship on a happy note not a sad one. I knew she was done with me it was inevitable at this point but I wanted her to look back and constantly wonder why our relationship and friendship ended. We went and got milkshakes and went ice skating like we were just on another date. It was a great time until it came time to say goodbye. I broke down. We hugged for a hour straight. We cried in each other's shoulders for a hour straight. We didn't say a word for that hour. After that hour of breaking down I gave her a piece of me, a piece of us, to keep. I gave her my inspiration to become a better person. I gave her the ultrasound of the baby we were supposed to have from almost 3 and a half years ago. She had no clue I had been carrying that around with me this entire time. I told her the story behind it. I told her how deeply cut I was by the abortion. I told her why I carry it around. I told her everything. I thanked her for being the girl that gave me a chance 8 years ago. We continued to cry for another hour in each other's arms. She told she had to go after those 2 hours. Before she left I told her to remember the ultrasound whenever she feels down. Whenever someone breaks her heart. Whenever she fails a test. Whenever she needs it. I told her to take care of it wherever she goes. We unexpectedly kiss and she heads home. I sat in the parking lot for 30 minutes before I could I even move. It's insane how something that has lasted so long can end so quick. I've sat here for a hour and a half typing this. Everything is so hazy right now. I'm going to miss her. I'm going to miss our relationship. But most of all I'm going to miss our friendship. I just want her to be happy again.


**My questions are:**



* I've realized I don't even know how to make new friends anymore. I don't want to stay in the same mutual group of friends as her. I know it will only hurt me and I'll never get over her that way... What do i do over the summer to make new friends? How do you even approach people without being creepy? I have a connection to get hundreds of baseball tickets to all the our local MLB team's games, would that be a good place to invite new people to try to make them become a friend of mine?


* Are there steps I should be taking right now to help this process?




* She has hurt me pretty bad this time. Should I be just completely ignoring her calls and texts?


* I need a new hobby to keep my mind off things. I'm open to any suggestions! Please let me know what you do in your free time and why you love it."

Recently applied to a visual effects internship at a video game company near me in Los Angeles. Believe I did a great job of expressing my love for their one title in my cover letter and felt I had a strong application and creative work sample. 

It's been over two months and still haven't heard back from them (encouraging as a friend has received a ""sorry but no"" reply), and was wondering if there are any additional things I can do to make myself stand out as a candidate. 

Have refrained from sending them additional emails or anything which could be misconstrued as bugging them, but would extremely value the opportunity to work with this company. Any suggestions?

EDIT:
Thanks for the advice! It wasn't an interview, it was an online application. The reason I asked is because the whole process seemed so impersonal. Will be following your tips anytime I have an interview though."

I don't want to reveal too much about this internship. I have been offered a Junior Level internship for a HUGE data/IT Security company that works with multimillion dollar corporations. They do IT security and my role will be along those lines. I would make sure that they are PCI - DSS compliant and solve any incidents that may occur.

I need to know what you guys would do to prepare for a position like this. There may not even be an interview, as I got this job through a family friend who works for the company. All I know is that they use programs such as Alert Logic, Tripwire, Rapid 7, Imperu, and Applicure. Now I have never used any of these programs, but as an intern, should I have to worry initially about that? What exactly should I expect? I am only an incoming sophomore in college with a year of thorough Java work. I realize this is more IT than programming, but some advice from seasoned professionals would be great.

**TL;DR I got an upcoming paid Junior Level internship for a HUGE IT Security company through a family friend. What should I expect from the internship? What will they expect me to know as an intern vs. what they will teach me?**"

It doesn't help that my internship started a week after my last final was over, and my last semester wasn't any easier for me.

I've begun to exercise a bit, eat healthier (mostly vegetarian. Sometimes I eat fish and eggs.) How can I feel better with the insufficient amount of sleep I get?"

We were so close for so long and anything sexual us was just a bonus, and now I feel like he only talks to me in a sexual way, and couldn't give a fuck if I'm upset, like I am now. He told me he would text me early in the day so we had a chance to talk, and he didn't. When I texted him, he barely got out a reply and hasn't even responded since. Fuck that. I'm sorry you only have time for me when you're horny now. I love you, but I'm sick of having to defend you only to be treated like shit. What ever happened to you doing anything not to make me feel like a sex object? Guess words really are meaningless.

I love my mom but she just doesn't get it. She can't even say the word ""anxiety"". I'm sorry mom but I have an anxiety disorder. I get panic attacks. I have crying spells. Don't tell me that ""my down is someone else's up"" when I was told that I needed weekly therapy and to be put on medicine and you told me you didn't want that for me. I told you I didn't want to disappoint you, but at the same time I feel like you're not helping me, or letting me get the help I need. Which is hard to say because you're a great mom and you do so much but this is something you just refuse to accept, and I already felt like shit about it, and when you make it seem like less of a big deal than it is to me, I just feel worse.

I'm sick of not having a friend in the world to talk to about this. I'm sick of feeling like I burden everyone. I'm sick of feeling like nobody actually cares.

I hate that when I was a virgin, I was called prude and bullied. I hate that now that I'm not, the people who know give me judgmental looks and make me feel like a slut.

I hate that I graduated high school with over a 4.3 GPA, over 10 extra curricular activities and about 100 community service hours, a pretty decent SAT score, and great recommendations from my teachers. I'm rewarded with no merit scholarships, no scholarships at all actually, and started school in a year where there was no honors programs. Now that there are I feel like I got screwed out of it. I'm always one step away and then get screwed over. There were things I wanted to do in high school (TA, starting clubs, etc) that I couldn't do because my counselor either didn't know about them or didn't give me the right information. Now I'm getting screwed in college for not having prior experience, and living far away from anywhere that I wouldn't be able to intern anywhere or anything.

I'm just angry that I keep trying and seem to get nowhere. I feel betrayed by my family, friends, and school. I know that the answer is ""you have to start nowhere to get somewhere"", and I try and put on a happy face, but I feel like I've been doing it for years and it's gotten me nowhere. 

I'm sick of trying and just being one step too short. I'm always everyone's second. Never anyone's first. Second choice for a girlfriend, second choice for a best friend, second choice for opportunities, etc. Hell, my dad even had surgery and I heard him say to my mom that he was counting on my sister to help because he didn't think I would, even though I had already been helping him and have been helping him with stuff for over a month now.

Life is just way too frustrating.

tl;dr - Life screws you over and you have to just deal with it, I guess."
v4lup,7,2012-06-16,I'm currently renting from someone who refuses to let me and my GF sleep in the same bed.  How do I convince him I'm not Satan?,Squagem,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/v4lup/im_currently_renting_from_someone_who_refuses_to/,"Alright, so I recently moved into a new place for a summer internship and I've been struck with a strange ultimatum.  The owner of the house I am currently living in (and paying a very proper monthly rent / utility fee) has one rule: he doesn't allow females to sleep in the same bed as his tenants.  Before actually paying my first months rent, I informed him that my girlfriend will be driving up for a week in mid July and he convinced me that we could come to an arrangement.  Apparently the arrangement is me either sleeping on the couch or spending the week at a hotel.

How do I convince him that although HIS morals are closely tied to religious values, he should not enforce them on others.

Here's some context so you can provide some more sound advice:

1)  He is a really nice guy; he just adheres to the ""rules"" of his faith a little too adamantly (in my opinion)

2) We have no formal lease signed so (as far as I am aware) he can legally toss me out whenever he pleases

3) I only knew the guy about two weeks before moving into the place: some other extraneous circumstances forced me to move out of my previous residence ASAP.  Details if necessary.

4) I am (obviously) an atheist

I am just being really stupid here?  What does Reddit think I should do? :)

Thanks for the constructive support!

like the title says, i didn't actually get with anyone but i still had a great night. i'm kind of coming to terms with the fact that getting with girls shouldn't make-or-break my night, and if i had a good night regardless then it's still a good night. anyway, on with the FR

note: i wasn't peacocking til a bit later, so don't expect it from the start :P


* left student accomodation around 10pm, with about 20 other friends. met around 10 more on the way
* was an ""end of exam party"" at a club that we had prebooked tickets for, ~400 people from my university were going to be there (i haven't actually started my exams yet though, haha. start next week)
* got to the club around 10.30
* opened up a few sets outside, using some opinion openers
* some girls replied ""is that your pick up line?"" i wasn't sure how to reply but i just blurted out ""yeah, you're kind of getting of script, so can we get back to the question?"" 
* they weren't really responding that well, so i decided to leave them (is this the right thing to do? how else could i have approached this?
* went inside, pee'd, went outside for a smoke
* opened up a 2-set with my buddy, HB7 and HB9. both french, HB9 didn't speak much English. she was over for a few days visiting HB7 while HB7 was here doing an internship (i wasn't really too sure how to include this into the conversation. any hindsight ideas?)
* spoke to them for a bit, teased them about how little English they spoke. HB7 responded well, HB9 just occasionally laughed at stuff we said but didn't really contribute. her body language was pretty defensive (arms folded, kind of looking away)
* ended up speaking to them about the french football league and the french team in the Euro 2012. one of their friends came over, spoke to them in french. i got the feeling she was trying to get them to come back inside, but they responded in french and stayed out with us.
* my buddy was pretty drunk by this point and was saying some hilarious stuff, but i kind of got the idea that it wasn't really going to work out for us with them
* i decided to eject (""my legs are begging me to dance, try and have a nice night without me!"")
* left them, went inside
* met up with some other friends from my university, met a girl they were with a few of my friends (HB6)
* spoke to her, turns out she went to a school near the one that i used to go
* didn't stay too long with her as i kind of got the impression she was with this guy that was nearby
* left her, walked around the club. getting my dance on, was bumping into people i knew every 10 seconds. was great for my esteem, not going to lie. everyone was pretty happy to see me (""hey, how'd your exams go!?"" ""haven't even started yet, mate!"" they'd always laugh at this, haha""
* opened up random dancing sets, ""can you hold something for me?"", i'd offer them my hand and then twirl them around
* some girls seem pretty offended, others seemed to dig it. funny though, the ones that digged it were the ones that already had boyfriends who would always try and push me away instantly. shame, really.
* went with a friend to this part of the club which had this chemistry themed bar, got a pair of lab-goggles from the table. put them on
* went back, found the HB6 who i used to go school near. she was wearing this black top-hat that had glitter on it. asked her for it, she gave it
* started rocking the hat as well as the goggles
* was getting looks from everyone, i was loving it
* went back to dance floor
* walked past a 2-set. 2 x HB8
* smiled at them, they smiled back
* walked past them, one of them poked me so i turned around, ""hey, i'm telling my lawyer about that.""
* she laughed, wanted to get a photo of me and her from her friend. we did
* gave her my hand and the twirl. pulled her away to dance, she tried to pull her friend to come with but her friend left her with me
* we danced for a bit, she tried taking my hat. i tried to go for a kiss after a few seconds.
* she kept turning it down, my friends smacked my ass as they went past and i burst into laughter.
* she kind of left me after this, decided to leave the dance-floor with my friends
* went around the club, lots of high-fives from random people and people laughing at/with me at my ridiculous look
* i genuinely had no idea what to do with the attention
* lots of people re-greeting me after they had seen me before
* spent a solid 45 minutes in the queue buying a drink
* went back upstairs to one of the dancefloors
* HB8 that i danced with pokes me as i walk past
* ""you lot haven't been kicked out yet?"" she didn't really hear what i said
* ""let's go dance"" she still didn't hear what i said
* ""i'm going outside, it's too hot in here"" i think she said, so i replied ""yeah i know i'm hot but wait til you get to know me"", she still didn't hear what i said as she was turning to leave
* i grabbed her as she was leaving and said ""let's go dance"", ""maybe later"" she replied
* ""i probably won't be here when you get back"" i replied, she shrugged and walked off with her friend
* fuck it, i thought. time to dance
* spent a solid 30 minutes dancing, tried to make myself the centre of attention by jumping into the middle of the circles that the groups were making. lots of laughs.
* was playfully headbutting anyone else wearing the goggles or the hats. 
* at this point, it was ~2.30AM and despite the place still being packed, 80% of the girls were already taken and the other 20% didn't really seem to be ""on it""
* decided to leave on the high of the social proof
* got bus back to dorms
* put some chicken in the oven
* wrote this FR, haha.


so yeah, all in all i'd say i had a great night. i'm not sure what to do while peacocking. i've still got the hat and the goggles so i might wear the hat out on a different night out. but a lot of people tried to take it from me (""hey, hands off the merchandise""). like i said, i didn't get with anyone or anything but i had a great night just dancing with friends and just getting up to stupid shit. i pretty much missed out half the stuff in this FR of just the banter and stuff we got up to as i just kept it to the girls related stuff.

the requirements i have left are to pass the CPA exams and get my experience from working under a practicing CPA. it would probably take me 1 to 2 years to complete these last steps.

however, those in california know that in 2014, the requirements for becoming a CPA will change. On top of needing accounting units, you would also need business units.

my question is, would i still need to go back to school and get those business units? i ask because by the time 2014 comes around, ill probably have passed all the tests and be in an internship working for a CPA. 

would i need to go back to school even though the only thing im waiting on is for my internship experience to be finished?"

What the hell am I supposed to do?",throwitfarfarfaraway,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/v4g51/im_sick_of_the_us_immigrant_worker_policy_h1b/,"Hi Reddit. I'm using a throwaway because I don't want this rant associated with me. Long post follows, and thanks to those who read. I'm trying to be objective - I'm really quite humble when it comes to describing myself (not in interviews of course), but I'm trying to be candid, and I assure you that my qualifications and recommendations are indeed true and well earned.

A little bit about myself: 

I was born to Indian parents in the UAE, and have an Indian passport. I've never lived in India, though, and spent the first 18 years of my life in Abu Dhabi (UAE's capital, often overlooked for Dubai). I came to the US to go to college, and earned my bachelor's as a dual degree in science and the fine arts from a school ranked consistently within the top 10 in the country. I then got a master's in graphic/digital design from a university whose graduate design program is also ranked consistently within the top 10 in the country. I've had great feedback from every professor I've studied under, both undergrad and grad. I've had good internship and freelance experiences and solid portfolio reviews from professionals and academics. My master's thesis was considered among the most well written and produced among those in the last five years of my program.

I've been looking for full time jobs in the US since I graduated in December, and I'm currently on [OPT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optional_Practical_Training), which allows me to work unrestricted for a year after graduation. This comes with the caveat that I can't be unemployed for more than 60 days, so I accepted an internship offer to work while I hunted for full time jobs that would sponsor my visa application. Since then, I've had offers for jobs that have been rescinded because of my sponsorship requirement, and also offers that I couldn't accept because the salary proposed was less than that required by the H1B visa petition process (the salary has to be higher than the [""prevailing wage""](http://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/wages.cfm) for the occupation and geographical area - yet one more hurdle for me, because I'm willing to work for peanuts to get my career going - just as any determined American would.) 

To add to this, the number of [H1B visas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa) allowed per year is limited to a certain number (around 65,000). There's a specific start date to that application process (April 1), and the end date is whenever the cap is reached - which happened to be June 11 this year. So I'm out of fucking luck. My backup plans right now are: 1. Look for jobs with non-profits and Universities, which are exempt from the visa quota (want a funny story? I can't transfer this visa, if i get one, to a for-profit organization in the future, and will have to reapply under the quota if I want to make such a career change. HAHA.) 2. To move to the UAE or, if that doesn't pan out, India, and look for ways to come back in the future.

The funny thing is, I feel more American than anything else. I have no real attachment to living under a pseudo-benevolent monarchy in the UAE, and no attachment to living under a corrupt patriarchal government in India. The U.S. has its own problems when it comes to government, sure, but it's the only place I feel at home anymore. In addition, I've met the girl I want to marry here (but unfortunately can't, yet, due to family obligations and conservatism) and we're terribly in love, so this feels like a forced separation. I've considered the EU, but it's equally hard to get in there being an Indian citizen (and I'm quickly coming to despise this status).

Anyway, the primary issue here is that the visa quota for the year was filled this week, and I'm feeling very despondent. I'm incredibly frustrated with all the hoops that I have to go through to get a fucking job. I've tried incredibly hard, and seen candidates much less talented than myself (I'm trying to be objective here, I really am) get sponsored. I hate this situation, and I hate that I might have to leave the one place that I feel I can call my home, the friends who I think of as family, and the girl who I hope to one day have the financial stability to propose to. 

I know my options, but I hate them all. I guess I don't think I'm looking for advice, since I think I've covered every option I can think of - I'm not sure? I think I'm just looking for someone to read this, and understand what a shitty situation this is. Maybe I don't know what I want from Reddit. I dunno.

I'm frustrated at myself, angry at the U.S. and its policies, and just flat out depressed because I've been doing this for the past six months now. I wanted to get it all out, so thanks for reading -your time and comments are appreciated.

TLDR; H1B visa application processes suck. I've been here for 7 years, and feel like this is my home, but I'll likely have to leave anyway because of the U.S.'s draconic immigrant worker policy. I'm looking at non profits and higher-ed jobs that are exempt from the quota but things don't look hopeful. Shit sucks, man."

I'm moving to Albuquerque tomorrow for two and a half months for an internship before going back to college in September, and, while I'm excited, I'm a bit scared to be plopped in a city where I don't really know anyone or anything to do. So I guess I'm asking for restaurants, grocery stores (does Albuquerque have a co-op?), events, and anything else that a 19-year-old, gay, political, deadhead who likes brunch, the Big Lebowski ethnic food, casual relationships, friends, and farmers' markets would enjoy.

Looking forward to getting to know your city!"

I'm already too far in to switch, will I still be okay?",espn1993sf,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/v4eo8/everyone_seems_so_down_on_biomedical_engineering/,"Every single post I have seen that mentions Biomedical Engineering is dominated by a large majority of comments suggesting the OP switch to EE or ME. I'm just starting my 3rd year and there's several reasons why I haven't switched despite what everyone has said. First, I have known for several years that I have wanted to work in the medical field, and I'm not even sure if I want to do true engineering, I may want to do research for a biotech company (I'm minoring in Biology since the biology side of our curriculum in ironically limited). Second, I came in knowing that biomedical is a very broad subject and that I would essentially be required to do a masters if I wanted to do anything. Third, our curriculum is essentially mechanical engineering without classes such as heat transfer and intermediate dynamics (using MATLAB to solve mechanics problem) -- we take EE, materials, and my department has our own versions of each class (advanced fluids, advanced EE, advanced materials, etc.).

I guess all I'm looking for is some reassurance that I will be okay. I have very good grades, but I'm starting to see that at my first internship at a medical device company, many of the biomedical engineers are stuck doing quality assurance while every other engineers gets to do the research/engineering. Can anyone give me some hope? For reference, I'm strongly considering doing a masters in Tissue Engineering so that I can focus on regenerative medicine or blood vessel mimics.

Thanks for your help in advance!"
v4dho,2,2012-06-15,[For Hire] New MA in Mental Health Counseling looking to relocate to Southern CA.,abraxsis,SanDiegoJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanDiegoJobs/comments/v4dho/for_hire_new_ma_in_mental_health_counseling/,"I am a recent graduate of Eastern Kentucky University's Masters in Mental Health Counseling program. This program is a CACREP accredited program, only 1 of 3 in the state. My focus during the program was anxiety/phobias/mindfulness, internship was 629 hours at an inpatient crisis stabilization unit, and I also did a 107 hr practicum at a small private practice. I hold Bachelor degrees in Psychology and Sociology.

My previous (paid) work experience was unrelated to the Mental Health field, as I was an Executive Art Director for a small toy company. However, this has given me excellent communication skills, experience working with overseas entities, management skills, project workflow (development &amp; implementation), and direct experience with graphic design/production. I also have rudimentary understanding of customs regulations, strong computer experience, MS Office, and dealing with product licensors.

My internship experience involved a variety of clients in everything from a severely depressed state to full blown psychiatric crisis. I worked 50 hours a week on the unit as a co-counselor in both group and individual sessions. Other non-therapy aspects of the position was to develop group manuals, treatment plans, and to conduct intake interviews with new clients.

I posted to the San Diego jobs subreddit, but am looking for a position a little more North, closer to Camp Pendleton as I have friends stationed there. I am interested in both mental health positions as well as other positions that might take advantage of my ""colorful"" educational/work experience mixture. Other ideas might be positions at a University/College, or actual government/military civilian positions on base. Ideally, I would like to work in the mental health field with active duty military or in academia.

I am also a semi-professional photographer in my off time and enjoy the outdoors and travel. For civilian military positions, Deployable positions are acceptable. Security clearance shouldn't be an issue as I have a squeaky clean record, not even a traffic ticket.

Resume and Letters of Recommendation are available on request."

I decided to persue a career in medicine relatively late in my undergraduate career, so although my numbers are fairly strong, I am kicking myself in the butt right now, for not making up my mind sooner and doing more in terms of my activities, because that's where I feel I am lacking:

- Genetics research for 2.5 years, where I also completed my Masters thesis work. Presented Posters of research at a handful of conferences/meetings.
- Emergency Department Volunteer: 2 years and counting
- Physician Shadowing: 20+ hours, 2 different disciplines 
- Biology Teaching Assistant: 3 Years
- Middle School Teacher's Aide: 1 month internship, test run of new biology module developed by UCSD scientists
- Science museum volunteer: 1 year and counting

I'm applying this upcoming cycle (mostly mid-tier MD, very few top schools, planning to submit in July) and I am very concerned that my ECs will ruin my chances of getting in somewhere. I understand you can never really predict what schools want, but should I be worrying as much as I am right now (which is quite a lot)? Any opinions are welcome and very much appreciated.

v7678,1,2012-06-17,"My older sister and I have nothing in common, she's controlling, a compulsive liar, and we don't have a relationship. Is it possible to have one at this point?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/v7678/my_older_sister_and_i_have_nothing_in_common_shes/,"I'm 20 years old (male) and she's 24. When we were kids up until about when I was 9, we got along fine. She did the normal older sister stuff, bossing me around, we fought, but at the same time, we were able to have a relationship. Probably because we were kids... Once she got into middle school, she started hanging out with the wrong crowd. Drug users, people who drank alcohol, and just... weird. Not to mention a lot older than her. I'm sorry but it's weird if someone in high school is hanging out with a kid in middle school. Since then, she got into loads of trouble, got shit for grades, always lying to my parents about every little thing, and it put a huge strain on the family and my parents marriage (I think). My mother is more free-spirited, so my mother and sister have always gotten along for the most part, but my dad was the one who was trying to put some sort of order into her life. Like any normal parent, he set curfews and RULES. My sister has just never been someone who did what she was told. 

And then there was me. I can't remember the last time my parents needed to tell me that I had to do my homework, clean my room, etc. I just always did what I knew I was supposed to do, and never got into any trouble. I got along with both of my parents and never really had any issues with them. 

What the hell went wrong here? Fast forward to about two years ago. She was 22 and myself, 18. My mother went to Florida for a week to visit her mom, and my dad was always working at the time. I haven't had a curfew since I was 17, went to a friends house, and get a call from my sister, screaming that I needed to be home. It was 2:30am, but I was watching a fucking movie at a friends house. Forgive me... I get home when the movie ended because let's be honest, I'm 18 years old, and I'm not going to let my degenerate 22y/o sister try to enforce a rule that she just made up for me, and she just... yells. Telling me I need to be home when I was told, blah blah blah. She calls my dad, who's at work and doesn't have the time to deal with petty crap like that, and tells him that I shoved her, and just started spewing more lies out of her mouth. I ask calmly to talk to him, she pushes me, I grab the phone from her hand and she proceeds to grab my hair, kick my balls, scratch my face and hit my kidneys. At that point, I was pissed, but I knew that if I hit her back, she'd call the police on me and come up with some elaborate story to get me arrested somehow. I finally get her off of me, and I just leave. 

I'm convinced that I was more mature than her 22 year old self, when I was 12... I'm in my third year of college, just got an amazing internship, doing well and have good prospects for my future. My sister dropped out of community college that my parents paid for, and now works as a hairdresser who can't make enough money to move out of the house. At this point, whenever I see her, I'm just irritated. She doesn't even wash her own dishes. I can think of a million other things I don't like about her, but it'd be pointless. My parents also bought her a horse and 2 cars. All of which had to be sold/junked because she couldn't afford to maintain them and neither could my parents anymore. She's a parasite. Because of the financial strain she put on my parents, I had to take out tens of thousands of dollars in loans just to go to school. I know I'll be able to pay them off, but I can't help but think how much better off my family would be if she wasn't around. It sounds terrible, but I have no reason to get along with her as you can see. Recently she tried blaming our lack of a relationship on ME. This was after she called me, again screaming, telling me that I needed to get home and go with her to a wake that my mom said she had to go to, or she was going to ""kick my ass"". I just hung up, because obviously, that had the opposite effect that she expected. Now we're just not on speaking terms, as usual.

My question is, what can be done about this? After texting her and convincing her that she was indeed wrong to threaten me, she still thinks that until I'm ready to have a relationship with her, we won't have one. At this point, why the hell would I want to have one with her? She's just so different from me, and we obviously cannot get along because of her control and perhaps jealousy issues. I really don't know. People keep telling me that we should try to have a relationship, but at the same time, why should we have to force something like that? I just can't. I choose my friends wisely so that I can keep drama out of my life and have done so successfully. But, I couldn't choose my sister, and she is the only source of drama in my life right now. It's toxic. 

Sorry for the wall of text, but I had to explain some specifics."

And I progress onward only to find them asking EVERY DAMN THING about my employment and educational background.

Um, HELLOOOO? Didn't I just do this with, oh, I dunno, my fucking resume? And it's like, can you READ? I'm sure you can, if you're asking me to repeat myself TWICE. No, no, no. I am sick and tired of stupid companies who are perfectly capable of reading my resume and cover letter. They can decide from THAT if they want to contact me, especially since what they see the second time isn't gonna change from the first!

If they REALLY want to get more in-depth, they may personally contact me from what they see on my Resume and Cover Letter, and I can go tell them about 'em from there. Hell, I even SAY ""references available upon request""! What the hell is WRONG with some of these people to ask me to repeat myself!? GAH! Needless to say, I stopped that application at once.

I decided to buy an entire new suit for myself from Express, All types of shoes (dress shoes, boat shoes, sneakers, high tops) from Aldo and then I took my friends out to dinner at this really nice place in midtown manhattan (~$350). I spent $1,000+ that day and no fucks were given. I was feeling great, paid in cash for everything, felt like a hotshot. Wasn't thinking about if I was going to regret this or anything.

Later that night we end up going to a house party and begin drinking heavily. I told everyone cover fee was on me, we entered the house and the party was lively. I was with my friends, I was happy, dancing, cheering, taking shot after shot. Anyways, I woke up the next morning missing my phone, my keys and my wallet which had ~$800 remaining from the withdrawal. 

Still felt pretty good though."

[What made you decide to go into counselling? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v5i8t/iama_27_year_old_phd_student_in_psychology_with/c51jgrb?context=5)|I have always been told I am  very good at helping friends with their problems...I also really like psychology and love conducting psychological research!
[What do you think are some of the biggest misconceptions people have about therapists?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v5i8t/iama_27_year_old_phd_student_in_psychology_with/c51jgrb?context=5)|That we all wear sweaters and talk super sensitively. Also that you have to cry in therapy to make progress. Also that we are their to judge and analyze you. Basically Freudian psychology is dead and almost all of therapy is focused on developing more effective coping skills/behaviors. We rarely ever analyze people in the traditional sense.
[This is kind of a morbid question, but I've always been curious about how therapists would feel if one of their patients committed suicide. Is that something therapists are trained to deal with? Is it a common problem? How do therapists deal with it? How would you deal with it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v5i8t/iama_27_year_old_phd_student_in_psychology_with/c51jgrb?context=5)|Having someone commit suicide is a constant concern and is very scary both from a legal and emotional perspective. It can also really hurt your career. For the most part though your concern is that you care about your clients and you will feel like you failed them if they commit/attempt suicide. You can also get sued if someone kills themselves which is an extra kick in the shin after the fact. We are not really trained for it, more trained on what to do to stop it from happening and how to look for the signs.
[Are there any particular mental illnesses that especially interest/intrigue you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v5i8t/iama_27_year_old_phd_student_in_psychology_with/c51jgrb?context=5)|I really like personality disorders. Narcissistic Personality Disorder and Schizoid Personality disorder are both very interesting. I also really like vocational issues. People spend most of their lives at work yet we rarely look at this area of psychology.
[What's the weirdest/strangest psychological illness you've come across?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v5i8t/iama_27_year_old_phd_student_in_psychology_with/c51ifdo?context=5)|I once worked with a kid who had OCD but his obsessive thoughts were related incest within his family. He engaged in repetitive thoughts to get rid of the incestuous thoughts and fantasies. It was like torture for him because he could not get rid of the thoughts without engaging in ritualistic behaviors. He was also very religious which made the case much more complicated due to shame and guilt. 
[Was it purely non sexual tickling?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v5i8t/iama_27_year_old_phd_student_in_psychology_with/c51orz2?context=5)|It wasn't really sexual at all....he just felt shame about the thought coming up for him and then it endlessly cycled between shame, incestuous thought, and then shame again.
[Did he get better?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v5i8t/iama_27_year_old_phd_student_in_psychology_with/c51jebv?context=5)|Yes.
[Don't mean to be a dick, and even though you don't say his name isn't it highly frowned upon to talk about patients in any matter outside of work? (And for a note of clarity this is coming from someone who was in therapy for numerous years \)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v5i8t/iama_27_year_old_phd_student_in_psychology_with/c51jeyu?context=5)|I am maintaining confidentiality. You have no idea where I work or who I am.
[1000 hours of therapy? I hope you get better so you can continue with your studies!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v5i8t/iama_27_year_old_phd_student_in_psychology_with/c51jujv?context=5)|Lol!!! Your funny! I am the therapist, not the client. Good joke though!!!
[You're* as in 'you didn't provide proof, and you're probably not even a psychologist because you can't even spell'](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v5i8t/iama_27_year_old_phd_student_in_psychology_with/c51ns38?context=5)|Here is me with my DSM-IV.
 |I can't provide much more proof because I don't want to break confidentiality by revealing who I am or where I live....I hope the consistent quality of my answers is proof enough. You can also quiz me if you want.

[I'll ask a question close to my heart. What are your thoughts on transgender patients? Do you consider it more a psychological issue, or a neurological issue?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v5i8t/iama_27_year_old_phd_student_in_psychology_with/c51k2qc?context=5)|I don't consider it an issue at all. Being transgender/transsexual is a lifestyle choice not a pathology. It is societies lack of acceptance which gives these individuals all the trouble they face!
[Do you feel that there is a stigma in society regarding going to a psychologist for help?  If so how can we as a society overcome this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v5i8t/iama_27_year_old_phd_student_in_psychology_with/c51j85m?context=5)|There is a huge stigma....HUGE! even among health care providers such as doctors and nurses. They often feel if they refer someone to us they are essentially calling them crazy! To fight it I feel like we have to normalize the process and be more open about talking about it. We also need to stop attributing everything to attention seeking and laziness/weakness.
[How do you feel about the use of medication in treatment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v5i8t/iama_27_year_old_phd_student_in_psychology_with/c51j85m?context=5)|Medication for more severe pathology is essential. For everyday stuff like depression, anxiety, stress, it is no more effective than therapy and alot more expensive in the long run. It is also not a very effective method of long term treatment.
[What is the most rewarding experience you've had with a client so far? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v5i8t/iama_27_year_old_phd_student_in_psychology_with/c51j85m?context=5)|Most rewarding experience was working with a man who had multiple systems atrophy. I would go to house and work with him each week and he would tell me stories about his life even though he couldn't move. I felt like I really made his life better. 
[How do you treat patients suffering from severe depression?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v5i8t/iama_27_year_old_phd_student_in_psychology_with/c51kqn6?context=5)|Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. You work on the Negative Cognitive schema they have developed. This is essentially a negative style of thought they use that perpetuates itself.
[What do you think about the dual-process model?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v5i8t/iama_27_year_old_phd_student_in_psychology_with/c51pzru?context=5)|Do you mean the dual diagnosis model?
[Implicit processing attempts to maintain the current mood by gathering acquired information that is similar to the current mood.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v5i8t/iama_27_year_old_phd_student_in_psychology_with/c51qoy5?context=5)|Implicit processing can't do anything. The term processing is just a construct we use for the way the brain organizes thoughts. It is not ""Real"" and certainly does not ""make choices"" to maintain a mood. The body reacts to the environment, it does not choose to maintain a mood. The environment causes us to have a mood and our body reacts.
 |As far as the difference between explicit processing and implicit processing I have no idea how one would divide this. Our brain does one type of processing. Only us humans name it differently for us to understand the complexity.
 |If you read Aaron Beck he explains what I think this guy is getting at in much more simple terms. This sounds like someone who is trying very hard to get to the nitty gritty of why cognitive therapy works for depression. Its good work to be done, but as far as being a therapist all I care about are actual techniques I can use. Since I cannot go inside someones mind and change the way they implicitly process information this article would not be very helpful to me. You have to remember, unless I can do it in the therapy room in 1 hour a week its not gonna work.
[Implicit and explicit processing has been around since Freud, it's nothing new. You don't believe in any sort of thought other than conscious thought? Beck certainly believed in unconscious emotions and drives, it's pretty much central to his theories. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v5i8t/iama_27_year_old_phd_student_in_psychology_with/c51ro23?context=5)|My point is that Freud had different terms for it, so did Jung, and so did Adler, and Beck, and Ellis, and everyone else under the sun. None of them are correct because they are just conceptual models of understanding the brain. And no unconscious drives are not central to Beck's theory. Beck's theory comes from how we process information incorrectly...not that we secretly and unconsiously want it to be incorrect to meet some unconscious need.
 |Also if your talking about ""the unconscious"" it is much older than Freud my friend. 
[How do you go about getting research/ clinical experience? Ive always found it tricky due to patient/ doctor confidentiality and the things I'm allowed to sit in on etc. Why is it so hard to be APA accredited? Is there anything that makes you stand out?  Thanks for your reply, its really helpful!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v5i8t/iama_27_year_old_phd_student_in_psychology_with/c51j2jd?context=5)|I would say go ask professors about opportunities for research experience. All profs a required to do research and they love when students ask to help! You are aloud to shadow at almost all places. You may just need to sign a confidentiality agreement. I shadowed for a year at a children's hospital and wasn't aloud to talk in therapy, but could participate in discussion afterwards. It is hard because there are way more students than their are positions. Its because there are some schools out there (terrible schools) which are puppy mills for psychologists. My class only has 4 people in it. Some schools push out 100 psychologists a year and they flood the market and take away all the good spots.
[Did you volunteer to do all those hours?

You have to do a certain number of practicum hours before you can graduate. I have donn 20 + hours a week for the past 4 years. Most heartbreaking case has to do with severe abuse. I worked with a girl who was abused by her father for many many years. It was essentially torture. The dad died very young which left the girl feeling both morning for her father but also guilt for feeling happy he was dead.
[Aww man, that is horrible. I mean, it is still her dad, so she has some unconditional love left. But it's horrible that parents do such things to their kids, who are supposed to be able to trust them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v5i8t/iama_27_year_old_phd_student_in_psychology_with/c51iv9t?context=5)|Yeah it was really hard to here her talk about each week.

[How do you feel about the division between biological/psychiatric/medical models of mental health issues that focus on medication as the first (and often only\) line of treatment and psychological models that look at maladaptive patterns of thought, feeling and behaviour that stem from early childhood experiences?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v5i8t/iama_27_year_old_phd_student_in_psychology_with/c51k7qk?context=5)|You must look at the person holistically.

[What do you think about using more psychology and psychiatry in prisons (i.e. more of a focus on rehabilitation rather than retributive punishment or isolation\)? Basically, to what extent do you think we'll be capable of overriding a lousy upbringing, the habits of criminal conduct, etcetera?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v5i8t/iama_27_year_old_phd_student_in_psychology_with/c51pzj9?context=5)|Every federals prison has many psychologists that work at it to do just this! I am not sure how helpful it is because I am not familiar with research. I really think the problem is that negative punishment (going to jail) is a really ineffective way of teaching anyone anything. Positive reinforcement is the best way. We would be better off paying criminals 1000 bucks a year for every year they stay out of trouble. I know it seems very odd because of morality (we shouldn't pay criminals), but it would be more effective than locking everyone up from a psychological perspective. 
[How would you go about treating a patient with ADD/ADHD who doesn't want to take medications such as adderall and ritalin?

[When I suffered with eating disorders, my counsellor explored my relationship with food, rather than the real causes which were to do with my relationship with my family, and the fact that I struggle to cope with change or stress.  I’m interested to know your view on eating disorders, and what counsellors/psychologists are taught on this issue?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v5i8t/iama_27_year_old_phd_student_in_psychology_with/c51isps?context=5)|Thats a complicated one....the recommended treatment is cognitive behavioral therapy in conjunction with interpersonal processing therapy. What this means is working both on the thoughts and behavior that contribute to the eating disorder...but also working on how control in relationships and in life works for you. Most times eating disorders come down to people being overly controlling in situations where they feel like they don't have alot of control. So they control the one thing they can...which is their body. Its like a silent protest. Also the media and girl on girl pressure is a major contributor. So deconstructing that peer pressure is really important as well. Overall I would say that a therapist who does not explore underlying causes is doing a half ass job...
[Thanks for answering my questions, and good luck with your PhD! I'm thinking of going back into therapy again to resolve some issues, although experiance should tell me that, for me, it probably doesn't work.

Unfortunately at the undergraduate level I wasn't able to get any research/clinical experience, so I've decided to get my master's in psychology (with a concentration in clinical\) before applying for Ph.D. programs.  Basically, I'm looking for words of advice/encouragement!  I know counseling psych is a little different from clinical in terms of training/academic programs.  How difficult was it for you to get accepted into your program?  What were your criteria for selecting programs to apply to?  How easy/difficult was it to find and take advantage of financial assistance opportunities (i.e. GTA/GRA\)?  Do most applicants to these programs have bachelor's degrees, or master's?

I wanted a program which had a big emphasis in multiculturalism and was APA accredited. They also had high rates for APA internship placement. My program helped me alot financially, but now grad students no longer have access to subsidized loans...which will make it harder. Even mix on BA and MA when applying.

[Here is a question for you. My sister is currently seeing a therapist for her behavior. However, I don't think the therapist has all of the information about my sister.

[Are you familiar with behavioural psychology and have you ever used it to help a patient? I may be using the wrong term for it...

Your using the term correctly as well. Behavioral therapy is a cornerstone of therapy. As therapist we reward good behavior and do not reward ineffective behavior. This is especially true when working with kids and those with special needs. Everytime you do a sticker chart with a kid you are using behavioral therapy. In fact almost every classroom in the world uses some form of rewards system. I have used it particularly with a kid I worked with who had trichotilamania (pulling out hair). 
[That's neat, I wasn't sure how wide spread it was in human ""training"" so to speak. It makes sense that it's used for children - I'd think they are far easier to reward, lol.  Would you mind going over what you did with the kid who had trichotilamania?  Also, when you are dealing with adults, what do you do to reward good behaviour? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v5i8t/iama_27_year_old_phd_student_in_psychology_with/c51jgym?context=5)|With the kid we did exposure training. Holding the hair but not pulling it out. Also discussing what different hair styles meant to her. Also she would use a journal and log each time she pulled her hair out. Every week that the number of times went down the more hair rewards she would get...things like ribbons and headbands and other fun things for her hair. Things like that.

She knew my mother was paying her so she didn't give a damn about my well being or anything she just wanted something to share with my parents.

Ideally I'd like to become a librarian in a public library or school, or I'd like to become an English teacher at the Secondary level. I currently hold a B.S. in Psychology and understand that I need to head back to school and complete further training to enter either field. I do have experience working in an academic library as a student worker, and I have also held an internship in special collections. I also tutored a fourth grader who struggled with reading and found this work to be incredibly rewarding--hence my desire to get into teaching.

But I feel I have arrived at an impasse when it comes to pursuing either of these potential career paths: I understand that acquiring a job in either of these fields will be quite an endeavor--a difficult one, but one that I am incredibly passionate about. Aside from continuing my education, where do I start? I would love to get involved in after school programs, but I currently hold a standard 8-5 job that prevents any volunteer time during the school week. Any input as to where I could begin getting more experience is much appreciated.

I would love to either teach or work in a library in the Madison area, but I understand that limiting oneself to a particular area is not realistic when it comes to either of these fields. Yet, I am hoping to continue living in Madison, and therefore, I am willing to commute in order to stay in the area and do anything and everything to obtain a job here. What advice do you have for getting a job in either field in the area? Which is most practical to pursue what with the current job climate? Any advice for getting a library or teaching job in Madison?

Also, I am interested in applying to either UW-Madison or Milwaukee for school. Does anyone have experience/advice with the MLIS/Education programs at either of these locations?

Any and all advice is much appreciated!"

I live with two roommates who were friends and knew each other before, and I didn't meet them until the day I moved in. Yes, I do hang out with them, but they really don't do much.

All of this pretty much means I have a lot of free time to myself here, and I've been getting extremely bored. I get bored of video games pretty easily, and they are too expensive for me to buy a ton of different ones. I read a lot, and I could start getting books but that's not very original. So I want to know what you guys do that I'd be able to learn over the course of the summer and continue with throughout my life. Preferably, I want to learn a skill that would improve my life over the long run, or at least be interesting enough to be a conversation starter.

v6vuy,1,2012-06-17,"Reddit, I recently had a TERRIBLE experience with my orthodontist. What should I do? ",g3t0nmyl3v3l,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/v6vuy/reddit_i_recently_had_a_terrible_experience_with/,"So, the other day I went to the orthodontist because i needed to get my teeth cleaned. When you get your teeth cleaned when you have to get the wires in your braces taken out.

My orthodontist usually has only interns. Fresh out of college. They never know what they're doing, they always hurt me, and sometimes it's as stupid as what happened the other day.

This intern lady had the simple task of putting my wire back in, but it was obviously too long. I thought she realized and would stop to cut it, but I started day dreaming and didn't say anything because I thought she would have it handled. So, she gets it in, and she needs to pull it out for god knows why. But It wasn't to cut the wire because she realized that later. Okay so she starts to pull and yank, and it hurts like a bitch. So she leaves me there for about 15 minutes doing absolutely nothing with half a wire in my mouth while she silently calls 2 other people over to help, so then I had 2 other people try and pull the wire out and no one said why it needed to come out. So they just end up saying fuck it and the actual orthodontist main person comes over and says ""oh, we'll just push it in if we can't take it out!"" and pushes that shit straight in to my gums.
Okay so now I'm bleeding, and he doesn't really notice, and then he calmly says ""oh, that's a bit too long. I'll cut that out for you."" okay so this wire cutter that he uses does in fact cut the wire. But once the wire got cut the excess wire just went deeper in my gums and they spend 2-3 minutes to try and get it out. Then he pushes the other side in my gums and that hurts like a bitch, but wasn't as bad.

Since they were pushing and pulling so much my mouth was sore for almost a week. (this happened about a week ago and my mouth is still kinda sore.) and come to find out, while they were pushing and pulling so much, it made one of the brackets (the big metal pieces on each tooth) come off my tooth. I know that it wasn't me because my mouth has been too sore to eat anything besides ice cream and really really soft stuff. The bracket is currently barely attached to my tooth, but I don't want to go back because of that experience.

I have had maybe one or two good - OK experiences in the 3 years I have gone to that place, but this has been by far the worst. My supposed to be 15 minute appointment went for 110 minutes.

But it's not like I can just stop going there because my parents already paid it all off. But that was just ridiculous and shouldn't be ignored.

Reddit, please help me."

The problem is that I will swtich from a student to a counselor this summer, then become an intern, then work as an au pair. Therefore I'm not consistent, and already have to obtain a new visa for next year. I'm wondering what the process is with getting contracts with products, specifically Huawei wifi. I want a two year contract, is that possible or should I shell out a ton of money to buy contract free (which I really don't want to...)

I can afford monthly fees..though another problem is my location will change a lot this summer, once again this fall, and next year but will stay consistent that year.

I'm sorry I don't know much about buying wifi, and I've discussed with those who have said buying wifi is not possible because we are not citizens. But this wifi should work internationally, right? And I just commit to a place for two years, right? 


Thanks!!

v6p37,0,2012-06-17,What is one of the most unfair gifts you have seen given in your lifetime? Do you think you or someone else deserved that gift instead and why?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/v6p37/what_is_one_of_the_most_unfair_gifts_you_have/,"I attended a high school graduation party for my stepsisters the other night and when it came time to open their presents they both got brand new MacBook Pros. Neither of them are going to college, one of them is a racist, they both work at fast food joint without any other plans, they both have done some really messed up things behind peoples backs, they take so much for granted, I don't even know if they have friends anymore because of all the drama they got themselves in, they both had not so good GPAs, and they are constantly fighting with my stepmother.

My graduation year I got a card with some money in it. I got accepted and went straight to college after high school, I had a 3.6 GPA last semester, I hardly ever gave my dad and stepmother any trouble when I was living with them, I always did my damn chores (plus extra), I was featured in my school newspaper once, I'm not a racist, I work as a stage tech apprentice at my school, plus an internship as a PA for a small production company, I surrounded myself with great friends, and I have my own apartment by my school. I do not receive any financial aid from my father/stepmother at all. Except for one time where I had to practically beg my dad to help out with an unforeseen tuition spike a little less than 300 bucks, which I came home and worked for in the hot sun.

I want to be an editor so a MacBook Pro would have been a dream gift for me although I never would have asked for it because of how expensive they are. It's not even the laptops that grind my gears but really the fact that my spoiled and ungrateful stepsisters are rewarded for misbehaving and making bad choices while I, who took on a lot more responsibility and hardship, got a card with I don't even remember how much in it. It must not have been a whole lot otherwise I probably would have remembered that. It definitely sucks knowing that those very expensive gifts are going to go to waste on my two undeserving siblings. 

Reddit, what's an uncalled for gift that you have seen given out? Can you think of someone else including yourself that may have deserved it more?"
v6o5w,35,2012-06-17,"Building a homestead and need advice on managing time, money, and my career. ",TimeVsMoney,homestead,https://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/v6o5w/building_a_homestead_and_need_advice_on_managing/,"Hello fellow homesteaders, I was hoping to get your opinion on my current situation. I'm in my late 20s and have bought a nice piece of land (~15acres) about 25 miles outside the city of a half million where I currently work. The land currently has no improvements, and is a mix of approximately 10 acres of gentle rolling hills and about 5 acres of cleared pasture near a creek. I have many plans for the land that include fruit trees &amp; bushes, a vineyard, large gardens spanning several acres, ponds, and paddocks for chickens and ducks. My business plan involves selling my products at farmers' markets and to local food distributors. Once I have these systems in place I'd like to work the agrotourism and education angles by hosting school field trips and teaching/hosting community education on topics relating to gardening, permaculture, and small scale ag. I understand that building and maintaining all of these systems will take a number of years and involve a tremendous amount of effort, so I would eventually like to host WWOOFers on my land to help me maintain the land and run the business. In my plans I have set aside an area for 2-3 small guest houses that would house farm interns. 

In the meantime, I'm working my 9-5 in the city, making good money which allows me to pay down the mortgage on the land fairly quickly. Despite having a 25 year term on the mortgage I'm on track to pay the loan off in 6 to 7 years. Now my dilemma is the old compromise between time and money. I have all these great plans for my land, but I don't feel like I have as much time as I'd like to implement them. I find myself sitting in a cubicle at work wishing I could be outside on my land. Some days it makes me pretty miserable, other days I take comfort in the stability of having a constant paycheck and aggressively paying down my mortgage. 

My question is this: at what point should I quit my job and start homesteading/market gardening full time? I wish I could do it tomorrow, but I'd deplete my saving pretty quickly without replacing my income. 

On the most conservative end of the spectrum, I could wait until I've paid off my land, built a house and paid it off, and have a substantial amount of savings. This would allow me to be a full time homesteader in my mid 30s. 

On the more risky end of the spectrum I could save up enough money to float my mortgage for 2 years, quit my job, and try to earn a living off my land. This would help me escape the cubicle, but I'd be taking a bigger risk than I'm typically comfortable with. 

Somewhere in between these extremes would be the idea of building the food systems and a house while I'm still employed and switching over once I have adequete saving to float any remaining debt for a few years. This is the track I'm currently on, but it is slow and I feel like I'm making little progress towards my goals. 

I know everyone's situation is unique, but I'm hoping that someone in the community can give me some ideas or encouragement to help me jump start my dreams. Are there any government grants that I could take advantage of to help me take the plunge and ease the transition? I've looked into the USDA specialty crop grant but it seems to be mainly awarded to universities and large producers. Any advice or insight is greatly appreciated. "

I've recently been introduced to the game of squash, and I'm wondering if anyone here would be interested. I play with a group of friends on Wednesdays, but that's all the partners I have for now. I am currently awful - if you're new, I'd be very happy to have someone to flail around with. If you're good, I'd love some tips and I'll happily get demolished. I do love meeting new people and redditors no matter what!

I'm thinking about booking the courts on Mondays and Fridays at 5:30PM - if no one shows up, I'll happily practice service, but hey, it's way more fun to play for real. Unfortunately, evenings/weekends are the only time I'll be able to play - I'm currently on internship and I work weekdays.

It's free with your recreation pass, and racquet rentals are $2.50 a pop if you don't have one. 

Hope there's some interest. Looking forward to meeting some new folks!"

I once used: ""I'm not very good at networking for the sake of networking.  I like to get to know people, but not just to get a job some day.""  That wasn't verbatim, but that's the gist of it.

Hi every, little time lurker, but I wanted to introduce myself and post because I need some support right now from people who ""get it."" I want to tell my whole story, but if you don't want to read I will, of course, include a TL;DR.

I am a 27/F. My problems began in my second year of college. Up until then I had been a stellar student; graduated High School on the Honor Roll, 11th in my class with a Regents Diploma (a New York State thing, I think). Honor Society, Scholar/Athlete, the whole deal. Started working in a pharmacy at the age of 16 and had decided my dream was to become a pharmacist (and not just for the money, I swear!). Got accepted into every pharmacy school I applied to, decided on going to college in Boston. Had a great first year at school, despite coming down with mono that spring semester. Second year of school rolls around and funny things start happening to me. Suddenly, I can't sleep. I don't mean, can't fall asleep til 2am, I mean awake for 36 hours and body won't sleep. I know things aren't right so I see the school counselor who told me it was nothing and wanted me to bring in a tape for our next session so he could tape some ""soothing sounds"" for me to fall asleep to and told me I didn't really have a problem. Needless to say, I never went back. GPA dropped from a 3.7 to a 1.8 at the end of the school year. Spent that summer as an intern in my pharmacy and planned to make up the courses I had failed that summer; never happened and I voluntarily decided not to go back. When I had come home from school that second year, mom was livid, after I explained the problems I was having she decided that I just needed to ""get over it"" and that I didn't have an actual problem. I knew something wasn't right, but now I had people telling me that I was fine and needed to just get past whatever it was, so I continued on. Attended the local community college that next fall (I was 20) and failed there too because I was too sad?/lazy?/depressed? to schlep myself to class. 

It wasn't until 2006 that I decided on my own to seek professional help because things weren't getting better and I had been in a relationship I was unconsciously sabotaging through my behavior (weird manic episodes, crazy bouts of extreme depression). Psychiatrist diagnosed me as Bipolar Mixed (not sure if that's I or II) and subsequently started me on Zoloft and Lamictal. Zoloft zombied me out so we switch to Celexa and Lamictal, which were tapered up to 60mg/day and 150mg/day, respectively. 

Things were okay for a while after that; I didn't feel full of crazy anymore, I doggedly attended school (to my ultimate detriment, but at the time because of my parents concern [uh, over my school, not well-being] I never thought it an option to *not* go to school. I had no plan, well to be honest I had many plans: one day I was going to become an EMT, another day a laboratory technician, whatever sounded like it could get me a job at the time. Took a smattering of college classes that didn't really lead to much, but raised my GPA enough to get into a local private college where I decided to just get my undergrad in Biology so I could at least attempt to go back to pharmacy school in the future. 

Family relationships have ultimately crumbled; my mother co-signed on my initial loans for college and when I was on hiatus they began coming due and I just didn't pay them. This has led to them going into collection, my credit score is absolute shit, and in turn has affected my mother's credit score, which she reminded me about non-stop and I feel like a fucking tool. We haven't spoken since last August. My father's side of my family (parents divorced) treats me like the black sheep. They have great relationships with each other, but no one talks to me unless they have to. It's...awful, and hurtful. I know I've let my family down in so many ways because of what I've been going through, but they all seem just as happy to write me out of their lives.

Fast forward to the last two years or so. I am trying and failing at college once more because I cannot get out of bed some days. Have taken two online courses through the university, received A's, because I could work at them from home, at my own pace. Every other course is a D-. Now the sleep thing is happening again. I also have a job. It's a great job in a pharmacy I like, but some days I just cannot get out of fucking bed. And when I say some days, I mean most. About 8 months ago my boss had to pull my health insurance because I wasn't netting 20 hours a week. Now I net between 8-10 a week. I am actually surprised I have not yet been fired, and I really think it may just be a matter of time now.

I truly don't know why I can't get out of bed/leave the house. My alarm goes off, I look at it, and just think to myself ""no, not today. just don't feel like it."" I have no health insurance so I cannot see a doctor. Well, I could, but it would cost quite a bit of money out-of-pocket, money which I don't have because I work so few hours. A vicious cycle is happening. I haven't been able to afford my meds so I stopped them a few months ago. At that point, I wasn't convinced they were doing anything anyway, but couldn't see a doctor to get adjusted or re-diagnosed. 

So here I am. I am almost 10 years outside of high school with no college degree. I look like a lazy fool in front of my work colleagues. Because I have no degree I have a generally low-paying job and I have a ton of debt and a credit score that can't buy me a bicycle, let alone the fact that I should be buying a car or my first house at this age. I am in a relationship in which my SO has been tolerant/patient of me not paying my fair share in the relationship, but I don't think it can last must longer since he has expressed contempt at having to be the sole-breadwinner. I feel like a complete and utter failure in all aspects of my life and yes, I've contemplated suicide more than once. 

I think my next step is to apply for SSI/SSDI (not actually, sure of the difference, or if I could even qualify). I still very badly want to be a pharmacist, and there is one school (here in the States) that has a completely online program for my Pharm.D, and I am one class away from having my pre-requisites complete to be accepted. Only problem, I'm positive my GPA will not qualify me anymore, and I have to give up my dream. 

I'm not sure what I wanted out of posting here, I think just some words of support or encouragement, or even an ""I've so been there."" Anyone?

v663z,2,2012-06-17,[For hire] MPH looking for any public health jobs,TheYellowRose,SanDiegoJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanDiegoJobs/comments/v663z/for_hire_mph_looking_for_any_public_health_jobs/,"Hi everyone! I'm new to SD; my husband and I moved here for his job (military) and now I'm left navigating SD's job market. 

Most public health jobs are at the state, county and city level. I've found one possible job with the county, but I won't stop searching until I get my first paycheck. The city has no suitable jobs for me and the state jobs are mostly in Sacramento. Does anyone know of any good non-profits that deal with health in the area? Idealist.org doesn't offer up many results. I've also checked out craigslist, governmentjobs.com, USAJobs, publichealthjobs, etc.

My degree is in community health sciences with a concentration in health education and communication. Last summer I worked at the CDC in the Division of STD Prevention drafting recommendations for Hispanic/Latino health communication. I also spent two summers as the Office of Policy and Planning intern in my home town's county health department. This would be my first full-time permanent job.

Any advice, leads, or help y'all have would be great :) Thanks!"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[How can a recent college graduate get on a path leading to similar work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gi53?context=5)|There is no single recipe here. The thing that worked best for me is to be relentlessly driven by the desire to solve problems I really care about, and to be open to changing my mind along the way when I learn new things. A lot of successful entrepreneurs do this. They pick a vision of something that's important, and work as hard as they can to make it happen. It can be done inside companies. They all try to solve important problems. Act as if you already know that you won't fail. What would you do if you knew that you wouldn't fail? (credit to Regina Dugan for this question). And have a healthy disregard for rules. There are way too many rules, and they usually have only one effect: to slow down those how are active. If you believe your activities are in the best interest of the company that employs you - yet you fear you have broken enough rules that you might be fired - then you are doing well.
[What are the career prospects of someone who wants to do cool research and coding or robotics projects (as opposed to manufacturing automation\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gi53?context=5)|Now - on to education. We are trying to design Udacity around the idea of student empowerment. Rather than lecturing to you how to solve problems, we let you, the student, solve problems. I am a strong believer in learning by doing. I believe you can't lose weight by watching someone else exercise. It's really hard to learn by watching someone else solve problems (and lecture about it).
[How can self-learners organize their education so they don't have gaps in their knowledge?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gi53?context=5)|I wouldn't really worry about ""gaps"" in the education. Even if your education is gap-less right now, it'll have tons of gaps 5 years from now. Worry about skills. Worry about that you feel empowered to solve hard problems.
[How do you aim to provide that guidance at Udacity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gi53?context=5)|Mentorship: There is a on of mentoring going on at Udacity, although I agree, we have a long way to go. This is one of the holy grails in online education. Can we educate at scale, yet still empower all students? Is 1:1 mentorship by an instructor really required, or can peers mentor each other with the appropriate guidance? We hope to explore this going forward.
[I'm sure you know the people involved with Coursera. What are the top differences that you see between Udacity and Coursera? What is your relationship like with them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gt3c?context=5)|I really want both entities to succeed. I really like Coursera a lot, and the founders are amazing individuals. Both companies are trying to being high quality education to everyone. We need more entities doing the same.
 |A lot has been written about the commonalities and differences between Udacity and Coursera. You cal easily Google people's opinions. At Udacity, we are trying to change the pedagogical approach. we don't just aspire to bring the existing classroom experience (lectures, assignments, exams) to the online world. You find that Udacity classes are focused around student exercise, not lectures. Videos are minimal, often less than 90 seconds long (although some are longer). At Udacity, you will spend more time thinking on your own than listening to a professor. I feel the online medium is so amazing, we should really go beyond the replication of the classroom experience.
[What keyboard layout do you use? based on the ""cal"" typo, it doesn't look to me like you use qwerty.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51ihjh?context=5)|Oops. Can. It's qwerty and I have no clue what happend. Perhaps UC Berkeley was on my mind (=Cal).
[1\) What would you say to people who want to learn to code?  2\) What programming languages would you recommend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51ghyo?context=5)|Of course.... I highly recommend CS101 at Udacity and the subsequent classes. All of them focus on making you learn coding by doing it yourself.  I recommend Java, Python, C sharp, Ruby, and perhaps C++ - depending on what you are using it for. C++ is great for systems level work. There are of course a lof of special platforms, like iOs, which requires Objective C. I don't recommend Fortran :) 
[3\) What programming languages do you know?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51ghyo?context=5)|I should add: I know only a small number of programming languages. Some are archaic: Basic, Fortran, Lisp, Modulo II, Pascal. This dates me! Most of my professional programming has been with C++. I have also taught Java. Pythin is my most recent language, and I am not very good at it - as some people remarked for my CS373 class. But I am getting by :). I love python. I also love Matlab. It's amazing. I do a lot of prototyping in Matlab.
[At what point will there be too many classes on Udacity? Also, what is the one class you would like to see be created?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gqsi?context=5)|I'd like to throw this back to the people on this forum. What classes do YOU want to see on Udacity? Please reply!
 |Wow - I love this thread. Thanks for the many suggestions - and keep them coming. You just wrote the roadmap for Udacity!
[Professor Thrun,](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51h6m3?context=5)|Would love it. I hear form the Department Education that they are pouring $2B into the development of open source educational materials. They have an amazing vision. Anything ""open access"" is great.
[I am curious on your opinions on the development of high-quality open-access textbooks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51h6m3?context=5)|BTW, I wonder what happens to the idea of a text book in the video age. One of the things that frustrates me about books is that they ""don't talk back"". I can do the exercises, but the book won't tell me what I am doing wrong. I really want to see innovation on that end as well.
[Software is eating jobs, and self-driving cars are going to put a lot of people out of work who currently make a living driving vehicles.  Do you have any thoughts on how society should adapt to what seems to be a ""new normal"" of higher unemployment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51hh5e?context=5)|Ever since time, and certainly through the Industrial Revolution, have seen a restructuring of the workforce. Over 90% of all people used to work in agriculture and now it's about 2% in this country (number may be inaccurate). Are we better off or worse off? I think better off.
 |This is just my personal opinion. I believe society is wasting huge resources with ""inefficiencies,"" and when we invent methods to overcome these inefficiencies, society tends to be better off.  I think we have to be socially responsible to the people who might be negatively affected by all this, but just retaining things as they are cannot be our guiding principle going forward.
 |Just my 2c.
[Do you believe that online schooling will eventually replace all classrooms?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gqo1?context=5)|No! Absolutely not. Cinema hasn't replaced stage play either. What online will do is to reach many more students, those who can't afford being in classrooms. And it'll augment classroom teaching to enable teachers to focus more on the tutoring aspects of learning, and meaningful small group interaction - over giving lectures.
[I have several people with Ph.D.'s tell me not to go on for one after my master's unless my career path genuinely requires one. Are doctoral candidates really that badly used and abused as a source of cheap academic labor with little hope of fulfilling the dreams they hoped they might achieve by earning a Ph.D.?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gt1a?context=5)|I would not share that opinion.
 |I recommend all my student to do a PhD if they would enjoy the process of getting a PhD. Getting a PhD is really all about learning to do research. Research is often frustrating, since you don't just find solutions, you also have to find interesting problems to work on. And someone who's great in college isn't necessary great in research.
 |A PhD is a significant time commitment. Make sure you'll enjoy the process, and you feel good about the process.
[Do you think something like Udacity will eventually lead to PhD level education, or is the general idea better suited for undergraduate work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51hd52?context=5)|I don't think so, at lest any time soon. The PhD is a very personal experience where the interaction with the mentor is really essential. I don't think it easily scales to the Web. I think Udacity will go to Master's level for now.
[What is your favorite project you have worked on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51glsm?context=5)|Self-driving cars, Google Glass, and of course Udacity. These are all very amazing projects to me. Plus - very importantly - helping my son to grow up (he's now 4 years old)
[What do you see as the major challenges for AI/Robotics now and in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51h7e4?context=5)|I think we should really try again the big goal: create human level intelligence. I think this is totally doable. We now have faster computer than ever before, more data than even 1,000 humans can comprehend during their live times, and much better engineering. If I ever run out of things to do, that's what I'll do.
[Welcome, mr. Thrun. I'd like to thank you for your work on Udacity and being one of the people responsible for the current wave of online education that, I hope, is only just getting started. As someone who dropped out of university the ability to keep learning this way is wonderful, both personally and for my career. I'm also a mod over at /r/OnlineEducation, so please excuse me for promoting that subreddit here.  Udacity is planning on broadening their subjects into other sciences and humanities. You have also said that you think/hope Udacity and other online universities such as Coursera will largely replace offline higher education.  Coursera has Standford, Berkeley, the university of Michigan and others backing it. EdX is the work of Harvard and MIT. Udacity has no famous 'real-life' names supporting it. Do you think this will be a problem?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gy0m?context=5)|First, let me clarify. I don't think online education will replace higher offline education. Quite the contrary. I think it'll draw more people into education. Movies draw people into theater. Radio brings people to live concerts. It's long been known that MIT's Open Courseware program has drawn students to MIT.
 |I believe that online education will improve the educational experience and the outcomes. It'll give existing colleges and universities much more reach, and reduce their costs.
[Were you speaking English language in childhood? If not, was it difficult to you to learn English? How many natural languages do you know?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51glg6?context=5)|I learned Latin, English, and a little bit of French in high school. I pretty much forgot all my Latin and French. I learned English mostly by living in the US.
[Most courses in Udacity are at the beginner/introductory level. I also noticed that each course covers less material than its semester equivalent in a university. As university graduate, I would be interested in taking in-depth graduate courses in CS. Does Udacity plan to cover fully that need in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51heqq?context=5)|This is a great suggestion. We hoped that CS212 and CS373 were graduate-level advanced. But I agree we need more advanced classes.
[How come you abandoned a successful career at Stanford? AFAIK you advise your team for a few hours a week? Do you plan to return in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51heqq?context=5)|I commented on my decision to teach online at my DLD talk (google me and DLD video). I really am intrigued to help hundreds of thousands of students worldwide, and to empower them.
[Do you have different views/approaches on online education with your Stanford colleages (Ng, Koller\) @Coursera? Which are these?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51heqq?context=5)|I commented on Coursera above - I am excited to see so much activity in this area. Together we can change the world!
[(transferred this question from previous thread\) **How do you complete a project (that's not part of a class\) where it's not clearly defined, and you don't know what you'll need to learn or what steps you need to do it?**  I can complete classes because they present material step by step and give you exactly what you need to solve the problems that they give you.  But when I want to do my own project, it's not clear what I have to learn to solve it.  Furthermore, I'll start learning a topic to solve it, then find that I'll have to learn something else.  It's not clear how far I'll have to search and how deep to finally get my answer.  Often it's frustrating. As a result, I often give up on completing the project.  So how do you do it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51het5?context=5)|I agree, this is had. The best rule for project completion is to complete it. When you get frustrated, I bet you get frustrated because things don't proceed as you want them to proceed. That's a learning opportunity right there. If you give up, you miss out on the most important part: the opportunity to learn something surprising. If you understand this, and use this as a learning opportunity, and develop pride once a hurdle has been taken - you will complete your projects!
[(I'm copying 2 relevant items from the previous thread, here is #2\) As systems become more autonomous and intelligent, what kind or research do you think needs to be done to make sure the machines ""understand our wishes"" properly? Specifically what do you think about SIAI's efforts in this area?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gmrf?context=5)|I think this is key to intelligent systems. In the end we build smart systems to help us, the people. Not to serve themselves. A lot of existing technology doesn't really connect to people. But.... the machine doesn't have to be human like. My calculator perfectly understands my wishes (by pushing calculator buttons) without smiling at me and asking me how I feel.
[**1. As a child/teengaer, did you always thought you were going to grow up as a person of major influence? Did you always knew you were smart and perhaps always one step ahead of your peers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51inbu?context=5)|I was just the opposite. I didn't think I had a talent. I honestly didn't care much about school, and it took me until college to realize I am actually good in math.
[When did you start getting into computers/coding?**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51inbu?context=5)|Two things I always had were: passion, and a gentle disrespect for rules. If people say it can't be done, then likely those people are wrong. But instead of arguing things, I really tried to do things, and to keep my mind open for learning new things.
[Also, could you please do a C++ class for udacity? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51inbu?context=5)|So be passionate, try things, and when you get stuck don't give up. See it as an opportunity to learn something new. Every wall can be climbed, any ocean can be crossed.  
[You mentioned at one point that designing good questions is key. Do you use trial and error for designing questions or something more systematic? Have you thought about hiring an instructional designer to help?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51grfo?context=5)|We don't do a great job with this quite yet. In my own class, I usually do things twice. The first version of questions is okay, but will be rejected by our internal instructors. The second version is then much better. We still don't do a great job with A-vs-B testing, and we don't yet have a good mechanism for student feedback.  So much more work to do....
[1\) How long would you estimate we have, before we are all riding around in self-driving cars?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51h02w?context=5)|Highly recommend a visit to Google. The company is truly amazing.
[2\) Is Google's campus really as awesome as I've heard it is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51h02w?context=5)|As for time: I wish I had a crystal ball. We are still focusing on getting the technology right.
[1\) What is the reason that Udacity's coursers are easier than Coursera's coursers and graduate level courses in general? Is it deliberate approach? 2\) Are you planning to implement sort of holistic approach when students may get equivalent of knowledge that brick and mortar universities give? Or you are going to provide just special courses for someone who needs just to broaden his knowledge? 3\) It seems that Coursera provides coursers under brands of universities (Princeton, Stanford, etc\) and Udacity provides coursers under name of its authors. Why is it so?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51hacg?context=5)|Some people thought the Udacity CS101 was harder than the Coursera CS101. I haven't paid much attention to the other courses on Coursera's Web site, sorry.
 |We are trying to make complicated material as accessible as possible. And we are trying to shift the focus from lectures to exercises. I generally believe exercises make material easier to learn.
[Ai-class was highly connected to Stanford University. Why did you decide to make Udacity completely independent of any university?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51hay8?context=5)|I love edX and what MIT and Harvard is trying to do. The more of us try to do meaningful online education, the better.
[What do you think about edX (MITx + Harvard\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51hay8?context=5)|Udacity is independent because we want to radically innovate. I think as a Stanford entity, it would be hard to issue meaningful certificates without confusing the entire world what these certificates mean. And remember, in AI Class we graduated 23,000 students with a certificate (and we never checked IDs).
[Thanks for Udacity! It's a great place!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51hay8?context=5)|We have an excellent relationship with Stanford. President Hennessy and I meet regularly. 
[Will google glass ever be... real?  Please! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51ijhr?context=5)|Babak Parviz and the team are working on it!
[For Google Glass, are you currently beta testing the devices with people out in the world?  And if so, is there any way I could get my hands on a pair?  Also, you're pretty awesome both for your neat Google stuff, and for doing this AMA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51h845?context=5)|Thanks!! Glass: A few of us at Google are testing them in public right now, and it seems there is now a good number of photographs of people who spotted us.  But we are not handing them out to others right now.
[What do you think of the future of Symbolic AI?  In what areas would Statistical AI not be suitable? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51hcl3?context=5)|I feel the pendulum swings into one direction, then into another. If you look at the best of AI in a company like Google, there is a lot of symbolic AI. But it's different from the symbolic AI from the 1980s. It's using extensive machine learning, and it marries symbols with probabilistic methods. I believe symbols will be in, but in a very different way from how it all started.
[Professor, I took the first CS101 course on Udacity and I have to say it was amazing. What else are you doing to encourage technology and the sciences? I've always felt that Google should have some massive expo for kids like the Stark Expo in Iron Man 2.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51h17h?context=5)|For high school students: I very strongly endorse US First. Dean Kamen and the First team are doming something amazing for the Nation. If you haven't heard about this, Google it. A great way to spend your time!
[I think Udacity is a brilliant idea, and I'm really excited to see where it will go in the future. I was wondering, are there any plans to expand into subjects outside of computer science and mathematics? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51gywb?context=5)|We have decided to stay within technical fields for now, especially in areas where there are ample employment opportunities. We are getting a ton of interests from employers, and many students asking about meaningful certificates that employers would accept. Once we have figured out how to make it work in CS-related fields, we will think about extending this to other disciplnes.
 |So let me turn this around: People on Reddit: what subject disciplines would you like us to cover???
[Is there a future for Udacity to give degrees or will it always be just a learning service?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51imx8?context=5)|We are moving into certification. We soon will be offering in-person tests through Person VUE. We are working with employers to give meaning to these certificates. We already placed students in jobs.
 |We won't give a ""degree"" any time soon, and we are not accredited.
[Are there any plans for networking courses?  I'd really enjoy a good class on that, especially as the world becomes even more connected.  Thanks for doing what you're doing!  Keep up the good work.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51indm?context=5)|Thanks - will add this to our list. I agree this would be great to have!
[One Question: I'm fresh to the tech industry, coming from and currently on the business side of a start-up. One inefficiency I notice all over SOMA is that businesses are so silo-ed between those that can code, and those that cannot. Certainly the best productive value is had when someone is proficient in both domains, but it's a difficult and rare medium to achieve. As you built a team of researchers, how did you evaluate the proportion of the team which would be focused on each? Do you favor the silo-ing methods, or do specifically search for people with both sets of knowledge? Or instead is having business-focused people superfluous at the beginning of a tech-project?  Second Question: This is the age, once again, of the amateur scientist, so they say. I believe it. Do you believe that great innovation in the next 10 years will come out of garages, or instead do you believe that it will take the foresight, risk taking, and bank accounts of a company like Google to to underwrite impactful research?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51olqs?context=5)|I much prefer people who can do things. Talking is one thing, doing another. We have way too many people who talk, and way to few who do. In Web start-ups, programming is a big part of doing. But there are many other ways. Get things done, don't talk about how to get things done. This is my mantra.  I think great innovation will first and foremost come from great people. People with vision, skill, and determination. (and we only teach skill at Udacity). Innovation can take place at large companies or small companies - even in Government. But often bureaucracy kills innovation.  
[Could you be awesome and do Physical Chemistry? There appears to be little to no online lectures for this tough subject.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c521o9s?context=5)|Noted! :)
[To second this, Udacity's focus on mix of making you write your own code and interpret existing code really solidify the new content they've introduced.  Also, they introduce concepts in a way that really allows you to understand the building blocks leading into more complex constructs.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51ir33?context=5)|Thanks! Cudos to Dave Evans. He's amazing.
[I second this. My company is committed to employee growth and we spend real resources on it. Something that was designed for internal skills training would be sweet. Our CTO currently teaches interns and qa how to code in weekly classes. That's expensive time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v59z3/iam_sebastian_thrun_stanford_professor_google_x/c51i8ro?context=5)|Yes, we are interested. Although I am committed to open education. We can't lock up education in silos.

So I'm in the Chicago area and am looking for cool Asian/white girls to hang out with (for friendship or more, if you're looking for that). I'm an 5'8 Asian guy from LA and will be here for another 2 months or so for my internship before heading back  down to Indiana for school.

If you're interested in going to try new restaurants, hitting up random Chicago summer events, or just want someone to flirt with via text, I'm down. When I'm bored, I spend time gaming, biking Lakeshore occasionally, and just doing random stuff to keep myself busy. Bonus points for you if you're down to go hiking with me on the weekends too!

Just hit me up with a PM and we can take it from there! Picture exchanges are pretty welcome."

I'm achieving high marks for subjects I love (compsci/geography) and have had multiple internships with big name think tanks.

**However**, I'm dying behind the scenes. Although my family is highly encouraging in my decision to attend college, I'll owe over $100,000 in student loans.

v63qt,1,2012-06-17,My life is fucking miserable and I don't know what to do about it.,Metro53,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/v63qt/my_life_is_fucking_miserable_and_i_dont_know_what/,"I don't even know where to start. I don't know why I'm writing this or what I think I'm going to accomplish doing so but since it's the most active thing I've done since finding out that I've been dismissed from college I guess I might as well go through with it.

My life, quite simply, is a train wreck. Yes, there are starving kids in Sri Lanka much worse off than I am. So i'm not so confused or dramatic as to think I'm the unluckiest or most unfortunate person in the history of the world. But still, my life has reached the point where I see nothing redeeming about it.

Throughout school I've always been one of the smartest kids but also one of the laziest, I guess you could say. For whatever reason I've always felt some sort of force field between me and work. I would never hand in homework assignments. I would half-ass studying for tests or not study at all. But when it came down to things like final exams, I would always do well. I got high scores on AP exams without even studying. I got a 1990 on the SAT's with minimal effort. My grades in middle school and high school were decent enough but could have been significantly higher if I just got my work done. Intelligence alone plus the sympathy of teachers who understand that I was a good kid with some sort of mental block helped me get through high school. And I eventually went to a very reputable college on a partial scholarship.

College was a different story. I failed two of my five classes my first semester and stopped going to class altogether my second semester. I  ended up withdrawing from those classes and taking the semester off. Scholarship revoked. At home, I did absolutely nothing aside from visit a psychologist. I at in bed all day with minimal social interaction and ate a lot of food, to the point I gained a decent amount of weight. The plan was for me to visit with this psychologist, get my head on straight, and go back to school ready to work. The psychologist, while understanding completely what my issues were on a level that most people have been unable to get, was unable to figure out the root of my issues or how to fix it. Over the summer I lost all the weight and got into the best shape of my life, and for the first time in months I was genuinely excited about going to school. Immediately upon arriving at school again, though, something felt off, and indeed it was. The people who were once my friends now barely hung out or taked to me, many walking past me as if we had never met before. This piled onto the already significant dilemma of me being unable to get work done. I withdrew from two classes and still failed my other two since I stopped going to class and didn't hand anything in from that point. The next semester, I met with a psychiatrist who insisted that there was no doubt in his mind I had ADD and that this was the root of my problem. He gave me medication.... which did nothing. I actually had a decent start to the semester but eventually stopped handing things in again. More failed classes, and now I'm kicked out of university. 

I have no clear path towards any sort of career right now. I'm not in school obviously. I have absolutely no idea what I'm going to do this upcoming year. I've had absolutely no success with girls; I've never had a girlfriend and I'm known in my circle of friends for having the worst luck, with girls treating me like shit or blowing me off one way or another. All of my friends live relatively far away from me and are doing well at school, studying abroad, getting all sorts of amazing internships, and as a result I feel completely worthless. I see absolutely nothing about my life that gives me any sort of hope for the future. I have absolutely no consolation to cling onto as some form of happiness. 

Just to provide a list of people I had at one point or another worked with to try to fix this issue:

-My parents
-My close friends
-My teachers/professors
-The Dean of Students
-My academic advisor
-The counseling center of my university
-Two psychologists
-Two neuropsychologists
-One psychiatrist
-Three different kinds of medication


And I've found no answers and have just continued to spiral downwards into the shithole situation that I am now entrenched in. No matter how many different people I meet with or how many different things I try nobody seems to have an answer for how to solve this. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to explain to anyone how this happened to me. I desperately need something that gives me hope but right now I have absolutely nothing to cling to for that. That's something even my most optimistic friends have conceded to me. I highly doubt anyone is going to read all of this but I guess it's nice enough to just write this all down and get it off my chest. And in a depressing irony it would be fitting for nobody to read this. Or give me any advice. Since that's more or less been how life has treated me the last few years. "
v62up,1,2012-06-17,"Women have never liked me before, now that they do it makes me angry and I don't know why.",[deleted],AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/v62up/women_have_never_liked_me_before_now_that_they_do/,"I must warn you, this post is long. Throwaway account because I am ashamed to admit this. I should start off by saying that I'm a college student who is on his way to graduate next year with pretty much a guaranteed job in my field. Before this however, I wasn't much of anything. I had interesting hobbies, nice looks, had a decent part time job and dressed well. However, that did not make me seem like a viable person to date. Also, I lived with my parents, so one could say that that was a deal breaker too. It didn't help that my sister seemed to resent me living with the family and didn't miss a chance to insult me because I was a ""deadbeat."" I felt like a burden to just about everyone around me. I felt weak and I hated it. However, that's only part of the story. There are also three other women involved in this as well. All of them I have known over a three to five year period. These weren't the only women that I pursued, but they are women that I liked a lot and tried to develop something romantic with each of them. I failed on all counts. I was massively disappointed and depressed over the outcomes, but I managed to get over it, we became good friends instead, they integrated into my social circles and vice-versa and they went off and dated other guys. This has been more or less the pattern for other attempts at a relationship with other women. I soon learned to get used to it and just stopped expecting anything to come out of any advances I made, until I eventually just stopped trying. I got much more involved with my school work, started working out more and just trying to find other social avenues that I could pursue that didn't cause me to stop and think that I was possibly never going know what it's like to have a girlfriend in college. So, fast forward to three months ago. I get news that I'm getting into my internship, at a place where I'm likely to get the job there or someplace else if I do well. I've also saved up enough money to afford a one year lease on a flat close by and I'm also on my way to graduate and get my undergraduate degree. I'm feeling pretty good about myself and my situation. I told my male friends about it, guys who've been friends with me for years, and who encouraged me to keep going when things got bad for me, and are very proud of me. However, somebody must of said something, or something else must have happened because now, I seem to be attracting women. Not just acquaintances, but women just seem to act so much more nicer to me now and want to hang out with me. Even two of three women who rejected me before (one is married now) have gotten in contact with me and are wanting to get together with me, under no prompting or pursuing on my part. For the first time I'm starting to get dates and numbers and while looking at my life now things seem like they are going great, they're not. I'm now more depressed than ever and it has become exhausting keeping a smile and a chipper attitude in public when I'm out at school and doing my job. I see all these women who now like me and I hate them. I hate all of them. It's illogical and childish and yet it has become this beast that cannot be fed and it's growing. I talk to these women and I want to like them, but I can't, I just resent them. There's a voice in my head always screaming ""Oh, so now you like me, you whore?"" it won't shut up. I'm afraid, I think I'm going to lose my mind if this continues, I've contemplated seeing a psychologist. It's like I finally get a toy for Christmas that I've been asking for for years and the first thing I want to do is take it out of the box and break it. I don't know what to do. I don't even know if this is the right place to post this, but I don't care anymore. I have to write this, just to get it off my chest and maybe that's enough. I'm going to bed now."

This same air medevac organization was started in the late 70's by my grandfather, a man I ended up never even meeting, but now has grown to be very successful even though the hospital tried to tell him it would never work in a rural area. 

These aircraft are absolutely amazing, but with their amazing capabilities comes quite complicated systems even though they are seen as utilitarian helicopters. Feel free to pick my brain about them or even other rotorcraft and even fixed wing stuff and I'll try to help you out. 

Here's what a turboshaft engine capable of producing 750hp looks like, the Turbomeca Arriel 1E1. [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/oMdB5.jpg)"
v5sv4,3,2012-06-16,Question regarding internships,french_toast_morning,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/v5sv4/question_regarding_internships/,"Hi all, I will be starting my third year at university this fall, and I'm studying computer science. I have an internship this summer doing IT work that doesn't involve coding/development in any way, it's more of a managerial/project management program. 

I've decided that this line of work really isn't for me, and that I want to go into software engineering/development. Is it going to be a difficult transition for me? I feel like as long as I continue to develop my technical skills through coursework and side projects I should be fine, and that exploration of multiple possible career paths is one of the purposes of having an internship. Still, a part of me feels like having this on my resume is going to work against me, and push me into roles similar to what I am doing in this internship in my future.


Any advice anyone can provide would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!"

v5qzo,27,2012-06-16,Is suing compatible with Buddhism?,Jacooni,Buddhism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/v5qzo/is_suing_compatible_with_buddhism/,"I'm experiencing a dilemma, and I'd really appreciate some input.

I was an intern at a summer camp last year, where I was raped by a camp staff member. I couldn't do anything to stop it because it was in a single-room cabin with many prepubescent boys who were sleeping all around me. I'm now suing the camp for liability.

However, I've recently been interested in Buddhism. I started reading *Buddhism Plain and Simple* by Steve Hagen, and I'm really enjoying it. That said, I feel conflicted when I think about the Fourth Noble Truth, the cessation of dukkha through the eightfold path, and how it relates to my situation. Is legal action a ""right action""? If I receive money as a result of this, is that... unethical?

I feel like my well-being has been knocked off-kilter by what happened to me. I also feel that legal action is something that would help me to regain my sense of harmony with the world around me. Am I wrong?"

She has conversational level of French. She is less willing to learn a new language.

• I'm willing to investigate any country, but primarily looking at Switzerland, Austria, Germany, and Canada

I was not offered a full time position because of layoffs and budget cuts and freelance wasn't worth it.

I then had an internship with a major television corporation. I worked with a division of NBC Universal and wrote several articles and worked very closely with many of their main columnists/editors.

Is this enough experience for me to start asking for actual career positions? Or am I going to be stuck in the land of internships forever?

I know I could get another internship, but I'm ready to be paid for my work and I know that my portfolio is strong enough to prove I can do it.

v8qoc,113,2012-06-18,Advice for soon-to-be interns / graduates.,freshbreath,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/v8qoc/advice_for_soontobe_interns_graduates/,"I just completed a 3-month internship at a Fortune 100 company as a Software Development Engineer.  It was my first taste of a *real* programming job and I learned so much in that time.  I have lots of things I know now that I wish I knew then.  Before I left, I found myself giving advice to fresh interns, so I thought some of the advice could resonate in this subreddit:

    Note: 
      This is based on my experience at a large company (50,000+ employees).
      Your experience may vary.

* **Relax!**

 * The people you will work with know you are fresh out of school. The environment I worked in was extremely low-pressure. I was able to set my own deadlines for the project I was working on.  I didn't have to handle tickets, answer phones, or provide support for anyone. No one expected me to do anything except work on my intern project.

* **Network!**

 * Get to know people around the company.  When your name comes up during the review, you'll want people to remember you.  Also, people move around in the industry and there's a good chance you'll meet these same people at other companies; they may even interview you!  Having an employee vouch for you makes you stand out against other applicants.

* **""Think outside the box""**

 * Consider this: The problem you're solving may already be solved. The best software developer is one that doesn't have to write any code to solve a problem ... or one that can solve the problem with one line of code.  

 * An intern I worked with was given a project and 3 months to complete it.  He searched for a full day through documentation and found a tool which already solves the problem.  In essence, he completed the intern project in one day!  This made the intern appear very resourceful and independent.  The team had to find another project for him to accomplish.

* **Don't be afraid to ask questions when you get stuck**

 * By ""stuck"", I mean when you have hit a wall and searching for the answer has not helped.  Try to understand the problem as best you can before asking.  You don't want to waste your co-workers' time solving something you should be able to figure out on your own.  However, don't waste *your* time trying to figure out something that a co-worker can easily explain to you in 3 minutes.

* **Check in with your boss/mentor at least once a week**

 * This helped me immensely.  My boss/mentor would tell me how I'm doing (positive feedback) and also how I could improve (constructive criticism). This is much better than hearing ways you could improve *after* you've completed the internship.

* **Be honest**

 * I didn't expect this to come up, but it did.  When people ask if I knew something that I *sort of knew*, I would claim to know it.  This led to problems and confusion on both sides.  Don't be afraid to tell people you don't know something! It can save time, avoid headaches, and admitting your own faults and shortcomings shows integrity.

 * I [accidentally] submitted code to the repository that was not peer-reviewed (which is against the company policy).  No one noticed but I was worried about getting caught, so I fessed up to my mentor.  He acted like it was no big deal, admired my honesty, and helped recover the situation.  Other companies may not be so forgiving, so be sure that if *you* don't know what you're doing, *someone* does, and *fast*.

I know I left some things out but these points stood out the most to me.

Seasoned Veterans: If you have experiences or advice you'd like to share, feel free to add to the discussion in the comments.

# *Edit #1*

crombodin's comment makes a excellent point which reminds me of a recurring problem I had:

* **Be prepared to bother people!**

 * I found that relying on other people was an integral part of my internship.  My project's progress was blocked for *3 weeks* because another team was too busy to implement a feature that I was waiting on.  I ended up poking the people daily (via email and in-person) to remind them that I was still waiting. At first I was afraid that I was the annoying new guy, but I had a job to do and needed them to do theirs.  Other engineers told me that this is part of working in software dev: reminding other people to do their job so you can move forward.

# *Edit #2*

They just called and **I got an offer for a full-time position!** :D (yay)"

I don't know how to approach my friends looking for work. I've hardly talked to them in a long time. I know they'd remember me, but I feel weird just being ""Hey, now that I'm done with college, can I have a job?""

Company background: It was one of many owned by a larger family of companies. Anyway, the business I worked for shut down, but many of my former co-workers are at a sister company owned by the same larger group, while some are at other businesses in the same industry.

v8pha,3,2012-06-18,Well that was an unexpected turn of events...,[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/v8pha/well_that_was_an_unexpected_turn_of_events/,"Afternoon all, 24 Male here

So apparently I've been completely obvious to the fact that I'm supposed to state romantic interest extremely early on according to this [thread here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/v5ldc/ladies_i_am_often_only_ever_interested_in_dating/). I usually try to be friends first to see if I'm interested in her personality. I've always been a SAP, and I've been trying to break out of that be trying to be as social as possible lately.

**TL;DR: Hung out with a girl (22) I was interested in this past weekend, things stall, meet her awesome friend (21) who lives in my town. Awesome friend is now single and it's obvious my traditional method of approaching a relationship doesn't have a very high success rate. I'm throwing a party next week that the new girl is coming to.** 

**Full story:** I've know this girl (I'll call her A) for a few years now, we were never really more than just acquaintances as we bother were in relationships when we went to college together. We're both recently single, and ended up talking a little bit after she found out I moved to a city a little closer to her. 

I drove to her town about an hour away three weeks ago hung out all night but I didn't make any moves as she had mentioned to me she was tired of every guy she's know in the past four years coming out of the woodwork trying to make it with her. She didn't want a relationship or a FWB situation. She gave no signs she was really interested in me.

A invited me out to an anime convention where I came to find out that I'm just not really interested in her in anything more than being friends (She doesn't seemed interested in me either as she was constantly texting a guy all night, who I later came to find out she went on a beach trip with and was sleeping with him.) Whatever, I still had a good time at the convention, I met some of A's friends who were pretty cool. All of whom made it a point to say how much of a good friend/awesome guy I am. 

**Enter girl B.** B met A last year at the same convention and became friends. I don't know too much about girl B other than she had a boyfriend who was being a dick lately. I don't know how long they've been dating. He got an internship in a different state some undisclosed amount of time and recently said, ""There is nothing here for me in (my and Girl B's city)."" 

I was friendly with girl B, she thought I was funny, and told me, ""I bet you get this all the time, but you're fucking awesome."" We got to know each other a little bit, had fun as a group and I ended up crashing in the bed with both girl A and B. Girl A was not happy with me or something as she didn't want to be next to me. Girl B however had no issue with being against me (no cuddling or anything, she had a BF and I'm not going to pull anything with another guy's girl) 

I got home from work this morning (I am temporarily working 6:30PM to 6:30AM ) to find out that girl B is now single on FB. I'm throwing a party next week to celebrate moving out of my parents house and the end of my crazy work schedule. B RSVPed to my party before her and her BF broke up.

**As for some of my questions:**

* Should I try to hang out with girl B before my party or should I just wait until my party?
* I don't have her number (I seriously squandered on that one as I got everyone else's number except hers) should I just ask her for it via FB or see if she'll text me first by posting my number on my facebook event? 
* How do I approach stating interest in dating with a girl who's fresh out of a relationship? Should this happen before the party or during?"

v8k8q,0,2012-06-18,Question about what to do with money in stocks that I need for school this upcoming fall,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/v8k8q/question_about_what_to_do_with_money_in_stocks/,"I'm heading back to school (MA Health Education program at a well respected school) this coming fall and have some questions about savings I have, and what the best choice would be for them. Here is some financial background.

Tuition for a year is going to cost approximately $45,000 (3 semesters worth of fulltime classes, at which point I will have completed my degree requirements and have recieved my MA). I have roughly $17,000 in stocks, and am about to take out a $25,000 federal student loan, in addition to a generous $20,000 gift from my parents. So, the loan plus my parents contribution covers tuition. I will be working at a 30 hr/week unpaid internship this fall, which pretty much eliminates part time work since I will be going to school full time. I was planning on using the $17,000 in stocks to cover living expenses for a year, which I budgeted and is pretty the bare minimum I need to cover rent, food, utilities, etc. for an entire year of being unemployed (the city I am going to school in is extremely expensive). 

Now here is my question. The stocks I have are fairly stable (as far as stocks go, that is) and I MAY be able to start working come the spring semester (that is, if I don't have to take another unpaid internship to further network and hopefully get a job post graduation). Part of me wants to take out what I need for the fall semester, and keep the rest in to (hopefully) make some more money to pay off student loans and save up some more money for an emergency fund. I spoke to a family friend who is also my financial advisor for these stocks, and he pretty much told me this was a terrible idea and I needed to keep this all as cash, not in stocks.

So reddit, what do I do? Take the financial risk and keep some money in stocks, while taking out what I need for the fall semester plus some cushion money in the hopes of making some extra money to pay off my student loans? Or sell all the stocks, and put the money somewhere else (if so where? I get basically nothing from keeping it in a cash account where I have my stocks, is there a better savings account or some other option I should utilize to try and make the most of the $17,000 over the next year or so? I'd like to be left with a little something after graduation so as I am not totally broke and floundering. I'm hoping these unpaid internships will pay off and I will be offered a job, but I know lots of students hope for that and it never happens. Any advice would be great! "

I'm pretty sure that the co-founders just use the money for their own personal trading. Also the Associates listed on their page are not affiliated with the company in any way. I contacted one of them through LinkedIn and he has failed to respond (I was surprised he was actually a real person) and the others are impossible to find.

If you clicked on this through Reddit, you will probably have no idea as to what's going on so pls**

Looking back on things, it’s hard to believe that it wasn’t even a year ago to the day that the foundation of my very internet being was shattered and remolded into the person I am today. What began as a routine venture of scouting out babes at my pool’s apartment complex and having them mire my manly complex turned into sitting under the shaded area of our pool patio talking to some short-ass Israeli kid with a Westside Barbell cutoff on – he stood out from the rest of the inebriated residents like a sore thumb. While the typical pool-goer was chugging Natty Light by the case and screaming abhorrently at the intoxicated person a mere foot or two away, he was fixated on a book regarding human anatomy, completely ignorant of the collegiate chaos that surrounded him. Slightly intrigued, I sat down next to him and ignited a conversation with quite possibly one of the most interesting people to traverse this planet: Jordan Syatt.

As many of you know, Jordan was completing an internship at Westside Barbell located in Columbus, Ohio – because of this, his time here was [unfortunately] limited. During his brief few months of a stay in town, though, he and I became good buddies as he introduced me to a whole new side of fitness; not just fitness in itself, but the revolutionary people who make fitness what it is today: “big names” like Bret Contreras and Eric Cressey were tossed around, as were the relative new-comers who are making names for themselves and who will, in time, surely make their way to the top: Nick Horton, Rog Law, and JC Deen to name a few.

Ah yes, JC Deen. His name: it’s quite pungent. It’s a *formidable* scent; it stings the nostrils in a good way.

If you don’t live under an internet rock, you knew it was only a matter of seconds before his name came to light – you could practically *smell* it.

Perhaps the greatest feat to emerge from my friendship with Jordan was meeting Mr. JC Deen – residing a short fifteen minutes from where I grew up in Tennessee, JC is a fitness enthusiast who began his own business of helping and inspiring his clientele to reach their full potential through controlled and no-BS diet and exercise. I won’t go into details because, well, if you’re reading this, guess what? You already know him. Dipshit.

I’ve made it my life’s ambition to make JC have as many notifications as humanly possible upon opening Facebook. This is done in a variety of ways: pictures, articles, messages, wall posts, “liking” comments – you name it. One thing every notification has in common, though, lies in the actuality that it’s trolling him. Even if it’s not trolling, it’s trolling.

http://i.imgur.com/GwFIL.png

What exactly is a troll, you ask? According to Wikipedia, a troll is *someone who posts inflammatory, extraneous, or off-topic messages in an online community, such as an online discussion forum, chat room, or blog, with the primary intent of provoking readers into an emotional response*.

For you older, non internet-savvy folk, the above definition is a very baseline definition of trolling – trolling, much like any other social activity, has the capability to evolve as its user sees fit. Take, for instance, this perfectly-executed trolling by Jahed Momand several weeks ago, in which he posted an *inflammatory comment* which *provoked JC into an emotional response*; Jahed’s comment, however, was deleted a short moment later. The result? Well, just look at this unprovoked outlash by JC:

http://i.imgur.com/bhyjb.png

Jesus, JC. Quit acting like you have turrets. Calm the fuck down.

So, trolling is not just posting things or saying rude shit, it’s also manipulating and twisting others words and actions around to piss them off. That’s the end game of serious trolling: when it’s all said and done, the target victim needs to have so much adrenaline coursing through their veins that they could smash their monitor in without thinking twice.

What makes a good troll, though? How exactly do you troll? What’s the point of it all? And why is JC the only one being trolled?

These are all good questions. Let’s begin with some of the characteristics that define a successful troll: cunning, smugness, and wit. You read that right – trolls are, generally speaking, *extremely intelligent* creatures. They know how peoples’ minds work, how to manipulate them, and how to *piss people off.* It’s a survival tactic. Revert back to the definition. If you’re “trolling” and not making anyone upset or angry, guess what? You ain’t trollin’. Still not convinced? Let’s look at JC’s three primary trolls:

http://i.imgur.com/3VzlP.png

All of us, despite what internets may believe true, happen to be fairly educated and established individuals – not to sound conceited, but we sure ain’t flippin’ burgers at McDonalds. 

I cannot speak for the other two, but I was raised in the South, went to college up North, and met a whole bunch of people of different race, religion, sexual orientation, political beliefs, and personalities in between. I was raised in a family where two languages were spoken. I’ve travelled to foreign countries, continental and overseas. While I sure as hell don’t know everything about how people operate, I sure know a lot more than your average Joe. “People experience” is a powerful tool to have in your trolling arsenal. That said, we can define trolling as not necessarily being a learned tactic (in the sense that someone could *teach* you how to troll), but one that is intrinsically acquired through years and years of real world interaction and experience.

By this point you might be thinking, “OGM DAT’S ME LOL!” and guess what, asshole? You could be absolutely right! Without you even knowing it, that inner troll has probably been trying to gnaw and bite his way out of your cerebral cortex for *years* now, only to be suppressed by societal norms. The nerve of modern-day society – oy vey.

Trolling is an art. To break it to you plain and simple, there isn’t any definite way of showing someone how to troll; much like dieting or weightlifting, what works for you may not work for the next person. Everyone gets to be their own special snowflake and, over time, develops their own method that complements their personality best.

http://i.imgur.com/m0yS0.png

Let’s observe matberry’s method of trolling. 

Having a PhD in philosophy, he refines peoples’ thought processes (or whatever it is they do), with a heavy focus on the area of exercise psychology. Probably whips up a damn good Pumpkin Spice Crème Frappuccino at Starbucks too. You can check out some of his work at your local coffee shop or on www.myosynthesis.com – there’s good shit there.

If you’ve played on the internet at all in the past year, you may have come across some of his work. You’ve indisputably come across some of his trolling.

If you’ve seen his trolling, then, you know he’s nothing shy of an expert. But what is it that makes him so *damn* good at trolling? Aside from the fact that his profile picture has been trollface.jpg for millennia, matberry *knows his audience* and that, my friends, is his means to success. 

Much of his trolling dabbles in the area of “bro-science,” which we’ve all bore witness to with a simple Google search to bodybuilding.com – if you’re discussing optimal carbohydrate timing after your fourth meal of the day but before your eighth on a controlled bulk, rest assured that matberry will swoop in like fucking Batman with relevant yet irrelevant PubMed articles that not only use your own arguments against you, but also make you look like a complete and total douchebag moron, further humiliating you in front of your peers, xXcurlzbroXx, FKBTCHSGTMONY, and DickTalens. When you finally come to grips with what just happened within your infinitesimal brain, you’ll see matberry is nowhere to be found. Like Batman, damnit. Like Batman.

I honestly don’t give him enough credit. He’s been my inspiration since day one.

http://i.imgur.com/PDADO.png

Don’t get caught up in the specifics of his methods. Remember, *everyone is different.* With practice, you too can become a trolling superstar. Like me.

Some of you reading this may be shaking your heads thinking, “Why the fuck do you even bother? Go outside you fkn fag,” to which I say “u mad?” Think for a moment – if you’re getting upset while reading this, *by definition* I’m trolling you. But the real reason that I, along with many others, troll and will continue to troll is because it’s fucking *fun.*

Recall a couple of weeks ago. D-Day. The storming of JCD Beach. Operation Trollverlord. *His birthday.* Many of you, up till now, failed to realize that May 30th was not JC’s birthday but actually an elaborate scheme developed by yours truly, and executed by the three musketeers – me, Jihad bin Laden, and matberry.

**The birth of an empirical idea:**
http://i.imgur.com/A5dSd.png

Note the date in the photo. In the course of two days (thanks matberry for being on New Zealand time and fucking everything up), JC Deen’s wall was transformed into a birthday apocalypse:

http://i.imgur.com/jCJbd.png

Millions of Facebook users from around the globe flocked to his wall and for nearly 36 hours straight, a birthday bonanza unfolded as the “t” and “y” keys on JC’s keyboard slowly dwindled into nothingness. The battle was won. The war was over. There was nothing left of JC Deen’s Facebook page except for melted ice cream and leftover cake frosting which some fat bitch probably ate for breakfast the next day. Overall, it was a tremendous victory for the trio – needless to say, champagne bottles were uncorked and emptied out that night.

I recall a moment some time back where Rog Law referred to me as being a “monogamous troll,” in that only one person is victimized and suffers from my rampant trolling: Mr. Deen himself. To be quite frank, I had no retort. Why is it that I honed in on JC and JC only? Why don’t I spice things up and troll Bret? Or Eric? Why don’t I troll this chick:

http://i.imgur.com/TS9Xj.png

who believes (or believed) dietary fat to be filled with carbohydrates that will cause her to gain weight? Read what she said. Now do it again. Holy shit, it’s like macronutrient inception: dietary fat inside a carbohydrate inside a fat reservoir. **DA FUQ BRO**

Point is, I don’t really know why I only troll JC. I do know he’s fun to troll and I mean, he’s kinda cute. In a gay way. I’d hit it.

I hope this internets pamphlet helped some of you who may be confused about trolling and why the denizens of the internets continue to troll. Hopefully I inspired you to start your own trolling career. To that I say: Go forth. Become great."

Previously I've completed a two year compositing education, with a four month internship at a rather big studio. I kept working there for two more months and at the end of it I was completly spent. A very rough break up at the start of the internship, too much weed, alcohol and several hundreds of overtime hours left me burnt out. It's been a long fight to get back up, but today I'm feeling back on top. When I couldn't bring myself to find a new job, I took some time of and then eventually opted go back to school for four months. 

Presently I really want to get back into compositing, but I'm unsure how to.. I feel like the hole in my employment record is a pretty big deal and with me being a out of the business for so long - I'm not sure if it makes sense to be looking for employment as a Junior Compositor.

I just finished school for my degree a couple weeks ago and i'm feeling a little lost. When i was in school, i was in the same class of girls for almost an entire year, 5 days a week 8 hours a day. Lately i have seemed to have a hard time making friends so being in a class like that really helped me communicate better and forced me to be more social. Since school let out everyone went their separate ways, moving on and doing their own things. I text a couple of them every once in a while but no effort is really made to hang out with one another. I figured this would happen after school was out so i was looking forward to working some place with a lot of people where i could make more friends. I recently got an internship right out of school and i have been there for a month and a half. Only 3 people work there, one of which is my boss. The other 2 don't seem like we are on the same level with things being that one is in her 50's and getting ready to retire and the other is a party animal, which I've grown out of. I guess I am feeling really lonely. I don't have that friend that i can just call up and spill my problems to. I have a boyfriend of over a year and hes pretty great about supporting me but sometimes it would be nice to just have a girl around to talk to. 

*As far as the internship goes, i get fully licensed tomorrow in my field and that means i will be full on working there as an employee fairly soon. Things are so different than we learned in school so being around experienced people makes me feel like a complete moron at times. Sometimes they look at me like i have 2 heads. I know they kind of look a little down on me because they all went to the same school very expensive specialty school... and i just went to a community college. Its all the same in the end... they just paid more money, i know they don't see it that way. 

How can i be more comfortable with myself... even like myself more. I need self confidence. How can i go about making more friends or coping with the differences in my job and school?  Has anyone else felt like this?"

So my girlfriend and I have been hooking up for about a year and a half and dating for the better part of a year.  We have yet to have any major arguments and things are going really great!  We share most of the same opinions and outlooks and I think I'm starting to love her.

The problem:  I'm extremely driven (professionally and academically) and she's...well, not.  I always pictured my future partner being as motivated to succeed as I am.  The last thing I really want is to be the head of a single-income household.  I'm on track for a very successful engineering career (well paying internships with prestigious companies and I was flown out to Stanford to perform research with a lab for a semester).  On the other hand, she failed out of sociology freshman year and is very uncertain of what she wants to do with her life.  Whatever it is, she will likely depend on her future husband to provide for the family (though money does NOT matter to her.  I'm confident she'd be content with a combined income of 50k/yr).

Similarly, I'm very curious and get by pretending to be intelligent while friends ask me how I can be so patient with her (stereotypical blonde).  I come from a rather poor family while she comes from a decently wealthy one.  I've supported myself since I was 16 while she has never had a job and I honestly can't picture her in a professional setting.

Ultimately, I'm not sure what to do about the future.  I always pictured being with someone as driven as myself and she's quite the opposite.  On the other hand, I really love spending time with her and for the time being, we have a great relationship.  Any advice?

Thank you for taking the time to read this, I'd love to hear your opinions!


tl;dr- Our relationship is going great.  However, her lack of drive concerns me about her future.  I'm scared of having a ""trophy"" wife.  Advice?

I could use some help, please.",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/v817c/pretty_depressed_on_life_i_could_use_some_help/,"I doubt anyone here will actually want to read this, but here is a letter I angrily wrote to myself a week ago and I'm still feeling useless. Just wanted to share. I apologize for any vulgar language.

Dear self,

I don't know what is wrong with me. Well, really, I kinda do. I'm depressed as fuck and I shouldn't be. You know why? It's because you have loving friends and family, a fraternity of brothers to back you up, and nice internship -- wait, let me stop there. Ok, ok. So this internship is really how I thought it would be. I'm stuck here, in a lonely cubicle, doing shit I've never done before. Going from Python code to C# w/o anything in between? What's the point. I don't feel like I'm gaining anything at all and I'm afraid that I won't get anywhere in life. Going to graduate school seems impossible for me and if I can't do that or get my dream job, then I have nothing left to motivate me. I'll just sit on my ass all day looking at Reddit (like I am now) until I get off work at 3. Sometimes I just feel like sleeping for a long time. I wish I could sleep this depression away. That would be marvelous, yet impossible. My medication isn't working. Yes, I know it's because I skip my pills for days. I miss them for 2+ days and it's not good. I feel like my body is about to collapse and I'm about to black out every few seconds. I felt that way in the car this morning (which another rant I don't want to bring up), which isn't good at all. I know I need to take my pills. I'm fucking 20 years old. There's no point in it if it's not going to work. I really want to try marijuana, because *I* believe that it would help my situation, but I don't want to go to extremes, you know? It's not really in my morals. 

Then of course, there's the girls, and [my ex]. Why do I put all of my effort in, yet get nothing out of it? I drop **everything** for girls: money, time, etc and what do I get? A pair of tits that leaves me for 2 douchebags who only want her for sex. Am I the only one around here who wants a fucking relationship that will last? Seriously, I wanted to marry you. I cannot believe that you put me through this. How *I* let it happen and that I didn't back away. It's because I loved you, but you wasted a year of my life. I had to live through your parents divorce, get on depression/anxiety medication so I wouldn't feel skeptical whenever you went out alone, and it got so low that I had to go through therapy. Thanks for wasting a year. I did everything for you and you fucked me over. So the reason why to this day why we still have sex? 1: I like it, and who doesn't really? 2: To hurt you for hurting me. You made me feel like something was gonna work out in the end, but it didn't, and it fucking messed me up. I'm sorry about reason #2, but fucking new people is **A LOT** easier than getting over depression. I'm cutting it off completely now. No more sex. Figuratively speaking, **Fuck. You.** And I'm glad you haven't texted me in days. It's actually quite nice to not deal with your life. I just wish I could focus on mine. But I do hope that your next boyfriend treats you like you did to me. Maybe you'll learn a thing or two about respect, trust and honesty. You know what's worse? I fucked your best friend. You can't get pissy, because you and I weren't dating. I'm free to live my life, but with the damage you've done to me, it's hard when you breathe down my neck about my entire day and who I talk to. I'm not dating you anymore. Move the fuck on. I'm trying my best to. I've had so many chances to betray you, but I didn't, because I loved you. Thanks a lot, bitch.

(Reddit, side note: within the year that I dated her, I cut off a lot of my time for this woma-, well, girl really. She was massively immature. With her, I had to spend over $2000 of money that I had saved up for college tuition. She was my entire world, and you might know what it's like; to love someone so much you would jump in front of a bullet for. Now? I have nothing.)

I just have nothing left to motivate me. I'm stuck in this cubicle for 40 hours a week only to come home and try to sleep this pain away. [My ex], you took my ability to like and love anything or anyone completely away. That's all I want to do in life, like and love. I don't see how anyone could deal with me or like me with this mental state. I'm just at a loss.

I don't feel like doing anything anymore. I just want to be happy again.

To anyone who read this in it's entirety, you have no idea how much it means to me. I would love to listen to your issues and try to help. Making other happy makes me happy.

Thank you."
v7zrr,5,2012-06-18,Have you ever sabotaged your own path to success after getting yourself so close to your dreams? I'm getting there.,icedmatcha,selfhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/v7zrr/have_you_ever_sabotaged_your_own_path_to_success/,"When I was 18 I was shunned by my group of friends after confronting my then 'good friend' of the fact that her uncle raped me. She quickly twisted my cry for help into something far less sympathetic, and as a result I became alienated. My first real relationship fell apart a few months earlier, home was anything but peaceful and I spiralled into depression. 

I turned my basement into a bedroom and proceeded to spend almost two years hidden in that room. On several occasions I would find myself trembling in tears during the dead of night, because I felt alone, and I knew that as a result of my alienation, nobody would have noticed my absence. I had no friends, a terrible relationship with my family, poor health and no motivation. 

Finally after an aborted suicide attempt (my older sister walked in on me when I was in the process of hanging myself), I realized that I was punishing myself for people's misdoing. I mustered up all the dignity I had left - along with a small fortune, got myself in shape, purchased a new wardrobe and at 20 applied for another program that would lead me to the dream job I held on to before and during my breakdown.

I landed myself multiple jobs and internships to prepare myself for my new career, and accumulate an impressive resume. This September I will be entering an amazing PR Program and finding myself several steps closer to my dream. I am living with my soulmate, have a ridiculously wonderful relationship with my family, and plenty of friends. But as the reality of my improvement in life and happiness kicked in, I am not finding myself unconsciously creating problems. Recently I've been ignoring my friends, slacking off at work, picking fights with my S/O and hesitating to go back to school. It finally hit me that I am going to be some average asian nerd, trying to excel in a program (literally) filled with good looking/hot blondes. Now, I find myself wanting to quit.  I can't bring myself to network anymore. I try to convince myself that my intelligence and experience would be my advantage; however sitting in a room full of beautiful people who probably possess the same skills and intelligence as myself is intimidating, and almost unbearable. I am by no means pretty, nor do I have as many twitter followers, or social media contacts as them. I find myself falling further and further behind. At times I feel as if the coordinator accepted me into the program as a cruel joke, or worse: the token ethnic. "

My start was with Elfen lied. I loved it, but it caused me to feel a little depression inside me because it came to end . After two days from finishing Elfen lied, I somehow found myself downloading a game called ""ef a fairy tale of the two"". I liked the Prologue, so I decided to get more information about it in wiki, where I found out about the existence of the anime version. When I start watching tale of memories I couldn't stop, episode after episode until I finished it in 2 or 3 days, because I simply fell in love with every word in it.In fact, I was surprised about the end, as you know in anime like EF someone should die in the end to create the balance, but it was a happy surprise.

Without wasting anytime, I started watching tale of melodies. I finished it. Everything ruined for me forever. From the heaven of tale of memories, I fell into the hell of tale of melodies. I couldn't believe that tale of memories and tale of melodies are the same anime.Because of the happiness that I found in S01, I wasn't prepared for this madness. It is like they were giving us everything just to take in moments. 

Now, I am depressed and afraid to start watching any anime. I just can't take another hit. But I still want an anime like Tale of memories to forget my depression. So, Please no trolling :( 

PS: I know it's too long to read, but I will happy if someone did read it:(

It was an internet marketing firm, looking for multi-lingual students for research and translation purposes. Since I've already done something similiar during an internship in france I felt like I was just the man for this job. When I recieved the mail I was pretty happy that they were considering me and all I read was 
""Hi. Interview. At So and So from 10 to 14 hours. Can you come?""

Not literally, I replied with HELLS YEAH, and was looking forward to it until today. I had to miss one class for it but that was fine. I just had to appear at any time between these 4 hours, RIGHT?

Well wrong but I get to that later. I was making myself ready, feeling like the handsome dude in ZZTop's Sharp Dressed Man, and everything was alright. Until I loaded up the email again to confirm time and location. I actually read it in its entirety for the first time and suddenly words appeared, that my brain had somehow omitted for troll reasons I presume.

It actually sad ""This is a selection day. You have to be there FOR THE ENTIRE TIME PERIOD""

Fuck me. This wasn't an interview, it propably was some sort of test they put a lot of people through to get to the ones they really want. 
Now its noon and I fucked up again. I'm trying to find solace in thinking that they propably wouldn't have taken me (My language skills are superb, my marketing skills undeveloped however).

Then again, even though I've propably read the same email at least 5-8 times I really have never realised the existence of this last sentence. My brain only read what it wanted to read, not what I needed to read. Is it my ADHD? Nah propably not. "

[Parents..........go! how do they act? any instance of special asshattery?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51wri8?context=5)|Parents, I've been waiting for this. Anytime someone asks me if my job makes me hate kids me response is ""It makes me hate the adults raising the kids alot more"" so experiences with parents usually goes one of the following ways.
 |If the kids been hospitalized before, the parents are usually pretty chill, they know the routine etc.
 |We then have the parents who refuse to leave their child with us. Basically in MA if a section 12 is filed on you, you must be hospitalized for up to 72 hours for obsevation. Alot of the times parents will refuse to leave the hospital or will try to take their kid with them. This is when we have to call the cops to deal with the parents.
 |I have two instances of special asshattery.
 |We have ""passes"" on the weekends where a child and their parents can visit off the unit as long as they stay on hospital grounds. Mom took the kid on pass then just drove the kid home. AFter we called the cops and got the kid back, she filed abuse charges against everyone on out unit...all unfounded but still a pain to deal with.
 |We had this 11 yo girl admitted for routine stuff, fighting at school, making suicidal statements, drinking a bit. She comes and her mom is a bitch to her the entire time, swearing at her, telling her she hopes we keep her for months etc. Cut to two weeks later, the girls discharged to her mom (we informed DCF about suspected abuse, they didnt see an issue) Girls back three weeks later because her mom tried to kill her and her little sister. My patient actually caught her mom choking her sister and fought her off. But yeah, if I ever see that mom again I will kick the shit out of her. No questions about it.
[*We had this 11 yo girl admitted for routine stuff...drinking a bit.*  I did a double-take.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51yi0s?context=5)|When I first started I thought it was silly they didn't have a kid's admission packet that omitted that substance use questions, after the first week I realized just how many kids were using drugs/alcohol.
[It's kind of sad that an 11 year old drinking a bit and making suicide attempts is ""pretty routine""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51yeyr?context=5)|Just a clarification she was making suicidal statements, she didn't have any attempts.
[Most fucked up / scary story to tell ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51w0o0?context=5)|There are way too many. One that comes to my mind right now involved this 5 year old boy we had, he was severely sexually and physically abused and thus had a history of sexually acting out. One day I was sitting outside his room playing with him.  Out of no where starts telling me to suck his dick. I try to talk him down, he then pulls his pants down, and proceeds to grab my hair and tries to pull me head down to his penis, i was able to get him off of me but still having a kid that young, already acting that violently and sexual to this day fucks with me a bit.
[Are you make or female? I mean, as much as the whole situation is fucked up, the degree of how fucked up it is changes depending on your gender. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51y2as?context=5)|I'm female.
[Are there ever kids or adolescents coming in who you consider so dangerous, like psychopaths, harming others and fully aware of what they're doing? and would you think it's better to keep them locked up for life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51wlg1?context=5)|One kid (a 9yo boy) in particular comes to mind. He's been in twice, once for killing his neighbors dog and once for trying to murder his baby brother. He came at me with a toobrush he had snapped in half once He was such a good liar, and manipulative and could be so charming. You can't diagnose a sociopath that young, but none of us who worked with him will be surprised if he's the next Ted Bundy.
 |But in spite of that, as far as children go, I am completely against forced institutionalization 
[Wow i'm in shock, i was actually expecting to hear: no that only happens in movies or something. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51wqlq?context=5)|I guess I should add that it is pretty rare. Even my coworkers who have been in the field 30+ years said he was one of the worst kids we had...so it happens but rarely.
[Sometimes clinicians (that I've known\) have diagnosed child antisocial PD under PDNOS.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xbx0?context=5)|Yeah most I've worked with prefer not to just because technically according the DSM you can't be diagnosed antisocial until your 18, even if its under PDNOS. Most I know will label it as conduct disorder (which is pretty much just a child version of anti-social PD)
[What's PDNOS?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51y4nd?context=5)|Personality Disorder Not Otherwise Specified.
[I'd always heard ""PDDNOS"" - Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified, but it's nothing like what you are describing - at least not what I've learned of. Do you know if they are just to very similarly-named, different disorders?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51yjcb?context=5)|Yeah, PD is any type of personality disorder.

Do you have anymore stories?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xuyn?context=5)|This is probablly the only time I've been full on left speechless by a kid running their mouth. This 7 yo girl (who was one of the cutest things ever) and this boy are having a fight. I seperate them but they're still yelling down the hall to each other. SHe tells him to go suck his dad's dick. He says that his Dad is dead. She replies ""Good then go dig up his fucking bodies and suck the maggots out of his dick then""  There was defiently a good 20 second silence while me, the coworkers, and other kids tried to take that comment in.

[Do you not get drug tested when working with kids? Also I think everyone has read way too much into the fact you have few beers and a blunt.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c5240wf?context=5)|We got drug tested upon hire, and once a year but thats it. The higher ups are pretty chill so they let weed slide, mostly making sure we're not popping any patients xanax or whatever.
[Weirdest thing you've had happen to you there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51w4q1?context=5)|I answered something like this earlier but I got plenty of weird stories so I'll tell a different one that happened when I was working on an adult unit. I had gone over to the adult unit just to provide an extra body becuase they were having a pretty hectic night and all the kids were sleeping. I'm just chilling over there when all of a sudden this women sees me and goes ""Fuck you bitch! You think you can fuck my husband and steal my crocodile""then proceeded to try to punch me. Good times.
[Why did you steal her crocodile?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51ydaj?context=5)|A crocodile's a dangerous item. I can't have that shit roaming my units.
[Did you like working with the adults or the kids more?  Do you see yourself continuing to do this job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xkf3?context=5)|I personally like working with the kids more, but the adult unit is also really interesting. I'm starting grad school in the fall to get my master's in counseling so I see myself staying at this particular job until I have my masters.
[What education do you have? I'm just curious, in terms of job qualifications and whatnot, as I'm preparing to enter this field in the next year or two.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51z7t8?context=5)|I have a bachelor's in psych.
[What is the youngest child you have had admitted?  Roughly what percentage of children you see do you think will be able to be independently functioning adults?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51vnlz?context=5)|The youngest age we will admit is age 4, and we have had a good amount of them while I've been working there.
 |The functional adult question is a little bit tougher. Ideally, I hope with intervening this young, most will be able to function as an independent adult. Realistically, I'd say probablly about 50-75% will be able to do so. Most of the cases where I think they'll have problems as adults, are the severely abused and the ones getting bounced around in DCF custody. The system sucks, so I have less realistic hope for those kids.
[What was the four year old admitted for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51z70d?context=5)|We have had a few since I've been there. One told his pregant mom he was gonna kill the baby then stabbed mom in the belly with a fork. Another recent was a 4 year old girl who lit her mom's bed on fire (while her mom was sleeping in it) because she ""wanted mommy to go to hell so she made it hell""
[Was the child abused? Or does this just happen for no reason?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c5202go?context=5)|Yeah there was abuse in both cases, most of our kids have some type of trauma history.
[Do the kids have to wake up by a certain time?  Can a kid stay up later than 8 or 9?  Male to female ratio?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xy3a?context=5)|Kids can stay up later than 8-9 but they have to be doing something quietly in their room after that time  Male to female depends. We can have up to 14 kids, and the ratio varies all the time.
[If one of them is schizophrenia, how are you told to deal with it? Are you told to act like some of the hallucinations are real if the child is young and doesn't know any better?  How many patients are there per room?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xy3a?context=5)|We don't have too many kids with visual hallucinations but when we do how we handle does depend on the age and if they are able to grasp the concept of a hallucination. Its not ideal, but sometimes we will pretend they're real if its the only option. For ex, this one 4 yo would always complain of seeing snakes. If we ""killed"" the snake he would calm down.
[Most fucked up example of parenting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xy3a?context=5)|All the rooms either have 2 patients or 1 patient.

[On the other hand, do you feel that sometimes the institution you are working for is bad for a particular child recovery and may be pushing him down?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c523kqi?context=5)|It can happen sometimes. A big thing that happens is alot of the times certain kids will bully another kid. Us as staff do our best to keep them seprated or are civil to eachother but kids do tend to bully eachother which is obviously not the best for their recovery.
[I don't know if you have experience with this, but what happens when the child's family disagree with the doctors about treatment, i.e. refuse to treat with medications? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51ww3y?context=5)|Well we cannot give meds without the parents consent to each specific med so in that case they just do all the therapy and stuff without medicine. 
[Are social services more likely to be notified about a family if the parents do not consent to medicines?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51ygv6?context=5)|Nope that's entirely in their right.
[Have there ever been guardianship issues when the parents are being ""holier than thou"" and the therapy alone isn't working?  Just curious.  Not saying a pill cures all (it doesn't, working in pharmacy I get sick of this question\).  But there are times when the two need to go hand in hand.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51zskx?context=5)|Oh yeah all the time. But since we are designed as a short term unit, unfortunately what happens in this case is the patient is discharged even if they aren't better.
[Have you encountered any kids who you found to be especially interesting? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51ykvw?context=5)|Had our own version of rain man. Kid was severely autistic but had every map of the US memorized. Name two cities, he'd tell you how to get there.
[What specifically is your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51w2d6?context=5)|I'm a ""Milieu Counselor"" , which means I pretty much do everything non-med related (only nurses can handle meds at my facility) Running groups, doing checks, just being there to talk, and restraints if necessary 
[If you don't mind sharing, why were you admitted?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51yhi0?context=5)|I was depressed at the time, and had gotten drunk and take some valium. My mom took me to the hospital so I got admitted. It wasn't a suicide attempt, but my IDGAF-ness in regards to my life was enough to have me go in.

[So, job interview! I ask you why you decided to pursue a career in this field. Do you give me that true story or go with the safe bet and make up some nice BS? Personally I think I'd go with the true story (it sounds very poetic\) but replace the ETOH / drug use with something less severe.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c52fxt1?context=5)|I used a toned down version that didnt involve the inpatient stay but mentioned that i stuggled with depression and anxiety when i was youner 
[Do you think since they're young the chance of improvement is better?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51vqu9?context=5)|I think it goes both ways. I do believe that starting talk therapy and learning coping skills at a younger age is beneficial in the long run. On the other hand, alot of these kids are of anti-depressants, anti-psychotics etc, which I think in the long run is worse for the kids because their tolerance level is similar to an adult, so the meds lose their effectiveness.
[I feel the same way about the talk therapy vs. drugs. Diagnosing mental abnormalities in children and prescribing psychotropic drugs to 'correct' them is a very slippery slope.  How long do patients stay in the childrens wing for? Have you bonded with any kids in particular?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51w3rh?context=5)|Most kids stay about 5-14 days or so. Though if a child is still having problems they will stay for longer. We have had kids there for 3 or 4 months before.
[My question: daily seeing all these kids that are messed up, do you think you would ever want one of your own? Do you already have one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51zmwt?context=5)|I don't have kids, and working here does make me slightly terrified to have on haha but yeah I do still want kids eventually. Also, its made me consider adopting kids  more seeing all the foster kids we have. I'm considering adopting a few older kids just because it sucks seeing these kids who have been in the system for years and are probablly not ever going to be adopted because of their ages and histories.
[ off, thank you so much! It takes a strong and special person to do what you do.  Sorry if this sounds really nihilistic, but are there any patients that you don't think will ever be able to function in society? Any hopeless cases? If so, what is their future like? Institutions? Group homes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51ylie?context=5)|Not so much on the children's unit, but on the adult units there are weekly trials to determine if patients should be institutionalized at a state hospital.
[Are these children coming from abusive home lives? Trauma?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51zd05?context=5)|Yeah about 80% of these kids have some type of confirmed abuse or trauma history. And of the remaining 20% there are definetly some kids who have abuse/trauma but are not disclosing it.
[Yea sorry! Like what is the difference between this and a normal hospital. Are there group therapy sessions, or that sort of regular event? Is it kind of like a prison in a way? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xdv9?context=5)|Yeah there are group therapy sessions run a few times a day. We are strictly a psych hospital, so we don't have the same equipment/set up as a regular hospital. And as much as I hate to say it, there are some similarities between it and prison. Locked doors, strict routine, unbreakable windows etc.
[Have you had any patients you especially bonded with? was it hard to say goodbye?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51zw2v?context=5)|Yeah, actually oddly enough that 5yo who tried to force me to give him a blowjob. He ended up being there for three months, and he needed alot of 1:1 time just because he was so volatile with other patients, we bonded. And it was def hard to say goodbye, esp because his abusive parents were giving custody of him again and he was being discharged home. Hands down the most upsetting thing that ever happened 
[How did you get this job? Do they accept volunteers on the floor? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xd5j?context=5)|We don't have any volunteers, everyone is salaried. My position is entry-level in the psych field so some hospitals only will require a high school diploma while others require an associates or bachelors. Personally, I have a BA in psych.
[Is parenting getting better or worse?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xq77?context=5)|The head child psychiatrist once told me the following and I think it answers the question. ""The one constant in this field is that some parents will suck and others won't"" I personally  dont think is a generational thing thats improving or devolving.
[Has your hospital received any donations from Child's Play?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xvmv?context=5)|No we haven't unfortunately. The latest video game system he have on the unit are gameboy colors.
[What is your salary?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xc9g?context=5)|14.50/hr before shift differentials 
[I am a student in psych (studying personality and psychopathology\), and I have a sister that works a similar job to you (though much less stressful and intense\). I am primarily research-focused, but am working on an internship in a MFT clinic. What in your opinion is the best method to bridge the gap between research and practice? I sometimes feel like I'm doing nothing useful for the children you see when I'm sitting in the lab doing lit review after lit review. Even the terminology is euphemized in the literature, so far removed from its' actual human presentation. It takes a lot to force yourself to think about what ""negative urgency, etc."" actually means. What are your opinions regarding this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51xeur?context=5)|I definetly think research plays is just as important as clinical work. Most of the time I'm using all the concepts I've learned in my classes without consciously realizing them. For example, when a kid has a good day and I decide to give them an extra 10 minutes to stay up before bed even, or make them go to bed early if they had a bad day I dont think to myself ""Why, thats some nice operant conditioning."" when really thats all it is 
[Hate to be this guy, but proof?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51ygw1?context=5)|The only proof I have blatantly reveals who I am/where I work, and between my bosses and angry ex patients I dont want to just post it.

[If you were a parent, and you child had to be admitted to a psych ward, would you let the doctors administer anti-depressants or the likes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51yul9?context=5)|Honestly, I have no idea. I guess it would depend on the severity of the issues, the kids age etc.
[ off, thank you for what you do.  Do you or someone else use any art therapy techniques with your patients and if so, does it help? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51ztzb?context=5)|Yeah actually we have an art therapist do a group with the kids almost daily, and most of the kids love it and I think it does help them process things that are hard for them to vocalize. That being said most of the adults patients think its bull shit haha.
[Have you ever seen that documentary, Child of Rage? (you can find it on youtube.\) Have you ever had kids who acted in that manner? if so, do you have some examples? If you don't want to watch it, basically it's this 6 year old kid and her 4 year old brother who got adopted when they were little, and were abused before. She kills baby birds, stabs cats, tries to kill her brother and sexually abuses him, tries to kill her parents, and does sexual things in public....anyhow, I was just wondering if you've ever had that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c521w41?context=5)|I'm interested in that, I'll check it out tonight.
 |But from the description you gave, I have at least one kid like that on the unit at all times.
[What do you guys do with the children who aren't coping well even after months with you guys? Do you just send them home until the next time they're admitted or is there a long-term facility they can go to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c520uwd?context=5)|It depends on the case, but ususally we will send them to another hospital (and its common for us to get kids from other inpatient facilities) 
[Ever have a patient be incorrectly diagnosed? What happened?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51zb0h?context=5)|Not too often, most of the time people come in with diagnoses they've had  for a while so we don't often do any intial disgnostics. The most common thing though is when someone comes in with depression symptoms, and are given anti-depressants, often times if they are actually bipolar instead of depressed the anit-depressants will make the patient manic.
[I have a bit of a boring question. What did you study to get your position? I'm studying psychology and i'm interested in developmental Psych. Did you do any post grad work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c5248f2?context=5)|Im starting post grad work in the fall, but as of right now all I have is a bachelors in psych.

Anything, perhaps, that you never would have predicted?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c5246dq?context=5)|Honestly the language coming from these kids is the most shocking, never thought i'd hear myself being called a cunt by an adorable little kid, but now it doesn't even phase me.

Often, people start working here and then realize its not what they want for a career. Also develop a thick skin, you will be called every insult imaginable at some point in your career.
[What kind of routine or 'day' dl the kids have.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v6zm3/iama_worker_on_the_childrens_wing_of_a_pysch/c51w1as?context=5)|During the day (the 7-3 shift), the kids have free time until breakfast after the kids have school/tutoring and therapy groups. On the 3-11 shift, if the kids have outdoor privs, we take them outside for a few hours. After that they have dinner, then a movie, then bedtime's between 8-9 depending on the kids age.

v7uhp,14,2012-06-18,Unpaid internship is becoming more and more unethical,Acidwits,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/v7uhp/unpaid_internship_is_becoming_more_and_more/,"So I started the summer with great gusto at an unpaid internship at a small digital media startup (Red flag 1). Under the circumstances I was ok with it but recently things have been becoming increasingly unethical and weird. 
Examples include, the company is composed entirely of one person and half a dozen he's hired (we even get advertised as ""staff"")
Then there's the work the other guys are doing. Churning out facebook and twitter posts like their lives depend on it. I do different things involving analysis and system improvements but I still end up with 4 hours a day doing nothing and am expected to put in the hours until the 5.
Then there's the boss/company. Not incorporated, no contract, nothing on client information protection and confidentiality. Not even an employment contract. 
The HR policy? If you take an hour off expect to spend an hour in sometime during the week. Never mind if I spend that hour doing nothing and add it to the fistful in work time I spend doing nothing anyways.
One of the other slaves has already walked out on this. 
Now the boss wants me to use my linkedin account for the company's benefit, a company built on the backs of free labour.
Now I've gotten another internship that is a life changer for me. I'm glad for any thing in this internship that translated into me getting a better one. 
But for me it's the ethical question of wtf the other guys are going to do. They've got nothing to show on their resume than a talent at witty punchlines.
 I got the job through their job board and a law prof told me to talk to career counsellors. Should i complain to my university? What is the likelihood of this situation blowing up in my face if I do...

EDIT: So just to follow up on this. I quit from this internship 2 weeks ago and haven't looked back since. The crystallizing 3 days included these events:
- I was asked to create a fake profile and history that looked authentic (a real person's name had to be used in connection with their company) and then impersonate them, pretend they're the bottom line on customer service and get more people to sign up with the company.
- I was asked to pretend to a prospective client by the CEO to be a much more successful businessman and entrepreneur. When I told him I'm not comfortable doing this he threatened to blackmail me to the university saying I'd sold client information. Client information he'd done buggerall to protect himself.
- Walked into office the next day and told him politely that I'm leaving. He went ballistic and so did I. Long story short some of the current clients were in the waiting room, they opted out of the service. I spoke to some of the other interns afterwards and they wanna stick it out because only a month's left. 
I don't get a recommendation letter after 2.5 months of exemplary service.

Also regarding my work. I designed the overall framework of communication for this business with its clients. Streamlined it over the course of a month. I learned nothing new and was just churning out spreadsheet formulaes and email templates. But the OTHER interns are basically the ones who ARE the business, like I said, the issue was a moral/ethical one as much as it was about the increasing dodginess of the job.
I'm looking right now at the same job description from 3 months ago posted on the company's website its on the university's job board as well."

v7stu,2,2012-06-18,Student needs urgent advice for internship in Paris,Synroc,paris,https://www.reddit.com/r/paris/comments/v7stu/student_needs_urgent_advice_for_internship_in/,"Salut tout le monde,
This is a somewhat complex situation so I'll try and be clear. 
I am a french citizen who left the country to study at the university in the US. There, I started dating a girl, whom I've been dating for the last two years. She is now currently studying abroad in Paris for 6 months, partly for me, partly because she is interested in French culture. 
Here is where it gets complicated: Obviously, I want to see her in Paris, however my parents are only willing to let me go to Paris if I somehow get an internship there, or at least do something meaningful. However, since I have another internship lined up in another country till September 6th, and I have to go back to the US by september 27th, there are little opportunities for such short internships. Of course, I would like to do an internship in paris for other reasons, such as working in french industry (hopefully finance) so that I can get experience to work there in the future. 

Do you guys have any advice on how to proceed? 
I appreciate your help, since I really want to see her, and so does she. "

What should I do?,nastynip,LosAngeles,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/v7r0h/im_living_in_la_for_3_months_this_summer_what/,"Hey, I just moved to LA from San Francisco for a summer internship and am subletting a place in the south bay (El Segundo) for the summer.

I've never stepped foot in LA until when I moved in a few days ago, so I'm a little overwhelmed by the crazy amount of shit to do, so I was wondering what I should prioritize in regards to things to check out, maybe stuff such as:

-cool neighborhoods/famous places

-awesome restaurants/diners

-good photo ops (Im into photography)

-cool tours or museums 

-good places for mid-20's nightlife?

or anything else that could be interesting, I'm really open to whatever. 


So far I've been to the Getty, taken an aerobatic plane ride over Long Beach, eaten at Roscos C&amp;W and biked the Strand for a bit. Thoughts?"

I'm a college graduate with a BS in Bio and minor in Studio Art. I worked in a lab for 6 years, lost my job and want to do graphic design. I am back in school and working towards it. However, as a career changer, I'm worried my background and age will make it more difficult to attain work, or even internships. I'm also concerned because a lot of job postings want graphic designers who can do web as well, so does that mean learning coding on top of design? Any advice will be greatly appreciated, thank you!

I started using tobacco when I was 15. I'm now almost 19 and have decided I've had enough with this substance controlling my life! I was a 2 pack a day smoker or a can a day chewer, ew. I've been using an e-cigarette to slowly ween myself off of the nicotine for about 4 months since I can't afford the patch or the gum and have no insurance to cover it. I've made it down to 1.2% nicotine by volume which is fairly low. 

***What I'm asking for and why:*** 

I'm hoping someone can help me out with getting a 3 pack of the 0.6% nic. by volume cartridges and a 3 pack of the 0% nic. cartridges. I've come to Reddit as a last resort. As of right now I'm at an unpaid internship which will turn into a pretty nice job in a few months, but I am ready to quit now. 

If you are willing to help you may PM me and I will give you details to the cartridges which are $10 a 3 pack. I would be very grateful.

v7nrq,3,2012-06-18,Is it normal to feel really down and depressed after graduation?,timatom,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/v7nrq/is_it_normal_to_feel_really_down_and_depressed/,"Background: I recently graduated college, and it just feels like I never really got any closure on a lot of issues. Also, a lot of friends just kind of left town really suddenly (some were fellow graduates, but many had internships in other cities), and it feels like I won't get to see them much anymore, if at all ever again.

I'm very lucky to have a great job lined up, but entering the ""real world"" has me very apprehensive for a number of reasons. First, it seems like I'll never again get to laze around all day, maybe visiting some friends and just sitting around chilling without any pressures or other things that stress you out when you have to hold down a job. 

I guess the last thing is the job itself; I don't mean to complain but I'm expected to have very long hours, with very little free time for a social life for the next couple years. It kind of feels like the past four years have blown by and I don't know if I actually made the most of it, even though it's supposed to be one of the best time of your life.

I realize these problems are pretty small in comparison to a lot of people's, but I genuinely would appreciate some advice if you guys have some.

TLDR: Just graduated, lucky to have a job, but feel like I don't have much to look forward to in the future."
v7mvy,82,2012-06-18,Trying to get a job you say?,Frandel,chemistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/v7mvy/trying_to_get_a_job_you_say/,"So, I always noticed people asking ""BA or BS?"", ""Should I just get my masters?"", ""Where are the jobs?""... etc... 


I'm here to tell you, that yes, there are jobs out there. Maybe not the one you thought you were going to get, however, we are not all so lucky to get THE job that we will stay in for the rest of our career. I will try to give my advice in how to get a job in the science field, since I didn't see a guide on here. (doing a quick search of 2 minutes and reading all the same stuff of asking where or what should someone do) 


Exclude those going into College/First Year Students:

Now first off, those going into college asking questions, just take a few classes in the degree you picked first. College is an experience that can take up to 7 years (a great experience mind you). Yes, I have known people who have been in college for 7 years, however since they were undecided for such a long time, they either got a general science degree or a dual degree (both work to benefit in their own way). That is why I wont tell you what you should do. This is for those who have any specific type of chemistry degree. 


Include some Freshmen/Sophomores and a must read for Juniors/Seniors:

Ask to do research with a professor. If they say no, ask another one. If people still say no, ask to help out in the lab. If they still happen say no, learn to cook for a semester. Ask again and again and again, until you are able to get into the lab. This may mean you'll work for free; however the end will justify your means of getting that experience. Intern as much as possible; whether its in industry or academia, it is a must. Do not think that getting the degree with little/no work experience will get you anything. Beg for science sake. This also helps if you are going into further education (applying for grad school if you so choose).  


Chemistry:

This field includes and is not limited to all the degrees that state the word chemistry in the title with the exception of CHEMICAL ENGINEERING. This is a totally different subject matter. Plus, chem engineers get a lot of benefits that chemists don't; starting pay is drastically different and the work place is drastically different. Two pieces of advice for CHEM ENGINEERS: Get an internship and you don't need to further your education, you get paid well enough getting your undergrad alone (just look up the differences in average pay). 


What type of degree should I get? 

Associates degrees (2 years) are able to be more hire-able than BS/BA's in a technician or contract position. The company knows you will stay with them for at least 6 months to at most 2 years (contract) and 5 years full time non-contract. The time spent here will decide if you like repetitive tasks or not (I mean really really repetitive) thus you may go back to school or do part time schooling to get a BS/BA to get a better less repetitive job function. (Pay $12-25 an hour possible benefits and recruiting costs) FYI Most jobs are repetitive especially in chemistry 


BA/BS - almost no difference with one exception: 

**If you want to get a PhD get a BS.** That is the only exception. You can still get a higher education with a BA, but you'll need the experience. That being said, **You do not need to get your masters if you want higher education.** You can go straight for your PhD if you so choose after your undergrad. This still requires the lab experience along with publishing papers. My GF will be heading to grad school in the fall. She and others alike who applied to good chemistry/biochemistry schools all had published papers. Most were first authors or had their names in them. Yes, as an undergrad you too can get published! It requires you to talk with your professor and getting into those projects and putting in the time. If you don't like it, then full time PhD and master programs are not for you.  


With a BA or BS + the small amount of experience you have in academic lab work you can apply anywhere lab technicians/chemists/scientist/contract job postings are available. (If I can, I will talk more about applying below) Note: **Your first job will likely not be something you like.** You are doing it because you know what lies ahead or you really hate your boss. (Pay $14-25 an hour OR $30-60 a year) Notice with pay its much wider, this is due to the experience and type of job you will have. 


I cannot stress enough how getting the academic lab experience is for you to get the job. Do not think that your lab for credits will automatically mean experience, it does not and will not. 


Applying for jobs

* Start applying 3 months before graduation. The hiring/interview process takes a long time, do not wait for your degree, wait for their replies. 

* Join LinkedIn (FYI if you have it already change your password) start looking up company names and put your resume on there. Look at the openings every week. 

* Get on Monster/careerbuilder/Indeed/etc. look at the jobs, look at the descriptions, write your resume to the description (just don't lie). 

* Call a recruiter if necessary; examples: manpower/aerotec/etc... 

* talk to your professors about being a lab tech at school until you get enough experience to get out. 

* be open to move - look for companies locally, but keep in mind that you won't always be so fortunate. (I had to move for my job(s))

* Do due diligence and sharpen your searching skills in different industries: pharma (growing fast), biotech(small start-ups), materials(Dow), fabrics, instrumentation(Waters co), reagents labs, synthetic labs, bio labs, contract companies, auto industry, paints, food, medical, government, etc... 

* Do not feel bad after receiving 40 rejections (I applied to over 50 jobs and only got 1 phone interview)


I hope I got everything, I might edit to add some more/fix my grammar tomorrow. Let me know what you think. I'll edit in some things people found or think is useful. Also, this applies for the biologist in r/biology too... 

Edit 1: bullets didn't work.
Edit 2: I hated the first format

EDIT3: Grad school info for the uninformed

If you are thinking of being a full time masters student... DON'T... be a full time PhD student instead... why? **You get paid!** Well, you may also get paid being a full time masters student, however, the benefits of the PhD are better, academia/industry pay is better, experience needed to get the industry jobs is less, if you fail at the PhD they let you finish up and you come out with a masters anyway. While I was applying for jobs I always noticed that for the same job, a PhD student can come in with 0 work experience while I needed 10 years for the jobs that I thought were super cool.

I'm working as an intern on the strip for three months (nowish - mid-September), and I've been unable to find an apartment that meets my needs.  I really don't want to have to buy kitchen stuff, linens, and other things of that sort, since I'm only here for a few months.

Unfortunately, I don't have a car, and I'll be working late at night, so I'd like to stay relatively close to the strip.  I'm currently staying at a Budget Suites, which is slightly sketchier than I really want to deal with, and doesn't supply linens or kitchen-related stuff.

Any suggestions?"

Be honest, but be understanding.",UrbanSound,Meditation,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/v7e77/a_question_for_you_all_be_honest_but_be/,"Recently my internship ended and I'm getting ready to move from Orlando to Denver. This change has thrown off my morning routine and now I'm not meditating after I wake up in the morning. I'm finding that I have more of an urge to meditate in the evening. One problem, I'm rarely sober in the evening and many say that meditating stoned isn't best for your progression in meditation. I don't fully agree with that, but to be safe I made sure to only meditate high if I had already meditated earlier that day while I was sober. So I guess my short ramblings all boil down to this question...

TL;DR: Is it better to meditate while high for a few weeks until I can reestablish my morning sober routine or just skip meditation for a few weeks?"

Do you guys have any idea what I could do on weekday afternoon/nights to make ends meet? 

I can do a variety of jobs but have the most experience planning events, and booking/managing local artists, have a college degree from a pretty well ranked school, have waitressing experience and am an extremely hard worker but in the two weeks that I have been here nothing has worked out and all my saved up money is going to be gone by mid July with rent/utilities and food. I'm pretty worried about what to do and any advice would be welcome. I have about a month before the internship would begin too, so if i could work non-stop before then that would be an option too.

TL;DR: I need money, am an intelligent hard working person and could do pretty much anything you throw my way. Weird hours though."

I have even said some innuendo and she is most certainly responded positively.  But at this moment we are completely alone. No boss, no coworkers, nothing. I kinda want to make a move but I'm not sure if work is the right place to do it.

[UPDATE] So I ended up going into the office she was working in and started talking to her. I escalated quite a bit. First I went in there and she told me she had nothing else left to do and if I could give her something to do (I immediately thought sex!). I just told her to design me a logo. I did this to get her to get to work for my approval. I teased her the entire time, looked over her shoulder, things like that. I commented about taking a nap on the couch and then said that I would invite her but that the couch is too small. To this she responded ""its perfect."" The innuendo and double meanings kept on coming. Eventually I moved across from her and I placed my hands on her thighs. It certainly started to escalate and I caught her doing the ""triangle look."" This is where I decided to leave it at. She made a comment about her roommates and I asked if any of them were cute. She was a little shocked. I've certainly planted that seed in her mind and I'm a ask her out and go for it. I came off as a tease but this might just play in my favor."

vajy8,3,2012-06-19,Should I just enjoy the moment or try and turn this into something?,twistoffate,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/vajy8/should_i_just_enjoy_the_moment_or_try_and_turn/,"Okay so I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit, but I'm not sure if r/relationships would quite get it. Sorry if this gets long, I must've re-written it like a thousand times before I finally posted. 

So I met this guy from my hometown on vacation last month, and I think the attraction was pretty instant. Unfortunately it was near the end of my trip so I'm only basing this off only a few days of knowing each other. The tension was practically tangible, but, we were constantly ""chaperoned"" more or less by his coworkers (I already knew them, that's how we got to talking, they introduced him to me as the ""new guy"") so he had to stay professional. Maybe part of it was that it felt so forbidden, but we managed to steal a kiss the night before I left and I can't stop thinking about it :) And we've kept in contact ever since, flirty texts and stuff. 

So, he's planning on visiting me next month so of course I'm really excited about that, but we live so far away from each other ($500 plane ride). So unless one of us were planning on moving soon there isn't much to go on... Well actually, I *am* moving- but for 6 months halfway across the world for an internship in the fall.  Definitely complicates things, but because of that I might move home for one full month in the spring (saves on rent, Ill probably be broke after my trip!), so we will only be a few minutes' drive away then. 

But basically, is this doomed from the start? Even if he wants to visit me in Europe, that brings us to a grand total of having ""met"" 4 times in a whole year, with a giant question mark of anything after that, if it even goes that far... 

I also acknowledge that I don't know him very well, and I'm wary of letting things get too heated while he's staying with me next month, I don't want him to think I'm just some international booty :|. But obviously, I really want to and don't want him to lose interest either. I think best case scenario would be like a When Harry Met Sally/Serendipity (don't judge!) sort of thing, where the timing keeps being off until finally it's right? Is that worth hoping for? Or should I just enjoy my renewed sense of having a real crush again, make him sleep on the couch and leave him (and me) wanting more?

Some background on me, I've been single for about a year after a string of long-term relationships, took the time to enjoy being single and have been dating really superficially for a while. He is the first person to come along that I really am excited about, getting butterflies when I think about him and shit like that :] I haven't felt this way since I met my last ex 3 years ago... I don't think I can just give up on it so easily :(. Also, just for info, he's 26 working in a real office and I'm 22 still a boring student with part time jobs. As for him, he does seem like a really nice guy, really funny, and although it's a secret from his work, I know they'd warn me if they saw us becoming friends and thought anything of it. All the stories I've heard about him from them before always just reinforce the fact that he's a good guy.

TL;DR: met a great guy from my hometown, trying to decide if I should vest myself into it (specifically when he visits me!) if I don't know what'll happen once he leaves. 

Pleease help, just typing this I can tell it's not the greatest idea, but I see so much potential and I haven't felt like this (so intense so soon!) in years! 

Also: I know a lot of you would kill to be able to see an SO that often, sorry in advance if I come off whiny. Its just all new and confusing so I want to hear from people who've been in this kind of situation before instead of asking people who'll invariably tell me I'm young/long distance never works/ I should forget about it.

vahoh,3,2012-06-19,Feeling like I'm helpless at a dead-end.,Glucksberg,MyLittleSupportGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyLittleSupportGroup/comments/vahoh/feeling_like_im_helpless_at_a_deadend/,"I missed my shift at work today. I apologized profusely and the manager there thanked me for doing so, but he also noted that the head manager had said that this was the second time this had happened (even though the first time was due to a misunderstanding when I requested time off literally *30 minutes* too late, even after I had asked the manager who does scheduling AND the head manager to take this into account).

My mom sympathized, but she said the reason I missed it was because it wasn't a high priority in my mind. Nope. Wrong answer. Of course work is a high priority in my mind; it's my main source of income, it's what I spend most of my summer doing, and I come into work on time every day and do my job well. It's just that I genuinely thought that my shift was tomorrow, even after I had written it down. You could say that if it was a higher priority I would have checked my schedule, but I was busy helping my sister study for her exam today; she also graduates today, so my mind was focused on *that* being on Tuesday, and for some reason that made me think that work was Wednesday.

***I hate my job.*** I'm tired of minimum wage. I'm tired of not working at what I love. I hate not being able to apply what I learn at college to my job, which I could do if I got an internship. I'm tired of irregular shifts. Why does school train you to wake up on a regular basis and follow a schedule that *doesn't apply to entry-level jobs*? I can't find work elsewhere. I commute to college, so finding a part-time job that pays well, or even an internship, is hard. I'm still undeclared, which I'm changing this year to economics, but I have *no idea what jobs are in my field*.

I don't want to get fired from my first job, but I want to get out of it ASAP. The problem is that the job market sucks. I'm feeling a little helpless and uncertain right now."

I have done Undergrad Research in the field of Acoustics/HVAC noise control, am currently doing an internship in the field of vibrations/noise control, and will be doing more undergraduate research in the fall on concrete composite columns with a well-known professor in that field.

I am planning on applying to Grad Schools for either seismic loading on structures, structural materials, or building acoustics and noise control (haven't completely decided yet) this fall and was wondering what I can do to make myself more appealing to the places I apply? My main concern is my GPA. 2.55 cumulative and ~2.95 in major.. Other than that I am very active outside of my academics (Brother in a Fraternity, Vice-President/Co-founder of a club, and Dean's Team member which is basically a group of students who give tours and info sessions to potential students.)"

Problem is, I'm basically the only person working on the website. The previous web master made the website extremely awkward and I'm supposed to fix it all and make it all look better. I have little to no experience with web development beyond basic CSS and HTML and have no idea what I'm doing here. The website uses WordPress and certain things that I would think would be very easy to change are actually not.

So what I'm asking is how should I go about learning how to ""fix"" a website using WordPress. Are there any good tutorials for learning how WordPress works or should I just mess around with stuff until something works? Currently I'm stuck trying to figure out how to edit specific pages. Editing a page's widgets or links seems to take me to editing all the widgets or links the site is using.

It sounds pathetic, I know, I feel terrible about myself, and this was about four months ago as well.  She wanted to stay friends with me, something I'm usually adamant about not doing, but since we're constantly in contact (Same groups and clubs in college, etc.) I figured it'd be alright.

She would constantly say things that pissed me off, so I would stop talking to her...this happened a few times as we tried to patch things up only to fight again...  I started dating another girl and she would text me saying how much she missed me and how hurt the breakup was for her now that I was ignoring me. and how jealous she is that I was with another girl, and I flew off the handle.  She didn't speak to me for a week, but then she saw me one day and told me ""I should be mad at you, but I just can't.  Even though it doesn't seem like it, I'm always here for you""

Mind you, this girl was semi-abusive when we were dating.  She would criticize everything I did, talk about her other ""crushes"", never did anything but complain to me about her life, and say how much she missed her ex as a friend...etc.  Now there were good times, and I really do miss them, and I do still love her.
About three weeks ago, she yelled at me for being upset about maybe losing my internship that I spent two years preparing for (moving away for 3 months...etc...big deal for me) and word for word said ""Stop being sad"".  I've dealt with depression all my life, and still am dealing with the heartbreak she dealt me, so I simply said ""Fuck off"" and haven't talked to her in two weeks.  

I want to fix things with her, but I can't lose my dignity by crawling back to her.  This weekend a mutual friend of ours is having a party, and we're both going I found out from my friend.  I don't want to miss a party because of her, but I don't want to make a scene.  Should I contact her prior to the party and try to fix things..or at least ask if we can be civil? (There will be alcohol involved...so that's probably not going to happen if we're both angry)

So, reddit, what are your opinions?


**TL;DR:** Ex-girlfriend and I are both attending a party, should I contact her prior to make sure things are ok between us or just hope for the best?

After sending a few follow up emails and not hearing anything back, I ended up accepting another position at a company (company B) my uncle works for. 

But now, I just received an email from the company A apologizing for the delay and asking me if I am still interested in interning.  At this point I am unsure of what my options are.  I've been working at company B for two weeks and even though it very relaxed atmosphere (my uncle is my boss), it is not as demanding as I hoped it would be.. meaning that I don't do much real work and spend most of my time on reddit (like right now).  Is it a bad idea to leave an internship in the middle of the summer? If so, what can I say to company B to possibly hire me in the future (like maybe for a co-op position)?

i'm a fourth year arch. studies student. as a requirement for graduation, i must fulfill so many internship hours.

i got myself an (unpaid) internship for the summer, and i've been here since about the start of may; 2 days a week.

right off the bat, the dude took on way too many people. several students from my university and another student from a neighboring school.

several days of the week there are at least 2 interns here. without interns it is a two-man firm.

i am here for about 8 hours a day, and i have yet to do more than 2-3 hours of real work during a work day. most of those 2-3 hours are spent looking up furniture or personal errands.

i ask consistently for something to do, and i'm told to wait. i wait and nothing happens. i acknowledge this and nothing happens. 

the student from the neighboring school was once a pupil of the principle (who still teaches at that uni.).  this results in any work getting tossed to that other student despite him not knowing the programs (that i know) necessary for projects.

i'm not making any money. i'm not learning anything. i have classes that i could be doing work for. this guy barely remembers my name.

what should i do?

i'm waiting on a response from my adviser after sending her an email describing what i've written above.

i need hours so i'm probably going to send some emails to other firms in the area.

**tl;dr** what should an internship be? am i wasting my time?

thanks"

I currently have a System Administrator job at a small eCommerce company with a Salary of 50k a year. I worked my way up from an intern to helpdesk to system admin over the past four years. However, I got a call this morning offering me a job as an Active Directory Admin offering 90k a year + benefits.

**So here are the pros/cons for my current job:**

**PROS**

-Good salary 50k + benefits

-Been here 4 years so I know the network very well

-Very lenient with hours/college.

-Learning all technologies, not just one IT area.

-Know most of the management and they know me.

-Only 10 miles from my house

-Stable in my position, I don't see me being fired or let go soon, however, the CEO made a comment the other day ""Here are the IT guys, we decided not to outsource this department yet.""

**CONS**

-I do everything, network, DNS, DHCP, routing, switching, fiber, SAN. So when something breaks they always bypass everyone and call me, I have become the ""IT guy.""

-Terrible health insurance, almost $300 every two weeks for just me.

-Company is not improving in profit, been about 8 million a year profit for the past 5 or 6 years.






**The Pros and cons for the offered job:**

**PROS**

-Better Salary 90k + benefits

-Fortune 1000 company so much more profitable.

-Better Health Insurance and other benefits (life insurance, cell phone discount)

-Will only be doing Active Directory only, so I only focus on one item.

**CONS**

-Farther away from my house. (about 35 miles)

-I only know one person (guy whom offered it to me)

-Iffy if they will be lenient on my school or not.

-Will it be stable? 

-Still learning powershell and in their job position they state that is a plus. I guess being thrown in head first is a great way to learn it.

-Will only be doing Active Directory, so learning opportunity as a whole is decreased.

Any opinions on the matter, I love learning all the stuff at my job currently. However, I could use the extra money, and I get to learn in-depth active directory (a new car as my current one is about 15 years old).

**EDIT:** I will have a daughter to look after too in about a month. So im trying to decide what is best for me/her. "

Only full time positions are available, no internships, part time, or summer work programs. Thanks!

**What we do**

We develop 911 emergency and public safety software. Our software revolutionizes the way emergency first responders receive calls, react, and deliver critical emergency services to the public. We believe that by applying innovation to the public safety sector, we can make a difference in people’s lives. Our products include next generation VoIP 911 communication (voice, sms text, and video), computer-aided dispatch, GPS enabled mobile units for fire/police/EMS, maps and live data delivery, police and fire post incident management/investigations, and data mining/reporting.

**How we do it**

We believe in agile software development. Our well defined and efficient processes are backed by the best tooling we can find. Some of the tools we use include JIRA, GreenHopper, FishEye, Confluence, SpiraTest, Balsamiq, Subversion, and Jenkins. We believe in continuous integration, unit testing, and automated testing. We like clean code.

Developer happiness is important to us. Work areas are quiet, spacious, window-facing, and all developers get fast boxes with dual 24” monitors. We have our own development lab to run load tests or bask in the warm hum of the server racks. Our systems engineers ensure that production issue distractions are kept to a minimum. Our QA group keeps us in check and even helps with the automated testing.

**What we’re looking for**

We’re looking for people passionate about software development. If you have side projects, contribute to open source, or enjoy reading about and discussing technology, then you sound like a great fit. We believe a strong foundation of data structures, algorithms, and design patterns is important. Our product line covers many diverse development areas such as distributed soa, web, backend, mobile, maps/gis, databases, caching, reporting, data indexing, and high availability. Each of these areas in a mission critical environment contains their own unique and difficult problems to solve. As such, a strong foundation coupled with the desire to learn, grow, and solve hard problems would make for a strong addition to our team.

**Junior Developer**

You have the passion and are ready for a challenge but are still getting started with less than a few years experience. You have exposure to some of the technologies listed, and are very eager to learn more while becoming stronger in the areas you already know. 

**Mid-Level Developer**

You are a seasoned developer with 2 to 5 years experience that can solve tough problems. You’re strong in at least one area of the software stack and are eager to expand into others. You are familiar with best practices and know how to write clean code.

**Senior Developer**

You are a very strong developer with over 5 years of experience. You are adept at breaking down and solving very complex and difficult problems. You’ve been exposed to most areas in the software stack and very strong in a few of them. You’re able to learn and integrate new technologies independently. You enjoy mentoring and guiding the more junior engineers.

**Technologies and Frameworks**

All of our developers have the freedom to pick the best tools to solve the problem at hand. Some specific technologies we like to use include Java 6 (soon to be 7), Spring, JPA/Hibernate, EHCache, PostgreSQL, H2, Web Services (SOAP and REST), Asynchronous messaging, Apache Lucene, Java Server Faces 2, Primefaces, HTML 5, CSS 3, WebSockets, JQuery, Android, Swing, TestNG, Selenium, Maven, JasperReports, Jython, Bash, Geoserver, OpenLayers.

[I own a company that sells a product to the adult entertainment industry and also to various ""specialty"" shops. It makes a certain part of a woman's anatomy taste different flavors. We have recently found out that an unfortunate side affect is that it makes that certain part of the anatomy turn a different color, permanently. Like the Blue Raspberry flavor turns it blue, forever. I may have accidentally dyed the important parts of several hundred female porn stars different colors.  How can I salvage my brand name and keep my customers? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v93vj/iama_public_relations_consultant_companies_hire/c52fqsv?context=5)|Stop making the product immediately. Your brand name is ruined, but you aren't. Change the company name. In a year, nobody will remember.
[I can't help but point out that several hundred female porn stars will remember...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v93vj/iama_public_relations_consultant_companies_hire/c52giul?context=5)|That's fine. The more degrees of separation you can put between yourself and the crisis (for example, your company name and the ""bad"" company), the more work people will have to do. People are lazy. You want to make your story easier to accept.
[I am a staunch libertarian who loves the U.S. and loves his job serving in the U.S. Armed Forces and I frequently spend large portions of my time within an internet community that is comprised largely of liberals and those who dislike me for who I am, what I believe in, and activities that I enjoy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v93vj/iama_public_relations_consultant_companies_hire/c52eqqy?context=5)|Agreeable with the fact that people dislike you? That's tough, but what I'd say is this. Dissent is a reflection of a functioning democracy, and you have more in common with your opponents that you might expect. At the end of the day you have a common goal -- the greater good of the United States. This ""dislike"" arises through differing strategies, but it's important. It means we have options. So perhaps they don't like you, but the very fact that they're responding to you means they are aware of your position. This might not seem important, but I'd argue that this exchanging of ideas is far more important than the fact that you like eachother. Please don't stop what you're doing. It's important. Their personal feelings towards you aren't.

Companies and politicians are well aware of what they're doing, and the general public are often as gullible as they're portrayed there. For what it's worth though, I work for an independent firm, which means I could be working in totally different industries within the span of a couple months.

It's easier to take advantage of that fact that people will try to project what they want to see on it. Using a catch all like ""I'm sorry for my actions"" is better because the audience decides what those actions are. (And also, you want to avoid reminding people what exactly you did to upset them so much in the first place)

I work with incredibly talented people. I have no idea what most of them majored in at college. What I do know is that they are insanely good at what they do.
 |So, in short, the hardest part for you right now is getting your foot in the door. Get relevant experience any way you can (I'd recommend volunteering for a campaign because it's election season). After that, nobody will care about what you did in school; they'll care about whether or not you're good at what you do. Be good at what you do and you will be fine.

Have you always had a talent for getting your way?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v93vj/iama_public_relations_consultant_companies_hire/c52ei54?context=5)|I started out on political campaigns, where I got to work with lobbyists. Through them, I got a job working for a lobby out of college, and ended up excelling with PR work. I was hired at my first firm through a connection I had made while working in Washington DC.
 |In terms of having a ""talent for getting my way,"" I'm not sure. What I *do* have a talent for is very quickly understanding what someone wants and creating scenarios that are mutually beneficial to us.

How about spinning the situation for greece?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v93vj/iama_public_relations_consultant_companies_hire/c52eeoy?context=5)|Greece is easy. Goldman Sachs is heavily unpopular right now. Your entire damage control plan focuses on Greece being exploited by evil Goldman Sachs. GS was supposed to be Greece's financial advisors, and instead created a total financial meltdown for their own gain. They cared so much about their quarterly profits that they were willing to risk the financial stability of an entire continent. It's important that you emphasize Greece's ignorance here -- they are victims, not colluders.

The worst? etc ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v93vj/iama_public_relations_consultant_companies_hire/c52e3hk?context=5)|I should have thought about this, because naming these projects will most definitely ""out"" me. I can tell you that most of the time I work for major corporations, although during election season most of my time is spent working for political campaigns. The best projects are the ones where you're right -- there are many times where companies are unjustly vilified for a particular decision. The worst times are when you're wrong -- when you have to manipulate the public to agree to and believe in something that they really shouldn't.
 |The scariest part is how easy it is to manipulate public perception. Deep down we secretly want to trust. This is shamelessly exploited everyday.

Don't be afraid to use them -- after all, they're using you too.
 |I got started this way and ended up lobbying for a few years. Now I work exclusively in PR.

They're really awful events, but are suprisingly easy to deal with for two reasons: 
 |They last a long time but they don't change much. After a while the news reports die down, because, well, there isn't much more to report. (It's still leaking, John, back to you.) The general public forgets things very quickly.
 |We depend so strongly on oil that we don't have a choice. Society depends on it. It's almost impossible to boycott an oil company.
 |A really well handled fiasco was the [Nigeria](http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/dec/22/nigerian-shell-oil-spill) oil spill. 40,000 barrels of oil spread over 300 square miles (bigger than the Deepwater Horizon spill). And most people didn't hear a thing about it.
[Is that because it was well handled, or because it was in Nigeria?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v93vj/iama_public_relations_consultant_companies_hire/c52g3g4?context=5)|Being in Nigeria absolutely helped, but you have to understand that, the better we are at what we do, the harder it is to tell we're doing anything.
[So do you have tips on getting journalists **not** to report a story?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v93vj/iama_public_relations_consultant_companies_hire/c52q9h9?context=5)|It's easier to work *very closely* with a journalist to get the story the way you want it. You control a huge part of the information they need -- you can use this to your advantage. Unless they have a large body of damning external evidence, in which case, there's no way you'd convince them not to publish anyway.

Any suggestions on quickly ingratiating yourself or building trust?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v93vj/iama_public_relations_consultant_companies_hire/c52qhlr?context=5)|Just realize that they are people who are under high stress to meet deadlines. They need you just as much as you need them. Joseph McCarthy would always hold his press conferences right before the newspaper deadlines because he knew that the reporters wouldn't have enough time to check his facts. The reporters would play right into his hands.

[Same sex marriage is awful and has a variety of horrible consequences. What are they?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v93vj/iama_public_relations_consultant_companies_hire/c52ghkp?context=5)|&gt;The fact remains that there are other options than marriage. In fact, it's upsetting that the focus of this debate is on marriage at all. It shouldn't be about religion. It should be about people. The people who can't see their loved ones in the hospital. The people who can't share a medical plan or adopt a child. The lack of rights same sex couples see under civil unions is sickening. How can the United States -- the world's supposed leader in human rights -- allow this to happen? 
 |&gt;But instead of focusing on the rights these couples see in their civil unions, we're focusing on a religious institution. We can't change religion -- it's literally forbidden in the constitution. But we can change civil unions. We can give these rights and we can raise the quality of life for countless Americans. So what are we waiting for?

 |&gt;I deeply regret my actions during that dark period of my life. Not a day goes by where I don't wish I could go back and do things differently. Not for me. But for (wife). For (constituency). For the people I swore to represent. I am a regretful man, but I am also a resilient one. I have learned from my mistakes. I know now more than ever what it means to be a public leader and I will not stop until I get a chance to serve the great people of (constituency) again.
[*I will generalize to a tech startup that just had a major data breach. If it's not publicly verifiable -- you should deny it completely.*  Do you by chance work for Blizzard? They seemed to have followed your advice perfectly during the recent Diablo 3 release and subsequent account breaches.  I realize it's entirely possible tons of people were hacked through a keylogger (which to my knowledge my own virus scanner and everyone else's was unable to find on their computers\) but what gets me is that Blizzard came out and said nope, didn't happen, no security issues on our side. All while websites like Forbes were reporting a major security breach.  How likely do you think it is that Blizzards public relations told them to deny everything if it was a breach on their side?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/v93vj/iama_public_relations_consultant_companies_hire/c52ipll?context=5)|Nope, never worked for Blizzard, but standard industry practice is to deny. It's much easier to wait for people to forget about an event like this than to leak information that could be used against you. If the event is over, then you only prolong the attention to it by talking about it.

Not morally (well, morally too), but logistically. There's a legal risk of defamation, slander/libel, etc, if you're found to be involved. You have to risk going through a third party and by that point, you're better off just running a run-of-the-mill negative TV ad.

I feel crappy telling students this, but it's something you should know: this is not an ethical industry. At the fundamental level you are manipulating people. You are modifying their beliefs about the world around them in ways that are beneficial to you.
 |Yes this is not inherently evil, and yes there are plenty of ""good guys,"" but generally, the code of ethics doesn't stop anybody.

[I realize I'm a bit late to the party here, but I hope you're still answering questions.  You seem to suggest the ""deny it completely"" approach a lot.

You make your first statement (denying, in this case) and wait. If facts become public that make it absolutely clear that the event occurred, then you spin it by showing how your decision was reasonable given the facts you believed at the time.

I do damage *control.* I make things seem insignificant, understandable, and correct, but I can't make things go away entirely (well, even this isn't *totally* true). This is something we often have to make clear to our clients, who pay for our services regardless of their perceived outcome. If they are really unhappy then they'll fire me, but this has only happened a few times throughout my career.

 |Trained dogs. Learned a lot about confidence and shaping behavior.

Even worse, everyone can clearly see that this is going on and it is reported openly in the news.

If you can demonstrate that a given platform (any platform) will significantly improve their chances of winning, they will adopt it. Marijuana is tough though, because right now the general consensus among politicians is that coming out for it is too risky in that the votes they get might not be significantly greater than the votes they'll lose.

All living things eventually must die. But that's the reason why we value youth and beauty as much as we do. There are a lot of terrible things about cancer -- I won't argue with that. But, in a weird way, cancer also gives you something very few people get otherwise: the chance to frame beauty for your loved ones. For the rest of their lives, there will be a part of you whenever they experience something they love. There's something quietly beautiful in that.

v9s7s,1,2012-06-19,Affiliate Marketing Tips,chuckgs,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/v9s7s/affiliate_marketing_tips/,"Marketers with successful affiliate marketing programs know that the affiliate channel is a cost-effective way to drive incremental revenue. But as with any marketing strategy, if you don’t consistently apply best practices to your tactical efforts, you’re likely to have disappointing results. Here are ten things you should focus on to improve the performance of your affiliate marketing program:

1.	Optimized Data Feed: The easiest way to get increased distribution is to have the most robust, complete, up to date product catalog possible. This makes your products immediately available to publishers and across comparison shopping engines. It’s also the thing we hear most often from publishers as being the most critical piece to working successfully with advertisers.

2.	Effective Creative: Publishers, also known as affiliates, spend time and money promoting your products or services, so you need to make sure you provide effective creative to help them sell your products. Effective creative has consistent brand messaging and a consistent look and feel every place the consumer interacts with it in the buyor- try conversion funnel, from the banner on a publisher’s site to your landing page to your shopping cart or lead form. Effective creative also has a clear and highly visible call to action and a compelling offer (see #3 below).

3.	Competitive Offers: Are your offers in line with your vertical or industry? Take a look at what your competitors are offering for similar products or services and evaluate whether or not your margins allow you to provide a comparable or better offer. The trend of offering free expedited shipping proved successful for online retailers during the 2009 holiday shopping season and is continuing to be popular with consumers in 2010.

4.	Deep Linking: It’s well known that that deep linking (linking directly from your offer on a publisher’s site to the landing page where the product or service can be ordered) converts better than linking to your home page. The fewer pages a consumer has to click to before reaching the item, the more likely that shopper will complete the purchase. An easy way for online retailers to provide publishers with their complete and up-to-date product catalogs is through the use of data feeds, which a comprehensive affi liate marketing solutions provider can set you up with (see #1 above).

5.	Optimized Landing Pages: Your publishers can drive quality traffic for you all day every day, but if your landing pages aren’t optimized, then your conversion rate will suffer. Make sure that there’s visual consistency between your ads and landing pages, that your copy resonates with your target audience and that you follow through on the promise of your ad by making it clear what shoppers need to do next to get the special offer.

6.	Pay-Per-Click (PPC)/Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Search publishers in the affiliate channel can complement your existing investment in PPC by filling in the gaps in your current search strategy whether that is managed through in-house program or through a search agency. These specialized publishers are able to elevate your ranking on the search engine results page where you may be outranked by your competition. In addition, if you’re not using paid and/or natural search campaigns to test the effectiveness of your ad copy, you’re essentially just guessing at what works.

7.	Simple Checkout Process: Streamline your checkout process to reduce the steps required to purchase a product. To prevent shopping cart abandonment, list shipping charges early in the checkout process and include thumbnail images of items next to their descriptions to provide a visual reminder for customers returning to their carts from previous visits.

8.	Incentives: Top-performing publishers drive the majority of your revenue and expect to be compensated accordingly. So don’t let them down by offering the standard commission you give to all your publishers. By offering special incentives that you tie to a specific product or to a volume or time-based goal, you’re letting your best publishers know that you’ll reward them for achieving the results you need.

9.	Communication: Lack of communication with your publishers is the cause of many failed relationships. Make it a priority to communicate frequently and clearly with your publishers using the methods they prefer. Many publishers rely on email or instant messaging, but there may be times when they’d appreciate it if you picked up the phone or visited in person — this especially applies to your top revenue-producing publishers.

10.	Quality Online Presence: When was the last time you looked critically at your Web site? If it takes forever to load, has confusing navigation or amateurish graphic design, then consumers are likely to perceive your products and services negatively. Invest in a graphic designer or user interaction designer (or a talented intern) who is skilled at presenting information from a consumer’s point of view rather than from a corporate perspective.

I'm currently in an internship but actively seeking a full-time job and a contact just recommended me for a job at her company.  It's in my dream location and sounds like a pretty awesome job so I really want to nail this form that HR sent me.  

My first question regards salary.  I'm familiar with a range that I typically put down, but after researching this particular role at this particular company, it *appears* as though the starting salary averages at $60K.  This is nearly twice what I normally expect a job in my field to pay, but my contact assured me that this is an entry level job and was the job she started with herself, though I'm not close with her and didn't ask her what her starting salary was.  So what do you think, would you put down $60K and try to fit the bill at the risk of going overboard, or put the regular $35K and risk selling yourself short?

Next just deals with skills.  On this form I was sent, it asks to list ""additional"" skills I'd like them to consider.  My inclination is to list skills that aren't on my resume, because this is really the only part of this form that seems to reference education, skills, etc. at all, so I believe they're looking for that sort of info on my resume itself.  Do you think I should just go ahead and re-reference my Adobe Suite, web design, etc. type skills, or go with the less quantifiable skills that you may not directly list, such as leadership/communication skills, languages, etc?  

Also, I won't be able to respond or look over these responses for at least a day, so many thanks in advance.  I appreciate all input.  "

v9eq5,0,2012-06-19,Advice for an Industrial Engineer Intern,rbodnicki,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/v9eq5/advice_for_an_industrial_engineer_intern/,"Hey there,

  As of right now, I'm working at a ""start-up"" manufacturing plant as a full time manufacturing engineer intern. I've got about 7 more weeks left with the company and I would like to make the best of my time. **What are some things I can do to better utilize this great opportunity?**



Some background...

  I'm currently going into my junior year of college as an industrial engineering student with prospects of getting a minor in math.

  By a start-up, I mean that this branch of the company has only been in the country for just under two years. They have been going through many ""growing pains,"" and are constantly encountering problems from all sides. There appears to be a lot of money backing this endeavor, but the stressful environment and people can make things a little too sobering for me.  While I handle stress well, the unhappiness of others weighs heavy. The tensions may be high in the company, but the start-up factor also provides many opportunities not seen by many interns. I feel like I'm treated more as an employee than an intern, and I'm surrounded by many senior/director-level associates.

  However, I'm not sure if manufacturing is the place for me, and as an industrial engineering, I feel like there are many other paths I could be taking. I'm stuck not knowing quite which ones I should explore. With this summer internship under my belt as only a junior, I feel like searching for an internship as a senior will yield many more options. **What other industrial engineering paths should I explore with the inquisitive forgiveness granted by an internship?**

  What should I expect later down the career path as an industrial engineer. I foresee myself as a manager of some type given my greater than average people skills (relative to my engineering peers), but what else is beyond that? 

  Thoughts? Overall, I'm just trying to make the best of my situation, and to pull from this community's vast experience.
Thanks!"

I'm a recent graduate with a BS in engineering physics who was recently hired by a company that does start-to-finish manufacturing of auxiliary axle systems - from design to component manufacturing to building and shipping of the finished product!

I was brought on as an entry-level design engineer and will primarily be working with SolidWorks, although they mentioned during the interview that there would be some work here and there on the manufacturing floor, given the ""start-to-finish"" approach I just mentioned.

we've been going out since april and used to be really close. as the relationship lasted we both felt very far from each other.

She went to a camp the week of june 6th and met a lot of new people, when she came back I saw extended wallposts from a person she had met at camp. these wall posts would be paragraphs and it made me kind of edgy. i haven't confronted her about it at all. we haven't seen each other much ever since school ended, we saw each other only twice (tonight and last week; the same day today last week actually..heh) 

when i talked to her tonight i asked if there was another guy and she said no and was very open with me about why she wanted to take a break. she felt like she hasn't been putting in enough effort in the relationship and even told me she felt the same way i did about drifting away. 

could you friendly redditors calm me down and explain the concept of taking a break to me and how i can make it better once we get together? (unless it happens to be a permanent break....)

I want to work in publishing- doing production design or editing perhaps, and also illustrate whenever I can. I understand the illustrators are not really working in-house but I think working in publishing would be a good way to tie in my interest for illustration and literature. Anyways, I need more experience in both fields so I want to go back to school in some capacity.

My options are:
1) Take some illustration courses part-time for the year- no certificate or degree earned. Then, pursue a Publishing Certificate (4 months + 12 week internship option)
2) Apply for a MFA at OCAD U (Interdisciplinary Masters in Art, Media, and Design) and declare specialization in Illustration with the option to explore children's literature, as it is an interdisciplinary program
Note: option 2 is extremely competitive and it's expensive as hell.

If you have a MFA, was it worth it?
If you want a MFA, why?
If you work in or know about either field- publishing or illustration- that I have mentioned, what do you think the best route to take is?

I don't like it when my bosses make jokes about farming out the bitch work on the interns.  They're here to learn, and I want to teach them.  

Here are some of my ideas I had so far, and I will ask you to please contribute more.  My ideas are very general, so if anyone has any SPECIFIC things I can do to make their experience better, please let me know.

* Be relaxed and easy going.  To be honest, I probably need their help more than they need the college credit, so I want to do everything in my power to keep them here.  Being nice is probably first on that list.  But even if I didn't need their help, there's just a right way to treat people.  I will never be one of those dicks who screams at interns to satisfy my own insecurities and lust for power.

* Give them real work to do.  This is tricky, because I have a very high-pressure job.  I don't want to give them something that they can't handle, nor do I want them to screw up something that can't be fixed.  But I'll try to give them interesting work and do the boring shit myself.  That being said, there's a lot of tedious work like entering a lot of data that's important and necessary.  I do most of it, and I don't mind, but they might have to do some of it, too.  I know I always appreciated when my bosses shared in the tedious work with me.

* Answer any and all of their questions, even if it interferes with productivity a little bit.

* Be as welcoming as possible.  I even set aside some money in the budget to buy them lunch a couple times a week.  I can't pay them, but I can at least do that.

* Include them in strategy and high level discussions, and welcome their input.  This was one of the best ways I learned, so I think I owe them the same privilege.

I also don't want to be a pushover, but I'd rather be a pushover than a douche.  "

I was doing a bit of research on it, and it sounds like you just enter data, and the program (or the company selling the system) does all the work.  I know every job is different, but - based off your experiences - what sort of work would I be doing?  Coding?  Running analyses?

So a little backstory...I'm currently on track to participate in a program centered in Washington D.C.  I currently live at home, with my parents in New Jersey, and I've never had a dorm.  This fall I will spend 15 weeks working at an internship based on my field of interest and taking a night class as well as participating in various events around D.C.

Right now I'm working as a technician on campus, and only making around $150 a week, I'm also waiting to hear back from a couple of restaurants on a serving position, but I'm not extremely hopeful.  I pay for gas, a monthly gym membership, and alot of time I pay for my own food, so I am spending a bit this summer, but I'm really cutting down as much as I possibly can.

In D.C. I will be completely on my own, though I'll live in an apartment provided by the program, food, transportation, clothing, etc. are all expenses that I have to pay, and my advisor said bring at least $3000, try for more.

I'm already up to my neck in student loans, and I really cannot afford to take any more out.  Is there any odd way, job offering, etc. ( I'm open to the most odd suggestions) I can make a bit of money before the end of August (the 29th to be exact)?

I am a french citizen who left the country to study at the university in the US. There, I started dating a girl, whom I've been dating for the last two years. She is now currently studying abroad in Paris for 6 months, partly for me, partly because she is interested in French culture. Here is where it gets complicated: Obviously, I want to see her in Paris, however my parents are only willing to let me go to Paris if I somehow get an internship there, or at least do something meaningful. However, since I have another internship lined up in another country till September 6th, and I have to go back to the US by september 27th, there are little opportunities for such short internships. Of course, I would like to do an internship in paris for other reasons, such as working in french industry (hopefully finance) so that I can get experience to work there in the future.
Do you guys have any advice on how to proceed? I appreciate your help, since I really want to see her, and so does she."

However, I have some issues I have to sort out before I get too far. First of all, I have to find a place to stay. When I was abroad, the Studentenwohnheim was arranged by the program I was attending. However, because I'm organizing this myself, I would have to set up my own living situation. Does anyone know how much a single-person room in Vienna costs per month (preferably in the 9th district)? How does one go about applying for living quarters? Would I even be able to apply for a Studentenwohnheim, seeing as how I'm not currently a student in Austria? If not, are there places where people like me can sign a lease for a four to six month stay? How much more would those cost?

Secondly, I plan to stay for four to five months. How would I go about getting a visa approved for that length of time? I know that I have 90 days within the Schengen zone to stay with just a visitor's stamp, but will I have to apply for a special visa to stay longer?

Will I be able to access the University of Vienna libraries as someone who is not currently attending the University?

Other than rent in the Wohnheim, a prepaid phone plan, food, and a public transportation pass, what other costs are there that I'm probably forgetting? Besides the regular visits to the Naschmarkt, that is? ;) And speaking of food, I have some food sensitivities that prevent me from eating as cheaply as some might (gluten, peanuts, and soy being the biggest offenders; no cheap noodles for me!). If I'm mostly subsisting on meat, vegetables, eggs, butter, the occasional fruits, etc., do you have any suggestions on where to shop, and how much to expect to pay? 

And on the entertainment front, will I be able to stream my American Netflix/iTunes content, or should I load up on books to read while I'm there? Will Skype function reasonably well with Wohnheim internet? 

I'm sure that there are a lot of other questions that need to be asked before I create my proposal, but I feel like I need to get these questions out of the way first. I would appreciate any/all help you can give me!"

v94me,1,2012-06-18,FUCK DR. ASSHOLE,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/v94me/fuck_dr_asshole/,"Fuck Dr. Asshole. He was a first-time teacher I had in my senior year of high school for an AP class that completely fucked me over. Thanks to his incompetence and inability to teach effectively, I failed his class and was consequently rejected from all but one of my colleges I applied to as a senior. 

I knew before I even graduated high school that I would have to transfer, so I went to that one college that accepted me (piece of shit, low retention rate, degree mill school) and left for a better school that was unfortunately much, much more expensive. Why was it so expensive? Because I was a transfer. Because I joined in as a sophomore, I was so graciously given the scraps of the scraps of financial aid. Now I will be in over $130,000 in student loans by the time I graduate. 

What did Dr. Asshole do?

* i went to a private school so they made us buy our textbooks. Dr. asshole assigned us *the wrong textbook* at the beginning of the school year but didn't tell us until the end. meanwhile, we're being tested by material and questions from HIS textbook while we're studying ours. COMPLETELY USELESS INFORMATION. And he had the nerve to tell us, ""I never told you to buy that textbook."" FUCK YOU, IT CLEARLY STATED SO ON THE SCHOOL WEBSITE. 

* CONSTANTLY CONSTANTLY CONSTANTLY blab about his time in the military instead of relevant shit for the class. FUCK YOU. 

* assigned useless homework assignments that had no FUCKING relevance to the chapters/lessons

* created the curriculum as we ""went along"". mind you this is an AP class that was highly notorious for failing to provide their students with the necessary tools for success on the exam in the past, so he never had any real references to work from since every teacher in the past was some SHIT

* speaking of shitty teachers, Dr. Asshole teamed up with Ms. Idiot to teach the class together. Ms. Idiot was the teacher who taught this AP class last year (with little success I might add). Yes, even two teachers couldn't help our doomed souls. Oh and by the way, Dr. Asshole has a PhD in the same field as our AP class and Ms. Idiot has a law degree from an Ivy League. 



thanks to this horrible class, i've had to go to months therapy on multiple occasions. it was painful seeing my peers go on and enjoy their first and second choice schools while i had to suffered through mine at Remedial University. Now I'm in student debt from new school, ALL WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF DR. ASSHOLE KNEW HOW TO TEACH. By the way, let's not forget that this AP class was the EXACT field I wanted to go into when I applied for colleges. How do you think colleges feel when their applicant is FAILING a class that he wants to major in?

BTW: My high school was, like I mentioned, a private school. We paid for our textbooks and had a strict nun that prohibited dropping courses. Otherwise I would have PEACED THE FUCK OUT OF AP MISERY. Worst part? Dr. Asshole is our principal, and all of my peers (including our valedictorian and salutatorian) were FATASS PANSIES who refused to stick it to the man. This was his time teaching first high school.

And don't get me wrong; I did EVERYTHING in my power from asking for extra help, attending tutoring, getting help from other students, etc. to survive. Dr. Asshole was just TO FUCKING BLIND and had TOO BIG OF AN EGO to realize that he is just not as smart as he thinks. 


Pouring salt into my wounds: I want to go to graduate school in the very same field. I'm making outstanding grades, have a glowing résumé filled with lots of prestigious internships, and excelling in my undergraduate research. I want to join the Peace Corps too because my studies directly correlate with the ideals and mission of the PC. Problem is I have student debt from hell, which, again, COULD HAVE ALL BEEN AVOIDED IF HE FUCKING KNEW HOW TO TEACH. ONE FUCKING CLASS RUINED MY LIFE. The graduate school I'm looking at unfortunately requests high school transcripts. Guess who got boned in the ass when he found that out?


Why pick such an expensive school to transfer to? Hell if I know. Because I was transferring after one year of college, my high school transcript is still heavily weighted. Surprise surprise, I was rejected again from more schools but I had to get out of my first school. My school now was actually my top choice because it was famous for my program but at the price it's at, i find it harder and harder to realize what is it that I fell in love with at the first place. 

**tl;dr failed a class related to my would-be major during my senior year of high school because it was taught by an incompetent and egotistical monkey who taught hs for the first time. now i'm in student debt from hell because colleges don't like transfer students.** should have went to a community college.

v90uf,14,2012-06-18,"I think I've accidentally built my college life around weed, and it's hard to shake the habit. I want to change, but I really need help and guidance!",kasserolepoop,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/v90uf/i_think_ive_accidentally_built_my_college_life/,"Hey everyone. I'm really glad I found this page, because there isn't really anyone in my life who i feel can give me good insight on how to handle my issue with weed. don't feel comfortable talking to my parents; my mom will freak and my dad smokes weed. my sister is a total stoner, lives out in california and got herself a medical marijuana prescription. my friends/other family members are either voluntary stoners who don't get it, or they probably couldn't give me effective advice.

 i didn't smoke much weed in high school because i went to a therapeutic boarding school where it was strictly forbidden to smoke and i got drug tested. so i would only smoke on long breaks from school and drink lots of water after so the test would come out negative. i had no interest in smoking everyday at that time. since graduating, though, weed has become a much bigger part of my life. my sister was living at my dad's at the time when i graduated so as soon as i was home we were smoking up. plus dad became ok with my smoking and even joined in now that i was out of my therapeutic school and heading to college. so i got the idea that weed was ok, that it wasn't a big deal.

 then i got to college, 2 weeks after graduation from my year-round therapeutic school, a very little amount of transition time. the first person i became close with was a total stoner, and she got me into smoking everyday, which i really wasn't into originally. i go to an academically rigorous and prestigious school so going in i was like, ""oh, no one will smoke weed here, everyone's too serious about their studies. i'll be fine, i won't become a stoner."" but as many of you can understand, it sort of crept up on me. 

at my tiny, tiny boarding school of only 100 students grades 7-12, making friends was much less overwhelming, forming bonds easier since it was a therapeutic school and it was part of the culture that everyone there had ""issues,"" so no one needed to hide anything. upon coming to college i had a serious complex about being different from everyone else because i had been in that close-knit, therapeutic setting for so long (3 years), and being at this school with such a great reputation, a huge leap from my boarding school which had mediocre academics and is on its way to shutting down, definitely intimidated me for the first semester or so. i felt like i was not only different but had issues and no one else there did. weed made it easier to make friends without having to open up about my past, or feel ""different"" from everyone else...it made me feel like i was part of a group of cool kids or something. not to mention the combination of the way it was kept from me during high school as contraband, then presented to me in my family and among my new peers as a positive part of youth/college culture. 

so i started smoking every day as a social/recreational activity. but now it seems that a lot of the people i'm ""friends"" with at college are co-dependent weed abusing friendships, like weed seems like the basis of a lot of my new friendships. i know there are ways to find genuine, deep bonds and friendships with the people at my college, i just don't exactly know how or where to find them. at boarding school it was so easy and instant to know if someone worked for you as a friend, didn't work, or would end up working down the road. it's harder in college. and weed DOESN'T make it authentically any easier--i know it's just a social lubricant that makes me feel as though the bond over weed is a real bond of friendship and camaraderie. also, i started smoking weed everyday to help me sleep, since i've had a mild case of insomnia for a while and weed always helps me fall asleep. but i don't want to have to depend on weed to fall asleep, and i don't want to feel that grogginess i always feel in the morning from smoking. 

now i'm home (at my dad's house) for the summer, taking some time before i move in with my boyfriend up near school for the summer and get a job in July, for self-reflection and self-improvement. now without the distractions of school and social life (i have only two really good friends around where i live since i went to boarding school, but one of them is too into drugs for me to connect with very much anymore and the other has an internship), i have been isolated at my dad's Connecticut house without a car or bike while he goes to work in NYC every day. 

at first i was just getting stoned all day, making goals for myself and getting frustrated because i wasn't achieving the goals and wasn't motivated enough to get out of bed. now i am realizing just how much all of the weed smoking i've done in the past 9 or 10 months has negatively affected me. now that i'm always alone with myself i see my potential, and now i finally see how much weed is holding me back from fulfilling that potential. i have a great volunteer position at a rape crisis prevention center next year, i'm aiming for a 4.0 GPA, i want to learn a lot and be healthy, and really live a fulfilling life. i need to quit weed to have the energy and motivation to achieve these goals. and i know that the reason why i feel so empty is because i'm not doing the things for myself that i know will make me happy, instead i'm filling that void with weed. i don't want this life anymore. i want to reclaim my life as the life i always dream of having, i want to be happy and live the life i want to live instead of lying around watching tv feeling high and depressed about not having that life or the motivation to achieve that life. 

but it's so much harder than i thought it would be to stop. i'll go 3-4 days without smoking, be like ""yea this is great!"", get to a point where i can sleep a full night without restlessness and then i'll find a bit of weed left in my grinder or steal a pinch of my dad's stash. this has happened twice. i'm not sure exactly where to go from here, and was hoping i could get some advice or insight that could help me to quit being a stoner and move on to living a healthy life for myself."

This is where you come in. We are looking for someone who wouldn't mind sitting down and talking with us before the event. (Either sometime Friday or Saturday morning before it starts).

So, who are we looking for? Anyone really, as long as you are planning on attending the event on Saturday! Even if you haven't gone to an event like this before, we'd still like to speak with you. If you're a regular for stuff like this, that'd be cool too.

This is going to be an intern piece, which means you won't be on the radio (though it would likely end up online) but you'd be helping us out tremendously. We aren't going to psychoanalyze you or anything either, just hoping to gain some insight. Plus, I'll buy you some coffee!

I'm not sure how many people will be interested in this but we'll only be interviewing one or two people before the event at most due to time constraints. (We'll talk to more people at the event itself!) So, if you're interested post a comment or private message me and we can work out the details!....and thanks

edit: please upvote this even if you aren't interested, so interested parties can hopefully find out about the opportunity!

UPDATE (06/21): We have two people who sound open to the idea so that's all we need pre-meetup. We'll be willing to talk with many more of you at the event. Looking forward to it! (Look for our NPR badges)"

I'm a 21 year old photographer from California who just finished college (degree in Journalism) and has been studying and working in art photography and photojournalism for the past four years. I want to pursue a professional career in photography as a photojournalist but I've come to a dead end and not sure what to do next.

Here's some background. While in college, I was introduced to contemporary art and fell in love with photography. Mixing my interest with writing, I decided to pursue studies in photojournalism. I photographed for my college paper and became photo editor shortly after. I made it a goal to one day photograph for my daily local newspaper, considered one of the most successful papers in the state.
That dream came true when I managed to get a photo internship in my last semester of college. Before that, I had done an internship for a local magazine which introduced me to video, editing, graphic design, etc.

Things were really good in school, my work was published on the front page every other Monday, and I was happy to see my work going somewhere. (I even managed to make USA Today's top photos in February!) But in an almost typical college fashion, all things came to an end. After graduation, my internship ended and I wasn't offered a job or even a freelance opportunity. I applied for other internships as a start, but haven't been accepted to any. So far, it seems I will be unemployed for the remainder of the year.

My only plan so far is to take the time I have to continue shooting whatever news I can find and work on my personal projects. But I was curious if I could get some advice from those in similar situations on how you make that leap from a recent graduate who is doing nothing to someone who is contributing their work to the professional world. My ultimate goal would be to become an editor for a publication, but for now just a staffer at a newspaper or magazine.

**TL;DR: I am a college graduate who recently finished his photo internship and had nothing planned afterward. I would like to work as a professional photojournalist and seek advice to make the leap.**

Most places will not give me a chance, because I have no prior experience in the interior design field. My undergraduate degree was in graphic design, and I immediately started graduate school after graduation without professional work experience of any kind (minus campus jobs).

I had an interview last week that went really well! I was confident I had a chance of getting the job (paid), but was worried about my lack of experience. Today the firm responded and basically told me the same thing. They said I was perfect for the job, but that they had a difficult time committing to hiring me because of my lack of experience. In the end they wanted me, but with professional experience.

Because I need to work an outside job for school and living expenses, I am not quite in the position to take an unpaid internship that requires almost 40 hours a week (which is what I tend to see in postings for unpaid internships). Although it seems like the only option, I have no idea if I can juggle an unpaid internship, a paid job, and my classes (also entering my thesis year).

I really would like an internship before I graduate, but it seems nearly impossible. At the moment I am just really frustrated at the situation. I am not one to give up, but I think I just need outside advice!

Designers, how did you get your first design job or internship? Do you have any advice for someone struggling to get their first design internship? Also, what are some good resources for job searching (my school has a job board, but only posts residential jobs- which i'm not opposed to, but i am really interested in hospitality design)?"

After graduation, my internship ended and I wasn't offered a job or even a freelance opportunity. I applied for other internships as a start, but haven't been accepted to any. So far, it seems I will be unemployed for the remainder of the year.

My only plan so far is to take the time I have to continue shooting whatever news I can find and work on my personal projects. But I was curious if I could get some advice from those in similar situations on how you make that leap from a recent graduate who is doing nothing to someone who is contributing their work to the professional world.

**TL;DR: I am a college graduate who recently finished his photo internship and had nothing planned afterward. I would like to work as a professional photojournalist and seek advice to make the leap.**"

I'm a rising senior and will have time to work during the semester, and the unpaid has implied that if I continue in the semester, it'll be paid.

I'm currently out of the country, and was worried about my summer plans when I get back (next weekend) so I found an unpaid internship at a software startup (3 years old) on referral from a friend (who was paid for doing the same job I'm going to be doing). However, I received offers (as in this week) for 2 internships with companies with FAR MORE growth opportunity (both received huge VC investments recently, and one was just bought by a much larger company) through referrals that took forever to pan out. I accepted the unpaid because I wanted to make sure I had something, but the new ones are so much better?

I feel terrible because I'm friends with some of the people at this company, and they were helpful, and have included me in the company culture while I'm still out of the country. They invited me to the company retreat the first week I get back, despite it being before I officially start. I don't know. I'd rather have a paying job, especially because I'm commuting (it adds up, mass transit or car) and have rent to pay. I took the unpaid because no one else had gotten back to me in April.

Is there a subtle way to ask them to pay me minimum wage or something? I committed to full time? They added my bio to the website and everything, and keep informing me of new info.

I basically stumbled into this subreddit after random subreddit hopping. I've been trying to plan an escape for a while now, ever since ever really. 

I want to move to California from Toledo, Ohio. There are numerous reasons for this, but it basically comes down to LBGT rights and the people here. 

I used to do web design at professional companies here, pre-transition. Post-transition i'm finding it harder and harder to find jobs. I now freelance, since brick and mortor house jobs won't even consider me, citing ""lack of experience"", even though I've worked for clients such as Best Buy, Masco (KraftMaid brand specifically), and I have close to 200 full sites in my portfolio as a web designer for 8 years. &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;.

Recently as well, my freelance work has been challenged, and I find myself getting fewer and fewer contracts. I know the reasoning, the only  proof I have is the one client who told me to ""Not come into his office in drag, since the interns might find it offensive"". I didn't go back to that office, and have been in state of depression since.

My plan is to move to California, San Francisco specifically, and continue to freelance in a more accepting community. San Francisco is also alot better for me as well since I cannot drive currently due to medical reasons. San Fran has a very nice transit system, while Toledo not so much. Especially while trying to get to suburbs. Just as well, LBGT support there is very cool and more abundant/prominent than in this area. To sum it up: They have more Web/Tech opportunities, LBGT support that isn't hidden from public, and transit to help me get to A - B.

I'm asking for $250 for the cost of a Greyhound ticket and a bit of food to get to San Francisco, Cali. This is to be paid back, with interest at a rate to be agreed upon. The length of the loan is 2 Weeks, although I'd like to ask for a month in case my first week or two doesn't pan out entirely to plan. I don't really deal with paypal, however I'm hoping we can work out something that is easily available (GCheckout, Greendot, flat out buying the ticket), trackable and comes with a receipt.

Even if you cannot loan all or any of the requested amount, thats okay. Thanks for looking, and just be kind to someone today. 

TL;DR - Suffering transwoman seeks refuge in California. Needs $250 for food and ticket. Will pay back in 2 - 4 weeks tops."

I recently applied to a multi-national company based out of Delhi and even though I did not receive a ""job"" I have been offered an internship with the company.  As an American I am used to two different types of internships, paid and unpaid. I understand that some companies in India offer some kind of housing or living stipend, so is it usually the company or the intern that brings up the topic of the stipend?

Also, in the U.S. people usually do not bring up their family during interviews and selection process, how does this work in India?  I do have a wife and children so the idea of moving around the world and receiving no financial compensation is quite daunting. I do have a small (by American standards) monthly income of roughly 22K INR and from what I have found this is *not* enough for a family to live off of in Delhi.  We live very simply and are not a typical ""Western"" family i.e. we don't need a dishwasher, foods found only in the U.S., 3bed 2bath house etc.  

So.. basically I am wondering what the best way would be to bring up the fact that I *need* some kind of stipend without ruining my opportunity to move to the country I love and what would be an acceptable stipend offer (if the company does offer)?

Any similar stories?",Waitingthrowaway,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vbob8/hey_reddit_im_waiting_for_tomorrow_where_my_new/,"Hey Reddit! (throwaway here)

UPDATE: It seems so far that it's negative! we are going to do another test on sunday in case her period doesn't come but this is at least a good sign!

I'm a 23 year old soon to be BBA living in Germany where I've performed my graduation internship for my thesis, I'm scheduled to receive my bachelors degree within 3 weeks. 
Now, me and my German girlfriend (I'm Dutch) who I've met here, have been dating for a while and we finally decided to commit to the relationship and become a couple. However some time ago we had some problems with the condom during intercourse and although I didn't orgasm and pulled out as soon as we noticed, she is now about 5 days late and we are worried as hell that she might be pregnant. Ofcourse we are hoping that everything is okay but in the opposite case we have to decide what to do... We've bought the test today and were told to use it tomorrow morning to give the clearest result, so I am sitting out one of my last work days just being nervous as hell.

Regardless of the result of the test I will have to go back to the Netherlands for my graduation ceremony but it was actually my plan even before this whole baby thing, to come back after a month or so to find a job here as I really enjoy my time in Germany and I want to be close to my new girlfriend and all my friends. 
In case it's positive I have no idea what we will do but I intent to fully support and be there for my girlfriend as I am not someone who backs out of responibilities.

I wrote this to get a bit of my chest and also to see if there are similar stories and to see what their outcomes were!

Edit: spelling (also sorry for the errors in the title, I haven't slept much the last days)

Colin is 38. Sam is 20. I am 23. I met Sam at college, we are in a business frat and associated in that context but are fairly friendly for the past two years. His dad is a CPA and, being friends and colleagues, Sam gets me an internship with his dad.

Colin is not your typical middle-aged man. He is sexy and smart and we have similar childhoods that really helped us connect. After a year of working together, we end up romantically involved. It's become serious and he has even began planning on how to break the news to Sam and such.

To complicate matters, Sam works there in the summertime and has been very aggressive in expressing his interest in me. I have politely but firmly let him know that we were not an option. It hasn't helped and recently he has began to declare his love for me, try to kiss me etc, whenever he can.

I love Colin and want to be honest with him but I know he prioritizes Sam and worry that this might be too big of an obstacle in addition to our age."

This makes taking out a massive loan pretty much impossible for my family to afford.  My dad being a minister and all, he has some friends that run a charity in Tanzania, and he suggested that I get some ""life experience"" while I can't attend college this year.  I figured it was the best option for me, so I'm going this September.  The only problem is, I have NO clue how to prepare-- and I haven't ever even been to a foreign country (besides Canada).


TL;DR:  I didn't get as much cash for college as I thought I would, and my family can't afford to take out loans right now.  I'm going to Tanzania for a year on an internship, but don't know how to prepare for a venture like this."

vbddi,12,2012-06-20,So I've been slowly developing this ability within myself..,paddywhack,intj,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/vbddi/so_ive_been_slowly_developing_this_ability_within/,"...and to explain it I guess I'll have to share a bit about who I *was* and where I've come from **and** how the events of the last 22 months or so have profoundly impacted my life.
 
I used to be a pretty average guy all things considered. I went to a university, got a degree in software architecture and design. I've always considered myself clever I suppose, always trying de-construct whatever it is im faced with, working mentally from the big picture to finer and finer granularity. 

I was quite fortunate back in 3rd year university and made the choice to go out and get an internship for 18 months with a great company. After returning to school for a final year and graduating in May 2008 (just before the financial chaos on wall-street) it was shitty pickings for new careers.  Great IT company from internship wasn't hiring, tightened up budgets and yada yada, whatever. Ended up taking a consultant type gig in a different city, re-located myself and set up life. Within first 2 months of new career had a relationship dissolve that stung really deeply. Re-bounded within the first few months with another girl and had a tumultuous 6 months with her, great sex but complete breakdown of communication and having a common ground.  
End that relationship poorly. Begin solid stretch of forever alone from April 2009 'til my subconscious clawed at my being and I got up and took 6 weeks off work and did the whole south-east Asia thing.

Came back to a depressing cubicle, and a depressed me. ""What the fuck am I doing in life."" Never ever been one to transcribe my thoughts, emotions down on any sort of medium before.. I picked up a piece of paper one day and wrote an honest self-assessment, I didn't just think about it, I wrote it down in August 2010. I cried alone in the dark over it. I knew I had to make a change, to feel fulfilled, to dream again.
Newton's third law plays into effect here, objects in motion tend to stay in motion so my shitty slide continued until about twelve months ago. 

I got involved in a business opportunity. 

This lead me on a path of personal development that I sought out. I've always felt, as an INTJ that I can process enormous quantities of datum and time-sinks like Reddit are fuel for that internal capacity.
So instead of putting my time towards what I always did, I **chose** to spend time consuming materials that enhanced my life, adding value in trying to achieve my goals that I wrote down in my honest self-assessment of myself back in August 2010. 

It was slow at first, building new habits takes time. Read a bit here and there, was recommended new books. I enjoy reading, but often fall prey to starting and not finishing what I start. I really caught on to success audio from a monthly magazine subscription I bought. I never read the magazine, just fell in love with the monthly audio. It all compounded from there, I'm listening to atleast 3 hours a day of personal development audio. You would be surprised where you can find the time to squeeze it in.

Ni is the greatest gift we have.

Anyway's I kept at it, even when things got tough, always bringing myself back to my ""why"" ... that vision of my future self that I had a burning desire to fulfil. I must change.

Bringing this all back to the point of this whole posting in the first place, the **TL;DR**.  Tonight I was around a group of friends, and some new person was introduced to me, now this person was outgoing but I could feel the tension under her skin. Everyone was sharing insights into what motivates them and this girl couldn't even look people in the eyes. Her self-confidence was low.  Truthfully, how many of you would feel comfortable sharing feelings to complete strangers.  I honed in on this, and leveraged a skill-set I have been consciously trying to build within myself. I was able, through conversation applying tonal patterns and empathising, to elicit a powerful emotional response in this woman, this complete stranger. I brought her to tears and made her come to realize for herself her deepest fear in life is not living up her mothers exceptions of her and living in her older sisters shadow. 

The wildest and most unexpected aspect of this action tonight for me was that I was holding back the tears myself, I knew I was consciously driving this conversation to get a desired effect in this woman. And I knew that if I didn't slow it down I wouldn't of been able to hold it back I would have broken down because I realized that I was passing on the same opportunity to change her life circumstances that I had made myself.  I made her promise me right there that whenever life got hard, and when she might choose to give up on her decisions to better her life that she come back to this moment and know why she made the choice to improve her life. 

I am only consciously competent in this skillset I've been learning, my goal is to get to an un-consciously competent level .. sorta like knowing how to drive a manual transmission in a car after doing it for so long.

I am proud of myself.  I first had to share this with my girlfriend, and now I'm sharing it with you INTJ'ers because I know this will plant seeds in a few of you.

Before, I've avoided going on dates because I was shamefully poor. My parents were hoarders, and I didn't want to bring anyone back home. After high school, I stayed home and went to community college because I didn't qualify for financial aid. Three years later, I fixed my parents tax situation so I could go to a university but none of my community college courses counted towards engineering so I had to start all over. So, one year left to go, and I finally get a decent internship and move out with my brother.

The past few months, I've been dating women, but not really doing anything intimate. I have no idea what I'm doing. Right now I'm seeing a girl who seems pretty cool, but I'm not sure if she's into me. We've been on two dates, and I feel like since I haven't made a move at this point, I should just start a clean slate. She seems to view me more as a friend anyways, and every time I walk her to her car, she doesn't linger or give me any cues.

What would a girl do if she was giving me the opening to kiss her? How do I know she's into me and not just trying to get a free meal or entertainment?"
vb9wd,1,2012-06-20,"My mom recently had ~$30,000 worth of jewelry stolen. We have a good idea who's responsible. Police are doing nothing. Please reddit, need some advice!",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vb9wd/my_mom_recently_had_30000_worth_of_jewelry_stolen/,"Just got off the phone with her. Might be a little lengthy but here's what I know:

My mom was out of town for Memorial Day Weekend and was gone for about a week. She didn't notice anything was missing until last week when she went looking for some old jewelry. Everything was taken - engagement ring, family heirlooms, bracelets, earrings, GPS, possibly more that's yet to be discovered. Basically every good piece of jewelry she had acquired over 30 years plus some other items. 

She filed a police report and was told she had a detective assigned to the case. After not hearing from anybody for a few days (aren't detectives supposed to come ask questions, check out the scene?), she called in asking for the detective, whose name she had been given, nobody at the station knew who she was talking about - turns out it was an intern. Yes, an intern had been assigned to her case. (Isn't $30k worth of stuff a pretty serious deal?) She has a friend of a friend who works for the sheriff's department. Having this friend inquire about the situation resulted in a very angry call from a real detective who was pissed that she went asking about it. He threatened to just close the case.

Here's what we know concerning the actual robbery. We're pretty sure we know who is responsible:

My mom left a key to her place with one of her best friends of 12 years or so. Wonderful person, definitely not her. This friend, however, had recently taken in someone to their home. This someone is a young 20's female who we know had been kicked out of her home, kicked out of her church. She has a history of drug abuse, prostitution, etc. but we're being told has since ""found God."" My mom's friend &amp; her family are just great people and were willing to take her into their home. This young woman had very easy access to the key, full knowledge of the dates my mother was out of town, etc. Additionally, the circumstances of the theft were such that every object was so meticulously opened, replaced, and looked untouched, that it is obvious the perpetrator knew very well that he/she had plenty of time to do the deed. There are also no signs of forced entry: all of my mom's windows were locked and appeared untouched. The sliding back door had (and still has) a piece of wood preventing entry - it would have taken some SERIOUS work to get through it and would have left clear evidence. The only logical option is that somebody walked through the front door. Even more: the upstairs neighbor knew that my mother was going to be out - a very nice older lady who we're pretty certain couldn't have done it. She reported to my mother that she saw an SUV pull up to the house, two young 20-something females got out and entered my mom's apartment.  This neighbor had just assumed my mom got home early and these girls were helping move in (my mother had moved in only a couple months prior and has been slow in unpacking/removing items from storage). It's seemingly clear who's responsible for this.

Back to the police. My mother was given an ultimatum: she can request that the detective call in my mom's friend for questioning, or just close the case. So we're currently sitting at the detective saying ""Well I'll be out of town for a few days, so I'll probably call in [mom's friend] Friday or maybe Monday."" At best, this leads to questioning of the girl. At worst, that's the end.

Now, we are pretty certain she won't get anything back. Weeks have gone by, things could have been pawned off at any number of locations, etc. But we both feel it's absurd that there is little to no interest being shown by the police. My mom has had her security and privacy violated, has been having nightmares since she found out, and a general paranoia/anxiety. Nothing too serious, but not a good situation.

My advice to her was to, as soon as they close the case and do nothing, go to the media and start a shitstorm that way. She's afraid of getting a bad rap locally and causing the police to shun her in the future should she ever need their help again.

So, reddit, please help! Is there anything we can do? Is this just a lost cause? Is there any chance of justice here?

I'll try to answer any questions based on what I know, but can call her tomorrow and get updates as necessary. Thanks so much ahead of time."

(Warning; LONG)",gagagirl,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/vb4rk/i_need_to_vent_advice_welcome_share_similar/,"This has everything to do with my SO, and I'm stressing really badly about it.

SO and I went to the same school and got the same certification as Dental Assistants. He finished his hours for internship and peaced the eff out of the field all-together. Now, he lives off tips working as a bartender at a hookah lounge and as a server at the same restaurant I work at. He lost his SUV when I was 10 weeks pregnant, and used the refunded down payment on a 2000 Yamaha R1. He crashed that when he was involved in a hit and run a few months back and couldn't do anything about it due to the fact that he did not have it insured, so it sat broken in his apartment parking lot for months while he tried to ""save money"" to purchase new plastics and new parts for it (he only got a new oil can, and spent most of the rest of his money on rent, cigarettes and beer). He missed two payments (one of which I helped him with, he still owes me $180 or so) and called me at 3:30AM to tell me it got repossessed, this happened sometime last week. He needed to pay close to two grand in fee's as well as a pay-off and only has a few more days to come up with the money or else he looses it for good.

So what's his solution? Save up and buy ANOTHER bike outright, because he cant come up with the money in time. I asked him today why he thought that was a good idea, and what would he plan on doing if he wanted to take Camilla somewhere? He assured me he'd have a way of getting her around safely, his mom's van being his first option. This saddens me and frustrates the hell out of me. He's 27-friggin-years old.

Bumpers, I love him. I really do. He knows it and loves me just the same. We're not together at the moment, but he realized just a few weeks ago that I have been one of the only people who has been stable in his life and willing to help him no matter what. I cant even count the times I've woken up early in the morning and driven across town to be with him after he had a nightmare (PTSD from the Army) and to just be there with him when he's lonely, and I dont keep track either only because I dont believe in doing so. He's rarely lifted that kind of finger for me, but I've stuck by him even when he was screwing around with our co workers. I've had to sift through countless rumors that flew around our social circle throughout this entire pregnancy and it's enough to drive someone absolutely insane. I've never once given him shit for his poor decisions because he gets enough of it from others, his mom included. I work two jobs, both on my feet. One in a dental office (and I dont get paid yet) and the other with him where I am a hostess and he is a server. I've given him rides when he needed it to and from work, as well as leaving my house to go across town (again, like a 30 minute drive) just to drive him home when his friends were too drunk to take him anywhere. All the while, he was struggling with a past relationship that he still had feelings for, ontop of a supposed ""girlfriend"" he made at our workplace among a plethora of other family problems. I stuck it out, because I knew I was better than all of them. I'm not the crazy ex who places myself in his life solely because of this baby, I stayed away unless I was called upon and even then, I picked and chose if I wanted to bail him out of whatever life threw at him. It got so bad, even his mom told me to stop coming around; not because she doesnt like me, but because she knew everything I was doing for him, he FAR from deserved. That's sad. I really want to put him in my position just for a day to know how I was truly hurt by all of this.

He told me he wants to make it work, but I'm so numb to his empty promises now. He's come to me twice in this entire pregnancy and said the same thing. First time was when I found out. He was piss drunk while I was working ( we were still together at the time) and he told me ""I love you and we will make this work"". He said it again when I was about 20 weeks post break up, said he wanted to be in her life, but wanted to be in my life later on down the road. I was fine with this. He tapers off again, only to come back a month ago and tell me ""I want to be with you and the baby. I love you, because you loved me enough to stick around when I needed you the most. I'm blessed to have you..etc etc"" and again, he's beginning to taper off. He's doing a lot better this time around, but he's keeping me on a long leash and its frustrating as hell. I told him he keeps going from one extreme to the other, and needs to knock it off because it hurts the crap out of me. He told me he wants to take it slow and get back to getting to know one another. We began dating for about a month before I found out, and he felt it was rushed (well, no shit!) but now would like to take me on dates after the baby to redeem what we lost. I am all for it, I just wish he wouldn't be so stand-off-ish in the meantime! 

Oh, and to top it off, he denied the baby up until the last phone call I spoke of earlier. He claimed the dates never matched up, until I told him there was a WIDE two week window in every pregnancy, and that two week window falls perfectly in the realm of the ""first time"" for the both of us .... the very drunk, unprotected, and stupid ""first time"". Now, he claims her and even gets mad at me if I call her ""my daughter"" and not ""our daughter""... oi vey. It got so bad, that... well let me tell that small story...

I met with him and a few friends who were all pretty wicked drunk one weekend at a hotel for a party. I sat around most of the night and smiled, giggling at the drunk people around me and mainly stayed quiet (which is not normally me, I'm just highly uncomfortable at this point because he is leaving every so often to go flirt with a few Puerto Rican girls he found, and I'm the only one not drinking or in a bikini looking cute like everyone else). I get up to go to the bathroom and his friend walks in with another friend who dont know I'm in the bathroom of the hotel room. One of them says ""Yeah, lets bring the pregnant girlfriend to the party... not my idea!!!! "" and leaves. I fight tears as I flush and waddle out, beginning to feel awful for even coming out at all, to which my SO comes up to me asking if I'm okay. I tell him what happened but asked him not to make a deal of it. Well, drunk him decides to pull aside his friend and berate him incredibly for what he said, telling him ""dont ever talk that way about the mother of my child. You're lucky I dont punch you in the face....blahblah man things"". His friend later came to me, sat next to me, apologized drunkenly a few times, and all was well after that. But moral of the story is, he's becoming more and more protective of me and the baby and I dont know how to take it. 


**SO, MY QUESTIONS ARE.**

1. How do I deal with him being so irresponsible? He's literally done NOTHING financially for this baby although he claims that he's planning on buying the $500 crib I want, also paying for my bills while I'm not working postpartum. My mom is angry at him for this, my dad is annoyed but has faith that he will pull his head out of his ass eventually...

2. How should I deal with him being so emotionally unstable about our relationship, and the relationship he is forcing on the baby? He went from denying her and me, to being incredibly protective of us. I dont know how to handle it; should I be happy? Should I be careful?


I will gladly clarify anything if need be. I wrote this scatter-brained so I dont know if I made a terribly-good amount of sense. 

Added note; I'm too scared to voice my fear in the second question to him, because he is the type to take what I say to an extreme. I'm afraid that if I do tell him, that he will pull off completely and I'll ultimately be left with nothing. Oh, the joy of pregnancy hormones."

I was thinking of biking down town tomorrow(about a 2 hour trip) and just enjoy the city life, but that would get boring everyday. I enjoy encounters with random people. im not antisocial or anything, i actually like talking to people i will probably never see again, it feels like i can be anything i want to them. I live in toronto, im sure you guys know some interesting places to visit.

tl;dr Please help me think of cheap things to do this summer so i dont fall into depression again.

edit:
i can't believe this is actually getting downvoted... thanks guys"

I have no college under my belt but over 10k hours of experience in pretty much every aspect of the company. I have countless hours in practice of business proposals, presentations, renderings, T-24, code research, design, full structural document preparation, engineering markups, coordination with City/County officials &amp; meetings, DRC/ Planning Commission, structural inspections, and even some basic engineering (hardware, footings, beams, lateral analysis, etc).

I am a translator for a deaf architect and have literally been in the middle of hundreds of projects, mostly residential but plenty of commercial too. I've recently become eligible for the ARE and would like to start planning for the future. 

In addition to my experience, and soon-to-be licence (in CA), what other kind of skills should I know that would be most beneficial to the typical architect firm, preferably one focused in commercial design. 

I know the ins and outs of Revit and I am picking up Autocad and Sketchup quickly as computer programs generally come easy to me. My communication and people skills have also been improved dramatically over the last 4 years with help from personal hobbies. Aside from this what other programs, skills, etc should I invest my spare time into? Anything that will really put myself ahead of the competition would be most helpful.

I'm incredibly well disciplined and with available resources I don't see anything holding me back. Hopefully some business owners out there may have some good advice?

Thanks to all of you with experience in the field. Your guidance may just have profound effects on my future. 


Some areas I've thought about investing into but unsure of usefulness:

- capabilities of full structural analysis (at least for wood frame structures)
- photoshop / illustrator
- landscape architecture
- a second language- spanish, chinese?
- internet marketing"

Hello,

I would like to share my weird story with all of you. First, I must clarify that I'm a French guy and that I'm currently going through my nineteenth year. My english is not that perfect, but you should be able to understand without puking!

It all started when I was twelve. I moved and had to attend a new school. Couldn't make myself to have friends and most of the time I used to be really alone. Somehow didn't give a fuck about this, as I was the kind of guy who likes to be alone.

After discovering world of warcraft, I had difficulties to continue going to school, as what I where doing in this game was more interesting that the stuff at school... I eventually totally dropped school, little by little. Over years, I've repeated 4 times because I did not attend school at all.
This is where justice came and said to my parents I HAD to attend school, or else I'll have some big trouble with them. An educator came in the story (and eventually lied ; he said that I've been beating my mom...), then I decided to attend home course.

Unsatisfied with that choice, the judge thought that the best for me was to maintain the procedure. I've been followed by a new educator, after the last one made his report.

Here in France, you cannot leave school until you're sixteen. I was sixteen, but somehow, using the fact that I've been in ""danger"", the procedure kept going. On september 2010, after having proved really good grades with home schooling, they decided that they'll intern me in a psychiatric hospital, in ""observation"" and for an undetermined time. I could not escape this one, and making appeal would not have work before the internment statement. Me, my parents, and my two lawyers kept thinking this was all so wrong, but we could not find the ""justice"".

I did not known this fact until last week-end, but the judge tried to intimidate my father because we got lawyers, arguing that my father was trying to publicly discredit him... This has not succeeded, as my father was aware of how futile was this vast mascarade.

I did end up for a month in a public psychiatric unit for adolescents. At my arrival, I was ""held"" in a chamber were I could not take a shit with the bare minimum of intimacy, and with nothing to hurt myself : bed was fixed on the floor, and radiators were included inside the walls... Hopefully, I stayed in this room for 5 minutes, before they came and told me ""Sorry, that was a mistake, you should not be here""... I got pissed of and argued with the director of the ""service"", telling her that I'll take her in court and all this kind of shit... Of course, I didn't...

I was then transferred to the adolescent unit and stood there for a month before being able to being again transferred to a soften unit, which I'll detail below. I was held with other ""patient"" who where under strong medication and hopefully, I was the only one who wasn't and never were. This month was really, really hard, as I could not go home on week-ends and barely had visits, but it was not the worst!

After some tight negotiations I was able to be transferred to a less medicalized unit, which was literally inside a forest... The only ""rule"" was that I had to keep getting ""home"" schooled, and that the first month I could not establish contact with the outside world at all (a rule i've broken by using my ipod touch and ""hacking"" their wifi network, modifying my mac address with one allowed, sending emails to my father and bests friends)... This was a fucking long month, and I did not see the civilization at all except when I escaped once for an hour or two, arguing that I wanted to walk in the forest, alone.

After a month, and so much discussion with the head doctor, she said to me that she did not understand what I've been doing there... I convinced her to let me go home, and back me in front of the judge, saying I had to go home, or eventually it will become worse and I'll really start to develop some trouble. This was decided in two hours. I packaged my stuff and left the same evening, all in a hurry. I was then seventeen. I had my birthday in this center, without being able to contact the outside world, and no-one told me ""happy birthday"" except the other patient. They even made me a chocolate cake. Problem is that chocolate is one of the only things that I don't enjoy...

Judge eventually tried to get me back into court, but I did not attend any meet up and turned eighteen. During that time I started programming everyday, all day long.

Started working as freelance. Was not satisfied, decided to move Paris with only little money for a month. Living for a month at an irc mate place. During this time I found a job and got hired.
I then had to move on to one of my two best friend house, which is by more than ten years my senior. I was happy since living with someone I deeply respect, and was working hard. I was hired as an engineer.

After six months, and as I was finding myself unsatisfied to develop for externals clients, I started looking for a work that involved some research and ended up in a start-up as the referring programmer and r&amp;d developer. It's been six months then, and I moved in my own basement.


Sometimes, I just want to call all the people who was involved in keeping me inside psychiatric units and did not trust that I could work, or have an adequate adult social life, sending them my pay slip to prove them.

Ask me any details about this, I'll try to help. If anyone ever get stuck in an awkward situation like this, just keep going and does not let them take over you!!

Well, ask me anything

----------
Special thanks to the friends who rooted for me, and a deep and very special thank to my friend who kept me at his home for a year, and his daughter whose good mood and innocence made me more optimistic towards life!"
veqm4,1,2012-06-21,How would you approach putting a mediocre project/first work experience on your CV?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/veqm4/how_would_you_approach_putting_a_mediocre/,"I just graduated with a BS in CompSci. During the last semester of my degree, instead of taking classes I did an internship, developing a kind of add-on web application for an existing application the company used.

While I do feel like I learned a lot, I'm not 100% happy with the final product that got deployed. Due to time constraints and, particularly, lack of direction, mentorship, and communication from supervisors that were overseeing my work, I feel like it's not up to the standards of more mature development environments at the bigger companies where I'd like to apply.

Additionally, while I don't think my past employer would say anything very negative about me as a reference, I'm also not sure her recommendation would be glowing, as she didn't seem to like me on a personal level for whatever reason.

So although I *could* link to the github repo and let potential employers browse my work, I'm not sure that's the best idea. Of course, none of my potential employers would know it was an open source project, but if I use my supervisor as a reference (and should I, considering? but wouldn't it also be bad to *not* have a reference from an internship?) but I'm still not sure how to best sell myself and my capabilities with these concerns in mind.

Any tips or thoughts? Thanks in advance."
veqjr,1,2012-06-21,(20F) Boyfriend (20M) lost interest in sex.,yskb,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/veqjr/20f_boyfriend_20m_lost_interest_in_sex/,"My boyfriend and I have been together for about 2 years, and we have generally had a good sexual relationship. This winter, my boyfriend basically seemed to lose interest in sex. We went from having sexual contact every couple of days to having sexual contact every couple of weeks. Right before I went on a two week trip this April, he admitted to me that he was bored with our sex when we did have it. We didn't talk about sex at all when I went on the trip, but when I got back, his libido was right back to normal.
 We started having sex frequently again, and this lasted for about a month. Then, his libido went right back down again, and our sexual activity got very infrequent. I tried to spice things up and do all kinds of sexy things for him, but I hardly ever got a reaction.
 When I try to discuss it with him, he gets frustrated and won't discuss it. He's assured me that it's not my fault. He says he doesn't even want to masturbate anymore. He says he doesn't know what the problem is. We've been apart (because I have an internship this summer) for 3 weeks now, and every time I bring up anything sexual he changes the subject immediately. I don't know what's going on. Other aspects of our relationship seem great. This is such a drastic change in him. It used to seem like sex was always on his mind. 
Does anyone have any ideas as to what the problem might be. Is there anything else I should be doing here? 

tl;dr: Used to have great sex life with boyfriend, now he has lost interest in sex and doesn't want to talk about it."

veokd,4,2012-06-21,[20m] How early is too early to get engaged to or live with my GF? [20f],throwawy112233443,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/veokd/20m_how_early_is_too_early_to_get_engaged_to_or/,"My GF and I have been dating since Sep 2010. We are now both going to be juniors in college this coming school year. Both of us have been very happy with our relationship and I would say we have both considered it to be a ""serious"" relationship since pretty early on. This past school year, she has stayed at my place 3 nights a week minimum. Sometimes is feels like we practically live together. We already have our living arrangements set up for this coming school year living separately. However, I brought up the idea of living together during the next school year. We both agreed that we would really enjoy living together, but she said that she believes that we should be at least engaged before living together. While I don't share this belief, I find it to be entirely reasonable. My problem is that I will be leaving for an internship for 6 months in January. By the time I get back, I will have to have already made living arrangements for the next school year. That means if I were going to propose it would have to be by December, which is sooner than I would like. I don't have any money for a ring (although I know for a fact she would be fine with even the least expensive ring I could find). And even if I do decide to propose some time soon-ish, myself and my parents don't really have much money to spare for a wedding at the moment. 

Again, we are very much in love and have a very strong relationship, and I can't think of any reason why I wouldn't want to marry her, but I realize that my perspective isn't as valid as it could be based on the fact that I am young, we've only been going out for 2 years, and she is my first serious girlfriend. (Is that last one a big deal, do you think?)

So, here are my main questions:

* Is it too soon to propose? How can I tell if we're ""ready""?

* How long is too long to wait between getting engaged and getting married?

* Anyone ever been in a similar situation? Anyone get married to their first SO and regret it? 

* How much does a small wedding cost?

* Any other advice?

I’m literally rambling all of this out. I’m about to enter my third year of college, and my brother graduated college two years ago (we attend/ed the same university). He’s been living out on his own, in the nicest apartment complex, driving a Lexus IS-F that my parents bought him as a graduating present - all while I’ve been working my ass off in college in the same city my brother lives in, coming home every break to visit my parents (not always by choice, you know how it is), and scrambling to look for future internship opportunities during the school year and for next summer break to hopefully build up relations with or a resume for future employment. 

However, yesterday, I got into a terrible argument with my mother. She told me that after college, I was to come live at home with her and my father, regardless of whether I had a job opportunity waiting for me or not -- because I’m the girl in the house. They would rather I risk a future career to be closer to the family WHO, by the way, have no idea that I’m A, an exmuslim, B, bisexual (haha I didn’t even plan that), or C, in a relationship with a white atheist. They’re making me do this while my brother goes about doing absolutely nothing for his future. He’s been rejected from medical school TWICE and is studying to retake the MCAT, but he hasn’t gone out and done volunteer work or gotten a job or anything truly productive. He’s been living away and having my parents pay for everything whereas I’ve been trying to look for a job all summer and will continue to look for one when the school year starts. Comparably, I’m a much harder worker, more frugal, more future-focused than my brother, yet I’m the one that my parents are limiting my future SOLELY based on the fact that I’m the girl in the house. 

Am I being unfair or bratty? Have any of you exmuslim girls experienced something like this? I can’t be the only one. This isn’t the first time they’ve restricted me from doing something that my brother is able to do because he’s a boy and I’m not. It’s just so frustrating! "

Anyways, my boss is out an about in California so she's left me in charge of the new intern. I finally had the balls to ask her if she wanted to get lunch together Friday.

My question is... I'd like to get to know this new intern much more outside of work but I understand there's risks when you fall for a co-worker (keep in mind she's a intern for the summer) but I was wondering how to handle this whole situation?

I need to know I am not alone. ,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ve32y/what_is_your_worst_affair_story_i_need_to_know_i/,"This last two years have been living hell for me. I have been through a lot of therapy. I just want to feel like I am not alone right now ... so here is my story first.  I found out in November of 2010 that my husband had been cheating on me with my pregnant really good friend, since before we got married.  She was also our realtor who sold us our house right before our wedding.  She helped me do the wedding favors and pinned the boutonniere on my dad and brother. They started their affair before she got pregnant by everything other than sex in December of 2009 (before the save the date cards went out for my wedding). They made a packed that they wouldn’t leave their significant other and that they would make our two family's really close.  She made herself out to be my best friend after that.  When she found out she was pregnant that meant they could do everything else.  

We got married and she helped me paint my new house.  Things seemed normal through the summer.  She spent a lot of time at our house since her husband was a Doctor doing his internship.  I would pick her up on my way from work and she would stay the night in our extra room.   In September my husband and I started to try and have a baby. She acted so excited and told me I should tell her first and our kids would grow up together.  (luckily I didn't get pregnant)

She had the baby in October and she stopped paying as much attention to my husband (they would have lunch trysts before because she didn't work other than sort of real estate but she only sold two houses one of which was ours) My husband in turn withdrew from me.  I looked at his email after seeing them play footsie under the table as we all (her husband included) played cards and played with the baby.  

My world came crashing down.  She chose to stay with her husband.  My husband said he wanted to stay with me.  So I tried for a while.  We went on a preplanned trip to his family in for Christmas.  He swore he was done with her.  I found out right before we came home on the plane that he was still trying to communicate with her.  I had to fly the whole way back with him sitting next to me.  She wrote him and me a letter stating she wanted no more contact.  She called the cops on my husband.  I was stupid and continued to try to make thing work as he told me he wanted to stay.  He became obsessed with her. He would talk about her and there trysts in detail (to try and get me to leave I think) I did in may after our anniversary when he didn’t try to do anything for it.  She filed a stalking order against him this spring.  I don't have communication with him but it was at the court house I work at.   

The whole thing led to a lot of therapy.  Friends doing intervensions with me because I was saying crazy things.  I paid him off for the house (probably shouldn't it’s a little over my price range but I found the house and did a lot of work on it and I didn't want him to have it because he bought it thinking that he would have a relationship and family with her in it someday.)  So I spent the last year remodeling things myself.  I have become a master at tiling.  Totally re did my kitchen.  Its sort of hands on therapy.  

I have had to come to grips about a lot of things.  The fact that I have gotten older and may never have kids.  The fact that I will never have my big wedding again (my parents paid for the last one and he didn't pay them back).  

But on the good side although probably a little too quick I do have a new boyfriend who treats me very well.  Things are looking up.  I don’t cry going into work everyday,  I don't have panic attacks,  I am starting to see a future again.

vdxty,9,2012-06-21,Counting calories in a foreign country?,Thephantomtollboy,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/vdxty/counting_calories_in_a_foreign_country/,"Hey everyone. So I'm doing a summer internship in China and it's finally given me the time needed to commit to a regimented diet and exercise program. The only problem I've been running into is getting nutritional information. 

I'd say 80% of the time, I prepare my own food. Typically I'll make either brown rice with dark greens, sometimes with beef or pork, and some low-sodium soy sauce or some variant with noodles instead of rice. It's easy enough to read the back of things like that to get the calories but I'm more concerned with the other 20% of the time where I get delivery from Chinese restaurants at work. 

I'm by no means fluent in Mandarin, so I've asked my co-workers if they could ask the restaurants to get me the nutritional information. At that point, one of two things happens: One, my co-workers will say why? and refuse to ask purely because they think it's pointless. Or two, the restaurant won't even have that information readily available because they too think it's pointless. The most information I've gotten from a restaurant was a crudely written ingredient list because they were concerned I had an allergy. 

So, I guess what I'm asking is has anyone been in a similar situation? It doesn't have to be China, but what do you all think I should do? I've been making progress and I don't want to hamper myself because I don't know how many calories I'm eating during the work week. Obviously I go for things that look healthier than others, but Chinese food can be especially deceptive in that department. Also, if you have any healthy Chinese recipes you'd like to recommend to help with food I prepare, I'd love to hear that too!

Any advice would be most appreciated. Thanks! "

My boyfriend and his ex broke up due to unusual circumstances. He was studying abroad in New Zealand, and she in London. They had been dating for two years prior to the breakup. While separated, they decided to consider getting back together when they returned to the US. 

But she met someone abroad, and my bf met me, and after a very long and exhausting process, my bf and I ended up together. That was 7 months ago. 

My bf's ex is still very much in his life. She is still incredibly close to his friends group, which had made my transition in very difficult, but I've been doing better with this. I've expressed my struggle to my boyfriend, who promises it will just take time for them to adjust to having me around.

Since my bf lives in another city, we only see one another on weekends. His ex has an internship in the city where my bf lives. One night when my bf and I were discussing our exes, he told me she came over to visit his dog. This was about a week after she had stopped by that he decided to tell me. This isn't the first time she's stopped by his house to ""visit his dog"", either. She did it several times very early on in our relationship, and not only gave my bf a difficult time, but also attempted to pry info about me out of him, which my bf refused. 

I told my bf I was upset that he didn't tell me until a week later about her visit, and I explained that it made me feel as though he was hiding something. He promised to improve. So last night, he sent me a text alerting me that she was stopping by to ""visit his dog"" while I was at work. I was glad my bf alerted me, but I can't help but feel nauseous about this whole thing. I explained to my bf that it is hard to hang out with exes when a break-up is so fresh, because those feelings are still here, whether we want them to be or not. He agreed with me, and reassured me that nothing had happened between them physically or emotionally, and I believe him. But it still makes me uncomfortable. I am having a hard time juggling my emotions and trying not to be controlling. 

Help!

Edit: I talked to my boyfriend about his most recent meeting with his ex, and expressed to him why it bothers me. He apologized and made excuses for her visits such as ""she's a little crazy and doesn't understand the boundaries"" and ""she genuinely misses my dog"" and such. I called him out on that and he told me he would be talking to her about the situation. Thank you for making me feel sane, Reddit. "

She has good marks, she works in the lab under a supervisor (unpaid), and seems to have had nothing but good remarks from her professors. Her father is on disability (muscular dystrophy), her stepmom is unemployed (was working as a bookkeeper, has since gone back to college for accounting), and her mother is is a babbysitter(started her own company but it is probably running in the red at least because it is new)

With that kind of information, for those who have gone through the process before, is there any advice for landing a job as a medical examiner? I know she has quite a few years to go. Finishing up her bachelors in a year, then masters, then med school, then residency, then a year or so specialization?  I believe that is how she explained it to me at least. 

Is there a specific time where you would suggest getting an internship in the field?  I would guess places wouldn't take you with just a bachelors, but if you are in med school without having an internship you may not have the time to get one before you graduate? 

At what point can you look to get a job in the field? How is the field with respect to motherhood? 

Any advice at all would be appreciated. I went to an inexpensive private college, worked 60 hours a week to pay my way through and received a job offer before I graduated in the IT field. I am really in the dark with looking for government aid (my parents made too much for me to get anything but too little to give me anything but my childhood bedroom), have no clue how the medical profession looks at various degrees (IT field really doesn't give a damn about a masters. Get a bachelors to show base line experience and then get field experience), and being someone who was always planning for the future for me, I am not comfortable being so in the dark about this.

Thanks for anything you can say about your experience pursuing a medical degree."

I'm a relatively inexperienced web developer (if you can call it that - just got my first real internship, still in college). I currently do most work in PHP, but Im thinking of picking up C#. Reason being: I'm interested in getting into game development, while simultaneously expanding my webdev knowledge, and I hear C# is pretty good at both of these.


My question is this: How simultaneous can this really be? How much overlap is there between using C# to do back-end web dev and using it do do game dev (XNA)? Is it just the basic syntax in common while using drastically different ends of the language, or will I be able to make some semblance of progress in both directions at once by learning a sizable overlapping chunk?


I realize libraries/frameworks are probably specialized by purpose, so I'm kind of guessing the former, but the bottom line is: **Is there enough overlap between the two to make learning C# worth it for the sole reason of said overlap? If not, are there any other languages you could recommend for this?**


I don't have much experience in practical non-web programming or multi-purpose languages, so forgive me if this is a silly question. It made sense in my head. Thanks in advance for any answers."

And I don't mean a little brow sweat, I mean sweat pouring down my face, sweat that is impossible to hide. Depending on my level of comfort, this can happen in simple situations such as answering a question in class or when a small problem occurs at work.

Although I understand this problem, I cannot seem to find the source of it. I have a lack of confidence, but no clue why. 

My worst memory of this occurred when I had been offered an internship at a financial institution. By the time I had finished talking to the supervisor, it looked like I had just gone for a swim. She commented on it, saying, ""stop sweating, don't be nervous"". I never worked up the confidence to go back there, I was more thoroughly embarrassed than I can remember in recent years.

Unfortunately, this happens when I talk to girls whom I consider to be beautiful. Even if this does not completely ruin my chances with said girl, I'll feel awkward and end up cutting the conversation short and forcing myself to leave.  It is very difficult trying to have a flowing conversation when every other one of my thoughts is about myself sweating. Anyone ever have this problem? If not, help me find out why I sweat, and ways to prevent it?

TL;DR When I talk to sexy girls I sweat like crazy and need help.

Oh yeah, I made a throwaway.

vdeql,7,2012-06-21,Mother who suffers from BPD recently diagnosed with late-stage cancer.,[deleted],BPD,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/vdeql/mother_who_suffers_from_bpd_recently_diagnosed/,"Hi, BPD community -- I'm new here, but I really need help, and I'm hoping someone here can offer guidance.


I'm 21 years old, and I grew up living alone with a BPD-diagnosed mother. My parents divorced when I was 7, and when my father moved away, I was left alone with my mother -- I had to become the caretaker, the voice of reason, and ultimately fulfill the role of the parent. 

As I got older, things got worse and worse. My mother would say extraordinarily hurtful things to me: ""I made a mistake for thinking you were smart,"" ""No wonder you don't have any friends,"" ""My marriage was perfect until you were born,"" ""You'll never make anything of yourself the way I did.""

The worst of these, which I will never forget, was my mother sitting me down and telling me that I was a sociopath, and that I did not have the basic capacity to feel emotions. This was not an off-handed comment -- she sat me down in the living room, looked me in the eye, and told me she thought she'd given birth to a monster. I cried for so long, I don't even remember the length of time. I never told anyone, because I feared so much that she might be right. It hurt me more than anything -- I love my mother, and I would do anything to help her get better, since it is apparent to me that she is not psychologically well. She's not at all a bad person, but there's something wrong, and I know that it's not her fault. She has only hit me once, when I defended my father's second wife for some petty action that I no longer remember the full story behind. To this day, she will not admit doing it. It didn't leave a noticeable mark, but I remember it as clear as anything. Her verbal abuse, however, was non-stop, and her emotions are entirely unpredictable.

I began to engage in self-harm when I was 12, in the form of skin cutting. This became threatening only once, at which point I was hospitalized overnight. I was only recently able to stop this behavior. I suffer from EDNOS (specifically, a combination of orthorexia and purging disorder. I am in therapy for this right now.) I started purging at around 16. My eating disorder is not the fault of any one person, and while I take full responsibility for my own actions, I find that my symptoms get much worse when I'm spending time at home with my mother. Right now, I'm living at home for the first time in 4 years -- I'm here for 2 months before moving across the country.

I haven't lived at home since I was 17 years old -- I moved away to college before turning 18, and since that time, have worked and gotten internships to the point where I could live alone or with friends in different cities over the summer. My father paid fully for my college, including housing expenses.

Here, I guess, is the big[gest] problem: last fall, my mother was diagnosed with Stage III (metastasized to lymph nodes) neuroendocrine cancer. At the time of her treatment, she told me not to come home from college, and to try my best to finish school. While I appreciate her desire to keep me in school during her treatment, I became severely depressed: our relationship had always been awful, and now, I'm faced with my mother's fairly imminent mortality.  

**My question, I suppose, is this: I love my mother, in some strange way, and I am spending the summer with her because I want her to know I care for her deeply and will always be there for her should the need arise. However, her BPD makes it nearly impossible for us to coexist peacefully. She's hurt me so much and caused me so much psychological damage that I find it hard to care for her unconditionally -- even though I know she's very sick, every time I tend to her at her bedside, I feel as though I'm doing a good deed that is undeserved. I've been in therapy since I was around 10 years old to learn techniques to deal with her up-and-down, irrational, unpredictable emotions, but nothing works for us. We've been in both together and separately, and there is nothing that has helped at all.** 

I want her to know that I love her so much, and that when I found out she was sick I had the worst few months of my life. Even though she's hurt me, she's my mom -- she lives alone, doesn't work, and is now fighting for her life. It's a lot to deal with.

My love for her aside, her BPD is hurting me quite actively, and has hurt me immensely while I was growing up. I'm moving across the country in a month, which has already been decided (I have a job offer there), and I just want to show my mom that I care for her before I leave. I'm sure that a lot of you know how difficult it is to grow up with a BPD parent, and I'd love to hear some input from others who have been through similar situations.

Thanks, and I look forward to hearing from you.

**TL;DR: Grew up alone with a BPD-suffering mother. She hurt me a lot as a child, and our relationship is very strained. Found out a year ago that she has stage III cancer -- looking for advice, how do I proceed from here?**"

vdbjk,1,2012-06-21,C# for web development vs C# for game development,[deleted],csharp,https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/vdbjk/c_for_web_development_vs_c_for_game_development/,"Hey,

I'm a relatively inexperienced web developer (if you can call it that - just got my first real internship, still in college). I currently do most work in PHP, but Im thinking of picking up C#. Reason being: I'm interested in getting into game development, while simultaneously expanding my webdev knowledge, and I hear C# is pretty good at both of these.


My question is this: How simultaneous can this really be? How much overlap is there between using C# to do back-end web dev and using it do do game dev (XNA)? Is it just the basic syntax in common while using drastically different ends of the language, or will I be able to make some semblance of progress in both directions at once by learning a sizable overlapping chunk? 


I realize libraries/frameworks are probably specialized, so I'm kind of guessing the former, but the bottom line is: **Is there enough overlap between the two to make learning C# worth it for the sole reason of said overlap? If not, are there any other languages you could recommend for this?**

I don't have much experience in practical non-web programming or multi-purpose languages, so forgive me if this is a silly question. It made sense in my head. Thanks in advance for any answers."

Here are the recent events, sorry for the TL;DR version of 40 Million others.

So in struggling for gainful employment after my Slavery (you-pay internship) to a U.S. Senator I got a contract gig with a large east coast med school. I was doing field research and was told that as soon as it was done, 2 weeks later I was going to get paid. I had my feeble tax return as a decent nest egg until I get compensation.  I am no stranger to contract work. So I figured it would all be par-the course.

Obviously it wasn't. So because most of us live/work in the boonies, they doubted the mileage. It was kind of high. They had to double check EVERYONES. My immediate supervisor had to send Google Maps to verify the distances. Apparently that was the massive SNAFU. The city slickers didn't budget or realize that not all of us are cheating the system. 

I was a model employee and because I had all that free time on my hands I could do my field work M-F. I was done in record time so that I could be paid sooner, which was encouraged. I started this in March, finished in April so that I could get paid by Cinco de Mayo. (Which is dad's birthday). Check doesn't come. I'm in the mail box every day for 3 weeks. Send some emails. Hear that it'll be a month after invoice. May 15th comes and goes and I'm late on bills. I'm living with my folks and they aren't getting rent. My taxes evaporated in my gas tank and oil changes for this gig I was never compensated for, as well as other un-suspected obligations. I start tearing hell. I email every other contractor I worked with. (Through CC's from my boss we weren't supposed to compromise the study through fraternization etc). I hear from all of them that:

1.  My trainer was paid 2 weeks late

2.  No one else in my study was paid as of late May

3.  Regardless of when I sent mine in they all were shipped to accounting on May 15th. Roughly a month after I was told I was going to get my check FROM accounting.

I call again today after continuing to look for a new job all day. I called accounts payable a few days ago to no avail. I get an email from the admin head that checks ""will be cut June 12th"" Not even a returned phone call. They were nice enough to tell me about the mileage snafu on the phone today and that we should have those checks cut on Friday. I'm holding my breath.

Also I have a wedding to go to, out of state, that I'm renting a tux for. Brides' family could have afforded it, she has a wealthy dad. But that's apparently an antiquated expectation.

Honestly if it wasn't for the loving, baking, charming +1 I'm bringing to the wedding I might be on a different, more grim subreddit.

Please cheer me up strangers. God Damn do I need to feel better."

Some context: I intern at a place that is predominantly women and there are a few who I talk to who I am attracted to. There isn't much room for flirting or any kind of physical interaction. How do I convey interest without being too forward?

vd5mj,2,2012-06-20,Holy. Crap. This is difficult.,[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/vd5mj/holy_crap_this_is_difficult/,"**Don't bother reading this unless you want to understand why another fapper wants to stop**

I began my first deliberate period of abstinence from fapping today.

Dear lord...

Previously, abstinence occurred as a de facto, and as a result, was easy:

- If I got a new roommate in college, I would go one or several weeks without fapping (then I learned how to do so quietly and covertly)

- If I stay overnight at a party or friend's house I avoid fapping

- When I was camping, I avoided fapping

- I had to have a circumcision 2 years ago, and I wasn't able to fap for 2 weeks. Despite me being a reasonable way away from being healed, I  got powerful involuntary erections (and painful) and satisfied myself very carefully. 

***

Normally I will fap 2-3 times a day - even at work sometimes. I became intrigued in /r/nofap when Evervigilant posted how he abstained from porn/fapping and it improved his life. I also read more and more into the alleged benefits.

There really is no harm in trying this out. 

It's funny how quickly my eyes opened. Like many addicts, I existed in denial - Masturbation is natural and normal, and I could do it as much as I wanted, provided it didn't affect others. 

Maybe that's not the case. 

I was struck by a recent memory that probably is the biggest indicator of my problem: 

My ex girlfriend and I were lying in bed. She was on the pill and spotting for 3 weeks, so we weren't having sex at that point (we did prior). 

I really wanted SOMETHING, and she felt very blah. I played with myself quietly (I'm a quiet masturbator, and quiet when I'm receiving oral/having sex). I came and she looked over and was super surprised. 

Not until months later (today) did it occur to me how truly fucked up that was. I could have waited, pushed harder for her to give me an hj/bj, or just kissed her and jumped in the shower. 

***

Finally, I realized that all my high points in life were accompanied by not masturbating:

- When I had my circumcision, I also scheduled a job interview for a great internship for later that week. 4 days after the surgery was the interview, and I was in great pain. I was also about 5 days abstinent. (I was hired, the interview went awesome)

- When I got my job (out of my internship over a year later), my interviews occurred at a time when I had guests at the house, so I abstained for about a week. 

- Whenever I land a girl, it's always occurred at a time where I wasn't masturbating. My ex gf of 5 years started with this, and I was very careful not to fantasize about her or anyone else for some time. Grades improved too. My most recent ex (lol who dumped me), began very similarly.

- My grades would be AMAZING at the beginning of any school year (new roommates). When I moved into a house with my own bedroom, this effect did not occur. 

So 24 hours is over, and it's tough. I know it gets easier with time, and I know that the clarity and testosterone boost will come eventually. This is a great challenge I'm hoping to complete. "

This lead to the idea: what if every young person taking on an internship were to all at the same time demand to be paid at least minimum wage for their labor or they all effectively go on strike (quit/what-have-you).

Obviously the risks for doing so would be great, but if a genuine coordinated effort were to be made and all/most free labor was eliminated simultaneously, we might just be able to send a message that the young people of the world are no longer going to be pushed around and extorted. That we have food to buy, bills to pay, and basic needs to be fulfilled, and that something needs to be done about this pitiful job market.

So let's hammer this out, get some discussions going, see if this is even viable. Why is this the best or worst idea you've ever heard?"

What I understood is that if you graduate in 2014, you should be looking at the internship in the summer of 2013 (I think). I'd be graduating with 120 credits, and the other 30 credits will be accounted from a MS in taxation. **I am pretty much asking for the transition between the internship and being a full time employee and how does graduate school come into play..**"

The dates are through July 1 to Sept 8, but we're flexible on these dates. If you need the place for a portion of this time, just let me know, we can work something out. We're located close to UCSD, so its super close to the bus/shuttle stops to take you to school or anywhere. So this place would be ideal for any UCSD students, but its open for anyone who needs temporary housing. 

A little bit about us: one student going to summer school at UCSD, one doing an internship, and another that works from home. We're all easygoing, relatively quiet, and pretty chill and if you like board games, this is a plus :)
 
Send me a message if you're interested! I'd rather let a redditor have the place then deal with any more Craigslist scammers. God there's so many. And they're not even clever about disguising their spammy messages. Anyways, thanks!"

My therapist is a really understanding person, and I felt really comfortable talking to him. He allowed me to choose which pronouns I prefer to be identified by, and what name I'd prefer to go by. At the moment, I'm choosing to go by male pronouns/names because I'm not presenting as female, but I let him understand that I will change that when I start presenting as female.

He agreed that I'm transgender, which is incredibly uplifting to me because it took a lot to accept it myself.

He even told me that he was impressed by my perspective on life, and that I'm incredibly mature for my age. He also told me that he thinks it's amazing that I summoned the courage to educate myself, and come out as transgender, and make the steps to transition.

He's an LPC intern still, and he started counseling in January of this year, and I definitely think he's great at what he does. Very professional, and made me feel comfortable talking about personal things even during the first session.

It was also explained to me that he will write me my letter to start HRT after two or three sessions, just to cover all the ""basics"", I guess. All in all, everything went better than I figured it would, and I'm extremely happy about everything."

I don't really do the whole ask the internet for help thing but I need some advice/help from people who are more experienced and I don't know where to turn. So here is my story. 

A few weeks ago I got an offer to fly to a state I have never been in before to go work as a sort of intern for a corporation in the northeastern US. At that time I had never flown by my self before nor had I been out of my state often or by my self. It was only supposed to last 2 weeks but they wanted me to come back for another 2(I am in my 3rd week here now) and after I fly back home next week, I will have to drive back up and continue working for a longer period of time. My problem is I have only lived in one state for my whole life and I have no idea about relocation or anything. I am getting help but things are moving abnormally fast(this was admitted to me by some one high up). I do not have a relocation package and I need to find a place to stay within a week. So I guess what I am asking is if anyone could point me in the right direction of housing in the area of Pittsburgh? On another note I would like to ask anyone who has corporate experience to offer insight as to how large corporations work and/or provide stories of experiences with those types of companies. I am not stupid I know its all politics, its not new to me, it is just my first time working for corporate America.

**tl;dr: working for corporation. Need to find housing in Pittsburgh. Also stories of what life is like in corporate America are welcome/encouraged.**

I didn't want to provide too much information just in case the powers that be have eyes here. Feel free to ask me anything, but don't expect it to get too specific."
vcvjc,1,2012-06-20,[REQ] $250 + Int. for Bus to California (Ohio to California),sarahchii,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/vcvjc/req_250_int_for_bus_to_california_ohio_to/,"Hey there fellow redditors. I basically stumbled into this subreddit after random subreddit hopping. I've been trying to plan an escape for a while now, ever since ever really.

I want to move to California from Toledo, Ohio. There are numerous reasons for this, but it basically comes down to LBGT rights and the people here.

I used to do web design at professional companies here, pre-transition. Post-transition i'm finding it harder and harder to find jobs. I now freelance, since brick and mortor house jobs won't even consider me, citing ""lack of experience"", even though I've worked for clients such as Best Buy, Masco (KraftMaid brand specifically), and I have close to 200 full sites in my portfolio as a web designer for 8 years. ಠ_ಠ.

Recently as well, my freelance work has been challenged, and I find myself getting fewer and fewer contracts. I know the reasoning, the only proof I have is the one client who told me to ""Not come into his office in drag, since the interns might find it offensive"". I didn't go back to that office, and have been in state of depression since.

My plan is to move to California, San Francisco specifically, and continue to freelance in a more accepting community. San Francisco is also alot better for me as well since I cannot drive currently due to medical reasons. San Fran has a very nice transit system, while Toledo not so much. Especially while trying to get to suburbs. Just as well, LBGT support there is very cool and more abundant/prominent than in this area. To sum it up: They have more Web/Tech opportunities, LBGT support that isn't hidden from public, and transit to help me get to A - B.

I'm asking for $250 for the cost of a Greyhound ticket and a bit of food to get to San Francisco, Cali. This is to be paid back, with interest at a rate to be agreed upon. The length of the loan is 2 Weeks, although I'd like to ask for a month in case my first week or two doesn't pan out entirely to plan. I don't really deal with paypal, however I'm hoping we can work out something that is easily available (GCheckout, Greendot, flat out buying the ticket), trackable and comes with a receipt.

Even if you cannot loan all or any of the requested amount, thats okay. Thanks for looking, and just be kind to someone today.

TL;DR - Suffering transwoman seeks refuge in California. Needs $250 for food and ticket. Will pay back in 2 - 4 weeks tops. 
(X-Posting from /r/Loans, as I'm not entirely sure if the vauge 2-4 week payment time is too close to breaking the rules.)"

I'm going to brisk through some information about it:

*for ages 18-24
*They pay you to go to school with them (Financial Ops or Info-technology)
*18 college credits upon completion
* 6 months of paid IT or FinOps training, then 6 months of a paid internship (with a raise for the intern) related to what you want to do
*Training in business communications and writing
*Super friendly environment with a staff you could consider family
*Guest speakers ranging from successful businessmen/women (CEOs, entrepreneurs and such)
*They provide you with mentors that go through a thorough interview process and match you up with someone who may have more things in common with you


Year Up has HUNDREDS of partnerships. Ranging from Google, Cocoa cola, Fidelity, Bank Of America, State Street...the list is so huge, I can't even think of more than that!


The best part about the program, is that they TAKE YOU TO MEET THE RIGHT PEOPLE! I've gotten such incredible advice from those who are doing the things I wish to do (at first I wanted to be a network engineer, but now I'm working my way towards software developer, which, I totally suck at right now)


You establish relationships with people who KNOW people, and from there you expand on your network until you're exactly where you want to be. No fear if you're a SAP, you will learn how to interact in professional environments after this experience!


Unfortunately, Year Up isn't available everywhere.


Here is the site: http://yearup.org/

They are only in:
Atlanta
Baltimore Community College Pilot
Boston
Chicago
National Capital Region (DC)
New York City
Providence
Puget Sound/Seattle
San Francisco Bay Area


But this program has been doing nothing but growing for the past years. Whatever your goals are, whether it's to go back to school or get yourself into the loop, they will help you get there!


Ask me any questions, I'm more than certain I didn't cover many things!

vcu6l,2,2012-06-20,"Been hitting the gym hard for a month. Started 188lbs, current 188lbs. Same gut, no visible difference. Why?",[deleted],Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/vcu6l/been_hitting_the_gym_hard_for_a_month_started/,"So, since I started my internship in NYC a month ago, I've been going to the gym everyday (minus Sunday). For the first two weeks I just did strength training, upper body one day, lower the next. These last two I've started with a run (1.5 mile last week, bumped up to 2 this week). The workouts generally last about 90 minutes of both free weights and the various machines. My eating habits have been roughly the same as always, roughly 400 calorie breakfast, 1000ish calorie lunch, and smaller dinner. I've gone out for drinks maybe 5 nights this month, never having more than about 4 Jack and Cokes.

What I'm wondering is, why am I not getting any results to speak of, and what can I do to improve my workouts so that my effort bears fruit?

Edit - Just for clarification, this is my general routine copied from a reply below

Morning: I generally just grab one of those 99 cent cinnamon rolls from the little shop in the subway station on the way to work. Those are, if I remember correctly, 410 calories of what I'm assuming is unhealthiness.

Mid day: Most days I go to the nearest cafe and get a plate of brown rice with chicken, and some garlic potatoes on the side. I almost never drink soda (unless its with alcohol, but that's a whole different story, and not something I do very often either), so it's either tea or orange juice with that.

Dinner is usually just a sub style sandwich or something very simple like that.

Work Outs: I always start out with a run, two miles currently, bumping up to 2.5 starting Saturday. On upper body days I start with bench presses, usually 185 on the bar, 4 sets of 8, then a burnout set. Then incline dumbbell press, pyramid 50-70lbs sets of 8. Next are tricep extensions. Been using a 50lb dumbbell, 4 sets of 8, then using the machine, I do cable over-head extensions, 90lbs, sets of 8 til I burn out. Again, sets of 8 on lat pulldowns of 120lbs, and I end with barrel hugs (gotta be the wrong name, but [this](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/xMlfiZJtwlo/0.jpg) is the machine) same drill, sets of 8 til I burn out, 110lbs.

Lower body I don't do so much on because I walk so much in the city, and the gym here in my building only has two leg machines, neither of which is a squat rack. Anyways, I've been doing leg presses at 450lbs in sets of 8 in the same kinda burn out routine. Then leg curls at 120lbs the same way. 

This is the first that I've ever really ""worked out"", but I've always been naturally big and my previous jobs didn't hurt any. (laying floor, church maintenance which you'd be very surprised at how much lifting that involved, and at a Winn Dixie warehouse)

I got a 3.5 unweighted GPA sophomore year of HS (two honors classes) and a 3.9 unweighted GPA junior year (5 on AP physics c electricity mag, 4 on AP physics mech, 5 in AP compsci, 5 in AP calc bc). 2150 SAT, 800 math II, 760 Physics. Extracurriculars were cross country and competitive pokemon TCG. I applied under the computer science major (which was probably not a smart move) and got rejected.

So yeah, I'm going to either davis or santa barbara for computer science.

A couple of things that I *already* have going for me is that I got an internship at a Silicon Valley startup literally a few weeks after I submitted my UC Application, been working there for 6 months. I get paid $20/hr but I might get a raise to $30 soon. The startup is doing really well and is expanding very quickly. When I started we had 11 employees, now we have 60.

Now, my mother is not a bad person, not at all, she fought for me all my life. She ran away from my insane abusive father when I was a baby, and ended up homeless. Then her cancer returned, yet by herself she managed to juggle radiotherapy and caring for me. She really sacrificed alot.

However, I've always paid the price, we have no family or friends, I put up with her guilt trips, her caring needs, her hatred of me having ""middle class aspirations"", going to uni, wanting to do well for myself, wanting to live at home, not wanting to live at home, it goes on.

OKAY HERE'S WHERE I NEED ADVICE - My uni offered me to apply for a paid internship which would be invaluable to me, not to mention paid, as me and my mum struggle financially, this would allow me to do it.

This sent her, in short insane and abusive. She's been drinking very heavily of recent and this was tipping point. She has decided that if I take this one month internship away from her she's downsizing to one bedroom place because I clearly don't need her anymore.

If I mention friends she says I value them over her and I should live with them.  She screams down the phone day and night, destroys my things, demanding all the money I have from me and seems to take pleasure from throwing me on the street and telling me I'm awful as I try and look after her.

My question is, what do I do? I have no savings, she has drained me dry for bills. I abide by her rules, but I have no real life or prospects as I am expected to stay here forever and care.

If I stay here, I may be kicked onto the streets anyway, and that would mean I couldn't continue my education (which she says I should experience because she never did) and there are no jobs even to take as an alternative.

I feel awful asking, but I feel sheltered, hopeless, scared and unprepared for ending up on the street because of her issues."

I am part of a team giving a professional development class series for interns at my office to help them improve their public speaking. We use PowerPoint to deliver educational material during the presentations (students will later give short presentations based on the lessons, where they put the ideas into practice). I am frequently asked by the students to email them the slides when the presentation is over. 

I have posited the notion to other stakeholders on my team that I/we announce to the classes that slides will *not* be emailed out to the group. It is my feeling that this will encourage future class sessions to copy down important information and really focus on what we are trying to teach them instead of just sitting there like lumps and then counting on us to send them the complete slide set later. 

My argument to the rest of my team was that the physical act of writing helps people remember things, but I can't find a scholarly work to support this. 

I would also argue that telling the students that they will not have the ""safety net"" of the slides will force them to:
1. focus on the material
2. take succinct, precise, high-value notes
3. ask active, involved, considered questions during class
4. ask follow-up questions via an email alias constructed for the class
5. work together outside class to fill in knowledge gaps

Now, while I fully acknowledge that there are MANY different learning styles, I still feel that just giving the slides away at the end of class just smacks of ""giving up,"" if that makes any sense. I'm wondering how we can create a more powerful classroom experience that will make students less likely to want the slides when the class is over.

Can someone with relevant background please shed some light on this issue? (scholarly works much appreciated, my clumsy Google searches haven't been fruitful)"

I'm a rising junior double majoring in Math and Physics at a semitarget(? Middlebury College, we get people from Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Morgan Stanely, BofA, etc. each year, used to send a lot of people to Lehman). I'm interested in doing Ibanking or Sales/Trading when I graduate, I'm looking for some advice as to what I should do.

Currently have a 3.4 GPA, which I realize is a bit low for bulge brackets since they look for 3.5+. Most of my finance experience is from the Student Investment Committee at school, where we manage 300k of the school's money. I'm the tech industry leader so I run pitches and meetings anytime we deal with tech stocks, and I also do some quant stuff with the Quantitative Finance subgroup where we use mathematica to do some modeling/valuation.

Currently this summer I'm working in the wealth management arm of a boutique investment bank. I was choosing between this one or a few different IBs in China that specializes in IPOs for emerging chinese companies. I ended up choosing this local bank because it was paid (whereas the China one had expensive travel costs and was unpaid) and my chinese is probably not business proficient and I wasn't sure if they did a lot of english (there was a BofA branch that might have been more english friendly). Unfortunately, the work isn't as in-depth or educational as I hoped. I do some market/equity research but also a lot of cold calling/finding prospective clients. I get some exposure to Ibanking by sitting in on meetings/conf calls but I don't get to work on any deals.

I'm probably going to work this internship a couple more weeks, ending late July or early August at the latest, and plan to do a lot of studying/networking. I ordered a bunch of books on Ibanking (Rosenbaum and Pearl, some modeling books), and plan on doing some kind of xcel/modeling course. I'm currently collecting a large contact list of Midd alums who work in finance and get to know them, ask questions, etc. Been reading mergers and inquisitions and wall street oasis a lot as well.

So any general advice that you all could offer? In particular, any specific program you'd recommend? Currently looking at 

the Breaking Into Wall Street Premium [pack](http://breakingintowallstreet.com/biws/breaking-into-wall-street-courses/) and the 
wall street prep [premium package](http://www.wallstreetprep.com/programs/self_study/premium_package.php)

Anyone have insight in these?

Also xcel 2003 vs 2007; which one is better to learn? 

Thanks!

I'm in need of some advice or suggestions.,DarkEpsilon,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vg2cz/im_a_senior_in_college_and_i_still_have_no_idea/,"Hi reddit. As the titles says I am a senior in college at SUNY Cortland, and I have no idea what I want to do professionally after school. As a bit of background information, I started as a Physics / Mechanical Engineer dual major at Cortland, but the workload was much more than I have anticipated after just coming out of high school. Needless to say it didn't work in my favor and I changed majors to Sociology with a minor in Computer Science. It was a difficult decision for me, and a very drastic change from physics. I really do enjoy learning about Sociology, but have no idea what I could do with it after school. I am currently floating on a 3.4 GPA in the sociology major, but from poor grades from some physics it looks to be much lower. I am going to spend next summer at school to retake the courses that need improvement to help myself if I decide to go to graduate school. 

I have thought long and hard about what I want to do, and still have come up with nothing. I have no idea what I think is best for me, or what interests me enough to pursue. 

At school I have taken a few courses in Computer Science to see if that can take me somewhere, because I know that it does interest me a lot, but I fear for job security. I have taken a visual basic course, and html 4 course and really enjoyed them, but it took me a long time to get used to a different type of thinking. In one of my sociology classes I had to create my own study about consumerism which was fun, but I don't think being a researcher is something that interests me enough. 

My father is a homicide detective in Manhattan, and knows a good deal of people and has good connections with them. I have thought about becoming a detective before but am still unsure about it. If I did follow through on it, I would be able to start off better then others in whatever precinct I would want to be in. My father also works construction as a second job whenever hes off, and I have been working for him since I was around the age of 12. I work for him every summer and it is how I make my money at the moment, and help pay for school. 

I have also thought about law school for myself, and think I would like it, but at the same time I know nothing of law and feel that I am in no way prepared to get into any schools without any prier knowledge. Again, my father has told me about his childhood friend who is now a very powerful lawyer who is willing to give me advice and maybe even some kind of internship over the summer. I have no idea what I would have to do, or if he would be willing to allow it so I haven't gone through on that either.

As you can see I have no clue of what is going on around me, and no idea what I want to do. I'm asking you, /r/AskReddit, for any advice or suggestions that could in any way benefit me in my situation. I'll try my best to answer any questions you have.

tl;dr: Have no idea what I want to do with myself after school. Sociology major with minor in computer science. Father has connections in police department, and with a lawyer friend. Law school possibility? Need advice."

I already looked around quite a bit for things to do outside of work, (such as http://www.latimes.com/features/la-100-days-of-summer-20120525,0,2347702.htmlstory), but well. What are just some general tips you can give to an alien like I am? (Such as... I don't know. Don't ever fill your car at a served filling station... Or... I have no idea, haha).

Thanks, loves!

My boyfriend (of 3 months) just moved 3 hours away for a summer internship. I started hanging out with my one of my friends again, even though she had been cold to me in the past few months. Boyfriend does not like her or her reckless behavior and thinks that she is a bad influence on me and our relationship. We kept fighting about this over the phone almost every night and I'm left crying each time. Then in the morning, he apologizes for overreacting. 

He is basically asking me to choose my friend or him. She has been my best friend for over a year but we had a nasty fallout this year. Normally, this is alarming because this is not something he should be asking. Yet his reasoning sounds right, that she is not trustworthy and is a reckless fairweather friend. They used to be friends, but he has cut her out of his life and does not want any association with her. He hates the idea of me hanging out with her and thinks that she is manipulative. He calls me a tool whenever I hang out with her.

I have asked my best friends for advice because I don't trust myself anymore. I might be too blinded by him to see the truth. Last night, I learned that even before this week's ordeal, my friends do not like him. They say that he has this tone of voice where it's like ""you need to listen to me because I know more than you"". And the worst part is that they hate the way he talks to me; they see him as being disrespectful and demanding. They have been holding back because each time, I would tell them of how happy I am with him.

Boyfriend is coming back tonight. I absolutely love him but this is starting to drain me. Everything felt alright until this week when he moved away. I think he's freaking out over the LDR and he overreacts at everything. Yet it's very concerning that my friends do not like him.

I really want to make this relationship work, but I don't know how. I don't think he's aware of his behavior. How should I talk to him tonight? Should we talk a break or should we just break up? 

TL;DR Boyfriend is overreacting due to LDR this week and wants me to stop hanging with a bad friend or else we will break up. I recently learn that all of my friends dislike my boyfriend, even prior to LDR. How do I mend my relationship? Or should I take a break? Break up? I really think he's the one, but I may be blinded."

Something like [this](http://talentegg.ca/employer/rexall-pharma-plus/jobs/pos-technical-helpdesk-representative-1/), with my strong technical background and tech support work I would say that I'm definitely qualified for such a job, it would be pretty easy.

I've had a few interviews but I can't get any of these jobs because:

* I'm not bilingual (Many jobs in Ontario require you to speak French)

* **I don't have a university degree.** I went to uni for two years for international studies, it was very theoretical and not what I thought it would be, I hated it and left to pursue something I was more interested in (IT work)

* I've done technical work, a lot of stuff, at my current job in retail. My 'relevant job history' has two positions, my job which focuses on customer service (2005-present) and I added a newer position for technical support (2008-present) so that I could play up my technical work but many of the people I've talked to don't seem to be interested because I don't have dedicated **work experience**

So I have no idea what to do. I've played up my technical experience, I have an IT certification and I'm working on two more.

I've been applying to jobs since December with only a few dead-end interviews and have had several recruiters contact me and fail to find me any work.

I can't get an intern job to get experience because I'm not enrolled in a degree program.

I can't enrol in a degree program because I still owe OSAP money for my first failed time at university and I can't repay that because my job offers such low pay even if I could repay it I could never afford to go back to school for 4 years.

I'm at an utter loss for words as to what I should do."

I want to work as hard as I can while I'm here. Researching just sucks as I have a lot of story ideas and things I want to do. I want to help them as much as possible, yet sitting around ""researching"" makes me feel useless and unneeded. 

The office culture is something I'm not used to. I'm intimidated. Everyone has tattoos and basically the only thing that's a common denominator between us, is the love of the material.

I feel awkward, because the staff was never formally introduced to me and I (along with the other intern) sit away from everyone. Whenever I want to talk to them, I feel embarrassed and in the way. They are nice to me, but I feel it's out of pity (I'm not being paid) instead of desire.

I know a lot of people are in a much worse situation than I am in, but I just feel like I needed to get this off my chest.

-----

I'm a third-year Mechanical Engineering student at a Canadian university and for the past year, I've desperately tried to get an internship. Most people around me were doing it purely for the experience, but I've needed to pay down my loans as soon as possible (I would be graduating with 38 grand in debt - single mother family with 2 daughters), learn the professional engineering world all while getting anything useful on my resume. Most of the people I know who graduated this year are still trying to find jobs and almost all of them moved back in with their parents (essentially scaring the shit out of me since I have family problems and scared to hell about loan repayments).


I sacrificed my free time and a lot of my school time to prepare applications and getting ready for interviews. I even invested myself to the point that I delayed planning housing with my friends. I almost got one, but I lost it because I didn't have a full driver's license. Why? Because myself nor my family could ever afford Driver's Ed for practice and my mother didn't lend me her car because it was critical for her work to feed us. That and the fact that my estranged father was in more accidents than I have fingers led to me pushing it off until this year. So I lost essentially the dream internship I wanted and it started the downward path to depression.

-


40+ applications later, I have nothing to show for it. As a result, my GPA went down significantly to the point that I almost lost my scholarship (engineering degrees are insanely expensive), I'm living as a sublet in my friend's house with no clue as to where I'm living for the new school year. I've had over 10 interviews yet for some reason I can't get anything. Interviewers won't give me feedback and careers counselling services tell me I'm strong as an interviewee so I have no fucking clue as to what's happening. Additionally, I've had 3 mock interviews to prepare. I can't confide in people because one friend got one after his second interview, and all my other friends either had 1 or no interviews at all so they tell me to stop complaining (""*at least you got interviews*"") and have since moved on. Interviews don't mean anything unless you get something. 


My friend with an internship then rubs it in my face whenever she gets the chance because she's a bit of a cunt, talking about all her friends up in Alberta got one too without even trying (""YOU SHOULD MOVE TO ALBERTA TO FIND ONE EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE BROKE"").  I have no real prior work experience due to my Chinese family's study-no-time-for-work policy in high school and the job market souring in university (especially in this shitty uni town).


I've exhausted my school's career counselling help to the point where I almost broke down during a meeting with a career counsellor. In one meeting, the lady basically drew a chart showing Baby Boomers and my generation saying ""You won't get anything until 2-3 years from now"". I graduate in a year, what the fuck. In others, they just told me to keep trying (no other advice) despite me telling them my current situation.


The worst part is that I could have fully avoided this by getting a license but I was too stupid trying to get over own problems and became complacent in not getting one until now. I feel like a fucking failure in every aspect. I gained considerable weight because I was too depressed to exercise, started to drink to cope with finishing another application (I've since stopped because I realized it wasn't helping + I'm broke). Sometimes I could barely get out of bed and other times, I've stayed until for 3 days straight trying to even start another job application but I feel vomiting when I do. I get more depressed than I should be when companies don't even bother sending me a rejection letter (I'm left hanging with hope only to be crushed as the weeks go by).


At this point, I've been trying to get any job and have been handing out resumes around the town since the beginning of May with no success. My boyfriend got a summer job after looking for two weeks and now I feel even more worthless since he goes off to his job and come back while I sit at home all day being broke and doing nothing. I'm dreading the new school year since I'm **going to be doing the exact same thing all over again for a post-grad job**.


I fucking hate my life right now, yet I'm still applying to the slim pickings that are still available. I fucking hate this so much, just so fucking much.

What made me think about this is the comments on this /r/programming topic: http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/ve31x/so_you_dropped_out_of_college_after_gaining_some/

The way the top comments talk down on education was a little surprising to me, as if it would be better for me to drop out now and get experience than to finish college. I mean, I am working as a programmer this summer and fully plan to shoot for a good internship next summer, which it seems my school would facilitate. As for background, I was really more of a math geek in high school who decided to learn Java 2 weeks before university, and so far I love the courses and have done well in what are usually considered the ""weeder"" courses, so I'm pretty sure graduating with a good GPA is feasible, if this matters in your advice. 

After going to university for a year and developing this summer for almost a month so far, I feel like I know infinitely more than I did a year ago, and can't really imagine understanding the theoretical basis of what I'm doing as well from self-study (I'd have neither the resources nor the motivation), and I can't imagine having as many big-name companies looking for internships in one room at one time in my hometown.

I'm sorry if this post sounds somewhat gloatful, since that honestly wasn't the purpose. I just want to put down all the reasons I feel like getting this education would be useful as long as I'm not putting a ridiculous financial burden on myself. However, many members of this website would imply just the opposite, and I'm curious to see what points I'm probably ignoring here. After all, I do come from a culture that puts a lot of value on education, so my opinions are likely quite biased.

What gives you the right to say something like that?

**Him-**
It's simple really, I sent you a
Lovely message u dismissed it
Therefore arrogant

**Me-**
Does my profile say ""I'm really not looking for intelligent conversation here. Just write me and compliment me, that's a great conversation starter""

What the fuck do you expect me to say to that?

That's not how you begin a conversation and if it is, as I expect it just may be, learn some new tricks old man because you won't be getting people like myself's attention except to throw your backlash back in your face.

**Me-**
A lovely message?! Who's arrogant now? Haha. That's funny that you think that your message to me was lovely.

Here's an example of a ""lovely message.""
I just googled it, and it wasn't actually all that hard to dig up.

""Some people have nice eyes, Some have nice smiles &amp; others have nice faces.. But You have all of them with a nice HEART…""

If you're going to attack someone be intelligent about it.

**Him-**
I am very intelligent and I don't need to google words that I don't understand!

**Me-**
Apparently you must not be, sir. For, you missed the point of my retort, which was to demonstrate to you that don't assume or even suggest that you sent a lovely message, when even I , who did not wish to compliment you, found a lovelier message than yours in 10 seconds using google.

If I did in fact wanted to send you a ""lovely"" message it wouldn't be a one liner that consisted of nothing but an empty compliment. Have a great evening, and go talk to someone who cares about your opinions.

**Him-**
Ps I never opened the starting conversation in an incorrect manner, I passed a very beautiful comment, which intern you have taken as an insult.... Sorry but how thick are you

You have no depth and are a retard, pleasedo get lessons as it will help your stupity ;)

**Me-**
Who's the more ""retarded"" one here?  The 22 year-old who just effectively rendered a 50 year-old man's  argument invalid and asinine or the 50 year-old man who:
A- thinks ""you are stunning"" is a ""beautiful message""
B- cannot spell ""stupidity"" correctly
And
C- uses emoticons to try and stay ""hip"" I'm sure"

vexts,0,2012-06-21,"I am concerned there was a major threat detected from the Somali terrorist group and AL-Queda affiliate, AL-Shabab, around Nov. 2011 that has been kept under wraps by the intelligence community.",Pragmatic_Politics,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/vexts/i_am_concerned_there_was_a_major_threat_detected/,"Hi reddit:
I intern for an elected official in Minnesota, and I work on immigration/visa work. In Minnesota, we have a substantial Somali community that formed in the wake of the failure of the Somali state.

It often very difficult for a stateside immigrant to bring a spouse over from another country on an I-130 marriage visa. It is the obligation of the applicant to satisfy a number of criteria to verify the relationship. There are many common reasons people are denied; they cannot demonstrate the veracity of their marriage, DNA tests are not satisfactory, among others. While this is a challenge, these challenges are shared by immigrants the world over.

In Nov/Dec 2011 a new reason for denial was reported to applicants. The new reason was 'Identity,' and we had never seen this before. Previously, Somali immigrants were allowed to use U.N high commission on refugees identification to verify their identity. The prime demographic of those denied the visa are young Somali men. 

This is speculative; but it may be the case that some intelligence came though that Al-Shabab was planning on sending Somali immigrants to the U.S., for some purpose the U.S. State department deemed a threat to National Security.

I don't know what I hope to accomplish in this post, but I have seen the humanitarian effect of this new denial. It prevents families from coming together, and honestly it is disheartening. Still, for such a change in policy to occur (albeit unofficial), it follows that there was some specific precipitating event that changed protocol. The new sweeping 'identity' denial is specific to the Somali Community. 

TL;DR: I suspect some threat to national security originating in Somalia is being kept secret in the state department.

This winter, my boyfriend basically seemed to lose interest in sex. We went from having sexual contact every couple of days to having sexual contact every couple of weeks. Right before I went on a two week trip this April, he admitted to me that he was bored with our sex when we did have it. We didn't talk about sex at all when I went on the trip, but when I got back, his libido was right back to normal. We started having sex frequently again, and this lasted for about a month. Then, his libido went right back down again, and our sexual activity got very infrequent. I tried to spice things up and do all kinds of sexy things for him, but I hardly ever got a reaction. When I try to discuss it with him, he gets frustrated and won't discuss it. He's assured me that it's not my fault. He says he doesn't even want to masturbate anymore. He says he doesn't know what the problem is. We've been apart (because I have an internship this summer) for 3 weeks now, and every time I bring up anything sexual he changes the subject immediately. I don't know what's going on. Other aspects of our relationship seem great. This is such a drastic change in him. It used to seem like sex was always on his mind. Does anyone have any ideas as to what the problem might be. Is there anything else I should be doing here?"

1. I'm 23 years old
2. I have a Bachelor's Degree and am halfway to my Masters (though I can really complete it anywhere at this point)
3. I have about $42 K available to me in the bank from saving work wages for five years. (after paying off loans, I would have about 30K.)
4. I currently work in a Retail store, making a REALLY PRETTY DECENT (but not superb) wage.

Here's the problem - like nearly everyone else my age, I'm not getting real internship opportunities to apply to, and my job (and education) are getting me nearly nowhere. I'm tired of living in the four corners region of the US, and want something new. Problem is though, I'm not sure how to figure out what I want (or need, for that matter), and simply up and moving elsewhere I don't think will necessarily fix that for me. 

tl;dr - Need direction, not keen on the military, and want to get the most out of life as an introvert while I still can."

I work 4 days a week, anywhere from 8-12 hours a day grooming dogs.  It's a very physical job.  I have chickens at home, 3 dogs, ferrets, a rabbit and a cat.  Recently the dogs started getting into the chicken eggs outside and have been having diarrhea on the floor.  I'm the one cleaning it up every time I come home.  The house is fairly large and I'm doing the cleaning.  My friend is living here rent free and she will do the dishes but that's basically it.  I feel like crying every night.  My house is covered in carpet and I want to tear it all up and put tile in because it looks absolutely disgusting now.  I feel like everything is a mess.

The first half of the program was a piece of cake, but by the time I got to the second half of the program.. things just started going downhill. I'm not sure if it was how the new professor taught it or if its the material. I got stuck up to the VLAN section (the more complicated side, not the basic/general side). Did my best and passed anyway but with a 'C'.

So now I'm sitting here with my associates degree and I'm thinking of taking the CCNA and CCNP exams to get the certs, but I feel like I didn't really get the second half of the course and that I may need to retake it with a different teacher. Another option for me right now is I can also start applying for an internship or jobs for IT help desks as a start in my career which is a hell of a lot better than working in retail right now and not gain any kind of experience.

But at the same time I feel this degree has no value in today's world and that a bachelors degree would be more sufficient... though I'd probably be around 27-28 by the time I graduate along with having to pay student loans on top. For time I will be using to get a bachelors in CS, I could very well be using it to gain experience on the Networking side as well and not end up wasting any time with a possibility of landing on square one again once I get that bachelors.

So I'm just kind of in a dilemma here. Which field (Networking with an associates degree or Programming with a bachelors degree) would be the best to get into right now and has a better job outlook in the next 10+ years? I want to make a stable income for myself as well ($50K if possible, the more the better).

IIRC, my professor told me IT's need programmers and programmers need IT's in order for this industry to work efficiently."

I heard some of the lead tech guys talking about ""bulk building"" these phones before they decided to give me, the intern, the task. I was curious if anyone has any idea where I can see documentation on how to possibly bulk build these. While I may have to individually do them anyways, it would be really cool to learn how to do the bulk builds in case something like this ever comes my way again.

EDIT: THANKS! You guys made my Monday morning a hell of a lot better. This is far less monotonous than going through every single one of them individually."

vhe0o,1,2012-06-23,Need help with express.js,[deleted],node,https://www.reddit.com/r/node/comments/vhe0o/need_help_with_expressjs/,"After 2 days of banging my head trying to go through express.js guide, I'm coming here because I need some help. I'm doing an internship, and while I applied for a python position, after about a week, I've been told to work on developing an express.js API which interacts with a flask analytics app(which I also have to create).

Only problem is that I've never touched javascript in my life, and I don't see myself becoming an express.js expert in 2 days. I'm kinda panicking.

From what I understand, the API has to respond to the flask app's GET and POST queries, and has to return JSON data. I think I've got the returning JSON part down. Here's a small code that I think is how this is supposed to work: http://ideone.com/iFUCO

The problem is that the JSON is at api.domain.com/me of every user. How can I make it return JSON for every individual user? How could I integrate the flask app with the API? Is there any way I can use the JSON to get total number of active users at any given time? 

I know routes work in express.js, but they also work for flask, so how am I supposed to use them?

I know I could probably do this stuff if I sit down and start learning from scratch, but that'll probably take more than a week or two. I know it's not a lot to go on, and I'm not looking for anyone to solve these problem for me. I just want some help in figuring out how do I go on about this. I have no clue how I'm supposed to complete it. 

Thanks a lot."

After two years of living together, my (ex)boyfriend disappeared for three days. I thought he was dead but instead he came home an said he had spent the weekend at a girls house and we were breaking up. Found out it was his intern of six months along with a shitload of other lies. I wanted to work things out until I came home the next week and found her toothbrush in my sink and her hair clip in my bed. I moved out of the apartment (that my name was still on the lease of) and lived with friends for a month until finding a place.

I did the math, and it's been 8 months and I am still waking up with thoughts of him/her and my forever alone-ness. I've tried everything short of moving across the country to try and feel like my life isn't controlled by these thoughts, but they still come on pretty strong and pretty often. I've even been going out with other people but i just have no connection with any of these other guys. I don't want thoughts of a person who isn't even here to keep messing up my days! 

My question to reddit is, what finally made you feel better? How long did it take to stop feeling the betrayal? Any advice would be much appreciated.

I've just finished up my first wave of actual IT classes that went over network security, java programming, html, and css. I’ve started learning a little c++ on my own and I'll be taking a class on android application development in the fall.  I plan on spending as much free time as I can picking up either php or javascript and getting into more advance concepts in java during the coming semester.  I've been using photoshop for over 8 years and love designing things for organizations at school whenever I can such as flyers, business cards, banners, websites, and whatever they want as far as advertisement goes.
 I've been looking for internships or jobs where I can get some solid experience programming or doing anything really that is computer related. I have spent hours upon hours scanning craigslist, monster, and even physical newspapers o_O looking for jobs in the field and I do not qualify for what seem the most basic of positions.  Everybody wants people with experience, and many of these part time jobs require experience in things that I'm not even sure I will get taught by the time I graduate and thus I have turned to reddit for advice.
I realize that my degree program itself will not teach me everything I need to know to get a decent job right out of college and that I will just have to teach myself the things that are missing. Fortunately I am well acquainted with the methods of online learning and have no problems figuring out where to go to learn what I want. The problem is I don’t know what I need to learn exactly and don’t want to waste time on stuff that won’t really add to my “hire-ability”. I know that a strong foundation in any language will make picking up other languages easier but as I said what I want to learn now is basically whatever it takes to get my foot into the door so that I can get some experience and maybe something worth putting on a resume.  
What are the things that I can pick up that will help me land that first job in the field? Is there some place that I’m not thinking of that can help me find a job that is computer related?
Thanks for any advice you can offer.

I met a woman online about six months ago, very unexpectedly. We lived in different states at the time but she had noticed we had much in common--we were both artists, political radicals, had similar reading tastes and intellectual interests. We were both in school at the time and decided to pursue a friendship for a while even though it seemed we would probably never meet. 

So we sent each other letters, emails and text messages, and it turned out in May, coincidentally, we were both moving to San Francisco--We'd both graduated, I had gotten an internship and she was starting a summer academic program. When we arrived we started seeing each other--a lot. We kissed after a week and slept together after two. 

The problem, though, is the economy (I'm only half-joking). I am trying to start a new career, which is why I took an unpaid internship, something I would never normally do. I am totally out of money and live with my uncle right outside the city, in a guest room. I still live out of a bag and might do so all summer. 

Essentially, I am a long way from being able to put a security deposit on a house, much less pay rent. She is also on a tight budget as a student and lives in a double room with a roommate--so naturally we don't have much alone time. We also both are fretting over jobs, whether we'll be able to find any work after summer and stay in San Francisco. 

I've been with enough people in my life to know that we have something very special, and I am genuinely excited to continue what we're building. The problem is that I wonder about our relationship, if it's hampered by how unstable things are. I've never attempted a relationship under such anxious life conditions. I remember falling in love in the past and it didn't feel like this... it was more overwhelming, more total. This feels very special but it doesn't feel like that insane rush I remember it being. I don't know if I'm jaded or if I'm just in a bad place in my life to be starting a relationship. 

I've also never really been in requited love--sadly, I've loved girlfriends who didn't love me back and vice versa. So maybe that was just puppy love and this is real? **I'm genuinely curious if anyone with more falling-in-love experience can comment on whether emotions can be hampered or subdued by personal stress.**

**I'm also wondering if anyone can give advice on cultivating a relationship when you can't sleep in the same bed or are restricted by money and stressful situations.**"

vh0ik,28,2012-06-23,For those contemplating law school - someone who decided not to go (and still respects people that do),cool_irl,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/vh0ik/for_those_contemplating_law_school_someone_who/,"About a year and a half ago I was right in the thick of the law school application process. I put money into testmasters, took the LSAT, applied to about 12 schools, got accepted to a few schools, and was telling friends and family how excited I was about it.  I had been working as a paralegal since the end of undergrad (2 years), and thought this was the logical next step.  I even went to a spring orientation weekend in a different state (on my own dime).  My GPA was somewhat low, LSAT good but not amazing, and I was destined to go to a school within the  30 - 50 range.  

Then, in April 2011, I balked.  I decided to make the decision and not go ahead with the law school aspiration.  I realized that I was doing it because of the situation/job that I fell into after school - which was not what I had wanted.  The cost and the seemingly infinite reports about diminished job prospects freaked me out.  

The hardest part was... telling people.  ""Didn't you spend ____ on an LSAT course?  Didn't you apply to x amount of schools?  That costs a lot of money too, right?""  It wasn't a great feeling - especially coming from a successful family that expects a lot out of their kin.  Or friends that are already knee-deep in law school and are doing very well.

Instead, I immediately applied to do a post-bac in computer science at a state school in a cheap area - a 2 year program.   My original degree was in economics.  I'm a geek at heart, had done some hobby programming, and wanted to 'do what I actually want to do' before I got too old.  Quarter life crisis, I suppose.  

Fast forward to now, and I somehow pulled off a 4.0 in both semesters, obtained two undergraduate research positions, and am doing a summer internship at an international, market leading microprocessor manufacturer (well, they may as well be the only one) doing software development.

I'm not coming here to say that law school is always the wrong choice.  It's not.  I know many, many people who are and have been successful doing just that.  I probably don't have what it takes to be a great lawyer, and envy certain qualities of people that do.  

But - I want to remind those of you who are contemplating law school because there's ""nothing else you can do with your degree"" that you are still young.  If you find yourself having to remind yourself of the benefits of law school because you're on the fence, give it more thought than you normally would.  You may find that it reinforces your aspirations about law - great!  Or, it may guide you the other way.

My experience might be an outlier, but I am so incredibly relieved that I changed paths when I did (even with the sunk costs) because it allowed me to remember that I'm not bound to some 'logical' career path just because family/society/myself expects it to happen.  You have a lot more control than you think you do.

This summer is the first time we will be apart for more than two weeks. Currently he is abroad in Europe with his family for 10 days, while I am at home in the States starting an internship. He left about 4 days ago, and the only contact we have had is via e-mail and Facebook because he doesn't have a phone for obvious reasons. His hotel has free wi-fi.

Because of the time difference between here and France (9 hours) the only times I can really talk to him are at the beginning and end of the day when he can connect to the internet back at the hotel (they spend all day sightseeing). Today was the first day of my internship and, on my commute back home which happened to take about two hours, I was lonely and tired and just wanted to talk and tell him about my day. He sent me one message after I had sent him an ""are you there?"" telling me that he was in bed and exhausted from all the things he had done all day (I'll spare the details of what they did). I replied with , ""I'm happy for you! sounds like you're having a great trip so far. kudos for [grandma] for keeping up with you guys. or maybe you're keeping up with her....? haha."" No response. I sent, ""hey so i don't know if you've gone to bed yet but if you did, I'll talk to you tomorrow. Love you!"" Again, no response.

..Here's the problem. This was on Facebook, meaning that now, since you can see when someone's read a message, I knew he saw them. I then sent (and yes, this might have been a little much btu at this point I was sad and frustrated) ""I'm kinda bummed that you haven't called or wanted to Skype yet."" Again, the message was seen. It just hurts because I figure would be so simple to go down to the lobby or step outside the room to call me or want to see my face.

 Now, it is the middle of the night and I'm sure he went to sleep, but what gives? Sorry for this being such a long post for what seems to be a petty problem, but I am actually really hurt and sad. What should I do? 

tl;dr: Boyfriend on vacation, isn't really making a huge effort to talk to me and it hurts. What to do?



EDIT: he's been on vacation before and has done this. 4 days doesn't seem too long and I probably seem whiny but on his previous vacation in the winter I heard from his friend (who I'm also friends with) that he registered for a fantasy football draft somewhere in the two days when I hadn't heard from him."

The degree is International Affairs- concentration in Diplomatic Service. I can't find any jobs or even internships. I'm not bragging but I know my resume is pretty solid but I've been lucky to even get responses to my inquiries. The reason I can't find anything is because I have been very determined to get something in the NGO sector, specifically relating to the Palestinian Israeli conflict which isn't really a money making endeavor. This is the field of study I have prepared myself to enter since my freshmen year of college so my mind is pretty well made up on that but I can't find a thing. My hope was to move either to Israel or the Palestinian Territories but so many orgs have very slim budgets making jobs/internships few and far between.  I can speak a little Arabic and my plan was to get the job/intern experience with an NGO and develop my Arabic skills in country but I am increasingly considering staying here in the US. I live outside Atlanta, Georgia and am looking in the area but options are slim. I'm not looking for a money maker, just something to gain valuable on-the-ground experience, or hopefully cover some living expenses.

To give an idea of where I'm at financially I will have around $10,000- $12,000 saved which is supposed to be for 'my future' ideally meaning a start to grad school in the next year or two. What I want to do is use some of the money (around $5,000) to go abroad hopefully for some kind of internship between 3-6 months.  Does reddit think this is financially irresponsible.  I want to eventually go to a 'higher tier' grad school for masters and eventually my PhD so that means spending a lot of money (potentially 50k or more) in the future.  

I've become more and more discouraged the closer I get to graduating because I feel like I am going to have to seek a job that has no relation to my interests and I can't help but think that if I want a successful career I need to get the ball rolling asap.  Should I go abroad and spend the $, stay here and seek unrelated employment to be safe, should I just start applying to grad schools..?

[Hi. you have done a great job with Reddit. Reddit is unique and has raised a very outstanding community which can be never found in the internet. And I love it!  What made you start a website like this? what was your inspiration?  What do you think about the current Reddit community? Is Reddit now as exactly as you imagined? or do you expect anything more from the current community?  How do you think the future of Reddit will be? and what do you expect the future to be? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542dso?context=5)|Thank you. But to be fair, this thing has grown *far* beyond what Steve and I started in that Medford apartment with. Sure, we can take credit for starting the planter box, tilling the soil, adding seeds, and watering, etc, but it's since grown into a freaking ecosystem.      We jumped at the chance, took the next train back to Boston and met with him for about an hour. He pushed us to drop mobile (it was 05) and think about a web app that we'd personally want to use every day. We left that meeting with a phrase in our heads that PG crafted ""front page of the internet."" Then it was just up to me and Steve to make it.      At the time, we were intrigued by delicious/popular, which was an interesting byproduct of their bookmarking service. Incidentally, we didn't learn about digg until weeks after we launched. It goes to show how much our ignorance helped, because you may remember all the blatant digg-clones that came and went before digg did -- Steve and I weren't trying to just copy, we were thinking about solving this problem from a clean slate.  I need to get better at distinguishing between the many varied reddit *communities*. The culture &amp; community on /r/NBA is very different from the culture on /r/aww and reddit is just the platform that enables such varied discourse. Steve and I always debated about subreddits vs tagging and I'm happy he won, because although it's taken longer to grow and develop, it's resulted in this marvelous variety in communities all using this common platform. So in a way, all of these varied communities are what we'd hoped for, but we've still got a ways to go until the reddit platform really is the ubiquitous way online communities share and discover content.
[Out of curiosity, what was the idea with tagging? One big front page ad people just tag the post with a corresponding topic?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c54330g?context=5)|I wanted submitters to choose, say, three tags to identify the post with to quickly create a rather broad categorization system.
[I am also glad Steve won if that's the case! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c54330g?context=5)|URL: Headline: Categories/Tags (3): 
[Now that subreddits are established you should introduce a system that allows the same post to be submitted to a number of subreddits, but only appear on someone's front page or /r/all once. It would be similar to tagging but the communities would persist. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c543a2d?context=5)|At this point, I like how one post submitted a few different reddits with different headlines creates different discussions based on community.
 |(Imagine if I submitted an article about a Skins victory over the Cowboys to both subreddits because it's technically could be categorized as cowboys and redskins news, I would give it an awesome headline for a Skins fan but it'd be awful for a Cowboys fan).
[What are your thoughts on the subreddit SRS? I know most people will view this from a ""lost karma"" perspective, but I don't care about karma, I mean from the perspective that a lot of thoughts and ideas are downvoted and never seen because this group doesn't agree with their thoughts. In my opinion, it kind of kills the spirit of reddit.  Also, what are your thoughts on subreddits like /r/picsofdeadkids and /r/beatingwomen (or whatever its called\)? Do you feel that these are ruining the credibility of the site?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542fn4?context=5)|I, like most, find people who use the reddit platform for awful stuff to be awful people. Just like [@deadbabygoon](https://twitter.com/#!/deadbabygoon) *(I didn't spend much time looking but this is rather offensive)* doesn't ruin the credibility of twitter, I don't see why these awful reddits would ruin the credibility of the reddit platform.
[Do you feel like there is enough sexism/racism/homophobia etc on Reddit to warrant a subreddit like SRS?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c5433pp?context=5)|I think there's enough sexism/racism/homophobia in the world to warrant people calling it out when it happens.

 |I look at reddit as a platform, not unlike, say, YouTube, where I can go see an inane video of a dimwitted human hurting himself on camera, but I can also use it [to watch Carl Sagan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnURElCzGc0) (which I highly recommend and I hope you'd agree is at least intellectual).

I don't actually use it anymore, but mostly because I'm content without it. (and lazy?). That said, I don't have any good feedback :(
 |The biggest product enhancement reddit needs atm imho is subreddit discovery, which we're working on. That'll be a glorious day when we nail it.
[The day that reddit becomes totally homogeneous.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c5455i4?context=5)|No no!

 |Oh, and cats. Please spay &amp; neuter!
[I recently read about how you and Steve made hundreds of fake accounts at the beginning to get the site going.

Maybe tens. I don't have a good enough memory. We submitted links (there were no comments back then) for the first month or so while we bugged friends into helping. The day about a month an a half in when we didn't have to do anything, submit a link, or even vote, was awesome, because we'd set a tone and apparently people didn't hate. it. I'm always telling people about the [1% rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture)) and why it's so important to treat those first hundred users well.
 |Remember, there was no 'social media' to speak of back in 2005, so all I had to spread the word was begging small bloggers to do writeups about a company they'd never heard of with a misspelled name and silly mascot.

I even got taunted by a guy at an /r/NYC meetup a little while back because he asked how long I'd been using reddit and I said I'd been a user for quite some time, joking that it was ""before reddit was popular.""

[Well I guess the anger could come because of hipsters really. I met a hipster not too long ago in the nearest city to me, complete with ironic hat &amp; glasses, and I found him ridiculous.

[Do you think you have become an inspiration to many young      Armenian and Armenian-Americans.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542fq9?context=5)|I don't know. I did an interview with [Yerevan Magazine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEAsrMzjnu0) and another [Armenian publication](http://www.haytoug.org/1755/alexis-ohanian-gains-perspective-in-yerevan). I grew up in a suburb of Maryland where I didn't know many Armenians so I was rather isolated from that half of my identity. I knew the history (and food!) of course, but I grew up far from Glendale. I actually know the community in Yerevan better from my 3 months living there. But if I can inspire, that's awesome. I get inspired by people I don't even know on reddit every day.
[What type of influence did the Armenian Culture have in your career.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542fq9?context=5)|I hate to bring it back to the genocide, but knowing what sacrifices my relatives made was incredibly motivating. As is the case with many immigrant stories, it creates invaluable perspective. I got to go out-of-state to UVA ($$$) without a single student loan because my great aunt, Vera Ohanian, saved money all her life for my college fund. She had no children of her own and wanted to be sure that I could go anywhere I wanted for college. So you can be damned sure that when I got to UVA, I took full advantage of the tuition. That's why I double majored in business and history (with high honors) and minored in german. I was told by deans that they'd never seen anyone complete a distinguished majors degree in the college *and* a degree in the business school and a minor to boot, all in 4 years.
[What is the greatest thing you experienced when you visited Armenia?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542fq9?context=5)|But maybe they didn't meet many Armenians ;) we're tenacious.

[Do you get a lot of pressure to more effectively monetize Reddit? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c542lfo?context=5)|I'm the one putting pressure on our CEO, Yishan :)
 |In all seriousness though, we never want to sacrifice the community for revenue. We've grown (costs) slowly by having a small team and I believe we can keep that up while also responsibly growing the business.
 |Stay tuned. Yishan and the team have some nifty ideas...
[When it started did you ever have any wild ideas in how you might monetize or was it really all about creating something people love?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c544zl2?context=5)|We thought if we could in fact become 'the front page of the web' it'd be valuable real estate to advertise on. Little did investors know we'd want to be so good to our users and not have obnoxious ads ;)
 |But sponsored headlines have been a not-awful way to make money in that they both make money and it's not an awful user experience (sometimes actually kinda fun with commenting).
[How have you seen reddit gold play in to this monetization? Is it an actual source of revenue or is it more like a fun optional ""proudly show your support for reddit"" kind of thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/c54be3h?context=5)|More of the latter.

And it gets harder each round because quality and volume go up. I'm not actually the best person at YC to ask because I don't have nearly as much data as the partners. But we want to see a team we can believe in, which we largely gather from what they've built together in the past. It's not a science, though, and it continues to impress me that YC has had consistently great rounds of startups (FD: I'm an employee of YC and [investor in a bunch of startups](http://alexisohanian.com/pages/investments))

Not just their butter/garlic stuff, but also ranch, and then some really random (not good) stuff... cheese sauce.... 
[Had no idea -- but then again, I've never eaten Papa John's in my entire life. I've had Dominos more times than any human should. Their deep-dish pizza is disgustingly good.

I absolutely lucked out this summer.

I missed my shot for most internships due to lack of relevant experience (I was only coming out of my freshman year after all)

Then, at the last minute I landed an internship with a local school district. Full time, $10 an hour (where I live has a super low cost of living).

The department I'm in is very small (me, my boss, and one other co-worker), and I work very closely with my boss. In a week I spend about 3 work days working directly with him. The other two he's usually off in meetings trying to get grants or other funding for the department.

On the job we discuss the department's budget quite a bit. Currently he has $15,000 budgeted for use on ""whatever can make [his] job easier"". Today, one week after I started, he asked if I would like to come on part-time in the fall. He said that the only roadblock to that would be if he has to spend that $15,000 on something else, then he would have enough in budget to keep me on.

Now onto my FAFSA, I've received $4,000 of work-study for next year, which would amount to about a third of my yearly pay. Since they're a public school district, I'm pretty sure they can use the work-study money (last year I worked at an NPO that was able to pay me through work-study)

So my question is, Should I let him know that work-study is an option for paying me? If so, how should I bring it up?

tl;dr: Internship at a public school district. Boss offered me part-time in fall, depending on how his budget looks then. I have $4,000 work-study. Worth mentioning it?

Thanks!"

I started college on a full-ride scholarship for ROTC.  

Mostly through my own freshman overconfidence and poor priorities (above all was avoiding getting yelled at by officers and upper-class ROTC students), I was disenrolled from the program.  Contributing factors included a terrible advisor who put me in upper-level courses my first term of college (Calc III instead of Calc I for example), as well as ROTC-stationed officers who didn't care about me.  Officially the reason was academic.  I've since learned my back is broken which rules out enlisting in the military as a means of paying my debt.  My grades sucked, but fortunately were good enough to transfer me out of a private to a public college, saving me tens of thousands of dollars in the long run.  It wasn't until after the review board I discovered that I could have requested assistance from a JAG lawyer regarding the disenrollment (as explained to me by a lawyer who specializes these kinds of cases).  

It was my understanding that the debt repayment could be pushed back AT LEAST until I graduated with my bachelor's degree (December 2012).  However today I received a letter that my financial hardship has been determined irrelevant and I must repay starting mid-July, or three weeks from now.  I'm going to call the department handling my debt Monday morning, but until then I'm going to assume the worst and try to wrap my brain around this situation earlier than I'd anticipated.  Here are my financials:


* Money in bank: $1,200

* Car KBB value: $9,000

* Rent: $0 (live with parents)

* Entertainment: $15 / month

* Cell phone: $10 / month

* Tuition: ~$1,600 for my final semester this fall (my father pays half of it)

* Car insurance: ~$1,400 per year

* Pay from my internship: ~$1,020 / two week paycheck (after taxes), at least 7 more weeks of work (potentially longer if they allow me to work part-time during fall semester)


DEBTS:

* ROTC related: ~$39,000 with 0.16% interest, due in 120 payments of ~$330 / month

* Stafford: $6,500 @ 6.8% interest

Due to my back injury I'm unable to do any work that requires standing long hours or repeated lifting, so as much as I'd have liked to work part-time at the local Fedex or UPS or any other decent-paying job less temporary than an internship, that wasn't (and still isn't) an option until I get surgery (and even then I might have trouble).  

My internship is mostly desk work with a little walking around to break up the day.

I've started scouting for post-undergrad jobs in my field (engineering) and hope to start sending out applications mid-semester.

Any advice on how I should properly deal with all of this?  Anything is appreciated!"

I am a 22 year old with a college degree (psychology :/) and am starting graduate school this fall for school counseling. I have worked lousy summer jobs but now every job after college seems to require 2+ years of experience. How can I get experience in my field if every job requires previous experience?! Even waitressing jobs around where I live require previous work experience. I can only find jobs where I earn $9 per hour. This is my wage now- i am a pre-k aid. Do employers really mean it when they say they require experience or is this just bullshit they say in hopes of getting experienced people? I have glowing recccomendations from previous bosses but it's for unrelated jobs like being a lifeguard and a daycare supervisor. There are currently no internships available. Relocation is not an option.

I'm a 19 year old girl. Here's some background: my father is a typical born and raised in pakistan, father. But.. Other desi fathers I know are strict but not nearly as bad as my dad. He believes he gets revelations from God. Because of that he believes he is always right by divine right. I'm also fairly certain he's bi-polar, as diagnosed from my mother who is a doctor.
Okay... let me explain a little bit about my life and living with him. He's... suffocating, and that's an understatement. 

He forced my mom to stop practicing medicine (because she's a woman) and now she stays at home all day and cooks and cleans. He did this while they lived in Pakistan- my mother was a doctor, very successful. However, back then, and especially in Pakistan, a woman could hardly say no to her husband. He would threaten her- and there's no domestic violence council or police that would have helped her. This is pakistan! Because of that she couldn't get her license to practice in America. Some mothers are okay with this. Mine is not. My fathers knows this and he continues to treat her like shit and not let her get a job. He's thrown stuff at her, publicly embarassed her, he is absolutely horrid to her. Extremely verbally... horrible. (I want to call it abuse. The worst part is, he forces her to stay home all day and cook and clean. That's it. He did this so that she would always have to depend on him. He did this so she would never have a way out. He did this so that he would always have a stay at home wife who would always cook and clean for him because she would have to. 
When I was younger, he forced her to scrub the floor while she had cracked ribs. He kept her working around the house, and she was constantly attending to his stupid fucking worthless needs like making tea for him and shit. This is the kind of person my dad is. He would threaten to beat her, divorce her... 

He doesn't let my mom or my brother or I ever go out. He prefers for us to stay at home. When I say I'm not allowed to do anything, I mean I'm not allowed to do anything. Listen to music, reading, watching tv, talking to friends, and I can't even go outside for a walk. you name it. I only go online when he's not at home. It's safer that way. He's also tried to get me married off. It didn't work. Thankfully he's letting me finish my education, though he has clearly stated multiple times that I should have been married straight out of high school.

The frustration that's been building up is... I don't even know how to explain it. I'm 19 and sitting at home- I want to volunteer, get a job, go out with friends, but I'm not allowed to. I can go volunteer, but not even at the places I want to volunteer. I do volunteering because I love to do it, and it also looks very good for medical school, which I am desperately trying to get into..

 I'm kind of just, locked up. All the time. Except when I go to school. But even then, I spend the majority of my time in the house. I just don't think this kind of isolation is normal. I can't do anything. If my brother or I or my mom try to go out, we're only allowed to go out for about an hour. Any more than that and... well, we all get seriously yelled at. Threatened. Saying he'll divorce my mom and turn her out on the streets. Saying he'll kick us out. It's... really really scary when he yells. I don't know how to explain it. I feel dumb, silly even, because people might say 'oh it's scary when your parents get mad at you- that's normal.' But I don't think this kind of fear is normal. 

Miraculously, when I was applying to colleges, my dad actually let me go to a university that was far away from home. I had gotten into a special program with research and everything. It was kind of a fluke that he let me go; it was like a miracle. But I went. I was so happy- so so so happy. I got to experience life, like going out with friends and not having religion shoved down my throat all the time. I could do the simplest things and not be afraid. I could study in the library late when I needed to and not get screamed at. I could listen to music. I could go outside without getting questioned and hammered on. I could call friends!

 And then... Well, I finally realized that I never believed in religion. Yet some people didn't take it well. I received a threatening phone call from my brother last summer, the summer of my freshman year in college. He said that if I didn't come out to my parents, he would tell them. My brother and I had been growing apart; he was really depressed since he was going to school at home. But still, I had never thought this would happen. Turns out my cousin (we'll call him M) had put him up to it. M is an extremely religious person. To give an example, he had told his parents that his older sister wasn't a muslim already, and they practically disowned her. Luckily she was living on her own, and it didn't quite turn out as M wanted it. M told my dad....
One of the happiest summers of my life quickly turned into a nightmare. No one would talk to me. Suddenly, the freedom that I had before was snatched away from me. I wasn't allowed outside. It was really depressing. My dad wanted to withdraw me from my university, but I begged and pleaded, and he consented. During my sophmore year though, things were just going to shit at home. My parents didn't trust me and things escalated more. Things my brother had overheard while he eavesdropped on my phone conversations- he told them to M. M quickly decided to ruin my life as he told my parents more about me. Things turned to shit in december, during winter break. I was allowed to attend my university for spring semester, but only if I agreed to transfer back home. I had no choice. I had to.

Now spring semester is over and it's been... what, a while since school let out? I've never been so fucking depressed. No more going out, no more living without fear; I was going to do research, be a paid mentor, be one of the officers in an amazing club, have an internship- I had a love interest, too. Now I've gone from everything to nothing. Especially the boy I was with... we could do things long distance, but I know he won't. And who would want to deal with an insane fucking father like mine? It hurts. It makes me feel worthless; because if I was worth it, then he would want to stay in a relationship with me right? It wouldn't be so hard to deal with if I wasn't trapped in a room with only my thoughts all day. You see, I feel like the way things are- me feeling helpless and stuff is because I can't do anything to take my mind off of what's happened. Everyday is a constant reminder. Other people can go out, talk to their friends, read books, do things. I cannot.

I want to go to medical school- I truly and honestly do. But my father barely even fucking lets me volunteer. All those extra-curricular activities to help me get in... gone. He put a tracker in my car so he knows where I'm at... while every other kid at least gets to do what they want, I feel like I'm stuck in this limbo. I feel lame. I'm 19 and I can't do anything because my dad won't let me since he has such control over us. I don't feel like I'm worth anything. My dad (who likes to tell me things like 'I wish you were never born' or 'God gave me love for you but he can take it away too') controls everything with his money. He made sure that he made his kids and wife dependent on him so we could never try to break away. Believe me, I've tried. But everytime I've tried to rebel, my mother gets hurt by my father instead. He is so, so terrible to her. And he isn't much better to us. The things he says, the ridiculous amounts of control he exhibits... I can't wear what I want. He is has these bouts where he pressures me and threatens me to wear the hijab.

 I tell myself to be strong everyday, but I've never felt so depressed and angry in my life. 
The smartest thing to do would be stay in school; let my dad pay for my bachelor's. But while it's helping me, it's also hurting me. I feel like one of the reasons I wouldn't be able to go to medical school is because my dad won't let me do anything. I know for a fact that if I don't get in, it will most likely be because I barely had any extra curriculars. He thinks I can get into medical school by just staying at home. I know there are other factors, but... this bothers me a lot. Is my future to be compromised as well?

I I try to stay upbeat and cheery- barely any of my friends know what I go through, but it's so fucking hard. It's so depressing. I feel like nothing and I feel like I'll never have a life of my own. Will I ever be able to talk to the few friends who stuck around with me without fear of getting caught? I just... need some people to give me ideas, to show me that I can't just lose hope. Something. This isolation, this not being able to do anything staying in one fucking room all day, tip-toeing around the raging bomb that is my dad...

 This is no way to live... You know, no matter what people's problems, be it money problems or emotional problems... At least they have the freedom to go outside. I'm not saying my problems are worse than anyone else's. I'm just trying to say... I wish I was at least allowed to take a walk without getting screamed and cursed out at. 

I'd just... I know I can get through this. It's just hard. Especially the relationship part. I feel so worthless. I feel like I'll never get out... I know I can, but taking this stuff one day at a time is hard for me.

I'm a tall and skinny guy in a shirt-and-tie internship this summer. I really struggle with finding undershirts that are long enough to stay tucked in as I move about—getting up and sitting down a lot—without them being super baggy. 

Any advice? Ideally inexpensive as well.

vjdyl,5,2012-06-24,Quebec Skilled Worker program -- Your experiences? ,WordsVerbatim,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/vjdyl/quebec_skilled_worker_program_your_experiences/,"I've written on here before, but I figured I'd ask about this anyway...

Originally, I had ruled out the idea of Quebec Skilled Worker program because of the processing times and because I have no desire to settle in Quebec forever. But now that I've researched it a bit, I don't think you necessarily have to (?). I have added up my points. I hit about 54, if I remember correctly, maybe 50.

I think this would be the best option for me, considering:

- French degree (December 2012) - Level B2 or maybe higher (Will take DELF or TEF)
- Age 23, 24-25 at time of application for Certificat,
- 2 years experience in Customer Service role (Campus Recreation)
- 2 years as Medical Transcriptionist
- Current internship (2.5 months) with my local Chamber of Commerce
- Studied for 3 months in Saguenay, QC during the Fall of 2011. (Sept-early Dec) Lived with host family.
- No criminal record to speak of.
- Medical history: hydrocephalus and retinal detachment -- both are stable and I've been fine for some years with the hydro. Both retinas have been addressed and are very stable, have been for a couple of years.

**How are the processing times for the Certificat and then PR?** The website says 12-13 montsh for the Certificat, assuming I were to be accepted. I assume PR would take at least 8 months.... **(I have checked the Quebec Immigration site, but I am looking for personal experiences!)**

I am happy settling anywhere in Quebec, so long as there is need for me there. Montreal, Quebec City, Gatineau, don't care! I would just like to establish myself somewhere. I was thinking about pursuing BUNAC USA (12 month Working Holiday) in the meantime. Does anyone have experience going from this to QSW?

I don't know if it's a viable option. I know that the best option is working here in the US while my application is processed. sounds more realistic, and it will proably be what I do."

Had a few interviews, but nothing has come out of them so I'm kinda at my wits end. Its not for a lack of looking and/or wanting it and I'm willing to take almost any job because I love this town and want to be able to stay here, but can't.

As such I've decided to go so far as posting my resumes here on the Austin Jobs subreddit. As the title says, I'm experienced in Video Production, namely editing and that's my true field, but I'm also a skilled writer and extremely experienced in food service. If anyone needs someone in those fields, hopefully for long term, but for any paid work, even if its one off or on commission, then I'm open to it. I have two resumes, one is my full work history, the other is my video production work resume. I'm removing my exact address and phone number from the resumes as I had someone use my information for a post to Craigslist and it really was a hassle dealing with all that, and I don't feel like putting my address on such public display. My email address is still included for the purpose of contact, and I will gladly give my phone number to interested parties that email me with true interest. I also have a reel of my production work on YouTube, but due to the prevalence of work on being stolen by less scrupulous people on the web, and my not wanting to have my work watermarked, I won't display the link here. If interested in seeing it, contact me by email and I will share the link. 

Thanks for looking at this stuff guys and hopefully it has the desired outcome of finding some work.

I'm a 21 year old (female, if that matters) college student who's home for the summer, based in the Fairfax area.  I have a full-time internship that's unpaid, and it would be great to have a little supplemental income. I have plenty of experience babysitting (did a full-time nanny sort of job for a summer) and am great with kids.  So if you want to spend an evening out on the town but aren't okay with leaving the kids at home alone, pm me and I'll give you my phone/email.

Oh, and I'm also willing to do odd jobs--pet sitting, gardening/weeding, helping you move, helping you clean, whatever the hell else.  And if your kids are older, I'd be glad to tutor them in SAT/PSAT prep, TJ test prep, Latin, history, English, various sciences, etc.  PM me if you're curious about my educational background/tutoring experience.

3: UW–Madison, Rutgers (50% chance)

I need some encouragement, please.",[deleted],askseddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/vj4vc/girl_setup_date_with_me_online_and_im_now_i_have/,"First some background on me.  I've been in a depressed rut since my last break up three years ago.  I've only began to get out of my funk this year and so far I've quit smoking, lost 30 pounds, and recently discovered seddit.  I'm also in my mid-late 30s.  I'm FAR from where I need to be weight wise since the weight gained for quitting was a bit extreme.  

I've tried Opening sets so far but with no real success.  But at-least AA is down.   I've ignored the Oneitis at work and she has started drama from that, claiming I was banging an intern and some other people at work.  Everyone now thinks she is a psycho.  Bullet=Dodged!  

Anyway, I emailed a woman online, she looks like an HB9 in the pixs but the main reason was that she seamed like a cool gal.  She is a Divorced Professor and she's in her late 30's.  

So for our interaction has been...

I sent her one email, Response was Phone Number.

Called her once, She was about to teach a night class and told me she will call me back.

She Calls me at work the next day, I asked if there was a better time since I was in the middle of something.  She told me to call he at 7pm.

She calls me at 7:15 and tells me a sob story how she can't talk to me right now and needs to help a friend.  Also he gives DETAILS of her x-husband who is a CPA who gambled, her Divorce, car situation, and work.  I just let her talk, occasionally, prompting her for more information.  After about 15 minutes she needs to hang up to help her friend.

5 Minutes later she calls back with how her friend, who is 82, is cooking her dinner, and how she is going on vacation next week. I prompt to were, she is staying at home, and how she is really cheap and doesn't like to waste money on frivolous things.  And that we should meet up during her vacation period.  ""How 'bout Tuesday, were do you work?""  I told her where I work which was about an hour away.  She then precedes to tell me that I'm going to pick her up at her place and then we are going to go first to the dinner nearby then my choice of the Irish or English Pub.  

I decided to just agree with it and go with the flow.  

Fake Update: I did some internet sleuthing with the limited info I had on her and reverse image search and found that the Photos were 4 years old, and she was a part-time model.  Is it wrong that after finding this out I want to sing this to her: http://tinyurl.com/28l4cb

I am getting pre-date jitters, I know it's my AA rearing it's ugly head.
Mostly, why the fuck would she want do go out with me.  I know it's bullshit and I'm being intimidated by myself putting too much value in her.  

About the part that she seams like a crazed psycho.  Well, every time I think of the interaction so far I get a Raging Hard-on.  :)  I guess I like them crazy.  

Should I try to take control of the date from her?  Or Should I just roll with it?

TL;DR Met HB9 that took control and I'm having doubts of myself measuring up.  Should I Take control from her or just let it be?  Any tips to build up my confidence even more?

Now that legislation has passed that puts graduate and professional students at a disadvantage when it comes to loans (http://www.loyno.edu/financialaid/federal-student-loan-changes-2012-2013), I need to plan ahead and adapt to these changes.


I currently work and have $1000 saved so far.

Although many current graduate students in STEM fields have been funding their studies through TA and RA positions, I can't assume that the university I will attend will still have money for this a few years down the road. 

I'll have to move out of my parents home for graduate school and attend a different school, since my school's undergraduate program is ABET accredited, but the graduate program is not (an important factor in an engineering education).


**The big question** : How do I tackle these unsubsidized loans in the future? Do I pay off the interest accumulated each month while I'm in school? Maybe try to pay the minimum balance each month if I find a decent-paying internship? Either way, it seems like a losing battle :(

vj25s,1,2012-06-24,America to (almost) Anywhere,Hollow_Hills,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/vj25s/america_to_almost_anywhere/,"I've been kicking the idea around for years now and I've realized I really need to start forming a real plan if I'm to actually ever get out. 
Like most other people it seems, Western Europe/Australia/NZ are the top choices but I'd definitely consider other options.

Relevant Info:

Age : 27 (female if that makes a difference)

Education : Bachelor's of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics, recently returned to school to get a Bachelor's in Bio-Molecular Engineering. 

Real Job Skills : Extensive customer service work (i.e. retail and fast food peon). I do have basic computer skills like Office and Excel but who doesn't these days. I can pick up necessary skills pretty fast but obviously I don't have anything to really set me apart from most people in the 15+ age groups these days. You can see part of why I'm back in school!

Language Skills : Very basic French- I'm willing to learn more of it or any other languages if it will help. I can also sort of guess at written German and Dutch if it's very simple stuff for whatever that's worth.

Criminal Convictions : None

Alternative Destinations: YES

Temp. or Permanent: Permanent

I'd also like to mention that though I'm in school for Bio-Molecular Engineering, I've only just started so I'm at a point where switching majors to something more likely to help me get out would be considered. Most specifically I'm nursing as other engineering disciplines don't really grab me as much and healthcare workers are always needed. (I don't get very excited about the idea of being a nurse though. But if it gets me out....) A general Chemical Engineering degree (what I'm going for now is an offshoot of that ) would be ok but I'd need to switch schools and I can't really afford to live on my own right now. I could commute but it'd be harder to have a job and still keep up with school that way. If necessary, I could even just have my degree as a back-up and teach English in SE Asia or something. I'm willing to be somewhat flexible if it can help me get out!

Another thing I feel I should mention, as I don't know how it may or may not affect my chances is my health. I have asthma, but am otherwise in good shape. Would something like that hurt my chances or are there any precautions I would need to take with it while getting out? It's something that I need to make sure is taken care of because without medicine to control it my asthma can become a problem.

One more thing: School outside of the US is likely not feasible for me at this point. It's cheap enough for the school but the money required to travel over is not something I have. If I found something that was essentially guaranteed my family *might* help but as it stands they're in some weird mindset that leaving America is harder than walking to the moon. Even trying to talk to them about it seems to get them irritated and they go all doom and gloom and I just get frustrated.  I do have the option of an exchange program next summer in France but I don't know how much that would help me in getting out unless I was able to make some awesome connections in the space of a month. (Or if  an exchange program would be helpful to this goal at all). I'd consider an overseas internship, but I don't know if such things really exist. (If they do I imagine they aren't easy to get either!)

Anyway, I hope my post makes sense and that at least a few of you can give me good and useful advice.

I already have a rather large amount of money (for a college student) saved up from my previous summer jobs and I feel like I could get a headstart on retirement savings with this internship.  I am in the fortunate position where my parents are paying all of my college expenses, so I won't be graduating with any loans.  I read /r/pf a lot so believe me I am very thankful for what they have done for me.  

So I guess I have a few questions/clarifications:  
 * Is now a good time for me to start saving for retirement?  
 * Is a Roth IRA the best utility right now? (my internship matches 401k after 90 days of working, so I will be  back in classes by then)  
 * I want Roth, not Traditional IRA because my earnings now are already in the lowest tax bracket, so I want to pay taxes now(?)  
 *Should I open it with Vanguard or Schwab (my bank)? The schwab site says there are no account service fees (Except for trades, but I dont pay for those anyways)  
 *Is there anything else I should be doing, or any advice you have for me?

Thanks!

As the title implies, I'm moving to San Francisco for an internship starting in July. The internship goes through my university in Boston, so I suppose i'm still technically a college student while I'm here. I'm super excited, I've wanted to be on the west coast for a long time so this is a fantastic opportunity.

That being said, I'm pretty nervous about meeting people and figuring out interesting, non-touristy things to do. I'll be moving there with one other kid from my school in Boston, but other than that I'll know literally nobody. Can anyone suggest any cool ways to go about making friends in the city?

One thing I've been thinking of doing is just sort of trying to bum around the college areas. Would this type of activity be socially profitable, or is it a different vibe over here? In Boston there's literally a college every 35 feet, and somewhere around 40% of the city is under 25, so you can literally just shout down the street and find things to do. I'm kind of doubting that's the case over in San Francisco considering it's not a collegiality dense as Boston, so I'll be a bit out of my element.

Anyways, any suggestions would be much appreciated! Thanks guys!"

Primary use will be, upon graduation from school, 3D work inside of UDK, Zbrush and Maya as well as heavy amounts of gaming. I am currently a game dev (artist intern) working on Simcity 5 and as this is going to be my career choice, I'd like to keep up with current tech.

Personally, I cant rationalize with buying the ABSOLUTE #1 THING on the market for each device (ie: GTX 690)... they look amazing, sound great, but I've worked hard for the money I have to spend.

My budget is ""around"" $2100 and I am now sitting right on that bubble :D

Of course, I am open to last minute suggestions and feedback, which is why I am posting :)

As an American agnostic with a Christian upbringing, I think this is a valid question. I do celebrate Christmas, but I don't want to. I believe that Christmas is a Christian holiday (yea I know, it wasn't originally... but now in the 21st century I think it holds true that it is), and since I don't consider myself a Christian, I don't think I should celebrate it on principle. The reason I do is my family. I just finished my sophomore year at college, and still rely on my family for financial support and I have been coming home for the summer and winter holidays. Next holiday season, however, this will change. I have a summer/fall co-op (a type of internship where I take a semester off from school to work) that continues through the middle of January and I most likely won’t be able to come home for Christmas because of the discrepancy between the time it would take to travel versus the time I will have off – west coast home, east coast job and school.

Is this the year to declare to my parents that I really don’t want to celebrate Christmas due to its inconsistency with my (non)religious beliefs, and visit them some other time? Or is it more of a family holiday and I should bite the bullet and celebrate Christmas for the familiar and traditional values?  Or do something in between?

TL;DR: Is Christmas for religion or family? Is it worth celebrating even though I'm not Christian, and do you as an atheist or agnostic celebrate it?

vip4r,0,2012-06-24,"Stuck in an internship job I hate, trying to get unstuck.",kevtice15,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/vip4r/stuck_in_an_internship_job_i_hate_trying_to_get/,"So on Monday, I will start the 4th week of a 10 week internship I have at a big tech company (by big I mean global, 10s of 1000s of employees, jobs for people to do in pretty much all areas of CS) that will remain unnamed.  I graduated with a degree in Computer Science in May and I will begin a graduate program in the fall.  The company sent out a spreadsheet to all the interns a few months ago with a list of all the groups in the company taking interns and asked us to fill our top 7 into a survey.  I get an email the week before the internship starts saying I'm going to be in a group that isn't even on the list, so I can't even check to see what the group I got placed in does.  But I figure, whatever, I'll see what happens, maybe I'll enjoy it.  A bit of backstory: &lt;backstory&gt; in my last semester of my CS degree, I took a class about data communications and network programming.  I learned a lot about networks themselves, but the biggest and most important lesson I learned is that I don't like network programming, and I'm not very good at it.  The class was a struggle and I praised Turing when the class was over. &lt;/backstory&gt;  When I arrive on the first day of my internship, my manager, after thanking me for picking this group, begins to explain to what it is I have to do.  Of course of all things, this group deals HEAVILY with network programming (if you're familiar, specifically the Data Link and Network layers of the OSI model, so pretty low level stuff).  My heart drops. I can't help but wonder how this has happened.  Firstly how the internship coordinators could not place me in any of my SEVEN choices.  And secondly, even if I really, for some reason, just could not have one of my SEVEN CHOICES, how did I have the intense misfortune of being placed in a group that deals heavily with one of the only topics in CS that I could not bring myself to enjoy in any way.  Even after this meeting, I try to have a positive outlook. Having a job isn't class, so maybe network programming in the real world could be fun.  They proceed to have me read documents to get me up to speed on what I'll be working on.  So I read ... every day ... 8 hours a day ... for 3 weeks ... about network programming ... in which I have utterly no interest.  Then at the end of the 3rd week, I have another meeting with my manager and he gives me my actual assignment (which I'm purposely not going to explain), and it sounds like the 5th circle of my personal hell.  I feel like I made a big mistake not trying to get transfered to another group in the first week because 1) I don't know what other managers would be willing to take an intern for 6 weeks, and 2) I don't know how good of an internship experience I'm likely to have even if I switch.  I wake up everyday with a huge sigh and struggle to get myself ready to be at work on time. I really feel like I'm not going to be able to do this and I don't know what I should do.  Should I tell my manager that I hate my job so he can at least know even if I'm unable to switch?  Would it be worth it to switch?  Any insights into a course of action would be much appreciated.

tl;dr - Lost the internship lottery at a big company, hate my job, 6 weeks left, should I try to get them to switch me to a new job?"

So I had a quick question for you guys. I'm currently in an internship and theres only like 4 of us interns in there. I get along pretty well with the other two but theres one in there who is constantly rude to me. The first day we had a long talk that was very polite and interesting, but after that he's done everything to not talk to me. He even puts in his headphones and theres no music on. (He sneezes a lot and I say, 'bless you' and he just sits there, that sort of thing.) So the other day I think I heard him talking to our boss about my performance; I heard him say something along the lines of, ""He just sits on his computer all day."" When...the purpose of my being there is to catalog things on the computer. Now I realize that he doesn't know what I'm doing there, and thats fine and maybe this is all a misunderstanding, but it really worries me. I'm wondering how my boss is going to grade me at the end of this. I'm worried that this guy may be trying to sabotage me/cold shoulder me. I don't really know what to do except to keep doing my work to the best of my abilities. I'm wondering if anyone has ever been here before and if they have, how did they solve it? This is my first internship and I don't want it to dictate the rest of my internships in the future. 

Thanks!"

I am currently declared as a Kinesiology major. Up until now, I have been headed in the direction of physical therapy, but have for the past several months been considering orthopedic surgery.

I began pursuing this course a few years ago after my first arthroscopic shoulder surgery, and have since had two more major orthopedic surgeries. I have had some intern time at the same hospital with some of the same pt's, and doctors who have helped put me back together. I only include this background to explain some of the motivations behind my pursuing medicine.

So, on to the advise I need. Would I still be okay with a BS in Kinesiology? My emphasis is movement science, which is very flexible with upper division electives, so I can essentially formulate my own curriculum. Or would I be better off checking out a Biology degree?

After considering the appropriate major, would anyone have any insight regarding what orthopedic surgery would entail? I've spoken to my surgeons about it, but I would never turn down more perspectives. 

Thanks in advance everyone! This is my first time posting here, so I hope I didn't do anything wrong here. "

vii6m,7,2012-06-24,THE MANLY ADVENTURES OF ABNER DEGGENT: Island of the Toroga,magwier,libraryofshadows,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/vii6m/the_manly_adventures_of_abner_deggent_island_of/,"The decade after the second world war was a period of unlimited prosperity. For a rugged few individuals it was also a time of unlimited adventure and the manliest of those adventurers was the mercenary, treasure hunter and unlicensed electrician named Abner Deggent.

It would be fair to say that he fascinated me from the very first. As an amateur writer I had become an avid observer of humanity and I knew from the very first glance that this was a man that lived life on the edge.

It began in the summer of 1947, once I had been one of the most decorated chefs in the navy but I had recently been dishonorably discharged. You might think a man like General McArthur would be more forgiving of a few tapeworms but you would be wrong.

My aimless wanderings had brought me to a bar in Singapore that was owned by a retired trainer of fighting chickens, which was why he had named his establishment ‘The Brutal Cock.’ This was an establishment that catered to the jaded desires of soldiers of fortune and modern day pirates.

Everyone looked up when the man strode into the bar; some noticed his whipcord muscles, others noticed his steely eyed expression, many more noticed that when he kicked the door open it hit a waitress and knocked her unconscious.

He walked up to the bar and began talking to the owner, his mastery of the Malay language was clumsy but he spoke with the kind of confidence only a man that doesn’t realize he’s accidentally ordered a Shirley Temple with Tabasco sauce can have.

I left my table and introduced myself.

“Deggent’s the name,” he shook my hand with crushing force. His was as deep and rich as a good souffle, “Abner Deggent.”

I introduced myself, “Ralph Brooks.”

The owner brought over his drink, Deggent sipped from it contemplatively, then coughed for a few minutes.

When his eyes had stopped watering I ordered him an expensive beer.

He smiled thinly “Much obliged Brooks.”

“Please, you may call me Ralph,” I paid for our drinks, “and if you don’t mind my saying so it looks as though you are either coming back from an adventure or are about to set out on one.”

“Everyday is an adventure for me Brooks,” he took a long swig of beer. If the mustache of dripping foam bothered him he gave no sign.

“Really? I’d like to hear more.” I said.

Deggent explained to me that he had recently undertaken a mission to help recover the twin idols from the natives of Togora Island.

“I’m sorry if I’m a bit confused,” I interrupted, “but you said you were recovering these idols.”

“Yes,” he grunted, “those artifacts were solid gold, they were priceless. Better to have them in a museum than to have them being worshiped by a bunch of savages for another two hundred years.”

I nodded with understanding and he continued his story. The expedition, he explained, had been organized by Professor Eisenhart working from the notes of a previous expedition that had disappeared without a trace. Other men might have been scared off knowing something like that but not Deggent!

Besides, no one told him anything about it until they were already on the island of the Toroga The expedition consisted of Deggent, Professor Eisenhart and their translator, a lovely native girl named Weena. They lacked the funds for native bearers and bodyguards but the Professor got around that by recruiting a small force of unpaid interns.

Occasionally Deggent would pause in the telling of his tale to place another drink order on my tab and try to entice our waitress into having sex with him for money. He started out by waving a ten dollar bill under her nose and worked his way up in increments of five.

My narrative skills could never fully capture the tale of their journey through that savage land. They encountered quicksand and ravenous beasts, clever deathtraps and rock slides, the crossed swords with another group of treasure hunters and wandering Toroga warriors. Our heroes braved it all, venturing deeper and deeper into the jungle leaving nothing but a trail of mutilated unpaid interns in their wake.

When they reached the village of the Toroga they were immediately set upon and captured, their translator having betrayed them. Deggent could only speculate to her reasons but he suspected that the check he had prepaid her with bouncing had something to do with it.

The chief of the Toroga spoke perfect English and he explained that his people were weary of one group of adventurers after another raiding their quiet village. He meant to make an example of our heroes by subjecting them to the Death Of A Thousand Screams.

Abner Deggent laughed fearlessly at this causing the chief of the Toroga to re-sentence him to the Death Of One Really Big Scream but before that could happen Deggent challenged the man, infact he challenged the honor of the entire Toroga people.

“I told him that we would have our champion fight theirs, if we won we would go free, if they won they would go forward with the executions,” Deggent explained, “luckily he fell for it.”

“Well, what happened?” I asked.

Deggent shrugged, “Damned if I know, we told them the last surviving intern was our champion and we made our escape as he battled the tribal champion in a pit full of flaming vipers.”

Of course there was more to the story? Did they ever find the treasure? How did they escape the island?

Before I could ask the owner of the bar appeared before us waving a rusty machete. It was only then that Abner Deggent discovered he had been propositioning the man’s daughter for sexual favors all night.

What happened then? That is a story for another time."

I'm currently a (super) senior at my school for Illustration and Design and I'm in the area this summer for an internship. A lot of my friends and fellow classmates have either moved or are still at school so I'm yearning to get to know other local artists, maybe share portfolio links, favorite artists, movies, books, hobbies, travel experiences, favorite cartoon characters, etc. I figured a good way to do this is to post on here and propose some social type of meet up (I'm new to Reddit and missed the Global Meet-Up day - go me). 

I would not limit this to just artists! Anyone interested in these sort of things can be involved. 

I think Art Jamz in Dupont has walk-in painting for $10 an hour so that could be a cool place to start! Otherwise, I'm open to anything if people are willing to pull together and make this sort of thing happen.

I'm just finishing up my second year (at community college..) and transferring to a UC to continue. 

Currently the CS-related courses I have taken are: Intro to C++ (two quarters), Data Structures &amp; Algorithms in C++ (one quarter). C as a second language (one quarter), Intro to UNIX/Linux.

I don't currently find any of these skills useful as no one is looking to pay me to create a program they can run in a console... 

I also noticed that most employers of interns are looking for either Python/Django experience or Java/Javscript experience... So what the hell am I doing with C++??

Furthermore, what can I work on this Summer, and which courses should I sign up for (this coming school year) so that next Summer I will be able to actually flex my CS muscles and get a powerful internship?

Some other ideas I have thought about was diving into Android App development. Where do I even start with this? I know it doesn't use C++ (I believe its Java based?), so would I need to start learning Java? What else? How long will learning this take? 

Also any other idea on how I can make money with my major before I graduate?

vibrl,1,2012-06-23,Fresh out of university w/ BS in Exercise Bio. At a crossroads at my life. I really need all/any advice that I can get. PLEASE!,Xosst,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/vibrl/fresh_out_of_university_w_bs_in_exercise_bio_at_a/,"I don't know which sub-reddit I should start this topic on, so I'm going with this one and hoping for the best. 

I am 22 y.o. and just graduated from a Uni in California with a major that has backed me into a corner in my life. I hope that some redditors out there have similar experiences or words of wisdom for someone like me and I would love to receive input on what I should do with my life.

I have a BS in Exercise Bio and a minor in Psych with my original intention of going to Physical Therapy school. Throughout college, I had done 3 different PT internships, logging in around 100 hours of inpatient/outpatient internships. I also volunteered at a student-run clinic that I could put on my resume. All of my efforts were solely for the purpose of applying and going to PT schools in the future. 

Graduation has come and now I'm on the fence about whether I want to even continue with my PT endeavors.  I did NOT get close with any of my professors due to my laziness so I don't know if I can get letters of recs from them. My GPA is VERY bland (3.12) and I am having a hard time finding a PT Aide job that would give me lots of experience to outweigh my low GPA and very average GRE score.  With all of these things combined, I am starting to feel that I cannot compete with others to get into PT schools.  I'm really starting to feel that I should not have majored in what I did because now I am suffering the reality of finding a job in this tough economy. 

I admit that I was very naive and ignorant of my life after college the past 4 years, but now I want to explore my possibilities. The problem is, there isn't much that I really find a passion for. 

Reddit, what should I do? Should I go back to a community college and work towards a degree? Should I just keep trying to apply to PT schools? I don't know my chances of getting in, but I'm sure it's not that high. What should I be doing in the meantime to keep my parents off my ass about bumming it at home? I really need advice because I am receiving none within my family and I have no knowledge of getting my foot in the door within the medical field. 

Please, helpz! Also, if there are any PTs, PAs, or others in the field that would be willing to guide and direct me, I would love to talk to you! Send me a PM or leave a message in this thread if you can. 

I appreciate the time you took to read this message and I am extremely grateful for your help. From the bottom of my heart, thank you."
vi5po,3,2012-06-23,How do I go about getting an internship in China (Advertising)? ,severedlimbs,China,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/vi5po/how_do_i_go_about_getting_an_internship_in_china/,"I'm a Chinese-Canadian attending university in America. Currently, I am pursuing advertising as my major. I will be spending next summer in China as I have not seen my relatives in 6 years. I thought it would be a great opportunity to gain some experience in the overseas Advertising industry at the same time. There are many reputable advertising agencies with offices in China and China-based agencies as well that seem like great places to gain experience. However, I am unclear about the hiring process in China. 

From what I've heard, internships don't seem to be common in China and hiring seems to be based more on who you know than what you know. That being said, my uncle and cousin both work in creative industry in Beijing so they may have some connections. I don't know if the Chinese job finding process is similar to the West. My parents have not worked in China for more than 10 years and my older cousins did not need internships to find a job so I don't have anybody to seek advice from. From google searches, I've stumbled on some sites for internships in China that seem kind of sketchy.

I don't mind doing nonpaid internships but earning money would be great. Doing a paid internship in China requires a work visa I presume? So that's why I'm asking almost a year in advance in case I have to apply for a visa or something like that. 

Some info about me. I'm 19, speak fluent English and Chinese (can only type Chinese, not write), conversational French. I'm currently an intern at an event marketing company doing projects in keywording, CRM marketing, photo editing, etc. I don't know where or how to begin my internship search and would like some help in getting started. Thanks in advance! :)"

I've graduated recently from a Boston university with a degree in Marketing Communication. I have extensive internship experience with a  well-known Boston agency as a Media Buyer. I have experience with DDS, am highly proficient with excel, and know my way around MS Office. My experience is predominantly traditional media: specifically broadcast with some radio, promotions, and online, but I am up for a challenge and ready to learn! I know the basics of AdWords and have worked with GoogleGrants but I am not certified. I also know the basics of Facebook ads and a bit about promoted tweets. 

In addition to internships, I managed to hold down several jobs on campus (all marketing and social media centric) while maintaining a 3.7 GPA. I have also worked on several accounts through NSAC, a national student marketing competition via AAF. 

Beyond that I'm an energetic person that loves meeting new people and learning new skills. I can (and WILL) teach myself any skills necessary to my job. I have a passion for media and knowing what makes people tick/ why marketing works.

I've been searching for months (job posting sites, LinkedIn, Alumni job listings, even newspapers) and have had several interviews but nothing has panned out. I'm becoming a bit worried I won't find something. I'm looking for any entry-level marketing leads in Boston. Tell me if you want to know more! I would love to network with people in the area.

vlfn3,1,2012-06-25,Self discovery and the battle within,[deleted],minimalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/vlfn3/self_discovery_and_the_battle_within/,"I suppose my journey of self discovery started a few months ago. The seed that grew in my mind, resulting in the person I am today, was planted by coming across minimalism by accident.

Maybe you know the feeling too. I had never consciously seen my possessions as something that was causing me some level of inner turmoil and stress. Throughout my childhood, I had acquired various things from my hobbies. Over time, those items had to travel with me as I moved for university and then internships. Packing and unpacking was always a stressful activity. You know the story.

When I came across minimalism applied to living, it was as if a light switch was thrown and the mental straps that was bearing down on my mind was illuminated, plain to see. I immediately became aware that my happiness derived from experiences, and if my possessions didn't contribute to positive experiences then they were an anchor of my spirit. I started throwing away and giving away a lot, but not all, of my things. Each time I removed something that I didn't need from my life, I became a little bit calmer, a little bit more tranquil. You know the story.

After a while, I'd made a lot of progress. I was much happier with the state of my living. I started thinking a little bit deeper about why exactly I was feeling burdened my possessions, and why I felt the way I did when I lived with less. It came down to this for me: the possessions are just an intermediary in the chain of anxiety, and at the root of it, fear.

What is this anxiety? It's not the normal kind, it lays hidden in your subconscious without you realising it. It's the chain being dragged behind you as you live your life, little by little taking parts of your spirit and time. It builds up, and when you realise it, it becomes unnerving just how long you've spent in this state. The anxiety builds because when I attach parts of my identity, of who I am as a person and my life experiences, to my possessions, I become responsible for them. I become a responsible guardian, because if who I am and my worth is in possessions, then the possessions must be protected as a part of myself. The fear simply results from the fear of losing parts of yourself, and the knowledge that you're more empty inside because of it.

So here I am yet again. The temptation to accumulate more comes with occasion, and the demons in my mind want me to put value, personal value, into them. It's easy. All you have to do is buy and store, and you feel like you're a bigger person for it. You temporarily feel like you've grown, because your possessions are part of your identity, and you have more. More is always better isn't it? We know of course this isn't true, yet this is another one of those battles that we fight with ourselves quietly, unknown to anyone, even ourselves sometimes.

The battle will be won eventually, but what's next? Minimalism was a necessary and valuable step in my journey of self discovery for who I want to be, and finding our how to live the life I want to live. Myself, I don't know where my own story goes. Perhaps you do."

I can't do that right now, so I have to listen to a constant barrage of ""what are you doing with your life?"". Both are very useful, profitable, in demand and realistically, not more expensive (as I already have a couple years of college under my belt) that going to trade school. For the record, I'm already a programmer.

Yet, every single time I talk to my family, they harp that I need to become a welder, plumber, or electrician- careers that have median earning of roughly half of my intended career; careers that also can't expect decent paying internships during the education. Regardless of how many perks I bring up, they seem to be brainwashed into believing the only profitable way to succeed in life is to do back breaking and dirty work. For the record, I don't think there's anything wrong with it. I've done construction most of my adult life. I just want to be *successful*.

Furthermore, I just spent 30 minutes arguing with my mother, who seems to believe that it's possible to begin a Civil Engineering apprenticeship after a four-month training program. No degree necessary.

Is the media feeding this impression that bad? I cannot understand where they're getting their information.

We normally get to see each other every weekend, sometimes more often if one of us gets a day off at the right time. I am 22, she is 20 turning 21 in July. We have been dating for 1.5 years.

Just recently, we ""went on a break"" because she feels we both need to think about the future and decide if we still want to be in a relationship, and that we shouldn't really see each other until we make the decision because it just makes things complicated (I vocalized that I am not a fan of this). This is due to a lot of compounding factors. She goes to school full time, has an internship, and is still working part-time, and she is worried that there will not be enough time for me to feel like I'm getting the attention I deserve (it has been an issue in the past).

So now here we are. I still want to be in a relationship with her; I mean, I love her, but I also trust her as a close friend. But it's killing me to just sit here and wait. I just got super passive aggressive with her over the phone because she came into town for the weekend to visit her friends, and visiting me was obviously not on the agenda. I'm almost never passive aggressive, but I'm at the end of my rope here and I cannot keep on being sweet and understanding. I feel hurt that she can't decide if she wants to be with me or not, because to me it shouldn't be that hard of a decision. I feel angry because part of me suspects she just wants to let me down easy, in which case get it over with and let me get on with my life.

I'm hoping someone can spoon feed me a little bit.  I'm doing a summer internship where I've been tasked at creating both an app and a web interface for something.  However all of my experience is in the linux realm using LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP).

Could someone please explain to me how exactly the following pieces fit in the puzzle:

ASP - my understanding is that this a web-centric language much like PHP is.  Yes, no?

C# - So C# is a language.  Am I correct in the understanding that it's an extension of C in the same vein as C++ is an extension of C?  If so, are people using C# to program server-side scripts (in other words is C# used to replace ASP or am I smoking crack here?).  I'm not sure if I should be aiming to use C# just for the app I'm to build or for the whole deal.

.NET - I skimmed wikipedia's page on .NET but would truly appreciate a uber-brief explanation of .NET and what this ""framework"" is for.


I realize only one of these questions is directly related to C# but I'm really not quite sure what level of integration (if any) C# has with the others.  As always, my apologies if my noobishness has caused me to post something where it should be posted. :)"

Initially I really wanted be on the investment side of analysis, but as time passed I became less picky and at this point I am willing to take anything at all that has to do with analysis.  

I graduated in the top 15% of my class from a well known University, but every place I apply is the same story: ""We need someone with more experience.""  These aren't upper level jobs I am applying to either.  They are entry level positions asking for 0-2 years, and there aren't very many of them.  Of the few entry level positions that do get posted, there are generally about 150-300 applicants per job(based off what several interviewers have told me).  

So how do I differentiate myself from the pack when I don't have experience?

Things I have tried:

Internships-  This is a dead end.  I applied to approximately 30 different internships, but I have been told by multiple recruiters that they cant hire you for an internship position if you are no longer in school, so this option is out because I already graduated.

Networking-  I contacted all my friends and family about my job search.  My family is very small and I am somewhat of an introvert so my network is not terribly large.  I ended up with 6 informational interviews and got a lot of good information(including multiple HR people reviewing my resume), but ultimately no job prospects.  I see ""networking"" mentioned frequently here, but I feel that I have reached the end of my personal network.  If you have any advice on how to improve my networking it would be much appreciated.  

Temp agencies-  I tried contacting the three agencies that specialize in temporary finance positions in my area, but they haven't returned any of my messages.  While I don't know why this is the case, I would imagine it has to do with the fact that they are looking for people with experience.  If their clients want people with experience(and I am sure they do) then the agencies are only going to hire people with experience.  

Applying to as many places as I can-  I check my schools career website, go to job fairs, and check the websites of as many local companies as I can think of(Amazon, Boeing, Blackrock, allstate, parametric, becu, ubs, Russel Investments, etc).

CFA program- With all this spare time I have not working, I decided to start on the CFA program in order to keep my mind sharp in the areas of finance.  I find out if I passed at the end of July.

Can anyone help me with my plan moving forward?

I am new to Audio Engineering and could use some direction. ,DinosaurSteak,audioengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/vkwfu/i_need_your_experience_i_am_new_to_audio/,"So I am an audio engineering student, and I want to start building things up for my studio. My immediate goals are just to start making demos for my friends and try to find an internship somewhere. I work full time currently so I have a small budget and I want to start buying gear before I have to quit. 

My goal is to eventually have a studio space.  I really could use your advice on gear I should start buying, mistakes you all have made along the way, just over all advice on purchases etc. Instead of buying stuff to get by on, I would like to buy items that I will use down the road. I am still a first year student so I am still learning about all the tools available for me to use. 

This is what I have
Macbook running Ableton, Reason, Ozone, and Garageband.  I will probably get Reaper soon. 
 1 SM57
1 Senheiser E609
M-Audio Fast Track Pro 
Alesis MK1 MK2 Active Monitors

Should I focus on getting mics first?
What other gear do you all use to get good mixes?
Should I invest in things like pre-amps initially?
Do you try to buy used gear when you can?

I have a lot of other questions any help is appreciated. 


I was thinking of first buying one of these SM57 drum mic packages.

vkvl4,2,2012-06-25,"I can't tell if i'm just nervous/have anxiety, or if something else is going on...",anxietythrowaway290,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/vkvl4/i_cant_tell_if_im_just_nervoushave_anxiety_or_if/,"Usually I would keep these thoughts to myself, but I feel like getting the consensus of the people on Reddit.

So I had been talking to this girl for the past 4 weeks or so but we hadn't hung out in 3 weeks due to conflicting busy schedules (or so I thought). So this past Thursday we finally got a chance to see each other by meeting at a bar with some friends. Now I know that the thought of seeing her got me anxious and whatnot, but I didn't think it would make me overly anxious/nervous. Long story short, I didn't eat sufficiently, I drank a little bit, and made frequent trips to the bathroom to throw up. Of course she didn't know that because she was playing me the whole time, but that's beside the point. The point is, was it the nervousness that made me nauseous or was it the lack of food I had mixed with slight drinking? 

Now move on to Friday. Right before I left for the bar on Thursday, I got the number of one of the interns I work with and it seemed that there might be something there. So the interns had already planned a trip to a brewery after work and I knew that since I wasn't talking to the first girl anymore, I could focus my energy on the intern. But this thought made my anxious/nauseous feeling come back. Not to the point that it was Thursday, but just enough that I could feel it. I didn't end up throwing up Friday, but just the fact that the feeling was still there was troubling to me.

And now, to Saturday. Some of the interns, including the girl, went to Athens to celebrate someone's birthday. I knew that I was going to actively pursue the girl, but I also could still feel the nauseous feelling...after two days. I disregaurded it becasue I knew that this was the day I had to make my move. So I drove to Athens, met up with the girl and everyone else. We pregamed. We went out. I drank a decent amount which surprised me becasue I honestly felt if I drank anything I would throw up on spot. Then towards the end of the night I ended up at her place and we made out a bit. In the middle of it I did have to excuse myself to the bathroom but I attributed that to the drinks. It was fine and we went to bed but I couldn't sleep becasue A) I was exremely hungry, and B) I was still kind of nauseous.

Woke up on Sunday. Woke her up with a kiss. Immediately excused myself to the bathroom to throw up (maybe hungover?? idk). Came back and talked a bit, then I left. Once I left I felt slightly better but I still had that anxious feeling. Tried to get rid of it all day with Tums, soup and rest but it didn't work.

So now it's Monday, and i'm sitting at work with the same nauseous anxious feeling that I just can't get rid of. There's nothing anticipatory about today other than going back to my hotel room and sleeping. I'm not gonna see intern girl until I get back in town which isn't for another 4 days. I honestly don't know where the feeling is coming from anymore. I'm wondering if I need to actually go to the doctor? I just want to feel normal.

Your input is appreciated. This is me kind of letting my gaurd down because this whole ""getting nauseous after hooking up"" thing is not fun at all and is kind of embarassing honestly. So yea...help me out please!

**TL/DR: Lately i've been getting nauseous after hooking up with someone. It happened this weekend but the nauseous feeling is still carrying over into the week. Do I need to go to the doctor or am I just overly anxious about seeing her again?**

vkoio,33,2012-06-25,here is a thing i wrote about my open relationship with a french girl from france.,bleerg,actuallesbians,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/vkoio/here_is_a_thing_i_wrote_about_my_open/,"So in October of 2009 I (American) was studying abroad in Prague. I went to the only lesbian bar in Prague, where I randomly met and had a one night stand with a French girl who was also studying abroad there at the time. We kept hooking up throughout the semester, and initially broke up when I left to go back to the states that December. But we couldn't shake each other, so decided to enter into an open relationship and try to stay together. [Here's an article I wrote two years ago about it.](http://millennialsmag.com/blog/2010/12/lesbian-long-distance-relationship/)

Anyway, in case you're wondering about what's happened since that article, I went to visit her every holiday break I had, and also spent the summer after graduation working in Paris to be with her. Last year, she took a gap year between her two years of Masters' studies to come to New York for an internship. We lived together in the same apartment with a [cat](http://instagr.am/p/LD4aH6E3NW/) for the past year, and we've grown closer and more in love with each day.

As I'm typing my girlfriend is packing her suitcase to go back to Paris to finish up her last semester of school. She'll be trying to come back to New York to work again in January, when she's done with school, and I'm planning on visiting her in Paris in October, to celebrate our 3 year anniversary (knock on wood). Long distance is hard, and open relationships a lot of work and communication, but we've grown to know each other so well that it's getting easier and easier to be together, though it may at first be hard to be apart for so long. I still feel lucky every day that I met this girl, and that we were able to figure out ways to be together and live a life together as much as possible, despite the odds."

vkn1c,5,2012-06-25,Not Enough Bits,notenoughbits,MyLittleSupportGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyLittleSupportGroup/comments/vkn1c/not_enough_bits/,"Well, I guess this is a problem almost everyone encounters, but I'd like to get it off my chest so I'm not tossing and turning at 3 AM again thinking about it. 

Basically, my lack of bits is due in part to personal irresponsibility, part in due to circumstance, and I'm conflicted about the entire thing. 

It feels like everyone I know has money. Everyone goes out, has cars, spends time traveling, whatever. Maybe that isn't the case, perceptions aren't always reality. 

And it also feels as if everyone's parents are subsidizing them except my own. While growing up we certainly weren't poor, my parents were shit financial planners and haven't really helped me out much in terms of college. A few bucks here and there, help with a few major jams, but damn, they did not plan. Oh, and the best part is my family, after convincing me college was a great plan, likes to now talk about how college isn't a good investment. Thanks for the heads up once I'm 50k in!

It wouldn't be fair to put it all on them, though. I spend too much money. I want to keep up with the Joneses, to look cool - to do what I thought everyone else was doing. My friends have nice things and go out, why shouldn't I? That attitude isn't really good torwards saving money. And while I consider myself well-educated and I'm getting good experience with my internships, they don't really pay enough. I've considered getting a weekend job, but I don't want to cripple my social life. I think about how much money I've spent on going out I could have saved - great experiences, but damn, I feel kind of stupid and I definitely need to tailor that back. 

Then it's just unfortunate events. Car breakdowns. Parking tickets. Traffic tickets. Computer breakdowns. Etc., etc....all these compounding things kind of suck. Bad planning! My car broke down, predatory cops giving out stupid tickets, my car not selling for as much as I hoped for. I barely have any money for merch at Bronycon (the ultimate in first-world problems, but still)

I know there's people much worse off in life, both in terms of parents, student loans, education, work experience and bad luck. But I still feel alittle cheated. It's probably just me feeling entitled, and I need to shake that. But when everyone else around you seems to be doing fine, you do get abit jealous. 

I really wanted to just write this out and get it off my chest, but advice, maybe your own stories, anything like that is appriciated too. Ideas on making extra money would be awesome, too. I'm saavy with computers and know abit about web design, maybe I could do simple computer repair or website design on the side for extra cash. I liked working with people, so going back to retail is a possbility. 

Thanks for listening to this first-world-problems rant. "

vkip2,4,2012-06-25,"Parents (of teenage or adult children) on Reddit, how do you deal with disliking your child's partner?",WithThePress,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vkip2/parents_of_teenage_or_adult_children_on_reddit/,"**TL;DR: My brother's girlfriend is an ass, and is making him more of an ass. My Mom wants to know, is it appropriate to say something to my brother? To de-friend her off of Facebook (she added my Mom long ago). She doesn't even want her over anymore. What would you do and what have you done?**

My parents are going through this right now. My older sister is married to the most fantastic, shy yet funny man. My parents love him. They love my sweet, nerdy boyfriend. However, for eight months my brother (25) has been dating this girl whom we've all tried hard to like, but she has pretty much no redeeming qualities.

My brother was always a real shy guy and as a result never had a lot of lady action until midway through university. When he got older I think he wanted to be less shy so he started becoming very rude and outspoken (I think he thought it would compensate for being so shy and didn't realize how rude he was being). We thought that having a girlfriend would fix that, but she's quite rude too.

They've only been to our house a few times (they live quite far) but every time they've been there they've driven my parents crazy. She really appears to be a pathological liar, she's a know-it-all, she's ridiculously condescending to my parents (especially my mother), is constantly talking about inappropriate things, and is a huge ass to me. Both she and my brother are in science fields (she's a nurse and my brother is still working on his IT degree) so they're quite condescending of the fact that I'm a writer. I just graduated and got an internship the day after my graduation and when my Dad told them after they showed up they immediately started joking along the lines of ""Yeah, I have a job that pays!"" They roll their eyes and/or mock every single thing I say.

She ""friended"" my Mom on Facebook before they even met (which explains why my Mom accepted). Now my Mom wants to take her off Facebook (how sad is it that that's actually an issue? ""I want to de-friend this person from a social networking site but I'm afraid they'll be offended). She wants to tell my brother not to come visit again if he's with his girlfriend. But at the same time, they're living together and even talking about marriage (eight months seems a little soon for a first relationship, but whatever). Is this going to be the kind of thing where you have to never say how you feel? Because it's driving my parents crazy."

I am searching for an internship in Bioinformatics in Australia at the end of this year. Right now I'm writing my Thesis at the university of Tübingen, Germany. Leaving in October with a Master Degree in Bioinformatics and 3 Years of working experience at the Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial- and Bioengineering. Despite the amount of work doing my thesis and working I want to search for an intership but I really don't how to do it best. So can anyone of you guys give me some advice whether it's better to contact IT / Bioinformatic firms directly or going for a supported program from guys like AIESEC, for instance. My grades aren't that bad. I think I will make it with a 1.3 which is comparable to a A- in the american system, I guess. So do you see any chances to set up such an intership in front of the trip from Germany or should I wait an canvass from door to door when I'm down under?

Thanks for all your replies...

One of those years was me being introduced to the subject in a casual way. A very intensive three year full time apprenticeship followed. Study trips, hands on trainings and internships included. I'm in practice for about a year now (interrupted by study trips as well). Currently I am studying Chinese Herbal Medicine.  
My main focus in practice right now is dietary and lifestyle counseling and the teaching of Qigong exercises.  
I underwent a very classical education, with a lot of one on one lessons as well as in small groups, focussing on discussion of taoist philosophy as a basis of Chinese Medicine.  
In my experience there are many misconceptions about this field of study. It is a system of medicine that functions differently than ours with a thousands of years old tradition. Many of the ""versions"" of Chinese Medicine (I will abbreviate as CM in this thread) we encounter today are oversimplified or a mixed up with certain aspects of Western Medicine, sometimes rendering it weakened in its efficiency or even illegitimate.  
In awareness of this issue, I, as a sceptical taoist on Reddit, am here to answer your questions. Throwaway for privacy reasons. I have messaged the mods about proof. Also, English is not my first language, so please forgive my mistakes! AMA!

Have no self esteem probably due to my childhood, and also hate myself consistently. As far as I remember, I have had no motivation to do ANYTHING in life. My parents hate me for being so lazy and unmotivated but I dunno what to do. I visit this subreddit sometimes and I leave exactly the same. I've pretty much destroyed my entire university career with my piss poor grades and lack of motivation to study. I try, yes, but I never get where I want to grades wise. I start off every semester exactly the same. Go to class consistently, keep up with work for a grand total of one week and then it all falls apart again. I'm pretty sure I have depression, but I just don't show it to friends/family etc. I act normal and try to make it seem nothing is wrong with me. I recently got a new summer job about 6 weeks ago, and nearly got fired. 2 weeks into the job I literally just stopped caring. Guess what, this was an ACTUAL job, with GOOD experience, yet I didn't give a fuck at all. I was so bored, some days I didn't even show up to work, other times I'd show up like 2 hours late. My boss was luckily flexible, and a nice guy, he gave me a warning that woke me up and now I try to fall back into schedule.
Regardless, this is killing me on the inside. I see all my peers getting places in life, securing awesome internships and then me, just sitting here applauding like a loser. Hey, who doesn't want to be successful? The same thing happened to me while working out. I maintained an ok workout schedule for one semester of school, after winter break came around and school resumed, I worked out a total of 3 times the entire semester. All my progress has been lost. I find life so boring. There are a few things that really interest me and I will willingly go out of my way to read/find out more about, but other than that, I don't like the field I'm planning to work in. I just do it because I can't do anything else. It's like I just don't enjoy life in general unless I'm with friends. But realistically that's not possible all the time. I have a great time with them around, and that's all it is. Sometimes I hope that watching them succeed would motivate me to do something, but it's more like ""Yeah! I should really do this too!"" and then I never follow up on that. I don't know if I can keep living like this. How can you go for a decade on end constantly hating yourself every single day for everything you do.

Anyway, this is more of a rant and maybe someone can give me some advice or whatever. Who knows if it'll make a difference."
vk82m,6,2012-06-25,What makes relationships worthwhile?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vk82m/what_makes_relationships_worthwhile/,"I have been in two legit relationships in my life. The first was with my first love. However, I was essentially a drug addict at that point. I was not a good boyfriend/partner. Eventually I realized that and went to get help. I really was ready to improve my life. I took every step necessary to get better. My girlfriend at the time was not willing to wait. I ended up getting myself clean and turning my life around. I have had successful jobs and internships since then and I am about to graduate from college with honors and making the Dean's List multiple times. I have always known that I had this capability but apparently this girl was unwilling to wait for me to get my shit together. I find all this acceptable.

However, after I got my shit together, I fell in love with another girl. She has been everything I have ever wanted in a women, except she is bulimic. I have always supported her, and especially understood because I had been through a similar situation with drugs. I have always thought that we were ""two peas in a pod"". Like we had similar personalities and philosophies on how we viewed the world. It hasn't even been a week since this girl broke up with me but I am still deeply in love with her. We were together for about 2 and 1/2 years. 

I want to fight for her and show her how much I love her. How do I do this? She said that she still loves me but is no longer in love with me, which tells me it may be over. However, she has also told me that I should fight for her, so that tells me that it may not be over?

We have lived with each other for about a year and she thinks the passion has died due to that. I feel that the love and relationship is what is important and the passion can come and go based on our actions. I mean we lived together, of course the passion will subside to a certain extent, right?

Anyways, she ended up breaking up with me out of the blue and moving out (I knew about the moving out part). I just wish I could do something to change her mind. I love this girl more than I've loved another human being in my entire life. I have also attempted to show her this. What should I do and is anything worthwhile?

EDIT: I see people talking about some feeling. But what happens when that feeling stops? Is that not just hormones causing that feeling? Is there not more to relationships than just some hormones making you feel funny? That's what I would like to hear about. If something else exists. What do people do in long term relationships to keep the passion there and the relationship fresh?

I need general motivation in life. I attend a highly-ranked university where I have good friends, but overall am unhappy and find most people there annoying. I felt like I lost myself a bit when I arrived at school and experienced an identity crisis. I often overthink myself to unhappiness. My grades are mediocre as a result of my unhappiness and inability to focus. I'm home for the summer with an internship that I'm getting kind of lazy with, and I always leave the house a mess. I hate cleaning and doing chores. I'm starting a great relationship with a guy who lives nearby and I'm really excited about it. I feel very lucky. However, I'm at the point in the relationship where I've won him over and I start to get lazy. I know there's a risk of letting him lose interest because I stop giving a shit. I've basically ""won"" in my mind because he's really into me. I'm always bad at maintaining consistent effort in relationships at this point, despite the fact that I like him. I don't want to screw it up.

Basically I'm innately lazy and need help staying motivated after my immediate accomplishments (landing an internship, getting into a good school, getting a guy who wants to be my boyfriend, etc). I need to grow up and get someone to get me on my game. My parents aren't going to do it (I was never disciplined growing up). I also just would like general guidance and someone to be honest and talk about shit with. "

vk37p,3,2012-06-25,A disheveled soul looking for relief.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/vk37p/a_disheveled_soul_looking_for_relief/,"OK, I've been perusing this subreddit for a little while now, and the overwhelming weight pressing down on me has finally compelled me to post something.  Maybe getting it out there will give me enough solace to get some sleep.

I've been feeling pretty much terrible for the last year and a half, and for the life of me I have no idea why.  By all accounts I have a pretty ok life.  I go to college, I have an internship I enjoy, I have a loving family, I am financially secure.  For whatever reason, though, I have an enormous amount of self-hate inside of me that I can't understand.

For awhile, it was something I could mask fairly easily.  Lately, though, it's gotten so much worse, to the point where it is starting to severely impact my relationships.  I'm starting to not only hate myself but everyone around me, including my family.  I've started to ignore calls and lash out when anyone asks me what's wrong.  And I simply cannot have a romantic relationship.  In the past sixth months, I've successfully chased off three girls that I had feelings for as soon as they actually became interested.  It's almost a feeling of jealousy, like why should you like me when I don't like me?

Today was the absolute worst, though.  I was given a girl's number a few weeks ago by a friend who thought we might have a lot in common. Long story short, we text messaged back and forth for awhile, I really started to like her, and she started to like me.  Out of absolutely nowhere I had a fit of anger, and I told her I didn't want to talk to her anymore, and deleted her information.  I just can't take the thought of someone actually thinking I'm an ok person.  I feel like I don't want anyone to care about my feelings.  It is completely tearing me apart inside.

Every day is like an exercise in self-deprecation inside my head.  ""Good morning, moron.  How are you going to f-up your life today?""  ""Oh hey, is that you in the mirror?  Everybody hates looking at you, ya know.""  ""Something good happen to you?  Let me remind you how much you hate yourself.""  ""You know what would be really cool?  If we thought about suicide for an hour or two.""

I can't help but think I have some deep-seated daddy-issues at the root of this.  My dad always hated me because I was ""too sensitive, like your mother.""  That was his go-to insult, that I was like my mom.  If I didn't do something right, it was because my mom never did anything right.  If he made a ""joke"" that upset me, it was because my mom couldn't take a joke either.  Of course his jokes were nothing more than callous insults making fun of how effeminate he thought I was.  His solution was to make me play football to toughen me up, rather than man up and be a dad.  He did the same thing to my mom.  If she didn't clean the house right, or make dinner on time, he cheated on her to teach her a lesson.  I honestly can't make this stuff up.  He had my mom brainwashed into believing that she deserved to be cheated on, or occasionally beat, because she wasn't a good wife.  He actually threatened to kill my mom several times, and I'm convinced he would have done it given the right opportunity.  Great guy, my dad.

My parents are divorced now, obviously, and I am out on my own, but my dad continues to be an inconsiderate ass to this day.  I hate the guy, but I'm too terrified of him to break off contact with him.  He is very good at using his position of authority as my father to bully me around.  He is an extremely manipulative guy (he was diagnosed with a personality disorder in the past, though I can't remember the name specifically), and he excels at making those around him believe he is a great guy and employing them to make me feel guilty about not wanting to associate with him.  He uses my grandmother (his mom) especially, because he can guilt trip her into guilt tripping me about coming over to his house to spend time with him.  It's a ridiculous situation.

It's getting so much harder to go about my day and not shirk my responsibilities.  I haven't even scheduled my courses for the the fall semester like I was supposed to months ago, and I have had serious thoughts about quitting my internship.  There is literally nothing that makes me happy anymore.  Baseball season used to be my favorite time of year, but I really don't even care enough to watch that anymore.  It seems easiest just to lay in bed and do absolutely nothing.   I have to work tomorrow, but I don't know how I'll bring myself to make it out.  I'm just a pathetic, depressed layabout.  

I guess I don't really know what I'm looking for, but writing this down is somewhat therapeutic, I guess.  I just really don't know where to turn at this point.  I feel too embarrassed to talk with anybody about it.  If somebody takes the time to read this though, I deeply appreciate it.  I know that the good people here understand the pain."

I want to go to UK for a medical degree, and eventually permanently settle there. Yes yes, I know, ""Why do you want to go to UK? What's wrong with US?"" The thing is, I've only been in US for about 6 years, and I never really fully liked it. I've always loved UK culture, and would like to live in it. 

I'm definately going to stay in US for undergrad, and I will use that time to get top honors, internships and money. I will also study abroad in UK so I can sort of get used to it. 

The question is, how exactly do I go about doing this? I would like to go to a really good school, maybe Cambridge? I know it's hard, but I am willing to do everything. 

I know that they have a 6 year medical program right after regular school, but I am trying for one after undergrad.

vk0a2,4,2012-06-24,Suicidal Thoughts. Thought a reddit post might help.,AlmostBreakingPoint,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vk0a2/suicidal_thoughts_thought_a_reddit_post_might_help/,"**TL/DR  college graduate. No job, no call-backs, loans about to default, stressed out too much, looking for advice** 
So, here's the gist of things, and this may or may not be a throwaway account. I have graduated from college with a Bachelor's Degree a year ago. After an internship, I stayed at my sister and her family's to help watch her kids while I searched for a full-time job. I would like to point out her husband works full time, she worked and took college classes, and she was pregnant. Now, after baby complications (sick baby) the kid is doing allright, and I have had several decent interviews. 
However, here are the biggest problems. I am not getting hired, anywhere. My nest egg for rainy days has now reached near empty, loans (90k at least) are near defaulting, I am basically mooching off her and her family, and I can't even get a minimum wage job.
I would like to point out that I love my sister and the rest of my family. I am beyond appreciative of how she has been willing to put up with me for this long. She, however, doesn't think I am looking hard enough, despite looking for both jobs for my degree and any minimum wage job I can get in the mean time. I can see her point of view of all of this. If I had the money, I would move in with my brother and hope job prospects are better where he is.
Here's the thing though. I can put up a good front, but I am psychologically fragile. I have no close friends, and barely keep in touch with anyone, besides random Facebooking. Nobody realizes how often I think of suicide. Wrists, drowning (convenient river nearby), car accident, window jumping, I've thought of ways and ways. and my sister has passive aggressive down to an art, so I end up talking to my bro-in-law, who is waaay too understanding, and has it rough being between the two of us. 
I know the reasons not to. Mostly, right now, it's that my sister's kids are used to their uncle and I wouldn't want them to see it, let alone deal with it. I also don't want one of my bros being stuck with the loan they co-signed for (+4k).  I've always told people, but I do't think they realized how serious I was, that one of the reasons I haven't gone through with it is that I'm too curious. About what's happening next in a book, seeing a new movie, wondering if I might actually get a date sometime soon. *sigh* and it doesn't help that whenever I start to get too upset after thinking about all of this, I get physically ill. I get flushed and heated, nauseous, and my throat burns. Sometimes it gets so I have to leave and go walking around at night to get tired enough to rest.  
So there you have it. Any advice, beyond the obvious ""don't do it!"" ? I've had thoughts like this before, but never this strong and this sustained. I'm not good with speaking about my feelings, especially with family. We've never been that type. And mom and dad passed away a few years ago. I've thought about joining the army but not sure how much that would help me out.
I should be on for another hour, and will probably check this again in the morning.
*edited in* I should also point out that along with all this, I have no health insurance and am currently getting teeth pain. I probably have a cavity or two, despite dental hygiene, which occasional pain doesn't help me much either.

**1hour gone**
So, not sure how to add the new little post below this, so just editing in here. I'm tired and my eyes are heavy so I think I will sleep now. Will respond to anything new when I wake... I should also point out that the past two nights I've had nightmares... and I haven't dreamed anything before this in several months. So this doesn't help my mental health much either. Thanks for the current responders, even if I can't yet and am unsure how to post this in the SW subreddit. Hopefully I will feel a little better in the morning."

I am trying to decided if the extra work and money of a BSc in Comp. Sci. is worth it over a 3 year college degree program.  While the college diploma would help connect me with an internship and help me enter the work force faster, I feel that it might limit me in my career growth.

Most of the 'good' job postings I have seen all require a BSc which makes me lean towards that route.  There are a couple of large companies in Toronto which could be potential employers (Ubisoft &amp; IBM off the top of my head)

vjt85,3,2012-06-24,This is frustrating... How do you guys get your projects out there?,[deleted],web_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/vjt85/this_is_frustrating_how_do_you_guys_get_your/,"Hi guys. I've been enjoying web development (alongside regular programming) for about a year and a half now. What's incredibly frustrating is how hard it is to get people to notice your projects. When I look back at the past year and a half, I see one project I would call successful. My first site, an attempt at an Adsense moneymaker on my favorite video game eventually blew up and has made a significant amount of money. After that, I launched another Adsense site that was a total flop. Next, I built a site called Tagzor that was focused around tagging pictures and voting on submitted tags. Another flop -- I submitted it everywhere, ran an advertising campaign on Reddit, but still hardly got any response. Throw in a mobile app with dismal results in as well.

I just today finished a new site called [YouTube RealTime](http://www.ytrealtime.com) that I've been working on for a few weeks. I have been asking for feedback from my peers at the internship I'm working and other people who would give me good feedback. I only got positive responses and was very hopeful. Some people I showed seemed really interested. But again, I can't get it out there. I've posted to Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, StumbleUpon, Digg, asked friends and family to post, everything. I'm still not getting any kind of response or further sharing. 

Out of everything I've built, I think this is by far the most impressive and creative thing I've done. People I've shown it to seemed to like it, but it's not catching on. What can I do? I think it has potential but I just don't know how I can get myself and my projects out there. I know this is a bit of a rant, but I really am looking for some advice. It's fun and all to work on this, but it's also incredibly frustrating to see nothing from it yet. I'll keep doing things like this because I genuinely like it, but I'd like some feedback on this matter."

The tree literally just snapped in half, not just a limb.

Another time we were facing a severe drought almost 2 months without any rain.  I was working as an intern at the time and I was sent to an architect's office just outside of downtown.  I parked my car and walked about ten blocks to the address I was given.  When I arrived, the building was abandoned, and suddenly out of nowhere it started to pour down rain, soaking me and the plans I was delivering.  With no shelter around I had to walk back another few blocks to find somewhere to get out of the rain.  When I call the architect to get their new address the rain suddenly stops and it didn't rain again until several days later."

Both the lifeguard job and campus job paid into a state public employee retirement system. I am going into my junior year of school and would like to find a way to avoid having to work during the school year (due to increased workload, windfall from summer internship, need more time to seek career opportunities etc).

The total value of the pension account is right around $2500. I know I can request a refund, but then I will be hit by income tax on the earnings + 10% penalty. 

Would it be possible to roll over the money into a Roth IRA and then turn around and make a qualified withdrawal for education purposes (tuition payment directly to school) to convert the entire $2500 balance without paying any taxes on it? Would this be wise?

Edit: just realized how terrible of a title that was for what I am really asking. I apologize in advance."

I'm really hitting a brick wall with my classes, and it's not because of effort. I came into university at age 20 with a severe lack of math and science skills (no substantial knowledge of math past algebra I), but somehow made it through the first 2 years on time for the most part. I was able to pull off a lot of A's and B+'s in the Calc sequence, in some of my Chem classes, etc. I've always worked hard. But I feel like i'm falling apart as I move into the actual engineering courses. I have gone from a B- to C+ and now a D in the ChemE classes i've been in (the D is a class I am currently enrolled in, Thermo). Last semester I get an A- and B+ in Multivariable calc and Diff Eq, but the C+ in energy balances. If you look at my GPA outside of engineering, it is wonderful (outside of Orgo 1, but i'm doing great the second time around, i'm taking that as well this summer).

I'm trying, i've readjusted my study patterns. My notebook is filled with notes in completely logical manner, split up by class notes, quizzes, online notes, etc. But I always fuck up on the quizzes that make up most of our grade, and it's just starting to eat at me. I basically have to start getting consistent 10's or I might fail... which will set me back a whole year with regards to graduation since the fall class is already full. I've been just as confused and frustrated in Calc and Physics before, yet found a way to get a good grade. I somehow got a B+ in Physics I while simultaneously learning Trigonometry. In the actual engineering courses, I never improve, it's like I have 600 puzzle pieces and i'm always missing a few pieces to complete the puzzle.

I feel guilty beyond all belief for so many reasons. My mom is paying for my college, and I went to community college for two years before university (tried accounting, my mom forced me to go). I feel like if I am able to graduate, it'll take 7-8 years at best at this rate. I also have a lot of stress in my personal life since I am transitioning from male to female, and have no idea how I am going to actually come out, or when, and how to correlate that to my classes. Or if my internship will even want me to stick around if I came out.

Am I just not intelligent enough to master engineering? Uhg. =("
vnkup,1,2012-06-26,Success story (and advice if you want to take it),fromcj,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/vnkup/success_story_and_advice_if_you_want_to_take_it/,"Sup dudes and dudettes,

This is a story about how anyone has a chance to beat depression. Seriously, anybody. I know some of you are like ""I've tried everything. This can't help."" but it might. So give it a shot. I promise not to offer bad advice like ""Just believe in yourself!"" or to ""take it one day at a time"" because I've been where you guys are, and I now want to see you guys get to where I am.

I had been getting more and more depressed since...December of 2009 or January of 2010. At first it was just me being totally broken up and lost after a split with my girlfriend of two years. Then I found out that she had been sexually assaulted at a party and that's what led to her retreating inwards, pushing me away, and ultimately no longer being interested in dating me at all. Then it sort of didn't cross my mind all summer, I was away from home for an internship so it was pretty relaxing.

When I got back to school in September though, it was right back down into a hole that was getting deeper and deeper. Girls didn't want to date me because I had 0 self-esteem, and I had 0 self-esteem because girls didn't want to date me. Then I started to do worse and worse in my classes. I had always had a tenuous relationship with alcohol but I basically went off the deep end at this point. I was drinking heavily. Like handles of vodka (100 proof, not 80 proof), everclear, anything that could just get me drunk super fast. And I was doing this basically every night.

So anyway, I'm gonna fast forward cause we don't need to hear all these stories about me making a fool of myself and making bad choices which all led to me becoming extremely depressed. I was pretty much thinking about suicide all the time cause I just couldn't deal with being this sad for the rest of my life.

Then one day while I was trying to get through some homework that I just had like, negative interest in, I put on an album by a band I had heard about all the time but had never tried. The band was called The Wonder Years and the album was called The Upsides. It basically saved my life because it taught me to fight. The whole theme of the album is that the guy who wrote it was too young to be this defeated by life. I'm not saying that people who are in there 40s and 50s and beyond should be okay with being depressed, but feeling totally beaten down by the world when you're still college-aged? That's the kind of stuff that leads to kids killing themselves.

I went to a therapist on campus, she recommended some guy to me, it didn't really work out. He kept trying to find a problem to diagnose me with and didn't address the fact that I was clearly depressed. He wanted me to work on my self esteem but I was like dude, you don't get it, its not that I don't have any self esteem, it's that I don't CARE that I don't have any. It didn't work out, so I went back to the therapist and asked if she had any other recommendations. She gave me two more cards for therapists that she knew personally and said they were really good. Out of the blue I asked her if she knew any physicians as well, just so I could get a physical, which I needed at the time.

I went in for my physical and regular doctor/patient stuff happened. Y'know, weight, height, blood pressure, grabbing my balls, all that stuff. At the end he asked if I had anything I wanted to talk about and I just said I was having trouble sleeping so I was hoping I could get like Ambien or some other sleep aid. He talked to me a little bit about why I was having trouble sleeping and I explained that I have anxiety, panic attacks, the idea of facing another day is so overwhelming, all this stuff. So he wrote me some prescriptions.

I got put on Celexa (citalopram) and Welbutrin (bupropion) for a while. I think I got put on them in December, so 2 years after I first started feeling this way. That's how long it took me to get help. Ridic. But they worked a little bit, and I felt a little bit better. I didn't want to die anymore, I just wanted life to be better. I left it at that and was like ok. This must be what it feels like to not be depressed. Kinda lame. Oh well.

I basically just lived my life at that point. Barely got through school, moved to a new apartment, got a new job, all that. But I wasn't feeling better. I was actually starting to get worse again. The idea of going to this job that I didn't even really like for the rest of my life was just overwhelming. Luckily, my bupropion scrip ran out, and my doctor wanted me to come in for a check up.

I went in and I told him about my issues. Still can't sleep, still getting anxiety attacks, still sad all the time, all that. So he upped my dosage of citalopram to 40mg from 20. I was really nervous about this next part and I had to fight to get it out but I told him I was thinking I might have ADHD. We went over why I thought so, I listed some of the things I do that made me think that, and he wrote me a scrip for Adderall.

Turns out that's exactly what I needed. It turns out that almost all of my problems are also problems that people with ADHD experience. Depression, anxiety, drastic mood swings, OCD, everything can co-occur with ADHD. I never even THOUGHT about it until my roommate in college got a scrip for it and it totally changed his personality from a person who did really poorly in school and didn't really care or try or anything like that to a completely average student. He did his homework, he passed his classes, he got a girlfriend, he was golden. Now that I'm on it, I feel better already and it hasn't even been a week. I've already had 3 days free of any significant, long-term bouts of depression or anxiety, I sleep better, I do my schoolwork, it's great.

So anyway, that's my story. I am the best person I've been in over 2 years, and I want you guys to know that you can reach that place too. Here are just some random bits of advice that I would give to ANYONE with depression.

* Don't be afraid to talk to your doctor about ANYTHING that might concern you because you never know what could be fueling your depression. Never just assume that you're not being effected by something.
* Don't be afraid of pills and drugs. I was, which is why I put off talking to a doctor for so long and resorted to alcohol and hard drugs.
* Establish a support network. Don't hide what's going on from your friends. They'll want to help you get better.
* Find inspiration. Find motivation. I found mine in an album (again, The Upsides by The Wonder Years. I really can't recommend it enough, I'm not kidding when I say it saved my life.) but you could find yours anywhere. 

That's it. That's all I had to do. In retrospect, it seems so simple, but I know from experience it isn't simple. All I can do is encourage you to take that first step. You'll feel so much better when the journey is over, but it can't end until it's begun. So do it for you. Get out there and do whatever it takes to feel better, because you all fucking deserve it.

TL,DR: It's not about forcing yourself to be happy, it's about not letting the sadness win."
vnkra,3,2012-06-26,"First year finished, looking to get ahead!",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vnkra/first_year_finished_looking_to_get_ahead/,"Hello,



I have just finished my first year of University studying Computer Science in the United Kingdom, after seeing so many people on my course it's really motivated me to set myself aside from everyone else come the end of the third and final year.



From my understanding, the best way to achieve this is through Intern ships, personal projects, open-source involvement and a display of passion.



Firstly, my University is teaching us Java, I believe actual coding only goes on until the end of the second year so I am eager to leave Java behind as it's continually stapled as a bad language to get into programming jobs (my desired field).



Now, Internships - specifically in the UK, how do these work? and how do I get involved? I've also seen people mention working for your Universities research department but I don't know how likely that is to happen. 

Personal Projects - Got ideas up my sleeve, but waiting to make the change over to C++ before I start making anything worthy of showcasing.

Open-Source: With my limited knowledge set of programming as of yet, how do I go about getting involved in open-source projects? I've looked through a few and they're all very very much out of my league. 


Thank you very much for your time, appreciate any replies and comments you have."

It was brought to my attention today that the CSB I am working for does not have a policy regarding religion in any way, shape, or form.  My supervisor and my only co worker are both very religious and fairly open about it.  I am not a religious person.  I work in an adult day program for individuals with severe and persistent mental illnesses.  

The conversation went something like this:
Supervisor:  I want to do a group on spirituality and mental illness and I found this great resource.
Me:  Oh great what is it like?
Supervisor shows me the website
Me:  Oh that stinks, I guess we can't use it because there is scripture in the material.
Supervisor:  That is not necessarily true.  We could take certain words out (e.g. Christianity, God, Jesus, etc.), and then it would be ok
Me:  Oh, I thought that the NASW code of ethics, not to mention the government which we receive partial funding from, would prohibit the use of religious material in this setting because it could hinder relationships with clients who would not be comfortable with this
Supervisor:  Well our accrediting agency, CARF, specifically requires that we discuss spirituality in order to address mental health holistically
Me:  Well what happens when the clients ask direct questions about their specific religion, in regard to spirituality, or anyone else's?
Supervisor:  You can say whatever you are comfortable with.  I have given religious materials to clients who I knew were religious and I have disclosed that I believe in God
Me:  I'm so confused...I was told throughout school, an internship, and a job in a non profit organization, that I was to leave myself out of interactions with clients, and when I was met with a direct personal question I should re direct the conversation and say something like, 'Why are my religious beliefs important to your treatment here?'
Supervisor:  You were not hired as a ""social worker"" (I have a BSW and am working for a CSB), therefore as an employee you are to follow agency policies when they conflict with the NASW's views

This turned into a very interesting, but emotionally draining debate with my supervisor, which led me to check out our policy manual.  Upon scanning the entire gigantic document and realizing religion was not mentioned once, I then spoke with my supervisor's supervisor (with my direct supervisor's permission) who said she would bring it to the management team tomorrow and get back to me.

I guess my question is, how is this handled at your agency, or if you are in school, what is the latest the NASW has to say in the matter? And more personally, what the hell am I to do if I find out that my agency is supporting self disclosure, and specifically disclosure about religious preferences while leading groups with clients? I would love any feeback!!

vnf6u,6,2012-06-26,How important is undergrad GPA when it comes to getting a job?,RedditAccount242,geology,https://www.reddit.com/r/geology/comments/vnf6u/how_important_is_undergrad_gpa_when_it_comes_to/,"I'm about to start my last year of my geology degree at university (in Canada) and my GPA isn't that impressive.  I didn't do so well my first two years and basically partied and stuff but this last year I really stepped up and brought my GPA up considerably (overall it's 2.37 up from 1.96).  I'm pretty confident I could bring it up another couple points this year and finish off with at least a 2.5.  I did the calculations and if I wanted to hit 3.0 I would need to get A's or A+'s in every class I take this year (challenge accepted) as well as redoing some classes and getting A's in those the following year.

Basically I could graduate in less than a year and end up with about a 2.5 GPA or graduate in 2 years and hopefully get a 3.0.  My question is what kind of career could you have starting out with BS in geology and a 2.5 GPA?  I'm not opposed to doing wellsite for 1-3 years after I graduate, save some money and make some contacts. But if I decided I wanted to go back to school and get my masters/PhD after working for a couple years would I be able to do that or would my undergrad GPA haunt me forever?  For what it's worth I haven't had any geology internship or job but I know I can get good recommendations from my professors."

",Sifilus,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vnc41/reddit_what_is_the_best_way_to_subtly_get_a/,"Backstory: I helped him get hired at my company just a few days after he finished college. I had never really talked to him aside from a ""Hey, how are ya?"" now and again. My company wanted me to find a young intern, and they were adamant that it was a male. Since he was the only male on my Facebook friends list that was on.. and based on his school work and the way he carried himself.. I got him an interview and he got the job on the spot.

Turns out I can't even hold the simplest conversation with the guy. All he does is boast about his life, and finds the need to tell everyone his opinion. He refers to a meme every time he talks to someone, and he's overly loud and obnoxious with his voice/conversations.. totally ignoring that everyone is trying to work.

He'll spend half the day with cracked.com wide open on his screen, and will get upset whenever someone hands work over to him so he can process it. (Which is his job obv.)

This is a conversation that happened not 20 minutes ago.

Annoyer: Hey sifilus! What did you get for lunch?
Me: Oh I just grabbed a turkey san-
Annoyer: Cool story bro, so I saw my friend at the store and she was.. blah blah blah.
Me: Ah.. okay cool.

Man I could just go on and on with the ridiculous hijinks this guy makes us go through. 

So again Reddit.. help me help him realize that he's annoying everyone, including the boss, and could be in danger of losing his job.

tl;dr: Helped hire what I thought was a competent new employee, turns out to be the bane of my work life. "

Industry:

Title:

Amount of experience in the field:

What you like about your job/ industry:

What you don't like about your job/ industry:

How much of your day you feel is ""wasted"" (doing things you hate/ dealing with bosses/ managers you hate):

Level of satisfaction/ fulfillment/ accomplishment your job brings you: 




If you have anything you'd like to add, please feel free, and please be honest. I'll start.





Industry: Retail Banking

Title: Client Service Representative

Amount of experience in the field: 1 year

What you like about your job/ industry: I love talking to new people everyday, and to some extent, feel like I'm helping them.

What you don't like about your job/ industry: The reputation that banks have nowadays, sales goals, and micromanagement.

How much of your day you feel is ""wasted"" (doing things you hate/ dealing with bosses/ managers you hate): I love who I work for, but a lot of my day is filled with menial tasks and reports.

Level of satisfaction/ fulfillment/ accomplishment your job brings you: Honestly, little to zero. I go home feeling like I have accomplished nothing and don't get much self satisfaction from my job. This is my biggest issue with my current path. The pay is great in banking (eventually investments or advising), but I don't get any self fulfillment from it and feel like I'm wasting my life away.

I'm an intern at a company, doing something that is completely irrelevant to my degree path. So naturally, I have gradually become a glorified tech support/excel spreadsheet guy for my floor. Now, every office has at least one guy, you know the guy, the one who doesn't understand why he has to put a $ sign in front of a row or column value in order to keep it in place. Well, one day, this guy was being more vocal than usual - a normal day usually doesn't go by without at least one loud profanity coming from his office because of his technological frustrations.

This time it was different.

""FUCK. SHIT. STUPID FUCKING COMPUTER FUCKING PRINT.""

I finally had it and went over to his cube to see what the hell was going on.

""So, what's up derp?""

""Oh, nothing man, the usual garbage. This computer and printer won't fucking print!""

So I asked him to go to the side and let me figure stuff out. I open the spreadsheet, and at this point I simply have goal: to print this fucker's job so he can shut the hell up. This meant ignoring the plethora of #NAME!s and #VALUE?s that plagued his spreadsheet. I go to print the workbook, and lo and behold, he'd been using a printer located on another floor.

So I explain to him what's happened, and tell him that I'll be back with his documents. Nothing could've prepared me for what I saw when I got to the other floor. This was a 50ish page print job, printed about 20 times. I enter the print room and find another employee waiting for the print job to complete.

I am interning for the summer at a small business and they want to do a Domain Upgrade this summer. We have about 30 users, and I have just a couple of questions. What do you recommend for Anti-Virus, Backup Software/Method. I am sure I have hardware right as my specs have been on par with what consultants are recommending. One consultant thought backup to disk was fine, and the other thought it was ridiculous and the only way to go was tape. I was thinking it would be reasonable to use our DC with raid 5, w/ hot spare, and a NAS w/ raid 1 for backup storage. I understand the want for storing data off site, but our off-site storage is only a mile away. The building is a new brick building with excellent fire suppression, we don't get tornadoes often (southwest Wisconsin), the it room is in the same room as the severe weather shelter, and if it floods 1000 feet above sea level we have bigger problems. 

Do any of you know of a good Domain Upgrade Checklist so I can be sure I haven't missed anything in the install plan.

Thanks,

I was always interested in Engineering and ended up at a Liberal Arts school. I transferred from there to another Liberal Arts school, which had a 3:2 program i.e. do three years of prerequisite classes and then two years at RPI or Columbia to finish the Engineering degree. I got very overwhelmed at first with that program and switched to getting a History degree and pursued that for the next two years (all this overwhelming and switching occurred within the first month and 1/2 at my new school). By the time Junior year came to a close, I had been thinking about my future much more than before, and realized I would rather pursue Engineering than History, though I only had one more class left for the degree requirement for History and would have had to transfer and basically start all over to get an Engineering degree. I decided not to quit and waste more money and time, and finished my degree. I did however start taking steps to apply to graduate school for Mechanical Engineering, as that is what interests me most. I took Calc I as a summer class and due to the fact that I had to finish general requirement classes for my school and the Calc II classes filled up instantaneously, as well as Linear Algebra and Physics I, I was unable to add some more classes to my repertoire. Spring semester this past year (I graduated in May) I took Physics I and Intro to Materials Science to continue my pursuit. Tomorrow (Wednesday 6/27) I will be taking my final in my summer Calc II class. I originally applied to BU's LEAP program and was denied from there as well as another university in my area. I should also mention I have taken the GRE and did pretty well on it. I did also graduate from a VERY reputable school, though I didn't expect it to carry much weight in my graduate endeavor.

I currently have one more school to apply to in the area, but as of now I'm feeling pretty discouraged about the whole thing. I didn't assume I would get accepted to grad school without a Physics, Math, or Engineering background, but I thought I may have been waitlisted or something similar. Do you guys have any advice on classes, course of action, or anything in general? I have tried to apply for internships, paid, unpaid, slave labor, etc. just to get some experience, but obviously the companies will take an Engineering degree seeking the position over me, which I do not blame them in the slightest for. Are there any programs you guys would suggest to me? I appreciate any and all suggestions and help, and thank you for reading!

EDIT: I just remembered to mention I graduated with a 3.01 GPA (overall) and am part of two national honor societies, A in Materials Science, A- in Calc I, and an A in Physics I. I am expecting a B or B+ in Calc II. This is just to say that I am capable of the workload for the schooling required for the degree, not to try and say I am a genius or any nonsense like that.
EDIT 2: In response to a comment, I do also have 4 years of CAD experience from high school, though not in college."

When we began dating, I was applying to medical school. Three years and two application cycles later, that is not going to happen for me. In the meantime I moved from California to the East Coast to be with her while she completes graduate school. School has been tough on her, and I've been doing my best to support her. However, we've had arguments, small but recurring, over what I should be doing with my life. I simply don't know what to do next. In the meantime, I've taken two jobs, one teaching, one in a restaurant. We both know that this isn't furthering myself.

My gf is also foreign (she's also a redditor, so forgive me for being vague). We've already had to do stints of ldr, and while not ideal, we've made it work. 
This summer she's doing an internship abroad, and when she left a month ago, things were ok. We skyped yesterday, and within two minutes she burst out crying, saying that she can't be with me anymore. 
I know her parents are successful, and though we've met a handful of times, I'm not sure how they interpret my failure to become a doctor. I know they visited her before she broke up with me, but I didn't have my wits about me when I spoke with my her. I have no idea what caused this decision. 
She said that we're different people and that she feels like she's preventing me from developing myself. I think I just need time to figure out what I want to do with my life. 

I created this throwaway because I'm lost, and could really use some advice. I've emailed her, despite her request not to talk for a while, just to get some answers as to why she felt the need to break up.  

Should I give her space for the entire summer? Am I being foolish in trying to convince her she's wrong? I saw a quote while browsing this domain of sadness that went something like this: my grandparents say the reason they've been able to stay together for 60 years is that they never fell out of love with each other at the same time. Is it possible for a relationship to overcome something like this? "

I had a brief web design internship with a local business that ended due to some illegal business practices, I've also been contracted for design work a few times by friends and some start-ups. I'm also fairly skilled with a pencil, I've  been drawing since childhood. 

I'm pretty confident in my knowledge in Photoshop, and Illustrator. My web design knowledge goes as far as creating a basic website in Dreamweaver, some HTML/CSS, and FTP and SEO. I hardly know any PHP,HTML5, and Javascript. I also don't know that much. about Flash.

I'm looking for more information on Color Theory, because I always have trouble picking great color schemes, I know basic color theory from Art classes that I've taken but I want to know more! As well as arrangement or formatting, making my design ""flow"" better visually. A stronger knowledge of coding, I ideally want to be a web based graphic designer, doing logos,websites, and other web related work. I grew up in Shadowness, Spoono and Deviant Art and I've always wanted a career in web based graphics design. 

   Due to alot of personal issues that have gone on in the past few years, I feel like I've been delayed from progressing towards my goal. Now I think I'm ready to be serious and start working towards my goal. If anyone is willing to mentor me, or knows of any design related mentorships please let me know. I'm also looking for Internships, but I really don't know where to begin with that, so if anyone in the field has any advice or can point me in the right direction please PM or post below. Thanks a ton for reading and I look forward to your responses =)

I know the basics of AdWords and have worked with GoogleGrants but I am not certified. I also know the basics of Facebook ads and a bit about promoted tweets.

In addition to internships, I managed to hold down several jobs on campus (all marketing and social media centric) while maintaining a 3.7 GPA. I have also worked on several accounts through NSAC, a national student marketing competition via AAF.

Beyond that I'm an energetic person that loves meeting new people and learning new skills. I can (and WILL) teach myself any skills necessary to my job. I have a passion for media and knowing what makes people tick/ why marketing works.

I've been searching for months (job posting sites, LinkedIn, Alumni job listings, even newspapers) and have had several interviews but nothing has panned out. I'm becoming a bit worried I won't find something. I'm looking for any entry-level positions related to Media planning/buying or SEO. 

Tell me if you want to know more! I would love to network with people in the area."
vmrzx,1,2012-06-26,Update since everyone was so supportive last time I posted.,[deleted],entwives,https://www.reddit.com/r/entwives/comments/vmrzx/update_since_everyone_was_so_supportive_last_time/,"I posted back in February about my roommate calling the cops without saying anything to me for smoking a one hitter for the first time in my apartment. I just want to say thank you to all of you for being so supportive. My friends helped a lot too. She got me kicked out as well, so some friends let me stay in their extra room. When I went to court I ended up paying 1200 bucks and got 6 months probation (I won't start until August, when I get back from my Co-op job this summer, and it'll be shortened because of that). I've already stopped smoking though. The misdemeanor will be taken off at the end of the probation. A few weeks ago I finally got the courage to tell my boss. I'm working a software engineering Co-op job so I was scared I fucked that up, but my boss is really chill. He was fine with it and said he definitely wouldn't fire me for it. Last week I did an interview for an aerospace/defense/tech company internship next summer, and he told me to keep in touch, said he didn't know much about the paperwork and stuff but that it doesn't start until December. When I said my boss could put in a good word he told me it wasn't necessary and that the interest is enough. I told him about the arrest since I didn't want to get my hopes up, and he was super cool with it, said he and many others made mistakes in college and it just happens, no big deal. I feel a million times better and I'm so excited. His team works on missile defense targets. Fuck yea. 

So I just want to say even when things seem to not be going so well, it will get better. I was dumb and the past 2 years of amazing friends and Reddit/other internet sites put me in a daze that anyone my age was cool with it. Not everyone is. Be careful out there. Don't trust everyone. I have a hard time in that I trust people right away if they are decent to me. I'm just happy I didn't fuck up my career. Oh, I never got revenge and one of the other roommates moved out after I did. 

Tl;dr: I fucked up, it all worked out. Don't trust everyone. "

Any advice greatly appriciated!",[deleted],resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/vmroq/resume_critique_need_to_add_new_stuff_to_cv_but/,"Hi everyone, I'm a university student applying mainly for entry level retail and secretarial jobs. Here is my [resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/p6yl76m7x8jarp4/cv%20for%20reddit.docx). 

I have a couple of things to add to it, but as the title says I’m not sure how to ‘phrase’ them in my resume. 

I worked on an archaeological dig and it helped me update a few skills. 



•	Better experience with Excel and Access. Got really well acquainted with it. 

•	Helped younger students to get used to the style of organisation and paperwork system used to process finds. 

•	Taught younger students how to fill out sheets and create site drawings. These can be pretty complex. 


Problems I’ve found with my CV:


•	I don’t sell my skills enough; I’m trying to get better at that.
 
•	The only ‘work experience’ I have is an unpaid two week internship at a bookstore and a lot of casual babysitting and dog-walking. I come from something of a rural wasteland where there were no jobs to be had by the young and experienced. 

I made the mistake of carrying this on once I went to university, and didn’t take the opportunity to get a real job as soon as I could. 

EDIT: I'm also disabled. Should I include this in the resume?

I know this is quite a lot, but I’ve been to my University’s careers advice office and they were quite useless and refused to even glance at the CV! Any help and critique would be hugely helpful! Thank-you!

My focus was Marketing Management.  At the time I was the manager of a small business and was doing / had great experience in retail sales.
  
In my final year of college some personal stuff happened and I found myself unhappy in my job or home town.  So I applied to some internship and international experience programs.  I ended up picking one that got me an accredited MBA and had ""working experiences"" in London and Thailand.
  
It ended up being a difficult program which was heavy on finance and writing requirements.  But I spent a good long while traveling around Europe and Asia.
  
I came back at the end of 2009.  I finally found steady employment in May 2010 and for the last two years I've been working as a ""lead generation representative"" for a small software firm in a major metro area.  
  
I'll be 27 next month.
  
I'm not happy with a career in sales / business development.  Although I love working in business and had the opportunity to do business related finance and marketing work as a part of my MBA.
  
I want to become an expert in something I care about and that other people respect.  I thought sales could be a good foot in the door to a career in management.  You know a career ladder.  Or something.
  
It isn't working.  After weighing my options I've looked into taking accounting classes at the local community college part-time.
  
My undergrad GPA was 3.56 and my MBA GPA was 3.45.  I haven't started community college courses yet... I'm very nervous about being a returning student and nervous about my recruitment prospects following such a transition.
  
I also own a condo (I bought it for a song) and I'm terrified entry level accounting positions won't pay well enough for me to meet my mortgage payment/fees.
  
I'm filling out the applications today and... so apprehensive.
  
Has anyone here taken a similar career leap?  Did it work for you?  Am I starting too late to get a CPA?"

**Facts**

I am in the technology field, and have been working mid-level positions for about 5 years. I have about 6 months of community college under my belt before I dropped out and started working full-time. I also have a fiance and a 2 year old I am supporting. I make enough to survive, but not enough to break away from living check-to-check or save much of anything.

**Decision**

I've been feeling super stagnant the past year, I've been drowning hours into a salaried position with no recognition and falling off the cutting edge of my field do to my family demands and all around exhaustion. This led me to start looking for a new job on the side. I sent my resume out to a few places, and one of my old colleges from my first job noticed. He works for a prominent start-up in my field.

I said what the heck and interviewed. Five 1 1/2 hour phone interviews later, I got an offer. They really like me, but feel that I need a bit more polish before they can accept me for the full-time gig. Their offer, a paid internship for &lt; 6 months with the option of that full-time job I was shooting for. The job is in San Fran (re: $$$$) and I am in suburbia ($$) across the country, 2 months into a lease with 2 dependents. I haven't replied yet, but the full time gig came with a relocation package, I'm not sure if this does, and how this would be feasible or safe for my family.

So I ask, what would you do? I will online all day today."

Hello, like the title says I've been in a relationship for three years with a wonderful girl (Kara 20F) who I care for so much but the problem is, I'm (21M) gay and I'm unfaithful. I've known I was into guys since I was 14 and have pretty much never doubted it but I've tried to fight it ever since. I have known Kara since we were kids and we have always shared a bond and me in my naivety thought with her unknowing help I could beat the feelings I was having for the men in my life.

I asked her to be my girlfriend on my 18th birthday and since then on the surface everything has been great. About six months into our relationship I had my first relapse so to speak, I had to be in a different state for six weeks for a minor internship for a company I wanted to work for in the future and in my time there I met a guy (21 like me now) and fell for him completely. I didn't do anything sexual but we spent hours every night talking and it meant the world to me. That raised some flags because that was the first time I had truly emotionally fallen for a guy.

A year later me and Kara move to that same place because she had been accepted to a great school, and I followed her because I was able to get a job at the same company I interned for the year before. Well, you can see where this is going, I met him and 4 month later I cheated and I'm not going to lie, it was incredible. I was able to feel the real thing, unfortunately the aftermath was awful. Just an hour after the sex, the self-loathing I felt was at it's highest point, I drove around for two hours crying like a little girl.

I was raised in a very conservative home where if you are gay, you're dead. My dad is a pastor, and my mother is no worse but she repeats everything he says as it's gospel. I haven't spoken to my mom and dad or my brother since I was 18 so that isn't the problem, it's what they left in me. This apparent inherent hatred for who I am.
Anyways, I felt so bad that I didn't speak to him for a month. I told him I wasn't gay and it was just alcohol and horniness (I don't even drink) that made that happen. I decided out of respect to my gf(I know, pathetic) to quit my job and get another one.

That isn't the end, I went to a convention three months ago and he showed up, begged me to talk to him and me being still intoxicated with him gave in and we talked for hours, we cried, we laughed and on the last day of the convention; we had sex.
Since then we've met up three times and had sex. He tells me to leave Kara and I know it's the right thing to do, but I'm not ready to be out and somehow losing Kara means it may be me giving up on what I promised my self at 16, to hide the fact I'm gay forever.

The shame get overpowering sometimes not only because I'm gay but what I'm doing to the most decent human being I know. Kara is beautiful, smart, funny and understands me. I really do love her but not in that way... It's hard to explain. She doesn't know anything, I've become to good of a liar, one of the things you pick up being a closeted gay man.

I have no idea why I came here, but getting this off my chest felt good. Has anyone else gone through something like this and if so. how did you deal with it?

tl;dr: I'm gay in a relationship with a wonderful girl, met a guy and fell for him, cheated and feeling pathetic and helpless.

Edit: Thanks for the replies guys, it has helped. I'm going to try to breakup with her in the next two weeks. Again, thanks."

But after the first few weeks, I am having doubts. I don't really want to get into the specific reasons right now, but basically I feel like leaving. Now I'm definitely not good at having these kind of talks, so I was thinking, if I decide to quit, to send an email to my boss over the weekend and tell him that it isn't working out and I've decided to leave, and then just not come in. Is this an acceptable thing to do, or do I need to tell him like 2 weeks in advance or something? I really just wanna avoid any awkwardness by telling him I wanna leave and then working for a few more days. I feel like sending him an email is the best way to express my thoughts, rather than in-person, since I am really bad with these kind of face-to-face things.

George Washington University - Elliott School of International Affairs

Double Major in IA and Philosophy

Minor in Korean (I'm not Korean, by the way)

Rising sophomore.

First semester of Freshman year, my grades were decent. A 3.3 I believe. Second semester I bit more than I could chew (5 classes, a job, an internship, and I was sick for 3 months straight) and my GPA must have dropped by a whole point. Now, I know I can very easily sail around the upper 3.0's maybe even skim 4.0, but seeing how bad I did Freshman year makes me wonder: can those bad grades hinder my chances of getting into Law School to a huge degree or are they negligible if I apply myself and do significantly well the following years? 


On a side note, I've interned at a government agency against corruption and at the legal department of a large corporate bank. I have recommendation letters from both.

Can't really make a TL;DR...

*Preface: This is a complete first-world problem, I know. Moving on:*

I have a fair bit of disposable income from my engineering internships, with no outstanding financial obligations, and I was planning on getting a new Macbook Pro Retina (RMBP).

What's making me hesitate:

1) I have a great Dell XPS 15z currently (picked it up using some lab grant money just a year prior - dual core i7, 8gb RAM, SSD + HDD combo, .97"" thick, 1080p screen, Windows8)

2) Early adopter ""curse"" with Apple - I've heard numerous times it's advisable not to get the first generation of anything Apple, even with Applecare, due to unforseen bugs/kinks.

3) Firmly Android - I have no intention of getting an iPhone anytime soon (not a big fan of the UI, as well as Apple's policies toward locking everything down, ""walled garden"", etc. - not negotiable at this point). That being said, will I lose some nice functionalities going with OS X without an iOS device? 

Will the notification center/Growl replacement and upcoming improvements in Mountain Lion not be applicable at all for me without an iPhone?

4) Waiting for Haswell (Intel's next-gen, big generation-gap architecture coming next year). I want this MBP to last me a good 3-4 years + have great resale value, but since I don't *need* it now, I'd like to get Haswell if I could. Then again, I'm not even sure if Apple would incorporate Haswell chips into the 2nd-""gen"" RMBPs next June-ish...

-----------------------------------------------------------------

I've had a fair amount of experience with OS X (my parents have an iMac, and I've hackintoshed several older computers I've used prior). No particular preference between Windows and OS X for me, I like both. I just really want a hi-res screen while my perfect eyes stay perfect :P

We need help!",lblove,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/vm52s/separated_from_my_boyfriend_for_a_year_by/,"I fell in love last spring with a good friend. He is the kindest, most gentle person I know. We decided to maintain a long distance relationship since I was going away for Grad school in New York. (We live in the LA area). We saw each other a few times during the past year, but were constantly looking forward to this summer. I got an internship back home so that I could come and be with him. In April, however, he was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia. He went to UCLA for a second opinion and they changed his diagnosis to MDS. (A less intense cancer of the bone marrow). So we got a couple weeks together, although we still had to deal with the unpleasantness of outpatient chemo treatments and bone marrow biopsy (the most horrible medical torture I have ever seen). Now, he has been re-diagnosed with AML and is in the hospital undergoing induction chemo. He is miserable and barely wakes up for more than 3 minutes at a time. I rarely even get to see him smile. I don't want to make this too long by going into details, so I will just say that we have both suffered other unwarranted difficulties in our young lives (we are 26) and it just seems like somebody has it in for us. 

I am requesting any financial support that you can offer. We have a fundraising page [here](http://www.youcaring.com/fundraiser_details?url=helposcarpayformedicalexpenses&amp;fundraiser_id=2706) where you can donate. What I really wish for is to receive enough aid so that when and if he gets through this, we can take a vacation together. Not necessarily something fancy. I just want to give him the gift of a brief escape where we can finally enjoy each other. I clearly have no shame in asking for help from strangers. At this point, I just want to help him. If the only way I can do that is by soliciting money so that he doesn't have to deal with financial stress, I'm okay with that. 


TL;DR - My boyfriend has Leukemia. We've been doing a long distance thing for a year waiting for this summer. Now he is spending it in the hospital. I'm requesting donations [here](http://www.youcaring.com/fundraiser_details?url=helposcarpayformedicalexpenses&amp;fundraiser_id=2706) to help with medical expenses and perhaps if anybody is feeling extra-generous, to help me take him on a mini-vacation when he gets out."
vm471,12,2012-06-26,"I hate to be that guy, but I need some advice.",tsr7851,gaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/vm471/i_hate_to_be_that_guy_but_i_need_some_advice/,"So, after seeing all of the posts of people getting pissed off over the change in attitudes here in /r/gaybros I was admittedly hesitant on posting this, but I have a quick question on how to deal with a relationship problem.

There was this guy that I liked for a short while that I decided to friend on facebook even though I didn't really know him. I had no clue whether he was gay or not, but I just decided to buck up and start messaging him. Pretty soon, we were talking regularly and found that we had similar interests in quite a few things so I eventually went out on a limb and asked him if he wanted to go see a movie sometime. We went on a few dates and everything was pretty great; I hadn't imagined that I would ever actually find a bf in high school (I'm 17) let alone a hot Filipino one. 

After a few dates, however, he became more attached while I started to lose interest. We have a lot in common; he is a gaymer, he has a good sense of humor, and he is smart. However, we share quite a few differences as well- he is more of a girl's guy, while i am more on the ""bro"" side of the spectrum; he is not at all athletic, while I am; he isn't a huge music person, while I am; he is also big on partying and doing drugs a lot, while I am not too keen on the idea of doing anything that is particularly unhealthy to myself. To add to this, he can't drive himself anywhere, so I have to drive 20+ minutes to pick him up from his house and do whatever. This just makes me feel like it is a chore to be with him sometimes. I know this sounds selfish, but I can't help feeling this way. Most of the time, when I suggest that we go spend time together by going out and experiencing the outside world, he just wants to go to his house and make out, which is fine in moderation, however, I find it to be kind of a turn off when it  happens every chance we see each other.

My initial crush on this guy just sort of fizzled off and I just can't feel a strong mutual connection. Being a noob in the dating field, I'm not sure if this is a common feeling or not. To add to this situation, I have yet to come out to my family and some of my friends, which makes the process of spending time with him and finding an alibi constantly very stressful. Maybe I'm just not ready for a relationship right now since I have some other issues to deal with in addition to my busy schedule and internship at the moment.

I feel the need to break it off, but I am not sure of the best way to do this. He is a really nice guy and I really want to minimize the hurt dealt on him if possible. What should I do in this situation? Should I reconsider my feelings, or should I go with my gut? I know this all sounds very naive, but this is what I need to know and I am admittedly a novice on these stomping grounds. I would rather ask a childish question than make a childish mistake.

Tl/dr-Met a great guy, didn't make a mutual connection, he is very into me but I feel the need to break up, what do?

P.S. I would like to thank everyone here at Gbros for giving me the strength to even attempt going for a relationship right now. I am almost positive that I wouldn't have even considered having the confidence to do this had I not stumbled upon this great place. You guys are the bomb!

vm469,5,2012-06-26,Just a little confused.,throwawayforavicethx,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/vm469/just_a_little_confused/,"Okay. So where to begin.. Since high school I would consider myself as a thinker. I have always thought to deeply into things, I guess. I went to high school at the town I lived in, which had about a 4k population tops, very small. I hated it. I hated every idea I could give myself for hating it. 

After high school, I went to a huge city to go to college. I went four hours further than anyone else did from my high school, just to show how unusual that was. I figured at such a different place, I was bound to enjoy it drastically more than high school. However, I found myself growing old of it and wanting something new. I felt as if I was just sacrificing time for my degree. This was freshman year.

Now, after my freshman year, I am doing an intern at a family member's law firm about eight hours from home. I get paid, but I hate it. I feel like I'm doing tedious things that someone shouldn't get paid for; feeling useless is probably the worst feeling in the world. So I guess my question is. . . I have no question, I guess. I'm just sick of my emotions, they suck. I can't remember the last time I was genuinely happy with where I was in life.

I just feel as a human, the only entitlement I have is life and death. My emotions will always be like this. There is not a storybook moment for everyone, and luck is a lottery that is not biased on morals.

Sorry if this turned into a rant. I needed to get this out."

I'm heading into my junior year as a mathematics major at UC Berkeley but I'm in Los Angeles until mid-august. I have no employment and didn't have the chance to apply to REU's (which I'm really bummed about). I've got three years experience tutoring and am certified through CRLA, but this doesn't help much because the demand cuts off so sharply in summers.  
  
Knowing this, what do you all do or have done in summers to keep busy without classes or research? Honestly it's getting to the point where I might have to consider trying to find a job in fast food or something of that persuasion just to have some cash flow.

vlx37,11,2012-06-25,[FR] Two different worlds: Chem Girl and Earth Girl,ThrowawayPUA,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/vlx37/fr_two_different_worlds_chem_girl_and_earth_girl/,"I'm working on a contract job, high security, nondisclosure agreements, secure facility in a bunker on a big open corporate campus. All I can say about it is is there are two sides of this gig, the math side (the side I'm on) and the chemistry side. I wish I was on the chem side, it's just like all the STEM jobs (science, technology, engineering, math) the women are all on the chem, med, and bio side and the guys are all on the geeky math/quant side. There is one girl I have my eye on, she's a manager, she's hot and she knows it (note: yoga pants are not proper corporate attire, but I approve). I'll call her Chem Girl. She's a manager so she looks down on all the contractors like me. She is a tech woman who is rising to the top and she is hard as nails.

I was thinking Chem Girl was a woman I should run some game on, especially since she's in another department and it wouldn't affect my job. Then I overheard her Friday afternoon, whining on her cell phone to her girlfriends about how they wanted to go out and she wanted to work. It was most unattractive. I figured this is a woman with none of the personality traits I'm interested. Sure she's hot, she might even be smart. But her heart is as cold as ice. Still, when I talk near her, she turns around and I immediately have her attention. I don't know what's going on there.

So today I was walking out to a break, behind Chem Girl and the other best dressed woman in the facility (note: fuck-me pumps are not proper corporate attire, but I approve). I'm about 6 feet behind them, trying not to pursue, or be seen pursuing. I'm actually having to slow my pace to not overrun them, because they're chatting and walking so slow. So as I get out near the park area, under the trees where I usually hang out, there are downed branches everywhere. It was a windy day, but it couldn't be bad enough to knock down all those trees. Oh poor trees. I blurted out, ""oh man what is all *this?*"" just sort of talking to myself. Chem girl turns back, she's kind of edging around all the branches blocking the sidewalk, and she looks at me. ""Yeah, what the..? Oh, they're pruning, must be a gardener around here somewhere. Oh there she is."" Chem Girl and High Heels Girl stroll off to their car, and I see the blonde gardener sitting at the base of a tree, pruning some plants. She waves and gets up to come over and chat. She's kind of hot in a rugged sort of way. She's younger than me but still close to my age, she has long blonde hair, she's wearing khaki shorts and hiking boots, a flannel shirt, and leather gloves. I'll call her Earth Girl. 

When I'm on breaks, it is hard to decompress. I have 10 minutes, I spend the first minute calculating how much time I have to smoke, check email on my iPhone, grab one more cup of coffee, and get back in the cockpit for more math. My mind is a highly caffeinated whirl of polynomial factoring, linear equations, oh hell I need to stop thinking about it but I can't. But hey, here's a cheerful girl, even the type I like, I talk to everyone and she's a hell of a lot friendlier than the chems and quants.

So we strike up a conversation. ""I hate to cut down all the branches but they're all dead, they have to go."" I said, ""oh yeah, I know, when I was a kid, I worked landscaping. Nobody likes to think about cutting down all their nice plants, but they grow better when you cut them back."" She's instantly interested, we get to talking about plants and landscaping. I don't notice it at the time, but she's throwing me some classic IOIs, she's cocking her hip, flipping her hair and ""grooming"" (which is amusing me because she's smeared with dirt, which is kind of sexy). She's even playing coy, holding up her handsaw and hiding her face behind it when I tease her. She is pretty forward in questioning me, she asks me if I worked here long, no I'm just a contractor. She says she wishes she could get on full time, she's just an intern. I wish I was full time too, I could use the work. etc. etc. It is such a pleasant day, cool and breezy, unlike yesterday when it was 99 degrees, we are having fun procrastinating from our jobs, and lost track of time.

In retrospect, she was really interested, and I was probably one of the few people that might impress her or even have anything in common with her, on her rare contact with those mysterious people doing secretive things inside faceless corporate offices, while she wandered through the grounds, maintaining the immaculate campus, all alone.

And I wish I had noticed all that. What I did notice is that just as things were getting interesting, Chem Girl walks past me on her way back into the facility. Oh hell, break time is over, it will be bad if I get back from break later than the managers. I'm thinking dammit I didn't have time to check my email, and already my head is switching back to Euler's Formula, power series, and combinatorics. I check the time on my phone, and make an excuse, ""oh no I have to get back to work. It was nice talking to you."" And I completely eject, while Earth Girl wistfully waves and says goodbye.

An hour or so later, as I'm grabbing my 5th cup of coffee for the day and have a moment to myself to think, looking out the window of the break room, and wondering if Earth Girl was out there, that it hit me: I'm a goddam idiot. What I *should* have done was say, ""Hey we should continue talking sometime. Give me your number and we'll talk later."" I even had my phone in my hand, and turned on, poking buttons on it. I had a perfect time constraint to give her a sense of urgency in giving me her number. I knew to do all of this, and *I did not do it.* Suddenly, I could sense Earth Girl's obvious disappointment in my ejection. Yes, she wanted me to ask her for her number. And it never even entered my mind, I was preoccupied with work. I will probably never see her again. I might as well be on another planet.

tl,dr; attracted a hot girl and totally failed to realize it, or do anything about it. Well at least I'm creating attraction without really trying, I'll count it as a win.

Until last night,AnonymousRebel,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/vltq1/everything_going_great_so_far_until_last_night/,"So, I'll make this short. My gf is at an internship over the summer, where they like to party over the weekend. She told me yesterday about the weekend, where she got really hammered, did crazy shit, etc. Nothing I hadn't heard from her before. 

However, when I asked her if anybody tried taking advantage of her, she said no, but said that she did dance with other guys. Coming from her, I knew what this meant. This made me a bit upset, and I voiced that. She then apologized. I told her I'm not trying to control her, but I just want the best for us, and to understand where I'm coming from (I was in a previous 7-month relationship where I was cheated on for pretty much the whole time behind my back). She said she did, and that she wants the best for us as well. For the year and three months we've known each other, this is the closest we've come to fighting about anything. 

Anyway, was I in the wrong here? I still love and trust my girlfriend, but I feel like this damaged it in a way. Help?"

[What does a vagina look like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55afe7?context=5)|Actually relative to the course of humanity, no question is more relevant for a man to know definitively.
 |But knowing what it looks like is less important than knowing how to get there. And if long-term enjoyment is your objective, you also need to figure out how to stay.
[Also, what do you think of Dell's announcement that they're going to move away from consumer computers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55ams1?context=5)|Every few years, Dell says they want to move away from low-margin consumer PC where they can't make much money.
[Isn't HP pretty much in the same boat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55erbf?context=5)|Yes, but they're #1 and do a lot of other things.
[But what's the long term value in remaining in that market? It seems applications and content are where it's at. A company that can support that growing sector with enterprise hardware and services has an advantage over a company that puts too much into consumer hardware, especially as Apple slowly takes that space away. Wouldn't Dell want to make that move?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55fzxy?context=5)|I think so, but have to do it via M&amp;A since Dell has almost zero R&amp;D in house.
[Their enterprise services are basically being eaten away by Oracle and they are widely viewed as less competent than IBM.  They are #1 in the printer market but isn't that a shrinking market due to tablets etc? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55hebt?context=5)|Services - they have some work to do, but the infrastructure is all there. Need to rebuild their bench of talent and wrap up all the bad contracts signed under Hurd.  Networking is a decent business and they are maintaining their position there.
 |Printer is in secular decline, but a very strong cash generation business in the mean time.
[Do you have any insight of the workflow how such incompetent pricks end up in the high level management of tech companies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55bw7f?context=5)|Quite often, the guy in the CEO's chair was (a) extremely lucky at some point in his career, and (b) stuck around long enough to get full credit for it. My opinion of most corporate executives is pretty jaded after having met so many of them. But doing their job is no picnic and the average tech enthusiast I meet understands less than 10% of what the CEO needs to know or do to run the company. There's actually an extreme shortage of qualified people to run big tech businesses.
[Realistically, what do you think about the so called ""talent shortage""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55bw7f?context=5)|There is a shortage of talent in markets that are new and growing fast, and an excess supply of talent for industries that are old and not growing.
[Do you base your analysis purely on public information?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55bw7f?context=5)|Yes, but the amount of information I can put together on company A working full time and utilizing every available public resource is many times greater than what the average armchair quarterback can do at home working a few hours a week. Investing is an incredibly cumulative job, so the longer you do it the more you can see patterns in the data. I spend a lot of my time doing detailed models for every company I invest in, which I think can be a huge competitive advantage. Not just for knowing how a particular trend will impact the business, but also when something is announced or a company upstream/downstream from them says something, I know what it means and how to react. 
[What doing your analysis do you have  bullshit meter for each company your analyze? Which one is the worst offender?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55bw7f?context=5)|Ha great question. I have had to develop an acute bullshit meter over the years. The worst offender is no longer a publicly traded stock.
[Could you be specific as to the markets that are new and growing fast?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55glkk?context=5)|Smartphones, wifi, solid-state storage, to name a few.
[Ok, this is sweet. So it sounds like I'm on a good track; I'm starting research today in fact with one of my prof's, and have an internship quasi-lined up for next summer at Apple.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55apcx?context=5)|Minor = doesn't matter. If you need some electives, take accounting and corporate finance. Helps when you transition to the business side of things if you can speak the language.
[Have you noticed a difference between colleagues/friends of yours that chose to go to grad school vs going into industry? Would a minor in anything in particular be useful in retrospect? Also, best and worst part of getting your EE undergrad? What made you go to grad school for your MBA and not EE/Physics/Comp. Sci?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55apcx?context=5)|If you are really brave, take OB.
[What is ""OB""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55eln0?context=5)|Organization Behavior.

What do you think of the rumour that they will be purchased by Facebook?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55ag78?context=5)|RIM is attractive for its net cash position, IP portfolio, and long tail of BBS subscriber revenue.

He is running a terrible farce. Windows8 is awful. And as much as they like to point to the scoreboard (earnings), Microsoft has been awful at seeing and capturing technology changes.
[*Windows8 is awful.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55fsmm?context=5)|Fair points.
[Why do you think he is so awful?  I mean not his specific failings, but why he actually has those failings?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55mr6l?context=5)|Monopoly power and ridiculous amounts of money flowing in.

[Do you think it'll be a platform that will spur more innovation in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55c628?context=5)|Tech-wise.
[Do you think APPL has now reached the level where MSFT is at in terms of growth and being cash rich?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55c628?context=5)|Surface: hate it. But the non-Apple PC community will invest billions developing and marketing Win8 tablets so expect to see a lot more like this and potentially someone will make a winning device. Needs to be cheaper. Hate that WindwsRT comes with office by default. That adds $25-40 to the bill of materials. Makes it impossible to compete w/ ipad on the basis of price.
[Do you believe the tech industry has reached the peak of a bubble with the whole FB valuation fiasco and most of the IPOs current prices below offering?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vkk92/i_have_a_phd_in_ee_and_an_mba_from_harvard_i/c55c628?context=5)|Apple: still a lot of growth potential as they continue to enter new geographic markets. But agree, not a lot of innovation on the near-term horizon.

If cashing out is what you want, then do it. If staying at a company forever because you're passionate, do that.

If they can make a decent tablet, then it makes a lot of sense to sell that at $0 profit in order to drive more of the core retail business.

Our system of free enterprise and high rewards for the biggest risk takers is unlike any other country on earth. Everyone thinks it's China, but I disagree. Too little respect for IP protection, and frankly too much corruption in the relationship between state and private enterprise. I don't think it's Japan or Europe or any other mature market.  I do agree America is falling behind where it should be in terms of education, but innovation is more about how the system encourages people to take risk by offering a huge potential reward to winners and respecting the rule of law especially around protecting IP.

 |I think near-term it will be less about faster CPU cores and more about consolidating system functions on-die to make the overall experience better. At least that is what I see Intel trying to do.

vlt8b,2,2012-06-25,"2X, I'm at the end of my rope (or, be grateful you don't have a life's passion)",passionatethrowaway,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/vlt8b/2x_im_at_the_end_of_my_rope_or_be_grateful_you/,"Throwaway. 
  
I'm in my early 30s. This is what it's like to be passionate about something and not have it fulfilled.
  
I've spent the last dozen years working towards a single goal: an administrative role in a specific industry that I'm incredibly passionate about.
  
My city had an annual event dedicated to it.  I volunteered every year, made my connections, expressed my interest in getting involved deeper.  I met with the producer, and told him point blank, ""I will do anything, I just want to work for your organization"". 

He offered to allow me to work for him full time, for free, and all i had to do was refinance my house so I had enough to live on.  Wow, such a sweet offer.
  
That was a lesson.  I never should have let him smell my passion.  
 
I learned from that, and I worked to prove myself.  I obsessively learned more and more about this industry.  I worked in areas where I would have transferable skills.  I took initiative and created my own projects, most of which got little attention, but at least I was working towards my goals. 
  
I also ruined my credit by travelling to the industry's biggest conference every year, so I could network and hopefully find a job, even if it meant moving across the country. 
  
Years went by.
  
I used to think it was *me*.  That I wasn't working hard enough, that I wasn't good enough, that I just had to wait my turn.  People told me it would pay off eventually.
  
I needed to do *more*.  Work *harder*.
  
I uprooted my entire life to move to this industry's hub.  Traded in my suburban house and car for a mouse-infested apartment and public transit, in a city where I barely knew a soul.  All because I'm passionate.
  
Again, it wasn't enough.  Job applications were ignored, despite fulfilling 100% of the qualifications.  Networking led to nothing but requests for free work.  People younger than me were telling me I should be an intern to ""gain experience"".
  
I have experience out the wazoo.  I've worked a solid decade to prove, on paper, that I care about this industry.  I run a website about it, I've continued volunteering, I've been working my ass off just in general.  I don't have time to date, socialize, see movies, or otherwise have a life.  
  
I have no trouble landing well-paying jobs in industries that don't interest me.  But the industry that I know the most about, and care the most about, and will happily work day and night at?  Not so much. 
  
I'm realizing that gender is a factor.  And I hate it, because before at least I *thought* had some control over the situation. 
  
It's partly because this industry is male-dominated.  But it's also that women who are passionate just come across as desperate and naive.  The reason I've been able to get ""*a* job"" so easily in the past is because I walk in with skills and only skills.  It's all they see.
  
Passion is a distraction.  I *finally* landed an interview with a Dream Job employer 6 months ago.  We were talking about that industry conference, and who knows who, and what projects are hot right now.  We talked so long, that they didn't ask me a bunch of really key questions related to the job, which would have landed it for me.  Someone else, with much less industry experience, got the job. They didn't see me as capable, but as a good conversationalist. 
  
I thought I'd reached a really great turning point recently: I've been given a few dollars to work on an short-term project for a major organization in this field, and it's sad how ecstatic I am to have been thrown the smallest of bones after so many years.  
  
I've attacked this project like my life depends on it.  And I'm killin' it.
  
But I was talking to a colleague on this project about how hard I've worked, for how long, for so few returns, and that I really should've asserted myself ages ago and not let other people take the opportunities I've earned.  He responded by sending me a series of hateful, misogynistic Facebook messages, calling me ""princess"", a failure, useless, a whiner, and that he will refuse to work with me again.  I'm fairly certain he was drunk for the ones sent at 4am, but  sober by the time he threatened that ""you're done"".
  
So I'm back at square one.  Either he's going to be fired over it (unlikely), or he's going to bully me right out of the project. 
  
I don't have anything left in me.  I feel like I've proven all I can prove.  I don't think it'll ever be enough.  I'm tired.  
  
I have an open offer for a really well-paying job in an unrelated field, for a good boss, at a stable company.  I've turned it town probably 20 times already.  
  
But the thought of leaving my passion behind always comes in tandem with thoughts of suicide.  Neither are viable options. But I can't live like this anymore, and I can't not live like this anymore.
  
I hate it when people moan about how they don't know what they're passionate about.  If that's you, you are so fucking lucky.  If I could just walk away and think that *anything* else could make me happy, I would've done it years ago.  But I'm stuck with this bullshit, probably for the rest of my life, because it's all I know how to do. 
  
Suburbs?  Husband?  Mat leave?  Saturdays at Home Depot?  If only.
  
**tl;dr - Passion only leads to pain, heartache, and mascara-stained ranty posts on 2X that drone on too long.**"

vlofb,3,2012-06-25,Is a Linguistics and CS degree any help?,Mason_son_of_Math,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/vlofb/is_a_linguistics_and_cs_degree_any_help/,"Hello, I'm a college student pursing a B.A. in Linguistics and Computer Science. The curriculum includes some introductory programming classes and a few upper division courses, but has about half as many as what the full CS degree requires. However, I will also take a variety of linguistics courses, including one on computational linguistics or natural language processing.

I'm basically wondering if this linguistics will make me a more attractive candidate, or won't help me at all because employers still want to see that I've taken a ton of CS courses. Electives will allow me to take two more upper divs, and I plan to take even more CS if possible.

I want to be a software engineer/programmer because, so far, I've found programming very enjoyable. I wouldn't go so far as to say I'm a natural but coding makes a lot of sense to me and I haven't had this much fun doing something school-related since I took calculus. I'm wondering if my degree will help me, or if I'll have to work extra hard on my own to catch up to all those programmers with fancy pants Bachelor of Science degrees.

And no, changing majors isn't an option due to a good deal of red-tape bullshit. Otherwise I'd already be a full-on CS major.

Additional wrinkle: I'm in California but would prefer to work in Massachusetts for non-career reasons. Upon a perfunctory glance of internships from major companies, a few seem to have offices in Cambridge and the surrounding area. How decent are my chances of getting work there?"

We've been dating for almost 9 months now. We love each other very much. I'm so lucky and happy to have such an amazing girlfriend. It's a LDR though, about 1.5 hours away from each other, not too bad. Sometimes she gets upset easily at small things and gets quiet with me for a little bit and when that happens I get irritated but I always keep my cool cause there's no sense in making a big issue out of a small one. But here's my problem I'm having.

I've been interning for the last couple months for summer and I have about 2 weeks left (thank god). Everyone at work is great and we all get along well. There's this one female (21) that I find interesting. I'm only PHYSICALLY attracted to her. It's odd because she's not my type at all. Different race, tattoos, she has a kid and only 21. We have small chit-chats and she's been flirty with me lately. I admit, I have a little too. I try to minimize my contact with her whenever possible but some times I still see her, like in the break room or something. I know I'm not going to let this stupid thing ruin a wonderful relationship but I feel horrible that I have this physical attraction to some other girl. I love my girlfriend so much and I just feel guilty about this. I want to be open and tell her about this but I don't think that's a good idea considering this internship ends in 2 weeks and a few weeks ago she thought I wasn't physically attracted to her, which is not the case at all. My girlfriend has a banging body. But this has also never happened to me before. 

Is it normal to be physically attracted to someone? What to do?

Sorry if it's confusing, please ask questions if have any. This felt good to write out because I've never told anyone about this and just kept it to myself.

tldr; I have an amazing loving relationship with my gf but I am also physically attracted to another female co-worker. Is this normal?

* Would you expect a drug test?

* How long would you expect it to take for me to pass a test?

* How would I get clean fast? Exercise, water, anything else?

* If the company will most likely test, how? Urinalysis obviously, but am I in a room by myself? Can I get a condom full of clean pee and put it someplace warm? Other ways to cheat a test?

I'm looking for advice on a career move, and was wondering if anyone here had any additional information or experience with my situation. I submit to this subreddit quite frequently, but for some strange reason I find the need for a throwaway account. Below is a background about my situation.

So, all through college I was really interested in the markets. Involved with a bunch of investment clubs, extremely passionate about technical/fundamental analysis, really thought I knew what I wanted to do when I graduated. I ended up getting an internship in IB, and moved full time after I graduated. During that time, my technical skills probably doubled. The broker I was paired with was extremely helpful and resourceful, taught me a lot. A lot of my friends went to prop shops after college, but I was too scared. 20k starting salary while living in New York, while the rest of your salary is in commission scared the hell out of me.

3 months after working full time, I get laid off. This was around 2008-2009. I was pretty upset, but wasn't devastated. I was fresh out of college, pretty young, plus unemployment was sweet. I started looking for other jobs in the finance field, but was told to try different things. A lot of suggestions were to try a smaller company to get the experience. Try a different field, you're young you never know what you might like. Job offers come flying in (surprisingly) and I decided to try something different. I accepted a job at a Financial Analyst position at a Pharma firm. It was awful. Experience was really good, but I missed the markets terribly. I start trading while I work. It started off slow, but then i became pretty active. I decided a couple weeks ago I wanted to get back into the financial markets field and started applying.

So far, I've been on 2 interviews, and have a couple coming up. The ones I am particularly interested in are from prop shops I applied to. I had offers from a bunch of scam prop shops, basically 100% commission positions where you have to pay for their training course. There are a few where I can't find reviews on, Infinium, WTS, and Spot Trading. Does anyone here have any insight on those 3 companies? Can anyone offer any advice on trading desks in general? I'm still actively applying, but I really don't want to waste my time if I know the position isn't right for me.

Thanks in advance.

vp6zz,11,2012-06-27,I'm receiving a MTM suit for my 18th birthday. Any advice? (info inside),[deleted],malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/vp6zz/im_receiving_a_mtm_suit_for_my_18th_birthday_any/,"**About me**

I am 18, and live in the Denver area. This means that I have only a few options for good MTM:

 * http://www.andrisenmorton.com

 * http://www.lawrencecovell.com

 * http://homerreedltd.com

I am 5'6"" and have a slim runners build (130 lbs), so finding good suits that fit is a challenge. H&amp;M fits, but the fabrics are subpar. I've had some luck with J Crew after tailoring.

Since I'm turning 18 and will be in the white collar workforce soon (I'm already doing internships), I need something more professional. Thus, I'm leaning towards MTM.

**My ideal suit**

Grey four season wool, probably sharkskin. Natural, only lightly padded shoulders. Skinny lapels, but not overly so. High armholes. A slim but not skinny fit. Shorter length (given my shorter stature). Side vents. At least half-canvassed.

Ideal price would be high three figures to low four figures. My parents are buying.

**Questions and advice**

I'm new to MTM, so I'd welcome any advice you have about how to proceed. I'm particularly interested in the MTM process (timeline, etc.) and in how MTM works with shorter, skinnier clients like me. I'd also welcome suggestions or testimonials from anyone in the Denver area.

Thanks for your help!"

vp24u,12,2012-06-27,Anyone here in a prop shop? Looking for career advice...,ChangingCareers,StockMarket,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/vp24u/anyone_here_in_a_prop_shop_looking_for_career/,"Hey guys,


I'm looking for advice on a career move, and was wondering if anyone here had any additional information or experience with my situation. I submit to this subreddit quite frequently, but for some strange reason I find the need for a throwaway account. Below is a background about my situation.


So, all through college I was really interested in the markets. Involved with a bunch of investment clubs, extremely passionate about technical/fundamental analysis, really thought I knew what I wanted to do when I graduated. I ended up getting an internship in IB, and moved full time after I graduated. During that time, my technical skills probably doubled. The broker I was paired with was extremely helpful and resourceful, taught me a lot. A lot of my friends went to prop shops after college, but I was too scared. 20k starting salary while living in New York, while the rest of your salary is in commission scared the hell out of me.


3 months after working full time, I get laid off. This was around 2008-2009. I was pretty upset, but wasn't devastated. I was fresh out of college, pretty young, plus unemployment was sweet. I started looking for other jobs in the finance field, but was told to try different things. A lot of suggestions were to try a smaller company to get the experience. Try a different field, you're young you never know what you might like. Job offers come flying in (surprisingly) and I decided to try something different. I accepted a job at a Financial Analyst position at a Pharma firm. It was awful. Experience was really good, but I missed the markets terribly. I start trading while I work. It started off slow, but then i became pretty active. I decided a couple weeks ago I wanted to get back into the financial markets field and started applying.


So far, I've been on 2 interviews, and have a couple coming up. The ones I am particularly interested in are from prop shops I applied to. I had offers from a bunch of scam prop shops, basically 100% commission positions where you have to pay for their training course. There are a few where I can't find reviews on, Infinium, WTS, and Spot Trading. Does anyone here have any insight on those 3 companies? Can anyone offer any advice on trading desks in general? I'm still actively applying, but I really don't want to waste my time if I know the position isn't right for me.


Thanks in advance.

Our event requires 600 volunteers and we need your help! 

We have tons of positions open: 

Beer Booth- No drinking on the job guys... hate to burst your bubble 

Pop Booth- Sell some pop, have fun with your other pop booth volunteers

Juror Escorts- The UAF is a really big deal. During the fair we have a panel of jurors that walk to every booth and judge each artist's work. Your job as Juror Escort is to keep track of how long a juror spends at each booth. You time them and then make them move on once their time at a booth is up. 

Booth Sitters- Here you have a huge job: You have to take care of an artist's art while they take a break. You are not allowed on your phone, you are basically security for a bit while the artist runs to the bathroom or what-have-you.

The last I saw of Stella was that same summer we met after graduation. Boy did we have some adventures... Endless fuckings, anals and exhibition sex. I fingerfucked her on a public bus. She blew me while at the movies. We sent naked pictures and made dares all summer. I got her to wear a vibrator in her pussy while talking to her boss. and she made me go to the midnight munch store naked. No hands. Autumn came before we even knew it and I had to go back to college and she moved out of town. That was the end of it. Or so I thought.

During my masters, I was scheduled to do my first intern job at a real laboratory. It was great fun even though the long hours, the endless cups of coffee and the boss who thought I was his personal slave. But I learned a lot and I loved every second of it. My thoughts of Stella had been replaced with telescopes, books and ramen noodles. I still remembered her beautiful hair. She colored it maroon before we left. I still remember her perfectly suckable nipples that just pointed at you once you saw them. As if they commanded you to suck and nibble at them. Her pussy and asshole that had been fucked so much by my dick it was almost engraved with ""I was here"" now. Sometimes I thought of her when I needed to rub out that easy one. I wasn't in love with her but I loved her company.

I used to spend my nights at a late café because I couldn't finish my reports at my dorm. Too loud and messy. Three cups of coffee into it and I looked out of the window, and I thought I could see Stellas red hair in the distant. ""Naah, I must be getting too tired..."" I thought and began packing my bags to head home.

I couldn't understand whether I saw her or not that night. But just the slightest reminder of our times always got me so horny. When I got home I saw a mail from Dave, an old friend, apparently he was getting married this saturday (today was thursday) in Vegas. At some fancy-for-being-vegas church. I thought ""why the hell not?! I get ramen and drinks for free!""

In Vegas, the city full of fucking, booze, gambling and more fucking, I decided that I wouldn't head home before I'd do atleast the drinking and fucking part. It is, after all, Vegas. At the reception my whole gang was here. Everyone from my old home town dressed as suave as possible as hell. Before we entered the hall I got that same feeling again, that I've seen Stella somewhere. And by instinct I got into the male bathroom, got my visitors card up of the place, placed it beside my hard cock and snapped a photo out of it. Texting it to Stella ""?"". As I exited the bathroom I just understood what I'd done... ""Fuck it.. She's seen it before."" I thought. Suddenly, my phone buzzed and I checked who it was from. ""Stella has sent you a picture."" it said. Opening it and I saw her pussy, looking just like before I left and a card just like mine next to it. ""FUCK YES!"" I thought just as I closed my phone and began looking for her. I couldn't until I saw that she had already sat down in the main room. I sat down next to her and her face lit up like a christmas tree. 

""hi stella."" I said. 
""Hey. It's about to start but come meet me after the wedding. I got something that belongs to you. But here, have these now."" and she suddenly took off her panties she had under her dress. Soaked all the way. I didn't know what I'd say or do. So I said ""oh you shoe is untied"" and went down into her dress for a quick moment. And she was, just like before, all shaved and wet as a river. It took and placed my one finger on her clit while pretending to tie her shoe with the other hand. She was wet and ready. 

The couple had wed and everyone was getting drunk at the party. I met up with stella quickly and said ""Hey.. Come with me now and we'll get away from all these party-goers."" She just nodded and bit her lip that sexy way. We went out only to find a limo parked. ""That's probably theirs."" and very drunkedly I suggested ""Lets take it."" and we did. We climbed in and the driver thought we were the couple. We began laughing our asses off until we realized that we might as well give the chauffeur something for the trouble.

Like a ninja I got my dick out and Stella didn't hesitate for a second to start sucking it off. I popped her breasts out of her dress and began touching her nipples. She began moaning ""no one does like you do.. I love the way you do it"" and I just moaned ""likewise..."". Stella removed the bottom half of her dress, exposing her perfect pussy and asshole for me and sticked her upper body out of the ceiling window. She had covered her breasts but I was below licking her tasty pussy and rubbing the outsides of her asshole gently with my fingers. She was moving her pussy to match the motion of the car and its turns. She tried to maintain herself but she began moaning and suddenly the chauffeur said ""we're here"" without even caring about what we were doing. We had no idea what he meant but when we got out he had driven us to this real swanky hotel. We said ""fuck that"" and went to the next door club. 

Inside we sat down at a small booth and continued. I fingered her pussy through her dress and she was rubbing my dick. All of a sudden more booths started fucking and we hadn't noticed it but we were inside one of those shifty swingers club. People began running around naked, breasts everywhere and dicks swinging side to side. ""There gotta be some kinky shit in this place somewhere."" and before we knew it we found it. Just down the hall there were a big number of doors and we entered one of them thinking that it was shooting pornos but as we entered and locked it behind us. We put in a dollar into some kind of machine and suddenly the walls moved and a chair was on the other side. Both of us were drunk as hell and said ""whoever gets in there will be lucky. LETS FUCK!"" and we both got completely naked. And I sat down on the chair while Stella gave me a lapdance and grinded my dick with her pussy. She was so wet and we both loved the idea that someone might sit down at watch us doing it. So I couldn't take it anymore I just sticked my dick into her wet pussy and let her ride me like a machine bull. She was riding me better than ever and I got my hand around her curvy body and stuck a finger inside her ass. While fingering her clit and sucking her nipples. She moaned harder and harder. She said she was going to cum but I didn't let that bother me. Instead I just kept on fucking her and she understood what I was doing. So as she came, I felt her twitching her body. Shaking it uncontrollably and her pussy was so creamy it was almost a creamy squirting coming out of it. Her pussy got so tight from her orgasm that I could bare fit my big cock inside. Instead I took it out and stuck inside her ass instead. She didn't seem to mind and she was riding my still as she was getting it anally. ""I've never had anal while riding before."" she moaned as I kept going and I just saw how it opened a completely new world for her. She was moaning and  could keep on fucking me eventhough she just came. But I couldn't resist to start playing around with her pussy with my fingers. She began moaning harder and higher now. I looked past her and a couple was inside the other side and was fucking too like animals. IT was so hot that I felt that I was going to cum and I tried to moan it but she just lifted herself up to start sucking it. But she wasn't quick enough so my cum shot right at the window instead. She didn't seem to mind and started collecting it with her fingers anyway. And I sat myself on my knees and started licking her pussy and asshole while she collected my cum. It was so hot I got hard again almost instantly and said to her ""brace yourself"" and stuck my refreshed cock into her asshole. Fingering her pussy with my other hand around her waist. She was moaning ""oh..my god..."" and I just smiled and fucked her more and more. She couldn't help herself and squirted all over the floor. It wasn't a small squirt either but a massive flood bigger than pee. Just flooding out of her pussy and I fingered her as she did, making it splash all over the floor and all over my hands. 

I sat down on the chair in the booth and she followed with my cock still inside her asshole. Fucking her like an animal. And I came once again, not as big this time but I felt it throughout my whole body. The sensation all the way to my roots of my hair from my toes.

I removed my cock from her asshole and she sat on my lap for a moment. We both sweating and smelling like sex and booze. ""maybe we should meet more often. It's always an adventure with you Stella.."" and she just kissed me for a long moment. Making out even. It was hard to say but this was probably the most romantic and loving moment of our lives. Both fucked until we couldn't walk and people were jacking off to us. We didn't care. We both loved every second of this.

""maybe you should follow me home..."" I said and she just nodded.. ""I got some days off."" She replied and hugged me hard. 

We left the place one hour afterwards. Stella had booked a hotel room where we took a bath together and spent the night with candles lit. The next day we both drove back to my place and recollected ourselves.

vottp,9,2012-06-27,Looking for advice towards graduate school,nickles063,Anthropology,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anthropology/comments/vottp/looking_for_advice_towards_graduate_school/,"I'm beginning to consider taking alternative routes towards getting into graduate school for anthropology. A few of these things are TESOL, AmeriCorps, etc. 

I didn't have the opportunity to study abroad or take internships during undergrad and I have the feeling that my academic career/background will not be enough for me to get into graduate school alone.

Brief history: Graduated with a BA in Anthropology June 2010 (From a university in Ohio). Took core classes for the major, but had much more of a cultural anthropology focus. 
GPA: 2.7 (Sadly). 
Other courses taken during undergrad (in relation to cultural anthropology): French, from 103 (I tested out of 101 &amp; 102) through 300 level courses
Middle Eastern Studies (3 courses)
Southeast Asian Studies (1 course)

Since graduating, I have not had the opportunity to ""work in the field"" as it's often stated. I've gotten nothing but desk jobs, making decent pay, working 8 hours. While that's definitely better than other options, I would much rather do something useful with my degree to make my graduate school application look appealing. 

I'm looking for advice on starting the process, if the direction of graduate school is really worth my time based on my background, or if I really should consider doing something such as teaching overseas or paid social/community based work for a year. 

Please keep in mind these small tidbits:

- I come from a family that did not have a lot of college or graduate school graduates. Only a aunt, a cousin (23 yrs with a BS) and myself (25 yrs) are currently the holders of an undergraduate degree or a master's (my aunt being the only one with a master's). Experience with graduate school applications and the process as a whole is rather unknown to me. 

- I know that the GRE is crucial and could easily boost my application if I score highly. 

- Jobs for anthropology are rather slim in my part of the country (Ohio) and I cannot afford to travel outside of the state at the moment. 

If you need any other information to give advice, just let me know. "

Voices for Sudan is an awesome nonprofit that is in need of some help. Unlike many other US or European organizations fighting against genocide, Voices for Sudan was founded by members of the Sudanese diaspora and tries to unite the voices of the Sudanese community (north, south, east and west) towards a peaceful, prosperous Sudan and South Sudan. 


This completely volunteer-based organization that I help out runs the risk of losing its only work space. We recently brought on some interns for the summer and that drastically increased the electricity. As an organization that completely relies on fundraising and donations, they have been slim lately. We have other prospects in the works--(grants, newsletters etc...) but they haven't had enough time to materialize results. 


Please give if you can! Or help pass the world along to others who you think would be interested. We do some really amazing work and would like to keep it up for the sake of our members with friends and family stuck in conflict zones and refugee camps. 


[**Here's a link to our donations page**](http://www.indiegogo.com/voicesforsudanrent)


Our website was hacked recently, but here's the wordpress we have up while we get the more professional page back up and running: [www.voicesforsudan.org](www.voicesforsudan.org) You can also donate there. 


Thanks so much!! Any little bit counts. "

Here is my [resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/p6yl76m7x8jarp4/cv%20for%20reddit.docx).

I have a couple of things to add to it, but as the title says I’m not sure how to ‘phrase’ them in my resume.

I worked on an archaeological dig and it helped me update a few skills.

• Better experience with Excel and Access. Got really well acquainted with it.

• Helped younger students to get used to the style of organisation and paperwork system used to process finds.

• Taught younger students how to fill out sheets and create site drawings. These can be pretty complex.

Problems I’ve found with my CV:

• I don’t sell my skills enough; I’m trying to get better at that.

• The only ‘work experience’ I have is an unpaid two week internship at a bookstore and a lot of casual babysitting and dog-walking. I come from something of a rural wasteland where there were no jobs to be had by the young and experienced.

I made the mistake of carrying this on once I went to university, and didn’t take the opportunity to get a real job as soon as I could.

I'm also disabled. Should I include this in the resume?

I know this is quite a lot, but I’ve been to my University’s careers advice office and they were quite useless and refused to even glance at the CV! Any help and critique would be hugely helpful! Thank-you!"

A cool part of my job is that I find out plans for the WWE way in advance, so I might be able to shed some light on things such as the 1000th RAW or Summerslam, as long as they aren't spoilers ;)

If I'm missing anything, please let me know (politely), I hope to give an informative and entertaining AMA.

I should also mention that I trained to be a ""superstar"" for a year with an indy promotion. So ask me about that too if you want!

This is a throwaway account. I'm in a retail job where I mostly manufacture things in the back of the store. The items we sell are targeted to newlywed couples, people shopping for their anniversaries and very old ladies with lots of money. So I don't have a lot of people to pick from.

After graduating from college, my life is at a little bit of a standstill. I'm working in retail and attempting to get into some internships with my Bachelors in Biology - with relatively no success due to the economic downturn. My regular job keeps me afloat - leaving me no time to do long-houred unpaid internships or volunteer opportunities.

I don't want to get anyone's hopes up. I'm about a 5. But I'm a nerd. I love video games, sci-fi and movies. However, I'm also a very quiet outdoorsy person and I could spend the whole day hiking or relaxing in the sun. I love just ""doing things"". I'm kinda artistic... and I'm not that much of a reader anymore. I like eating out most of the time, but I do have some fun cooking a tasty meal every week or so.

I like girls who pull themselves together well. That means I'm attracted to girls who can pull off their style. Cleanliness is the most important thing - and after that I really don't care unless you are a generally nice and kind individual. I am slightly annoyed by smoking - but I am a wine-o so I'm not one to complain.

I'm not going to spoil anything else for anyone. Hurl your questions."

vodit,10,2012-06-27,How come I read the Ask Reddit post about the sluttiest thing I have ever done and this wall of text slowly crept out of my soul?,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/vodit/how_come_i_read_the_ask_reddit_post_about_the/,"So I’m sitting here reading reddit about all of these sexy and slutty things that people have done.  And I want that.  I want a man to approach me at a party and want to fuck.  Not that I would….  Maybe I would….  But I want the invitation.  

I love my friends with benefits guy as a good friend, but I can’t help but think that he doesn’t want to be seen with me in public.  That explains why he never invites me to the bars or to hang out with his friends.  He was talking about fucking me at a bar and how dirty that would be.  I want that.  But I don’t want to chicken out or be embarrassed by my weight.  At this weight I obviously would back out.  But I don’t want to.  I don’t want to back out of my life.  Of my possible experiences.

FUCK!  I haven’t even been out to the FUCKING BARS YET BECAUSE I AM SO FUCKING SCARED THAT THEY WILL REJECT ME AT THE DOOR.  21 for almost a month in a college town.  I’m an embarrassment to the 21 agers.  My bar crawl is coming up, and I just get nervous thinking about going.  What if the bouncer says no and won’t let me in because I’m fat?  I would just want to end my life right then and there.

Not that I need a man to affirm who I am, because trust me, I don't, but...  I want men to hit on me at bars.  I want men to buy me drinks at bars.  I want a long term boyfriend.  I want a guy to ask for my number. I want to shop at normal stores.  And not pay $100 for a simple dress.

God I just need to lose weight now.  What can I do to shred the weight?   I want to wear sexy dresses and high heels.  I want to flip my hair and know that any guy at a bar would die to be with me.  Seriously, I have a beautiful face, big brown eyes, long sexy hair, a killer smile, and a coke bottle figure.  All hiding under what I have built up for myself in order to protect me.

Sometimes I wonder if I have been sexually abused when I was younger, repressed the memories, and used food as comfort.  But I think pretty deeply and don’t remember anything.  But then again, why am I so obsessed with criminal justice and bringing justice to the bad guys?...

I don’t know the last time a man looked at me with wanting or loving eyes.  This weight is just tearing my life apart.  I just want to be at a smaller size, not skinny.  I’d like to be thick with curves.  As a current size 20, I want to be to a size 14.  THAT’S IT!  It’s not even that far away of a goal.  But I really need to do this for myself.  I just need to get off my fat, lazy ass and do this.

I’m also scared about my internship.  What is an obese girl doing in a police station where everyone else will be fit?  Everyone else will be fit and in shape and I won’t be.  I will be laughed at.  I won’t be invited out with them.  They won’t smile or take me seriously.  I’m really scared about this.

I’m just afraid of what may happen though if I do lose it.  Will people still like me?  Will my friends change how they act around me?  Probably yes.  But ya know what?  I shouldn’t fucking care!  I’m tired of being the funny, fat friend who people keep around to make themselves look better/skinnier/prettier.

Literally just received this message on Plenty of Fish after I turned this guy down nicely.  “Haha fuck u you fat ass bitch.  Ur such a cunt.  Go eat some fuckin ho ho’s and stfu!  Fattie!”   Then when I said, “See, I told you we probably get along.”  The reply of, “Good I’m glad.  If u loved me I’d prolly get eaten.  Goodbye chunky!”  was received.

He’s right.  I didn’t deserve to be called these names but the truth is, a complete stranger just called me some horrible names, and I’m not even mad.  I’m not even mad because I know it’s the truth.  And realizing it makes me cry.  

I often wonder what people think of me when they see me on the street.  What’s wrong with her?  She’s young, no excuse to be lazy.  She doesn’t care about herself.  They probably call me all the names that this rando on POF called me...

I think I’m coming to the point in my life where if I don’t change my body, I will forever regret it and will likely kill myself in a car accident.  Just jerk the steering wheel really fast to the right, into this big beautiful tree on a back road close to my house.   Leaving my mother devastated and guilty for not pushing me to be better.  

I always say, “Tomorrow I will workout, tomorrow I’ll not eat fast food.”  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow.

Well right now, after I’m done with this, I am going to do some sit ups.  I think I can overcome this.  I want to, need to.  

If you are reading this, and know of any way to help me, please say something.  I could really use it.

I just want comforting words on how to move on from this.,allie-bern,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/vob0y/job_offer_rescinded_i_just_want_comforting_words/,"Hey everyone.. I am posting here because I feel like you ladies are pretty understanding on a wide variety of topics.

I won't go into every detail because I want people to actually read this, but I will gladly answer more questions as I have been explaining this to anyone who cares all day.

I got offered my dream job a few weeks ago. I felt so great and validated. Today I got a call that they were rescinding the offer. They couldn't tell me why, But I knew why - I walked into my current supervisor's office and asked her if she had spoken to them and she said yes - she told them that she would not recommend me to be a lead on a project.

Now, this is the part I'm having trouble with. I would never ask her for a recommendation, as I know I have not done the best job in this position. I wouldn't expect her to speak highly of my work, and I don't blame her. I have had problems with tardiness and organization that have been going on since college. The other night I was thinking, ""Why did I even get offered this job? I'm not a great employee."" Then I thought ""Maybe it's because I try so hard. I do deserve this job, I will do a great job, I know that I will."" So I had resolved with myself to stop feeling guilty over whatever had happened in the past.

I know that I try my hardest. I have finally found a way to stay energized throughout the day after years of chronic fatigue, dull pains at random times in random places, and organizational issues- go paleo diet! I have enough energy to exercise, I don't get headaches and stomach cramps during the day, I don't have muscle pain, I sleep better, I can get up early and fall asleep faster. I honestly feel that this is the answer to all of my prior work issues, I am happier with myself and my life outside of work, I am now able to organize my work and was ready to start this new job on a fresh slate.

I do not want any comments saying that she was justified in doing what she did, as I am not arguing with that. I think she is unprofessional and tactless at times, but I do not disagree with some of her feelings about my work (though at a certain point it seems like she's looking for more ways to have power over me and finding small things that she can use against me to feel more in control). What I am asking for is opinions and advice on how to not let this get me down. I am sending an e-mail to my former supervisor-to-be explaining myself, just because I am so embarrassed and hate that this would leave me on bad terms with her even though I will probably never run into her again.

After hours of crying and complaining and calling friends, I have decided that I may be better off without this job. Before I found this job, I was planning on getting a part time job, and spending my time at an internship (unpaid of course) that I had lined up in the field that I am looking to work in. I thought that organizing my own time by having different things to work on and having time to myself to work on myself and keeping my mental and physical health in check was a good thing. I was ready to work on my organizational skills as well, and was ready to start a different type of schedule and work life, maybe the 9-5 40 hour a week thing just doesn't work with me, or at least not at the moment. But this embarrassment, ego bruising, and disappointment is lingering, and I'm sure will linger for a while. I found this job opportunity the day that the applications were due. This seemed like the perfect job for me and was the only one I could find in my field of work and in the area that I am living in. I thought it was a sign, I thought it was meant to be. I am having a hard time letting go of this and not feeling like somehow the world is out to disappoint me. Why would I get offered this job, just for the offer to be taken back? Why is the universe doing this to me? Why can I not just have this? Why am I losing this opportunity to prove to myself and others that I can do this?

TLDR; Job offer rescinded, ego is bruised, how can I bounce back?

voazj,0,2012-06-27,What was it about your profession that caused you to know that it was or was not right for you? Advice to those unsure of their future?,PoochieMcPoochmuffin,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/voazj/what_was_it_about_your_profession_that_caused_you/,"I'm an undergraduate rising junior with a double major in Art and English at a small, not very well known college. I am very active at school with leadership positions in clubs, I volunteer, and I maintain a satisfactory grade point average. Out of school, I volunteer and am currently involved in two internships. I love literature, art, and communicating with people unlike myself.

I have no idea what I want to do when I leave college. For many years now, my dream was to go into writing/drawing comics and get a MFA at SCAD, but as I'm learning just how difficult it is to even get a job -- let alone a good paying one -- I'm rethinking of if an open door is worth so much debt. Not only that, but I question if I even should follow my dream. So often, I can't even pick up a pencil because all I think is, ""Make something great. If you don't, you're a failure. You'll never make it to SCAD,"" causing me to be constantly blocked by my own insecurities. If I can't do what I want as a career now, how can I expect to do it later?

Worse yet is I'm not only greatly interested in comics, but also the world of journalism and art galleries/museums. I currently work for the newspaper at my school, and I love it. Meanwhile, I volunteer at an art gallery and currently have an internship at another art gallery, and I love that field as well. While I'm actually doing things I love in other disciplines, the one I'm working towards has yet to even become a hobby due to so much fear.

All I ever wonder is what if I make the wrong decision and stick to one path and end up finding out that I'm either not good at it or that it doesn't make me happy? Is an open door worth regret later on? Worth finding out I'm either not good at something or that something doesn't make me happy?

I could just try to bury my fears and give it a shot, but sometimes going for one's dream isn't the right path. Sometimes just doing something isn't enough when it's hasty and immature. Sometimes YOLO is the worst thing to do. And that sometimes is what's causing me to be stuck even while I do my best to go forwards. 

Jumping into one job field and trying to make the transition into a completely different one is not easy in this job market. I could always try to make myself feel better by saying, ""I have time,"" but all I can think instead is, ""What am I working towards?""

My problem is that I'm an outsider when it comes to my dream. I research it, but unlike journalism and the gallery world, I have yet to actually experience the ins and outs of it, the actual industry and what it's like being a part of it. Unfortunately, no comic publishers are near me, and all of the internships provided do not work at all with my school academic calendar, either beginning a month or two too early or a month or two too late. I would really have to jump into the industry blindfolded, and the only way to even jump is with SCAD and the education it provides as well as the great networking.

Okay. Let's say I give up on comics and SCAD. My dream gone, impractical and stupid. Then what? Journalism or the art world? I'm still split on what I should do or be. I keep wondering what will make me happy? What will make me fulfilled? I keep worrying about the thought of 10 years from now waking up and realizing I should have followed one track and not another.

&lt;b&gt;TLDR: College undergrad fearful of future. Fearful of making the wrong choice in career path. Fearful of not being happy and always wondering, ""What if?"" Fearful of growing old filled with regret with a job I'm not good at or grow to hate.

I want to know why you're happy or not happy with your job, what it is about your job that caused you to know it was or was not right for you, if you always wanted to have the job you have now, and any tips for those who are afraid of their future career path.&lt;/b&gt;"

I tried to make it happen this summer but with me working 3 jobs (2 of which are unpaid internships), it's not going to happen. I promised to take her on the surprise trip next summer though after we get back from college.
What's the best time to visit in? I have all of May to the end of August. Is there a tourist season that I should try and avoid to try and experience everything?
I was thinking a 4 or 5 night stay. My girlfriend always talks about how pretty some big basilica was when she went there (even though she eats lots of babies) and I was wondering if you know which one she's talking about? I obviously want to take her there, or be near there if that's practical location wise.
I'm a history buff and she's an artsy girl, any suggestions of places to visit or things to see?
I have so many question....money (how much am I going to spend, how can I save money as a poor college student, I'm guessing US $ or Canadian $ doesn't really matter all too much?), location (downtown, parking, price and quality), things to do (during the day and at night), eating (we're pescatarian's , only eat fish, and generally just a pain in the ass, and by the sounds of it there's lots of restaurants, what to expect), anything else you think I should know?

voahl,3,2012-06-27,Keyboard for work,[deleted],keyboards,https://www.reddit.com/r/keyboards/comments/voahl/keyboard_for_work/,"Spending my summer in the office coding as part of my summer internship, and I can't quite decide what to two with my keyboard situation!

I would be very surprised if I could acquire a mechanical keyboard through my company, since I'm only here for twelve weeks, although I guess it never hurts to try. However, assuming I can't, I only have my Das and my Poker, both with blues. Has anyone had problems with using a keyboard with blues (versus, lets say browns) in an office environment? I tend to bottom out a lot, although I can get O-Rings to help that (after all, I did just do that group buy...). We don't have cubicles, but the offices are fairly close together and there is generally an open door policy it seems.

I'm tempted to buy a tenkeyless MX brown filco on Amazon to add to my collection and for the middlepoint between my Das and my Poker. As the development environment is non-unix based, I have a feeling I wont be quite as comfortable on my Poker as I typically am, so that would leave me with bringing my Das in to work if I don't get the Filco.

Similarly, wristrests. I only have one... and it is a fullsize ducky wrist rest (which I love, especially considering the price, but I would look ridiculous using a full size wrist rest on a TKL, and the nearest thing I can find is $70!)

I know it is kind of a special situation as I am an intern, but anyone have any advice? Both regarding getting supplied keyboard, and keyboard/wristpad advice.

/endramble

Alternatively, how to Leopolds compare to Filco's, besides not looking as nice with the rounded, rather than clean edges?"
vo5u3,19,2012-06-27,Anyone out there with a B.Arch or other architecture degree working in a professional field that's not architecture?,sigaven,architecture,https://www.reddit.com/r/architecture/comments/vo5u3/anyone_out_there_with_a_barch_or_other/,"I'm about to enter my third year of the B.Arch program at my school, and I'm starting to doubt that architecture is right for me. I'm doing an internship right now at a small local firm and I'm frankly bored as hell (granted, they don't do very exciting projects to begin with). And I've been thinking about all the other fields I could have focused on...history, journalism, music, international relations, etc...and the possibilities those studies could have brought for me. I also feel that it's too late to transfer to another major at this point, and I always keep thinking that eventually architecture will settle in for me and I will begin to genuinely enjoy it, so I'm going to push to complete my architecture degree. But for now I'm having my doubts, and I'm just wondering what in the world I could do with a degree in architecture besides working at an architecture firm and eventually becoming licensed. Did anyone feel the same way in college, and eventually come to enjoy it (if you decided to continue your career in architecture)? Is there anyone who felt like me, decided to finish the degree anyway, and begin a career in something entirely different?

Edit: thank you guys for the answers (so far - more are welcome of course). First of all I'm thinking long-term here, work/career-wise (ie, not obtaining my degree and then bussing tables or working in retail for a few years). A lot of you have said to follow my passion, but that's the problem--I'm just not sure where my passion lies, that's why I chose architecture to begin with, since I didn't know what else to get into. I've always considered myself more of a right-brained person but I suppose I'm actually fairly balanced in that respect. I love creativity and the arts, but I suppose subconsciously I'm obsessed with logic and reason. 

I guess what I was hoping to hear from some people in here is that because an education in architecture is so well-rounded and touches all sorts of fields, that getting a job and starting a profession anywhere else wouldn't be so difficult. I'm still hoping that's the case. Because sometimes I honestly feel like I've trapped myself, limiting myself only to architecture for the rest of my life. And sometimes I feel like that's not a bad thing, but sometimes I do. Don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed most of my studio experiences for the past two years even though I hate it at times, just like everyone else (although maybe for differing reasons). I'm still hoping that I'll settle in eventually, because I feel like 2 years in it's too late to settle on something else (I know that sounds silly). And even if I were to switch majors, I have no idea what to switch to.

Anyway keep the responses coming!"

BioWare: Maybe we can hash out the last 20 minutes pretty quick. But... uh... I have no idea what to do for Day 1 DLC. 

EA: Do something that those kids would go nuts over. What are those old dead aliens? Prostatians? Throw in one of them. Do that or else your children won't be released. Okay, thanks! Love you! Gotta run!

Now, I have been to a handful of undergrad defenses, a masters defense, and a research symposium, and I seen people get grilled on their work...but this...this was crazy.  
  
A room full of seasoned physicists and engineers trying to find every possible reason to tear up one of their co-workers results. Every single possible question was asked. No result each of each of the slides went unnoticed.  
I didn't know what was going on during this bloodbath of ""prove to me you are right or else you are full of shit"", but it occurred to me. This is the foundation of being a skeptic. Question everything that is presented to you and down it until you get enough convincing data to prove you otherwise.  
  
However, there was something else I realized, which is common sense when I thought about it, but I see this as a problem a lot when it comes to anything, be it science related, or some other field. 

You can only really have the authority to down play and truly be skeptical of something unless you yourself knows what is going on. I couldn't just raise my hand and say ""None of your data makes sense to me"" for the simple fact that I didn't know nearly enough math, physics, theory for me to make an educated judgement/question/concern.  
I see this happening all over the place when people down play scientific findings. The people that never read a single credible article on the subject they claim is wrong always seems to be more vocal than the ones who tore up the research that was done to make that scientific finding.
  
I think if there's anything I pull out of this internship, I think that one afternoon watching people that are currently spending 10-20 years of their life to develop, build, and analyze data to answer a question, changed my whole way of thinking whenever I read or hear anything someone says.  
  
If you ever get the opportunity to listen to seasoned scientists argue, take it. It's pretty hilarious for one thing, but it really makes you appreciate all of the scientific theories that are employed each day. Each one of them went through a rigorous process to get where it's at now.

But I don`t think anyone cares. It feels like I can`t get through to anyone by talking about my depression or suicidal thoughts, or why I am unhappy. People won`t change their ways in the slightest if I ask (especially the parents), and that just makes me think that ending it might be the only answer to get through to anyone.
I just feel that expectations are not met. While a lot of the people I know through my program are doing internships and professional work, I am working a shit job, not making enough money for rent in the long term. I have no support from the parents or friends emotionally, and have failed a few courses, making me seem like a dead-end failure.

vnz8k,3,2012-06-26,[FR] She just kept talking in one long incredibly unbroken sentence moving from topic to topic so that no one has a chance to interrupt it is quite hypnotic.    AKA She is really Dr. Vassbinder,Oldguard,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/vnz8k/fr_she_just_kept_talking_in_one_long_incredibly/,"background:  http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/vltes/have_date_with_hb9_professor_now_have_predate/

Background music: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6oUz1v17Uo

Picked her up, I was about 5 minutes early (mistake 1?) and my former intern needed to get off the phone.  She walks out the door and walks right by and starts talking.   I open my mouth to speak, and she continues to explain that where we are going we will need to drive and where my car is.  I point out my car and pull it out so she could get in.    I glance over to her and smile as my RECARO seats swallowed her up.  That's when I first notice it.  **Her shoulders were raised up to her ear lobes.** You don't sit in a RECARO seat like that, you let them swallow you up.  **Is this a sign of her being nervous?**

She asked me to pull up at the CVS and she runs in to get some meds.  She comes back out and tells me this is the best parking space there is and that we should walk to the dinner.  The dinner was packed so we went to the Pub.  While walking I noticed that her **shoulders were raised and her head was lowered like she was, I don't know, nervous.  She was holding her purse over her shoulder on whatever side I walked on.**  I was stretched to my full height, shoulders relaxed and back exposing my chest.  I was also walking slowly, making her wait for me.  

And that's when **she starts talking in one long incredibly unbroken sentence moving from topic to topic so that no one has a chance to interrupt it is quite hypnotic.**  

Her topics she moved to (for those that want to know) bitching about work, complaining about the education system, how much money she makes, the economy, Obama, reverse racism, her lawsuit, Bush Jr, Bush Sr, GM, etc, etc.  **Seriously, how do you tell a woman to shut the fuck up without sounding like an asshole?**  I couldn't help it, I felt my eyebrows go up (Mistake 2?) as I tried to contemplate how she could breath.

I sat in the booth across from her (Mistake 3?) and had to lean in occasionally since she would speak quietly.  (Mistake 4?)
 
At this point I noticed that her shoulders were no longer raised.  ""Maybe she was nervous?""  So, I attempted some kino.  I waited for a topic (didn't take long, LOL) that was serious, it was about her unfair treatment and lawsuit.  I reached over and put my hand on her hand.  She stopped for a moment and then I noticed it.  She was raising her shoulders.  Sometime later she looked relaxed and I attempted again, she was talking about 911, so I reached over and placed my hand and got the same reaction.  **Is this some kind of shit test?**  

I go to the Mens room, I checked my MSG, since I was receiving a ton of texts from friends.  As I walked to the booth, I wondered if she was even there or did she run off.  I was getting bored. She goes to the Lady's room and I stealth pay (mistake 5?) the bill.

She comes back with fresh make up on.  And ask me if we could leave,  I say ""sure let's go somewhere else.""  She tells me she has a ton of work to do.  And then she continues talking...  At this point I was bored out of my mind and I say, ""Let's go.""  And we leave.

She still has her shoulders up, and holding her purse over her shoulder on whatever side I walked on.  I did a sudden stop and looked at an used bookstore.  And I stated how I love used bookstores.  She asked if I wanted to go in.  I was already inside when I said ""Yes!""  

She kept talking but she was asking me questions about my Family, where I was from.  I was answering as I was checking out some books.  We continue to walk towards the car, and she continues asking about my family.  That's when I notice it.  **Her fucking shoulder were not raised.**

We get into my car, she was telling the best way to do a U turn.  I ignored her.  I half throttle out, allowing my R-Comps to bite into the road, rotate the rear, and hear the TurboFart^TM as I shift through the gears.  She yelps but I noticed she was relaxed in the seat.

She keeps talking, as I pull up to her place.  **Short date, except she is not getting out, and her shoulders were raised up, again.**  She keeps talking about work.  I looked over her as she talked, I thought to myself, I would love to be with her, but not if she is going to be like this.  She tells me how busy she is going to be this weekend.  I mention how I was going on a 4 day trip on Thursday.

She asked for me to call her on Monday to set up another date.  I personally have a feeling she is going to Flake, but what rule was that?  Always assume attraction?  If I do call, it will be late, and it will be as an afterthought.  **I notice that as she walks away her shoulders where back up.**

Could one of the mPUA tell me what the deal was with the body language?  (see Bold) and confirm/deny my mistakes?  What did I do wrong/right?  And how can I improve.  


TL;DR She won't shut up.  Weird body language, then ask me to call her?  I have no clue what I'm doing.

Update:  She just emailed me that we wouldn't work out.  Dodged a bullet there.  I wrote back that I agreed and I hope she finds what she is looking for.

I'm 26 and have never had an inkling of what I wanted to do with my life. Coming out of high school I just didn't have a lot of help in figuring out what major with me and I went into college rather unprepared. I started in CS but I absolutely hated it. I was capable enough to do the work, but I just pretty much decided I couldn't bear being so isolated, coding by myself for long periods of time.

I ended up switching around to a bunch of majors and eventually graduating with a degree in English (haha, I know how popular English degrees are on reddit). I also had some nice internships, including one doing technical writing, for which the company I was working for hired me right after I graduated. I worked there for a while but now I got laid off as the company isn't doing so well.

So I just feel like here I am at 26 back at square 1 again with no idea what to do next. I could keep doing tech writing but honestly I never saw that as something I wanted to make a career. I feel like this is the point in my life where I really need to make a career decision and go for it. I'm OK with the fact that this will probably mean going back to school. I'm just not sure what for.

**So Redditors, if you love your job, please tell me about it! I'm really hoping to just use this as a brainstorm of sorts to get some ideas from.** I'm particularly interested in jobs that would allow me to be social (I'm not good at sitting at a desk and being by myself all the time) and also have some ""meaning"" to it; like helping people in some way, something I can feel good about doing.

vnuv1,0,2012-06-26,"My girlfriend and I met and married in an MMO 8 Years Ago, help us finally break the distance?",kcm117,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vnuv1/my_girlfriend_and_i_met_and_married_in_an_mmo_8/,"The Story:

Eight years ago at the age of 14 I moved to the Florida from The Bahamas.  I didn’t know a single person so I decided that I would purchase a video game to occupy my time.  I stumbled into Best Buy and wandered into the video games section.  As I gazed at my choices, Star Wars Galaxies caught my eye.  I had never played an MMO before and I loved Star Wars, so it seemed like a good fit.

I spent my noob days wandering around Tatooine on the Ahazi server, until finally one day in Bestine, someone was advertising/recruiting for a guild called -CoP-.  I joined the guild and met a bunch of very nice people, whom i played with for over a year.  I grew very close to one person in particular, a female guildmate that played along with her brother and father.  We ended up getting married in the game after a few months.

After spending so much time talking in the game, we began to talk on Teamspeak and Ventrilo.  She seemed like a really nice girl and we became friends.  At this point, we were not more than online friends due to the fact that she lived in Indiana and I was in Florida, over 1,000 miles away.  After SWG started to fade, we still kept in touch through email and social networking.  I’d regularly contact her to see how she was doing and to make sure all was well.  After a few years, Star Wars: The Old Republic was announced.  We agreed that we would play on the same server and relive old times.

Fast forward to December of 2011, 7 years later and we were back online in a Star Wars setting.  Both older and more mature, we talked constantly via voice chat and began to realize the characteristics in one another that made us come together initially.  I was coming up on my last semester of University after five long years (dual major), and would finally be able to move wherever I wanted.  The timing seemed right so after a month of catching up, we decided to start a long-distance relationship.

I flew up to Indiana after a month and a half to finally meet the girl whom I had known for seven long years.  We had an instant deep connection that I had never felt with any of the other girls that I had previously dated, this was special.  My family initially thought I was crazy for flying across the country to meet “some girl from the internet”, and that I was most certainly going to be murdered by strangers. But alas, everything went well and her family really liked me.  This may seem naive or cliche, but we both knew we had each found our soul mate in one another.

We’ve been flying back and forth over the last few months visiting one another when work and school schedules permitted.  Towards the end of the semester I started applying to jobs in Indiana to discover that even for a graduate with three internships, work experience and two degrees, finding a post-graduation job is difficult.  I’ve applied to damn well over fifty positions with nothing yielding positive results as of yet.  There is added difficulty in applying for jobs in a city that is a thousand miles away.

I thought I would share this story to reddit for a number of reasons.  To show the fact that love can be found on the internet, that MMO’s may not be a complete waste of time and to ask for the Reddit community’s help and advice.  

Does the community have advice, comments, or job leads for someone in my shoes?  For background info, my degrees were in Finance &amp; Management Information Systems.  I also have internship experience in IT asset management, wealth management and internet product management.  I’m a very quick learner, dedicated individual and overall nice guy.  Also, I’m a redditor just like you. I’ve applied to a very high number of jobs and always attempt to follow up, but it’s difficult out there for new graduates as i’m sure many of you know.
 
We could really use help breaking the distance and finally being together, any advice?

I was diagnosed after a breakdown two years ago, and upon discussion, realized it had probably been going on for upwards of 7+ years. But, this week has been one of the worst in a VERY long time. I didn't realize how bad things had gotten until today.

I have been put on Academic Probation and Financial Aid Warning for my now failing grades in college. I have zero motivation (even while on Citalopram) and have withdrawn from too many classes to receive any Withdraw Passing grades including when I withdrew from university when I had hit rock bottom before. I'm worried I'm going to soon put myself in the position that I won't be able to return to college if I fail again.

I am on an upcoming rental house lease with a good friend and my now ex-boyfriend. We broke up about a month ago, and are now battling over the lease. My friend and I can't afford the place without him, but we haven't been able to find a replacement for him on the lease. Due to the nature of the lease, we can't even terminate it. I have to fight and deal with yelling and being put down almost every day because of it. 

Today, I was fired from my job. I had an internship position at a fairly large company. However, they had very little work for me. I've automatically put in my hours at the stable rate for weeks now. When I walked in to work today, I was met with HR and my boss. They sat me down and had a discussion that I was falsifying my time sheets. While I realize I may have had a bad day here or there (not being able to get out of bed in the morning), I had no idea that it had been so incredibly bad. I am going to be liable to pay back all the hours I wasn't there. I realize it's my fault for not adjusting things. But I'm terrified of the consequences. I feel like I let my depression get in the way of logical decisions. I'm afraid that I've completely ruined my future and career by those decisions. I don't even know what to say to them either. I feel trapped and absolutely hopeless because of this.

I am waiting to hear back from a psychiatrist to set up an appointment so I can return to medication and therapy. I have been trying so hard to get a regular help solution, but have had various failures. I have had many ""no new patients,"" no returned calls, and just general blocks. I've been to physicians that treat patients like cattle, and therapists that ignore what I say. I'm tired and want to give up. 

I just don't even know what to do any more. I feel like I'm in a place I can't escape, and that I have destroyed any chance for a happy future. I have zero friends for support. My sister is too messed up to offer consistent support and my Dad thinks depression isn't an illness. My Mom is my only rock, but even she's getting tired of my lack of progress. 

I just don't know any more.

I need your help.  I'm a guy, in my early 20s, and just graduated from one of the better universities in central London, UK.  I've now been offered an internship in the tech sector for the next 2-3 months.  It's unpaid, but they've hinted I might be offered a position at the end.
That's got me thinking - what should I expect salary wise, and do I negotiate?
I like to think I'm a pretty valuable commodity.  I've graduated from a good university, in a good, serious topic, with a 2.1 (that's a 3.0 GPA for Americans, ish).  I've got a lot of real work experience in a variety of sectors.  But I'm a recent graduate, and this is in a competitive field I'm really interested in working in.  I've also got parents who live nearby, and live there, so a huge starting salary isn't essential - but what should I be expecting?  What should I settle for?

I've asked my parents, but they both work in banks, so I'm not sure how valuable their advice is.  My dad said take anything, then try and make yourself invaluable, but my mum pointed out quick promotion isn't guaranteed in technology fields, especially in a customer service/operations position, so don't settle for anything under 25k.

So, reddit, what do you think?

A little backstory: my good friend, Katie (Des Moine, Iowa), is an ambitious animator that’s going to a very esteemed (and expensive) art school. Despites having more than her share of hurdles in life, she’s never once turned her back on her dreams, her morals, her family, or her friends. She doesn’t have much, but she’d give away her entire bank account and everything she owned if she thought it’d help someone out. She’s the type of person I look up to and someday aspire to be.

Recently she’s hit some financial hard times. Her computer, which she needs for her classes and her unpaid internship for school that she had to quit work for, has started to clonk out. She was saving up some cash here and there to buy a new computer before next semester but hit a few serious snags along the way- her commissions fell through, the internship started dumping other people’s work on her, and – most severe – her cat was just diagnosed with an unknown ailment that’s shaping up to be either diabetes or thyroid cancer. All the money she had saved up went straight into diagnostic tests and she has no idea how expensive the treatments will be.

Her other friends (Texas and Kansas) and I (Michigan) have been trying to help out but there’s only so much we can do since were all at least 300+ miles away and pretty much in similar financial situations ourselves. So I’m asking for some financial assistance in order to help cover her cat’s new expenses as well getting a new Macbook Pro for her so she can take her classes and finish her internship. Any amount helps tremendously.

Her Paypal address is kbolte@mcad.edu 

She also has some sculpture commissions open if you’d like to help her out while getting something in return. You can get more information here: http://iron-zing.deviantart.com/journal/#/d52g4v8

The intern (which I am giving him the benefit of the doubt that he was legit) kept bringing up that Raw 1000 will change the way the audience interacts with the WWE. 

I'm thinking that with Raw 1000, they are going to do something like they did the the AJ hashtag. They're going to start Raw shows off with a big segment (good idea, real in the audience) and then pose a question to the audience. They run a poll, and bam, there's the main event for the night. They might even have something like the real time polls that were going on during the E3 announcements. 

The Charlie Sheen hing is just a way for millions upon millions of people to see it live in action, and get it going in full effect. In my opinion, this is actually a very good move. Even if it's partially scripted (Like CM PUNK had 57% of that AJ poll...) it gives an interaction to fans, and gives an already huge media presence to the WWE when practically the entire roster is going to be trending topics on Twitter.

I would love to do a guided research project involving astrophysics, but I'm not really sure what exactly I'd like to research that would be doable, which is why I'm asking you guys. 

I'm going into my senior year.
Here is a list of my relevant courses, to give you an idea of my capabilities and knowledge base:
-modern physics (basically intro to SR and quantum)
-quantum mechanics
-statics
-astrophysics (was mostly about planetary orbits,included some visual python programming)
-AC/DC circuits
-electronics (mostly logic gates and such)
-intro to experimental design
-cslculus up thru multivariable
-linear algebra
-differential equations (have to retake)
-intro to algorithmic design 1 &amp; 2 (inrto cs courses, all programming in C++)

I'm really interested in cosmology, galaxy formation and life, gravatational lensing. I'd like to do something somewhat unique nd challenging without biting off more than i can chew. Any and all suggestions are really appreciated! Thanks!"

I'm looking to, in the next few years, be able to market myself as an independant Sharepoint consultant for small (50-200 person) companies to bring in for a few months to implement a Sharepoint solution to replace whatever aging intranet structure they do have.

2 years ago, I did a pretty self-directed internship in which I, with a little supervision, researched how to use Sharepoint, and developed a plan and prototype for the company, including some customized features. I learned a ton from this.

This summer, I'm working for a different company doing something very similar. It's being billed as an ""internship"", but they're treating me like a consultant and just checking up on my progress every couple of weeks.

Given this level of experience, I'd happily call myself an expert on this kind of Sharepoint implementation.

How do I market this? Are there MS certifications I can get? I'll have my bachelors in CS with a minor in Business by next May if all goes well. Where would I start looking for this kind of work?"

* What kind of a vet are you? (private clinic, farm, research, maybe something I never heard of?)
* How many different kinds of animals do you work with regularly? How intimately do you have to know the different species? Are they more or less similar or totally different?
* What's a normal day like? Do any of you have to be on-call like a human doctor?
* Do you just do check ups or also surgeries, spaying/neutering, that sort of thing?
* How is your balance of professional/family life?


I guess I'm just looking for information about the sort of ins-and-outs of the field. Is there anything specific I should know?

A little about me: I just finished my sophomore year as an electrical engineer at a state school. I have a good GPA and extracurriculars, so I think I could be a competitive applicant. I have a summer internship now which is making me question if I want to continue pursuing engineering.

I do not believe that any issues that arise here are too complicated for someone with sufficient knowledge of these things.

Additionally, I would be interested in discussing any other set up to assist, such as either part-time employment or a paid internship (with the understanding that it is not really an internship since you won't have a mentor).

EDIT:  To all you naysayers out there, this is a real law firm that needs some IT help.  I chose Reddit because I tend to find quality people on this site, both professionally and socially.  I also find a lot of people like some of the posters below who would not believe the sky was blue unless they saw it with their own eyes and had the Pope swear by affidavit by it. 

Additionally, you can see from my user account that I'm not some bot using reddit for nefarious reasons.  I'm always reading, and I regularly contribute. 

As for the sketchy email address, that was so I don't get bombarded with resumes and emails on my work account.  Responses are coming from my work eamil address so you can do your due diligence and realize that this is an actual law firm in a real building and with actual employees.  Is it so crazy to not want to put my work email out there for solicitations?  Apparently some of you think that way.    

So for those that took a wild leap of faith by emailing your resume to someone who is offering work, thank you.  For those of you who doubt the world is round because you've never personally seen it from space, good luck to you.

[BoundGame](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53503414/BoundGameFinal.swf) - a top down game where the player must get to the end of what is essentially an obstacle course. Press SPACE to jump, WASD/Arrow keys to move.

[BreakinBalls](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53503414/BreakinBalls-AKLOS.swf) - a physics game where the player tries to launch a ball into other balls and break enough of them to pass a level. I used Box2D for the physics in this, as my own physics code wasn't good enough. Mouse controls.

[LDGame](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53503414/LDGame.swf) - this was going to be my submission for the last Ludum Dare competition. Mouse controls, click to shoot.

Details inside!,Mirror23,Favors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/vq5b4/request_kind_of_a_weird_request_looking_for/,"I'm currently in Denver working a summer internship and I'll be done here at the end of July. At that time, my boyfriend will be flying here and we will drive together to the city where he and his family live. We want to get a room at a nice hotel together since this will be the first time we'll see each other in 4 months. Just for the record, we are both 21 and have been together for 1.5 years.

The problem is that his parents are very strict and overprotective and will never be on board with this plan. Every time he spends the night somewhere, they always call his friend's parents to make sure he is where he says he'll be. So basically there's no way we can stay at a hotel without an alibi.

That's where a friendly Redditor comes in :) I need someone to pretend to be the parents of the host family I'm staying with here and convince my boyfriend's mom that we're staying here in Denver a night longer than we really are. I don't have any family or friends in Denver, and I don't feel comfortable asking my host family or any of my coworkers to lie for me. So I'm relying on the kindness of the Internet here.

I'm looking for a person (preferably a woman, because my boyfriend's mom will feel more comfortable talking to the mother of the family) who can convincingly play a middle-aged mother. How this works is that I will give my boyfriend's mom your phone number, I will provide you with all the personal information you need to carry on a conversation with her, she will call you, and you will tell her that we are spending an extra day in Denver so we can see the mountains. That's it!

I know this request is a bit insane, but I would be really, really grateful if someone could do this for us. I'm willing to pay someone $20 to help me out. Thanks so much!

And I met a guy at my internship who is 26. At first everything was pretty much the same for the first few months, but now it's like wow is this really it once you're out of college for relationships??? I'm wondering for a few different reasons....
One, he likes to have sex once when we see each other... thats it.
two, he hates cuddling, and has no shame admitting so,
three, he will go the entire day without texting/calling me, and sees nothing wrong in this.
four, when he walks into my place i'm generally not greeted with a kiss.


is this guy just a weirdo, or are these how grown up relationships work?? Am i just used to being spoiled dating guys with no lives that will text all the time and wanna have sex 24/7?? We are about 4 months into our relationship. He takes me out to eat, pays for everything, and monetarily i guess you could say is very kind to me. but i miss all the cheesy stuff like cuddling all day, cutesy text message (or sexting), and it seems he's just too busy for all of this?"
vq3n1,0,2012-06-28,why is it so hard to get an unpaid internship in statistics? have you encountered similar difficulties?,[deleted],statistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/vq3n1/why_is_it_so_hard_to_get_an_unpaid_internship_in/,"I apologize if the posts in this subreddit recently have taken to an undergrad trend, but i think what I'm asking is significantly different enough from the other statistics major post to warrant a new thread.

I have friends in various other majors who (with similar GPAs, which I know doesn't say much unless I specify the majors) have easily gotten paid/unpaid internships. I have applied to over 25 internships/jobs which I've found online. The majority of these were through my university's job database, but I also searched internships.com. I've contacted department heads to see if there were any need for help in the department and ""cold emailed"" relevant businesses. The only place to offer me an interview did not have a website or phone number and did not return my emails! 

I've been searching for positions for this summer or the coming fall and at this point it feels like I'm all but explicitly stating ""free work! please, take it!"". *i'm not looking for sympathy* though this might be a rant, because I'm still a college student (majoring in statistics if it wasn't obvious), but I would like to know whether other statisticians on Reddit had experienced these difficulties when beginning their job hunts? Some kind of assurance that I'm not missing a vital step to make this process easier would help as well.

I also understand that I may not be qualified to do much of anything with the education I have thus far attained. However, I feel that by applying to primarily unpaid internships I am compensating for the lack of an extensive skill set.

So I’m currently an intern for a newspaper, and one of my tasks is to update the website everyday. The process is really annoying because the design is not very user friendly. On the system I use, every time I upload an article, it starts off at the very bottom (and thus on the website, it appears at the very bottom), which isn’t something I want, because as most of you will know, the newer the news, the higher up on the web page it should be. Right now, I have to resort to clicking the story back up, which means the more stories I upload, the more times I have to do it. At the end of the day, I’m clicking a story up 50 times and it’s super annoying. I found that every time I click up though, the following thing comes at the last part of the URL (I cannot show you guys the entire URL, for obvious reasons)

1&amp;subAction=move&amp;fmRank=55&amp;toRank=54

At first, I thought I’d hit jackpot, thinking I could type 55&amp;toRank=1 to avoid clicking so many times, but doing this made the stories switch places, so story 1 had taken the place of story 55, while 55 went to 1. This isn’t what I want. I want story 55 to go to rank 1 and the original rank 1 to get pushed to rank 2, story 2 to get pushed to rank 3, and so on. Is there a way I can type the URL to achieve this? 
Thanks!"

vq0cj,12,2012-06-27,"I, a PC/Android user was given an iPad to use for my summer internship. My thoughts after a month.",Elpants,ipad,https://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/vq0cj/i_a_pcandroid_user_was_given_an_ipad_to_use_for/,"First off, a little background. I have never been much of a fan of Apple as a business. As a PC gamer, I love my Windows 7 Desktop and my small HP laptop I use at school. Last Apple product I personally owned was an iPod video I bought with my first paycheck from my first real job in High School. When the ZuneHD came out, my iPod's 2nd battery was about dead. I jumped on the chance to purge everything Apple from my computer. Been happy with that ever since. I don't know what I would do without my Android phone, I have an Samsung Epic 4G Touch (Sprint version of the Galaxy S2) that is rooted with AOKP ICS ROM. I also own a Kindle Fire, unrooted and completely stock, I don't feel this is much of an Android experience and I use it as an e-reader, nothing else. I may root it and put ICS on it in the future. I have pretty extensive use of other Android tablets such as the Asus Transformer Prime as well.

Fast forward, I am 1 semester away from graduating with a degree in Construction Management/Engineering and after 2 years of interviews with some of the largest construction companies in the world and some small local ones, I scored a paid internship as a project coordinator with a small custom home builder that builds some very large and expensive homes for some very rich people. I moved to a new town and got an apartment a week after finals to start work.

The company is small, I along with the owner, another guy and a bookkeeper twice a week are the only ones in a 1 room office. The owner had been impressed with iPads and iPhones and tries to integrate them into the business. So he purchased an iPad for Project Managers and Superintendents. When I arrived, he ordered 1 more for me. Luckily I am using the iPad 3 while everyone else has an iPad 2.

The main thing he uses it for is a service called BuilderTrend. It allows the clients, engineers and architects to keep track of building progress that we upload online via iPad or Computer in form of product selections, photos and job reports. More on this service later.

Here are my thoughts on the iPad after a little over a month of use coming from someone who is used to knowing his way around a PC and Android Phone.

* Insanely simplified. There is no denying it's easy to use and pick up on. This isn't really a bad thing, but not so great either. Customization has been sacrificed in iOS in favor for the boring stock UI. Beyond moving icons around, I can't do much. When I turn it on, I see a homescreen with a few icons, the clock up top and the ""DON'T PANIC"" background I found. I am used to useful widgets with all sorts of information and functions at my fingertips. Speaking of icons it bothers me I can't select *where* on the grid I want them, they just snap to that first available slot. I feel it's too simple and I'm being treated like I am not trusted to create my own icon layout. [My Android home screen](http://i.imgur.com/EjDU4.png) reflects what I mean and wish I could do. VS [iPad Homescreen](http://i.imgur.com/x7y9l.jpg). (Kindle Fire's nightmare of a Homescreen doesn't begin to compare to either.)

* Stock email app is absolutely terrible. Few things bother me, the first I noticed when replying to a subcontractor while on a jobsite. I had put the pdf in my dropbox folder and downloaded it to the iPad, I wrote a reasonable in length email and tried to attach the file only to realize I couldn't. I needed to open the file on the ipad then select the email option...which just opens a new draft that is not related to the current email chain between myself, subcontractors and other construction personnel. Frustrated, I drove back to the office just to reply in Outlook in the sake of being organized and functional.

* Keyboard works and does it's job fine, but where are my long press keys? I can type with 1 thumb on my phone faster and more efficiently than I can on the iPad with both hands, I gave it a month to get used to it and I have become more accurate but I feel my speed and accuracy has plateaued. Word prediction is terrible compared to many of the 3rd party Android keyboards like Swiftkey 3 or use of a regular keyboard.

* While it takes a good photo [(example)](http://i.imgur.com/FVHLB.jpg) when lighting is good, it's awkward to use. One of the things with BuilderTrend is uploading progress photos the home. I was in the crawlspace of a new home taking pictures, it was dark, dusty and tight. The lack of flash prevented me from taking the photos I wanted and I didn't like the fact to get stable picture it required two hands. I ended up pulling my phone out to finish the photos because I needed flash to get a reasonable picture.

* Certain apps are just a joy the use. I had used Flipboard on my phone, but seeing it large and in charge on the iPad has made it my favorite app when I'm not working.

* Wifi range sucks, I have seen this as a problem and people saying getting a replacement solved it, but every iPad I have used that's owned by the company is suffering from the problem. Standing on one end of the jobsite I had no wifi on the iPad and neither did the superintendent, so I pulled out my phone and had perfect signal strength.

* It's a toy, bottom line here. Everything it does for my job, I can easily do on a laptop and more efficiently. I can upload photos on buildertrend, but I can't upload spec sheets for product selections. So instead, I just do it all on my laptop. Email does not have enough functionality to make it professional and organized, I can't create folders to file emails from jobsite to jobsite, I have limited attachment capabilities. I might as well do it on my laptop and only read emails on the iPad...which I do. There are a couple of things it does pretty well, such as being able to open the engineering/architectural drawings as a pdf or with Autodesk Design Review and easily view them while walking around or refer to specific details while having a full printed version in front of me. I keep notes on it, the stock note's app is surprisingly good.

* Gaming, I'm a PC gamer, I'm not sold on mobile games being anything more than puzzle games like Cut the Rope or social games like Draw Something. Even on Android, I don't play a lot of games. Frankly I get bored of them pretty fast. iPad is no exception. I wouldn't consider it gaming, more like 5 minutes at a time entertainment. Call it what you will.

This brings me to a few things, I would like to be able to use the iPad to make myself more productive. My boss would like to know what kind of apps would be useful (paid or free). All the apps we use as a company are on the screenshot of the home page [Or here](http://i.imgur.com/x7y9l.jpg). Like I have been saying, we're a General Contractor building Custom Homes and the like, even a private airport. The only thing I brought to the table was Autodesk Design Review (PC version I can do materials take-offs). So if there is anything I should know about I would appreciate it.

I realize a few things I find lame about iOS in general could be fixed through Jailbreak and believe me, if it wasn't company property I would have jailbroken this thing 10 minutes out of the box. I'm considering offering to buy the iPad from my boss after the my internship is over, it's neat and all, I like my tech toys, but with the Microsoft Surface and Asus/Google Nexus Tablet being announced, I might just go for one of those. I'm undecided, either way, whatever I end up owning for myself will be a fancy touch screen for Reddit."

To begin, I'm a rising sophomore in college who's set on finding an internship for the next summer no matter what. I'm ready to do pretty much anything: learn a new language, a new concept, you name it.    
The thing with me is that I actually did't understand/hated programming before January of this year (talk about a bad high school experience).     
So far I have taken an introductory course to Java; will be taking a continuation to that one in the fall (basically: algorithms and data structures), also will take discrete mathematics at the same time.     
This past semester really made me like CS and I'd like to pursue the degree. I understand that in order to set up myself for a better job after college, I need experience, lots of experience. So one of my ultimate goals for this upcoming academic year is to learn as much as possible for the recruitment season (which usually starts in January/February in my university).   
**TL;DR**    
**My experience so far**: basic Java, some Android development (started teaching myself this summer), HTML (lol), and some XML.     
**What are the ""must-haves"" that I need to learn before January 2013?**     
P.S. also, for anyone in a similar situation, I found these threads particularly **helpful**: [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rghrs/can_you_get_an_internship_as_a_freshman_in/), [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/h6cfk/computer_science_internships_how_do_i_go_about/), [3](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/m5biu/a_question_regarding_cs_internship_resumes/)"

So a while back I ran into this sub in a comment somewhere, and was incredibly intrigued. I have been PMOing since 15, probably, and now am 20.

I never thought of it as much of a problem, I am a pretty social guy, and was even able to get an awesome girlfriend who I have been with for 19 months now. PMO had not appeared to affect my life much at all, until probably the last year.

As much as I love her, we've had some sexual difficulty. We've maybe only had real intercourse a handful of times: I am apparently a bit too big for her (I'm nothing huge, she's just very tight and it makes it tough), but we are still very sexual in other ways. Unfortunately this aspect, combined with a very emotional year for her, have driven me to PMO on my own a bit more. Add to this that we are separated for the summer, and that she just finished college while I am returning next fall, and things have been tough. 

I was at a weird place at the beginning of the summer, seeking out new types of porn and looking up things that don't match my orientation (which I now think may be due to HOCD). This was due, in part I think, to being long distance (1000+ miles) from my gf. I recently started my internship only an hour from her, and these abnormal PMO habits slowed down.

In my preparation for my first visit from her, I decided to abstain from PMO simply so that our first time together would be awesome. During that week I seriously changed. I got a gym membership for the summer, ran nearly every day, worked out nearly every day, and was very able to make friends with all of the people in my internship (the last one isn't generally a problem for me, but I imagine my incidental NoFap still helped)

That weekend was amazing! We did lots of stuff together, and after she left I was so ready to continue with my NoFap!

Enter Chaser Effect:
The next week was a Fap-fest. Morning fap, after-work fap, evening fap. I very quickly lost energy. I changed. I was back to the weird porn. No more running, no more gym, sleepy every morning. 

I want to get back to energetic awesome me from the other week! A couple times this week I have said ""Let's do it. You don't even need to do that NoFap site, just believe in yourself. And it has never worked. I don't have expectations on me, and so I just succumb.

So here I go: I realized that a reboot is really what I need. I am posting here so that there are expectations on me. I am posting here so that I will follow through.

This summer is essential for me. This internship could be a huge in for me, if I do well. I have muscles to build, books to read, places to explore! No PMO will give me the time for this!

And perhaps most importantly, it will give me the time to think on my LDR. My girlfriend is simply incredible. But we have decided to part ways at the end of the summer, barring a huge decision to stay together. I fortunately this summer have the opportunity to see her nearly every weekend, but after that, no more. NoFap will help me to make those weekends awesome. But I will not succumb to the Chaser Effect again. I will go play sports, I will go outside and read a book, I will go buy ice cream.

So please, give me some wise words on NoFap, but also on LDR's if you have any. 

Signed,
FactsNotFaps (clearly not my main account)

**tl;dr:** The tl;dr is the same as every other day 1 post. The details are what is interesting.

Anyone have any advice/good stories about pleading not guilty and going to court?",ChazzyCheese,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vpsau/got_a_traffic_ticket_for_supposedly_not_stopping/,"I was pulling out of a parking lot after buying a delicious sandwich and on the way out I accelerated a bit too much and I guess there was a cop around, because I got pulled over almost immediately after I turned right at the corner.

Well I got the feeling that the cop who pulled me over was power trippin'  pretty much the first thing she said was ""You're gonna be leaving here with at least a $500 ticket you know that?"", which is quite funny because even after writing me all that she could it only was $318. Anyway, she goes on to tell me how I was speeding and going 45 in a 25. Whatever, I acknowledge this and admit my fault but then she says I did not stop at the stop sign, which is ridiculous because I stopped for at least 3 seconds (which is the minimum at least in my home state), to which she replied that I was over the stop line..

Now wait a minute. The intersection where this particular stop sign is is a pretty big intersection, meaning that if you actually wanted to see if there were any cars coming, you would have to go a little further ahead to safely view the road. That is what I did, I actually might have even stopped fully before and inched up until I could see so I was pretty pissed that my ticket included that, so I plead not guilty cause fuck that shit, y'know?

Well fast forward a bit, my court date is here but I'm currently not in the same state (2.5 hrs away, got the ticket while at university) and am doing a 9-5 internship everyday of the week, so I can't really go attend my court date. So I'm thinking of just calling the court and changing my plea to guilty and just pay my fine and get it over with. I could however ask them if they could delay the date, as I will be back at school only 3 weeks after when my date is scheduled.

So do you think I should just pay the fine or try to get them to postpone my court date and still go try to fight it?


TLDR: Got traffic ticket, should I pay fine or plead not guilty"

I'm not particularly close with my siblings or my parents, in fact, I'd say they really don't know anything about me now that I've been away from home for a while (recent college grad). I have no dating prospects whatsoever, maybe one person who I consider a real friend, ""networking"" means nothing to me and its something that I'm apparently entirely incapable of.

It makes no sense at all. I'm young, actually very good-looking (just trying to be truthful, In person I would never brag about something that I didn't work for like that), in great shape because I exercise 5 days a week, rich (although virtually nobody knows this about me as fortunately I did have a great upbringing, and I'm actually uncomfortable being flashy or drawing attention to myself for stupid reasons like that), smart (I'll be going to grad-school next year in a fairly technical field).

But no matter what, clearly something is missing. I just don't get it, I'm a somewhat quiet guy, but not anything peculiar at all, and at this point I make a conscious effort to be nice and outgoing to people, because I've been refereed to as ""intimidating"" by some of my acquaintances before. Hell, I'd say almost every time I interact with somebody face-to-face, I'm actually forced to control the conversation, because even in person it seems like people just sit back and wait for me to initiate everything. If I don't say anything, with most people I would just end up sitting  awkwardly in silence, so even truly saying that I'm quiet is a bit of a stretch.

All in all though, I'm starting to think that despite it all, I'm just not ""interesting."" I have few hobbies, and those that I enjoy I'm honestly mediocre to awful at (I've been playing guitar for about 10 years and I fucking suck lol.....can't sing for shit either ha). I'm stuck in the city with no car, so any outdoorsy activities are difficult to organize (If I could even find anybody to do them with, which I cant.) Its summer now, and I've just been sitting around doing nothing. I bounce around between different places (home and in the city and vacation) too much to get a job or internship, and even if I applied for one, I'm entirely non-competitive (my last job, three years ago, was as a summertime late-night janitor (best job ever))

God I hope grad school is better than undergrad for me. I was absolutely fine in highschool, but I went to a small school so the kids I grew up with are the kids I went to school with (they were like family then, we are all losing touch now due to circumstances). Now I'm at a huge school in a huge city, and clearly something is missing from my personality, because out of everybody here, nobody gives a shit about me.

[Is r/squaredcircle one of the sites you visit for consumer research?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56a1ln?context=5)|I do visit r/squaredcircle, but that's just because I'm a redditor lol. I have no idea of any plans to change the set or theme but there is a chance everything will change on the 1000th episode. Also, its going to be highly interactive. Like taboo tuesday but better.
[Any word if there are plans to change the raw set or theme anytime soon? For the 1000th episode?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56a1ln?context=5)|I do work in stamford in the Titan Towers building. I didn't see Morgan.
[I'm assuming you work in the Titan towering Stamford, correct? Did you see Matt Morgan there last week?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56a1ln?context=5)|I talk about everything wrestling with my boss, including TNA and ROH and UFC. It's my job to know about them and talk about them =)
[Do they openly talk about TNA around the office?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56a1ln?context=5)|I went to an ROH event this past weekend.
[Any insight as to why WWE seems to have a hardon for twitter?  Notice any changes in policy or marketing relating to Linda's campaign?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56c9ai?context=5)|WWE is proud of its social media presence. social media is essentially free marketing so it would be foolish not to integrate.  I haven't noticed anything due to Lina's campaign. I will say that Fox News is always on the tvs in the elevator lol. I trained for a year with the IWF in NJ. They aren't around anymore but I had some of the best times of my life there.
[To what extent was your Indy career? Where'd you train/wrestle? How was WWE's attitude towards this in the interview process?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56c9ai?context=5)|The interview process was very relaxed. They didn't ask me any ""interview questions"" such as what is your greatest flaw etc. They just wanted to know my availability, knowledge of the product, and what days I could work. The second they asked me how much I knew about the product, I knew I was in.
[Coolest wrestler you've met?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c568rkw?context=5)|Well I've only been here since June 4th and haven't seen many wrestlers. Also, I only work Mon-Wed. But Paul Levesque comes in on Wednesdays and I've actually met him. We are on a first name basis (I call him Paul) which is such insanity. For those who don't know Paul is better known for his in ring persona, Triple H.
[I am correct to assume he's a massive individual in person?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56b897?context=5)|Yes, even in a suit. Although I'm 6'3"" so it wasnt that bad. I was mostly just shitting myself and trying not to pull an awkward penguin while shaking his hand.
[Is he still married to Stephanie?  (Vince's daughter\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56efsh?context=5)|Yup.
[Do people actually think its real? Any funny stories in regards to that? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c568t26?context=5)|I figured this would come up. First of all, most people know its scripted.  It isn't fake though. I would never call it that. Everything they do in there from an athletic point of view is completely real. They put on a show at any costs. The pain and excitement is very real. Obviously the punches are pulled and they are mostly all friends who don't want to hurt themselves. Why would they? If they actually killed each other every night there would be noone left to fight after a month.
 |I will say that the kids do have a higher suspension of disbelief. On my first day I checked my messages on my phone because I was getting used to my office and I saw that I had a voice-mail. It was from a very young kid who must have found our number online and called and somehow it got transferred to my desk. I listened to the voice-mail and it was hilarious and cute. The kid was so upset with The Big Show and was telling me how WWE NEEDS to fire him. The message went on for 5 minutes. I still might have it. He kept saying how Big Show is bad for business and needs to be fired for what he has done.
 |Big Show is one of the WWE's top heels right now and this voice-mail just reminded me of the passion I used to have for this program when I was 11.  I still have passion for the product, but I'm much more grown up now lol.
[You probably don't know this directly, but could you work your channels and find out if Paul Wight has a special toilet? Like a special big-boy toilet.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56c776?context=5)|He has his own bus, so it's possible.
[Are you ever tempted to get fired just hear Vince McMahon fire you?  Is that why you created this AMA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c569uej?context=5)|2) I don't think I will get fired for this. (At least I really really hope I dont) 1) My career goals thus far are to join the ""Kiss My Ass Club"" and hear Vince yell those two infamous words ;)
[ now reddit knows you want to kiss an old mans ass...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56anbb?context=5)|YES! YES! YES!
[How long have you been there? Have you met all the wrestlers? and what is Vince like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c568slx?context=5)|The wrestlers are usually on the road and don't often come to my building. I haven't met Vince, so I cant tell you, but Paul was very nice. Joey Styles also introduced himself to me. I call him Joe.
 |I started on June 4th. Everyone that I have met is so incredibly nice. It is seriously the best working environment I could think of. Especially since I've been a hardcore fan since middle school.
[So what exactly is your daily job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c568ray?context=5)|Basically, I am the eyes and ears of the WWE on dirt-sheets and competitive analysis. I go through the internet and find out what people are saying about WWE, its programs, and its upcoming network. I also keep an eye on UFC, TNA, and boxing updates. I look at what other companies are doing marketing wise, and think of how WWE could put their own spin on it. I maintain a PPV Competitive Calendar that compares buyrates in our industry. My current big project is creating a database that contains information on EVERY WWE PPV EVERRRR!! It's taking a while, but is an important task. My work is going to be shown to the VP of something or other, so I'm proud of that.
[Please, just let them know Dolph Ziggler needs the World Heavyweight Title.  Ratings will skyrocket.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56bg9r?context=5)|Believe me, I know!
[You sit down all day reading about MMA and Pro Wrestling, damn, that is a dream job.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c569hcj?context=5)|Pretty much! It's what I did for fun, but now its a job lol.
[Do you go through r/SquaredCircle while doing this research?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56avkz?context=5)|Yes, and for fun. I LOVE wrestlingwithtext.
[What kind of information about the PPVs are you collecting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56bjh9?context=5)|Buyrates mostly. Fan reactions. Looking for any changes in our competition (injuries, contract disputes, conficting PPV dates)
[Always wondered if they look into things like what people are saying. Does that influence things, and how so?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c568wfw?context=5)|It doesn't influence things too much. Obviously I see the feedback on the dirt sheets and a lot of it is negative, but I'm used to that. Basically I'm just looking to see what our competators are doing. Recently UFC got like 3 major injuries and had to change a few of its PPV cards. Those are the things I'm looking at.
[Are you getting paid for this internship?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56bd6m?context=5)|Nay, tis for credit.
[ was that true? I was at the Rumble, everyone was pretty much convinced Jericho was going to win, then when Sheamus won the building kinda went... ""huh"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56doqw?context=5)|It would seem to be true, although I cant confirm that.
[For the fan reactions and competition info are you having to comb the web for this info, or do they already have a lot of it and you're just putting it into a centralized location?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56bq8w?context=5)|Anything I deem reportable goes to my boss and he does with it what he wants.
[Whoa whoa whoa....you consider the UFC to be a competitor of the WWE?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56d9gw?context=5)|Absolutely.
[Were you a big fan before taking the internship? What do you study that landed you there? What was the selection process like? Did working there change what you feel about the WWE? Is it still exciting to watch if you know the outcomes of the matches in advance?  What size are the Great Khali's pants?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c568v99?context=5)|I have been watching WWE since 2003. It's been an obsession of mine. I study Marketing and this is a marketing internship. I applied online via the corporate site and got a call from an HR person telling me they wanted to interview me. After the interview I was exteded an invite for the Summer internship and had to sign a bunch of papers and stuff.  I don't know details like the outcomes of the matches (I dont want to know frankly) but rather more general things such as which legend will be on RAW this week, who is headlining what PPV, celebrity guests, WWE Magazine stories and WWE.com articles.
[Do you live in the Stamford area or did you have to relocate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56ay0p?context=5)|Right now I live on campus at my college in the Bronx/Riverdale area. I commute. Usually a 35-40 minute commute as long as its not raining.
[God, that sounds exciting. I'm from Queens so if I got this my commute would probably be significantly longer.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56b6fo?context=5)|Plus I work 10-4 so I miss most of rush hour. AND its a reverse commute (I'm leaving the city in the morning and coming back at night)
[I'm guessing you drive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56bajp?context=5)|Yes! WWE has a parking garage as a part of its corporate headquarters.
[As a CompSec Systems student, you've given me hope and direction. I'm going to try and do all it takes to get that internship next semester. I WANT to work for WWE's IT eventually. It'd be my dream job. Thank you, you've inspired me so much. You have no idea.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56bc5f?context=5)|It really can happen to anyone. I'm just a guy who loves the product and applied for my dream job. Now I have it and will hopefully slowly climb the corporate ladder until I die. Our IT department has some really cool shit and is located on the third floor. Anyone who is interested should call in and see if they can get a tour, or apply for a job/internship online. If you need any help with the application process or have any specific questions about my process I would be glad to help.
[Who is your favorite wrestler currently on the roster?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56a633?context=5)|Damien Sandow. Without a doubt. My favorite (until his recent semi-retirement) has always been Undertaker. Im also a huge fan of Punk and Bryan and Ziggler. 
[We had a conversation n the pub last week about what matches wedlike to see above all others. The other guys all mentioned triple-threats/Cage matches with Cena, Punk etc..  I just said Ryback v Sandow. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56dnh0?context=5)|Maybe when they decide to put Ryback against an actual person that can happen. I doubt it though as they are both getting pushed and for one to put the over now wouldn't be wise. 
[Yeah! I should be moving to Vienna, Austria pretty soon and hopefully pick it up from there!  Any advice you'd like to throw my way? haha.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56cyql?context=5)|I'm sure there are good schools in Europe. Although, honestly, I have no idea where or how to get to them. If you are serious about being a wrestler, do what the greats have done. Get in shape, spend as much time as you can in the ring. Wrestle often. Work on mic skills. Learn from everyone and everything. Always ask veterans for advise. Always improve. Don't stand still. Learn as many styles as you can, luchador, Japanese, American, European. There is so much to learn, you will never stop. Take care of yourself and the people you work with.
[I just printed that out and will hang it on my wall in a bit. Thank you for your time and all the best man! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56d3ua?context=5)|I am honored to have been some help.
[Is there a museum or something similar there? Also, do they let you watch any of the library they have there? One final question, who is the most famous person you have met (superstar or backstage guy\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56coc5?context=5)|The whole place is a museum. I walk past Andre's boots everytime I go to lunch. Every employee has acess to that week's shows and the most recent PPV. WWE programming is constantly on in the cafeteria and elevators. I met Triple H.
[Awesome! I would love to visit that place one day. I am a stock holder so.. GET BACK TO WORK YOU BUM!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56cv1t?context=5)|I'm so sorry to hear that. lol.
[Whats your day to day job consist of? Is there any interesting behind the scenes stuff that goes on we probably wouldn't think about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c568w9a?context=5)|I answered the day to day thing but I will say that the office building is amazing. It has a very WWE ""feel"" to it. The first time I walked into the building, my jaw dropped. I still cant help but smile when I'm walking through the halls. Im such a wrestling nerd and this is pretty much my dream come true.
 |Actually, I think its worth noting that employees have access to the roof and on thursdays there are BBQs =) The view from the roof is beautiful.  Its something I didn't know until I came here.
[Hi neighbor.  (Well, I assume you are working in one of two buildings\).  What is your favorite few places to get lunch around the office?  I'm trying to figure out where I feel like going today.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56a0he?context=5)|As much as I hate to say it, I have no idea and usually eat in the cafeteria (yuck). Or I bring my own lunch. Sodexo did the food at my college but they got replaced. Just when I thought I'd never have to deal with them again, I come here lol.
[The dirt-sheets have consistently said that Vince changes his mind literally as the wind blows. In the short time you've been there, have you experienced this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c569src?context=5)|Yes. That is the feeling I have gotten from the few meetings I've been to. I never have meetings with Vince, but the way others talk about him it seems like he changes his mind a lot. The thing is, I honestly think he is a genius for everything he has created. Geniuses are usually eccentric. Mr. McMahon is no exception. 
[The IWC is enamored with Dean Ambrose...whats his buzz like in the Titan Towers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56c1n1?context=5)|It's just awesome. Everyone's hard at work and very excited. We are approaching a huge milestone with this 1000th Raw. You didn't hear it from me, but there is going to be an awesome promo spot for the new start time.
[A promo regarding Dean?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56c3sk?context=5)|No, I really cant tell you who. but it will be gold.
[Awesome?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56desm?context=5)|Ah I read it wrong. I read ""whats the buzz like"". The people I work around love him also. We also like the Prime Time Players. Darren Young got his start at the wrestling camp that I trained at, so Im always pushing for him.
[No one can convince me that goldberg isnt involved now.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56ckes?context=5)|Im sorry to hear that lol.
[The IWC will just be hoping it's Dean from this comment and then be disappointed. It will be all your fault :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56cqpt?context=5)|Its actually not.
[Goldust vs cody?!?!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56drc6?context=5)|Goldust has been future endeavored.
[Was there any proper reason why the Bella's were fired? Man, I liked those girls :3.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56brl6?context=5)|They weren't fired. They just didn't resign.
[Is there any big angle/story/debut that you know about but you can't tell us? Nothing specific really. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56b7j0?context=5)|Well it's one that you could all guess but hasn't been confirmed on television. I saw the promo for Summerslam last week. It is centered around Triple H's opponent. (Whoever that may be ;)  ) I knew about the new show Main Event before it was announced as well. I'm not sure about any debuts or anything but I will say that EVERYTHING will change with the 1000th RAW. It's not going to be just a 1 off show with everything going back to normal after. This show is going to change the future of MNR forever.
[RE: Main Event - Is it Superstars with a new name or will it actually have storylines and some of the bigger names in the company?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56c4ml?context=5)|I guess we'll just have to wait and see. That depends on what the higher ups want.
[I've been a longtime subscriber to Meltzer and Alvarez's Wrestling Observer/Figure Four website, and it's amazing to hear that your job (from a marketing standpoint\) is to keep tabs on dirtsheets, especially considering the tenuious relationship wrestling journalists have had with the industry (stating they were false, lying, changing finishes based on what the smart crowd is expecting them to do, etc\).  From your position in the company, both your boss and your co-workers, what is your opinion on the dirtsheets/wrestling journalists? Do they help the product? Hurt the product? A necessary evil?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56c88z?context=5)|I use them as a tool. They tell me all the news I need to know about the industry in one place. I could care less about the drama stories (from a work point of view) but the actual substancial news I use. I am personally a fan of the sheets and journalists. I love the bleacher report. Any buzz about the product is good buzz and I dont think they have the power to do any harm.
[Are you there to make a career out of it, or is it just a part-time temporary gig?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c5690ad?context=5)|Right now its part-time. My career goal for my life was to get a bunch of jobs and hopefully work for WWE in some respect. Instead, I am still in college and am starting my career here. I am working with people who were interns here and it led to a full time job. Basically, my goal is to hopefully be hired here full time and never ever leave haha.
[Honestly, does wwe creative steal ideas from r/squared circle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56axtd?context=5)|Not that I know of =(
[Now, I'm not going to say the WWE is finding ideas on SquaredCircle, but I am going to point out this comment I made 22 days ago, and well....I think you can see where I'm going with this.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56e975?context=5)|Holy Crap! Well done! haha.
[What is your intern position title? what are you going to school for? any special qualifications or ppl you know that got you the job? Does WWE worry about the popularity of UFC.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c569sgx?context=5)|I am an intern for Affiliate Marketing. I got to a college in the bronx for marketing. I didn't know anybody here when I applied, and this is the only place I applied to. I'm just really really lucky. Also, I go to a fairly reputable school and have a lot of knowledge of the product, which the interviewers loved. Of the 20+ interns I met during orientation, only about 2 of them knew anything about our product, which was very strange to me.
[I'm fairly certain I know who this is from reading this AMA. We go to the same school and worked together on a certain Marketing Presentation for a Korean professor this past semester? Haha.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56akja?context=5)|The dongster!
[What does WWE mainly look for in it's talent? For example if I wanted to get into WWE developmental what would I need? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56dycd?context=5)|To be a WWE talent you need years of experience, preferably with styles from all around the world. Watch the legends. Use what they did to perfect your skills set. Be willing and humble. After years of training you can pay for a try out at FCW the WWE's developmental territory. I believe they are 1K a try out. Good luck! PS Vince is looking for 6'2 240pounders more or less.
[Looks like I'll just have to train for a long ass time and hopefully not be awful. I'm currently 6'3 and about 175-180lbs with 15% BF at 17 years old, looks like I've still got some work to put in.  I would have thought they would just be looking for great technical wrestlers and mic workers, seen as Punk and Bryan are so over. But I guess they need a nice spread of different builds and styles.  Any idea how much they value technical skill and charisma/mic work? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56eifo?context=5)|Technical skill and charisma and mic work are all soooo important. Mic work and charisma are the most important, but will get you only so far. Technical skill is important but unfortuantly not as valued as it should be (look at hogan, cena, miz). If you have technical skill and charisma/mic skills you should be set but McMahon is looking for someone with the skills of punk and bryan but with more muscle. He thinks the reason they aren't as over as they can be is because they dont have the ""superstar"" look. Its bullshit, but its what he thinks.
[What has been the response to the leaked pictures of the new WWE championship belt?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c569usr?context=5)|My boss and I don't like it (the pics we saw). But I'm not sure if its the real thing or if it was completed or anything like that.
[It's real. The picture was prior to it being finished.  Seems like there is a disconnect here. I was more interested in knowing how they felt internally about it being leaked, not if people ""liked"" it necessarily.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56a1uy?context=5)|Ah, sorry about that. I haven't heard anything either way about the issue, so I just told you what I know. I brought it up in a meeting with my boss and he just sort of acknowledged it and we talked about how we didn't really like it.
[Biggest dick you've met backstage?  Literally and figuratively ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c569106?context=5)|A few of the cafeteria workers are assholes. That's it. Everyone else is very nice and made me feel at home.
[Can you explain to me why or how CM Punk is so popular? Also, what the hell was the WWE thinking in bringing back Albert as (Lord\) Tensai?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56cbnl?context=5)|Punk is popular with fans old and new. He is fairly unique in that aspect. He entertains kids, and makes wrestling fans happy. Good on him.
 |As for Tensai. I was excited when I saw his promo videos. It was a cool idea that just didn't go over. It happens. I was just talking to my friends about how if they just brought him back as A-Train again, the fans would have accepted him as a wrecking ball and he's be main eventing PPVs. His debut was underwhelming.

They are both being treated as huge events and everyone is working hard to make them amazing. 
[2\) This doesn't have to do with either shows, but have you noticed an increased workload/more frenzied pace at Titan Towers with the 3 Hour Raws coming up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56a2si?context=5)|1) I haven't heard anything yet but I will let you know if I do (as long as I'm allowed to share) I will say that it will be highly interactive with the fans making decisions that will ACTUALLY impact the show. This is what we've been wanting forever right?
[I think many people are skeptical about WWE being interactive because of speculation that they doctor the polls. can you speak to this at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56bm0d?context=5)|If that happened in the past, it wont happen with this. With the voting PPVs, creative always had the final say. With this, I am told the WWE Universe will directly effect the outcome. There will be polls and whatever you vote on WILL effect the show.
[Fan from the west coast here:  I know RAW tapes live on the east coast.  Is there any way that they can sometimes make is so that it airs live on both coasts for the shows that are interactive?

This job is not stressful. It is everything I have ever wanted. The office is laid back and business casual. Everyone seems friendly and respectful. 
[Ever seen Vince at his nuttiest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56ckwj?context=5)|I've never seen him. Or Steph for that matter, and I'm by her office quite often.

[Any progress on WWE Network plans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56cwnd?context=5)|There are 4 business models being considered. With Summerslam and Raw 1000 and WWE Network everything is kind of busy and stressful around here. WWE Network plans are hush hush which actually sucks if you are an affiliate marketer because when the affiliate companies ask us for a PPV line up for next year, we don't have them as soon as we typically do.

[What were the requirements?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vojjk/iama_intern_at_wwe_world_wrestling_entertainment/c56a06k?context=5)|I had to be a Junior in College and it had to be for credit. And I had to be a marketing major, but that was because of the specific internship. Anyone who is interested should constantly look at the corporate site for job or internship info. With the development of the WWE network, they are probably going to be hiring a few hundred more people.

He works a limited number of dates though, so Paul Heyman will be (and has been) taking his place in promos. Which I love. Look for Brock to be on the 1000th show and Summerslam.

vtk2d,1,2012-06-29,"Alright expert trackers of Reddit, I lost access to the name and phone number of a company that wanted to interview me because of my stupid phone. Any suggestions?",KingOfSwing90,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vtk2d/alright_expert_trackers_of_reddit_i_lost_access/,"Here's the full story:

So I've been on the job hunt for approximately the last month, to little avail. The industries I'm trying to get hired in are downsizing, and I have little to no experience (I took paid jobs instead of unpaid internships during my college summers). This being the case, I was absolutely ecstatic when I got home two nights ago, turned on my phone (which had died a few hours earlier) and had a voice mail from a company looking to get me in for an interview. My phone volume was low, so I turned it up and tried to press the button to repeat the message. However, my phone is a bit old, and the touch sensors are a little off...so I accidentally deleted the message. This wouldn't be a problem except that my phone, like so many others I assume, does not record missed calls if it's turned off- only messages.

All I have is the area code (Sacramento, CA). Yesterday I tried contacting our phone provider and got access to the list of incoming calls on my phone number, and there was no trace of said area code. Maybe this won't be a company I'm interested in, but it's the first good lead I've had in a little while, and I'd really appreciate it if anyone has any suggestions!

**TL;DR Unemployed college grad seeks interview with unknown company, aging phone deletes my only source of information on this company, now I need help recovering it. Wat do?**"

How can I keep from giving up?",ravenesque1,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/vtjzh/i_need_help_im_stuck_with_a_racist_condescending/,"Honestly, I'm at my wits end. I've been here since May, and will be until August, and I think my spirit's almost broken. 



Over the summer, I agreed to stay with my aunt because I needed a place to stay for a paid internship. I had reservations, but I didn't even thing paid internships existed anymore. But as the days went by, I realized that things were bad. **Extremely** bad:



*she has isolated me from any friends or family.

*she forces me to ""follow"" her ""advice"" with the threat of being kicked out. (by ""follow"", I mean adhere to exactly, and by ""advice"", I mean contradictory rules)

*she doesn't allow me to spend time at home taking care of work for my job by unloading extensive, unnecessary chores on me daily (yes, toilets cleaned with toothbrushes)

*she verbally abuses me constantly, and any utterance of any kind of defense on my behalf leads to near physical abuse

*the money that I was supposed to earn for tuition keeps on being taken by her for living expenses that she agreed I never had to worry about. I'm stuck here, and not even making money for school like I needed to in the first place! I can't buy any sort of ticket to leave either.

***And worst of all:***

*I'm black, and she found out that I've been in a stable, longstanding relationship with someone who isn't. Ever since then, all of my ""advice"" and punishments have been exacerbated to a point where I can only sleep for 3-4 hours a night in time to finish everything, and the verbal abuse now includes heinous racial slurs not only against the SO, but even black people, to help ""remind me that I'm just a [N-word] that'd be hard-pressed to find any kind of healthy relationship.""



*Additional details*

She's a well-known lawyer who also owns her own company, and uses her influence to monitor what I do all day, everyday. To keep things private, I've had to delete all information from my phone, constantly change passwords on my ipod, laptop, and any other device of that nature.

Also, I can't even vent to my mom because no phones are allowed at work, and there obviously isn't enough privacy in the house to do so. Even if I could get away with it, my mom has recently contracted a chronic, stress-related disease because of the things that my aunt has done, and I'd probably trigger it if I got the chance to complain. :(

Reddit, I need help.  :(

**tl;dr I need any kind of coping mechanism to pull through a couple more months of a truly suffocating environment.**

**EDIT:** I'm staying here until Aug. 25th, so it's a couple months. Also, upon completion of the internship, I'm receiving a laptop (to keep) that's necessary to stay with the company in the future. I don't even have to pay for it. The SO's pissed about the situation, but knows that because I can't afford the laptop myself, it's necessary for me to finish this so that I can disassociate with my family permanently. That's the plan. However, when I do leave, I plan on giving her the goodbye she deserves. Immature? Yes. Worth it? **Absolutely.**

**EDIT 2:** I know that it's bad and I need to get out, and I'll obviously jump on any opportunity that I can find/is presented. But I'm asking for *coping mechanisms*, because the usual outlets one would lean toward simply aren't compatible with the current situation.

It just seems that agencies don't explicitly look for this sort of thing, and makes me shudder, frown, grimace, confuzzled, and tear-eyed all at the same time (woah).
 
Should I just do straight up copywriting? Come up with entire non-traditional campaigns? Summon the power of Thor's hammer?

Back to the drawing board after 8 years of confusion.",sarrybaterson,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/vtfju/my_story_back_to_the_drawing_board_after_8_years/,"I’ve been posting for a while on here but haven’t been feeling a very strong connection with this community, perhaps telling my story will help with this.

I’m a 22 year old guy, lived in the states all my life, my username is a variation of my real name, yeah didn’t put much thought into it heh.

The main reason I started this is because like most of us I could use the inspiration and motivation to meet my goals, my love life being front and center. My problems with females started way back when I was like 14, I was home schooled, and though I have no regrets about it and it provided me with many things it also cut down many chances of a social life, combine that with being very shy, awkward, overweight, happy to spend huge amounts of time on my own, and different from the home schooler stereotype (we never really fit in home schooling groups)  I had no social life through my entire childhood and early teen years.

So when I was 14 or there abouts I became curious and blindly turned to the internet as a way to meet people, and promptly I became overly attached to a girl from a member based music site, in my youthful ignorance I found myself longing for a relationship with this girl I barely knew, it gave me something to do with all of the confusing and amplified emotions most people have at that age, also there were painful issues developing in my family that I’m sure contributed, my parents splitting, my older sister’s drug abuse, the birth of my niece and ensuing custody battle.

So one day in the midst of all this, just searching for some kind of relief I plucked up the courage to tell her how I felt over text, and of course I received a very kindly worded rejection. It was at this point that I started thinking of girls as something out of my reach, I hadn’t yet learned to handle most general life problems, so I deeply internalized anything that went wrong as my failure, or that for some reason I didn’t deserve the things that I wanted, combine this with the fact that I was very religious in those days (with no pressure from my parents or anyone) I saw fornication or anything related as dirty and evil.

It was around then I got my own laptop as a birthday present and promptly began struggling with porn, it became an extremely powerful drug, during the day I would make grand speeches to myself about never doing it again (I can’t let god down, the whole 9 yards) and then at night I’d be back in my room completely overmatched by my depressed state, my age, and the urges, I would do whatever I could think of to stop, even writing to random girls on myspace trying to get a date (yeah I was clueless) and when nothing ever worked out and I was back in my room again caving to urges, I began cutting as a way to get back at myself, or to see that justice was served. 

Fast forward to about 17 years old, as the issues with my family continued to get worse, I became angry, doubt for my faith grew and grew, I listened to slipknot, I started lifting (still a therapeutic passion of mine) I lost  like 50 pounds, joined a youth group, met my best friend, which helped me a lot but I still couldn’t get a girlfriend for one reason or another, just didn’t know what to say or how to act to get my intentions across, my teen angst continued to grow.

Fast forward to 20, I was offered a position as an intern at a youth hostel, interns would live at the building, have our own rooms, and take care of whatever business was required, such as front desk work, cleaning etc. After being there for maybe 5 months once again I found myself in another dysfunctional relationship situation, but this time with another intern, she was older than me, and even though she knew how I felt about her she would use me for a shoulder to cry on, and for physical comfort, she was mentally unstable and extremely needy which was probably the biggest reason I fell for her, one minute she loved me, the next she hated me, she was a charity case. It became very ugly, I was drinking heavily on a nightly basis, smoking, cutting like never before (I now have very visible scars I hope to get removed someday) 
Towards the end of my stay there I had a very short relationship with a girl I met online, she broke up with me after a month, never really said why.


I retuned home from my internship a changed man, still angry, still had strong feelings for both women, but even though I knew it would take years to recover I knew I learned something, I learned that throughout my experiences I was never in control, I was outraged, I was broken, but I was never in control.
I’ve learned that I was always thinking of myself as the victim, and that things would not change until I changed my thinking about myself, and started doing things on my own terms, so my friends, my journey has lead me here, I’m still learning, but now I can say with pride that I’m aware of what it’s gonna take to get the things I want, and I’m willing to step up to the plate and try my best.

“So you can lock yourself away, give up, forget, go back to sleep, or you can realize that there is so much more to life than yesterday.”

My notes are one of the biggest and heaviest things in my bag, and if I could get a note taking device I could downgrade to a smaller bag.

I've been considering either a Thinkpad tablet or an Asus Eee Note EA800. Both tablets have their pros and cons, especially with the Eee Note, as it can be very hard to find. The Thinkpad tablet has received mixed reviews and is more expensive than the Eee Note, but I feel like it may be easier to use.

 Does anyone have any experience with either of these devices and can give me an impression of them? I've looked at a writing tablet attachment for my laptop too, but a couple of my professors don't allow laptops."

I have no guidance in these fields. I don't know exactly what colleges I could go to for either profession (I live in Florida, about 2 hours from Orlando).

* What colleges can I attend that offer education in the fields I presented (or at least ones you would recommend)?

* Where I can apply for scholarships that will help me fund my education?

* Should I pursue an internship? And if anyone has experience in either education or working in the fields I mentioned above, I would appreciate any further advice.

Also for some background information I grew up on a small farm of sorts, with parents who also dreamed of homesteading. However, they both had day jobs that kept them from doing so fully.  We raised chickens, rabbits, ponies, a donkey, and a goat with varied success.  We also kept seasonal gardens, grew grapes, and planted a small amount of fruit trees."

So basically he wants to just be able to run this game at low settings. He doesn't care if it looks pretty, he just wants to be able to run it. In his system settings he told me that it says that he is running ""Intel HD"" graphics. I'm assuming that means the GMA HD Graphics. He wants this to be as cheap as possible because he is already kind of cringing at the cost of the game itself.

I tried to upgrade the desktop that he has at his mom's place and got him a 520 gt but his motherboard wouldn't support it. He is only there for another month and he can't take the desktop with him back to college, so I am trying to figure out a way that he can play this game on his laptop so he can play this game for more than a month.

What to do?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/vt1h3/mutual_interest_between_an_old_ex_and_i_we_live/,"Hello, I will give a little bit of background, then the issue. There will be a tldr at the end.

I dated a girl for a little under a year at the end of High School, she was not my first relationship but she was great. She was beautiful, smart and really talented. 

2 years ago (juneish 2010), We broke up because of the combined stress of the last couple months of High School combined with the looming portent of us having to go our separate ways sooner then later as we would both be going to different schools. 

Our backgrounds and personalities have always been different, she was quiet, never drank, smoked or partied. She got Straight As and went on to one of the most prestigious universities in CA, and I suppose the world. 

I drank, I ran around all night, I partied and just didn't care too much - I always got good grades but never to my full potential. I ended up going to a top CSU, not bad but not all that either.

The breakup was tough but fairly clean, we both went our separate ways. We didn't keep contact until the following winter (december 2010), when we started talking slowly little by little. We didn't see each other ever, even if we were only a couple hundred miles away.

The following spring (2011), I joined a fraternity and I rarely ever spoke to her. Aside from my job, education and friends I had to go through pledging and my plate was full 24/7.

She got a boyfriend after spring, he lasted a summer (2011) and then they broke off. I refused to speak to her during that time, and I suppose she had no reason to want to speak to me.

In the fall 2011, she left her school in California to go study in Washington.

In July 2011, I started a serious relationship with a girl I met at my office that would last me through February 2012. I contacted her a bit at the end of the relationship but she refused to talk to me, and only reached out once she saw I was single again. 

At this point we are both single, in the close of our 2nd year of college and now hundreds of miles apart. Both full time students and both employed full time, we speak regularly but never see each other. 

Fast forward to the end of may 2012. We are both back at our hometown from school for a few days. We end up meeting, hanging out and talking. I think it was then that we realized how much we missed each other. We sleep together for 2 days and just talk about everything we missed in the last 2 years. 

After the weekend, I have to go back to work and she has to go spend time with her family. Shortly after she goes on a vacation to New York and then off to her Internship at an embassy in NY. (I won't disclose which).

We still speak regularly, she tells me she misses me and I tell her likewise. However, after her internship, which will last until august, she comes home for a week - and then is off to study abroad in Europe for a year. 

So, Friends and fellow Redditors, what to do? I will get to see her a week at the most in the next year. I like her a lot but I don't know how to proceed. We have both had other people but we seem to keep coming back to that relationship both because of how good it is, how much chemistry we have and just the general unresolved feeling.

So what would you do in my shoes Reddit? On one hand, I am a 20 year old guy in a Fraternity, I can't wait for this girl. On the other hand, maybe I should. 


**TL;DR: Girl I used to date always in/out of my life through communication. Finally saw her for the first time in years. Realized how much we missed each other. Talk everyday now. Won't be able to see each other for more then a week in the next year. What to do?**"

My husband and I live about 8 hours away from where my mother lives. We are both attending school where we live and decided to come down and stay with her for the summer due to him getting an internship in her town. She is the only one that we know in her town that we could stay with. Plus, she would be able to spend a lot of time with her 3 year old grandchild she never gets to see during the year.

Now, my husband and mother have never really liked each other, but they can manage to get along for the most part. We have been staying with her now for about a month and a half and things have been going smooth until just the other night when my mother came out of the bathroom upset over how the toilet looked. Now, I do a lot around the house when I'm not working and I don't ask my husband to do a whole lot because he has his internship plus working a part time job for a pay check. Would I like him do do more, yes.

Any way, she come out of the bathroom upset, not yelling, but upset about the toilet. Right away my husband starts to yell back and things just escalated from there.

Now I have the both of them coming to me with the issues they have with each other expecting me to do something about it. My mother loves to tell me everything that she can't stand about my husband and all my husband does is ask me if Ive stood up for him to her or not.

I just need some advice on hon how to make the rest of our trip more bearable so I can keep my sanity.

Thanks all


UPDATE

Thank you all so much for your advice. I am glad to say that last night my mother and husband sat down together and had a civil conversation about their problems with out any screaming or name calling. There was give and take from both of them and they were both willing to admit where they had been wrong. i myself, stayed in another room with my son while they did this because this was something that they had to work out by themselves. With the advice that I had been given, I learned that if I was sitting there with them, they would put me right back in the middle of things. So, thank you again. "

Last year, I was chosen to study abroad in Budapest and I had the time of my life.  I discovered a great culture, made many friends and, mostly, I met an amazing girl. We ended up staying together, talking everyday over the last year as the plan was that after my bacchelor's degree I would find something over there. I've always wanted to start my career abroad and having a girilfriend over there would make things even better.

Fastforward 1 year, I have my bacchelor's degree in Finance from a good school, a decent resume and a great motivation. However, the whole process of finding a job abroad is waaaay harder than I thought and after sending over 50 resumés, I have yet to be invited to an interview.

I'm now reaching out to reddit because I think I might have more chance using ''non-mainstream'' job shearching tools.

I got into webdev a little over a year ago. My school sticks to traditional CS topics and doesn't really have anything specifically focused on web development, so I've been largely self-taught. I've completed a few projects, which I've added to a psuedo-portfolio that I can show employers. 


Since starting my internship doing PHP development this summer, I've been learning a lot more about good practices, design patterns, frameworks, etc. In short - how to actually code decently well, which is something my independent projects are definitely lacking.


So should I go for quality or quantity in my portfolio projects? My options at this point are basically:

-Update what I have, which would be take basically a full (albiet faster with a framework) rewrite of several projects.

-Cut the shitty projects from my portfolio entirely, leaving me with a distressingly low number of remaining ones.

-Keep the shitty projects as they are, at least giving me some content, and ideally illustrating a progression of what I've learned.


Any advice?

I'm just a 9-to-5 summer intern who enjoys listening to music while working. I saw that there was a post 4 months ago about this, but with few replies. If this is too spammy, I apologize!

I've recently started using the Soundrop room for Post Rock and it seems like a great idea, even with the limited # of artists and tracks in the genre currently available on Spotify. If any of you aren't familiar with it, it's a social music app which lets people chat and add/vote for songs in a playlist. It has potential and the playlist is slowly moving away from the staples (e.g. Mogwai, EitS, Mono, etc.) into more diverse offerings. The problem is, the room only has a small number of active participants and we're getting invaded by trolls posting Alesana and blessthefall. Without any apparent mods, the only way to get them off is to mass report them or to get enough active participants to keep the on-genre stuff at the front of the playlist. 

It'd be awesome if this could become a bigger thing. Come on over and add your favorites tracks and artists.

vsre1,4,2012-06-29,A Bit of Clarification,[deleted],investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/vsre1/a_bit_of_clarification/,"Dear Friends,

Apparently, the last bulletin I posted came across as pompous and condescending though I assure you I meant it all in good faith. Since the passing of my grandfather I have been desperately attempting to preserve his estate as I see myself as honor bound to preserve what I believe was truly the love of his life. Unfortunately, with no immediate family or trusted friends I lack the ability to manage it.

However, many saw my bulletin as an attack on individual day traders. Allow me to explain. Through, what I shamefully admit was the result of my grandfather’s connections, I have had internships in two London based bulge brackets. One was in sales and trading while the other was in equity research.

I was awestruck by the resources which they had at their disposable. Scores of well-educated individuals devoted to each individual element of trading. At their disposal they had technology and information not available to you or my in-house team. I am not referring to insider-information such as one man secretly passing an envelope to another. But little things such when our equity research department would label reports as “good” or “bad” so that our own traders would not mistakenly act on an exaggerated claim for a company which our investment banking sector may be doing an IPO on. Moreover, during my sales and trading internship, the casual relations we had with owners we did make an effort to avoid utilizing but once you know the answer to a question on a test, it is impossible to take that test unbiased even if you tried.  I often see the contention that you simply need to beat “half the market” yet many fail to realize that you must actually beat half the dollars in the market, not half the people, which you must realize translates into beating the major of these superiorly armed institutions. 

The odds are against you in every single way. However, I know that Mr. Gates must have been told this, every actor and singer must have been told this, that Zuckerberg fellow must have been told this.  Instead, I wish you all the best of luck. 

With that clarification I would be grateful if someone may assist me with my prior inquiry.

Me: 18. Moved to a metropolitan city by myself 4 months ago for an internship. Internship is about to develop into full employment.

She: Coworker, 24, spanish - a HB8-9 if you want to believe my buddy. 

She has been showing IOIs all over the place ever since I started working there. She would randomly show up at my workstation with lame excuses like ""I'm bored"", sit down and chat with me for a longer period of time, and she'd generally try to spend as much time as possible with me. She constantly sends me texts and touches me everytime she gets an opportunity.

Yesterday I invited her to watch the Soccer game with me in a alternative club and to enjoy a hour of fine Dubstep afterwards. She immediately agreed. I took one of my wing buddies with me so he'd help me out and possibly make the situation less awkward. 

Everything went great! We went to the club, had a great conversation as always (pretty much), and many laughs were had. A few beers later, we were sitting close to each other and she leaned on me and put her head on my shoulders. I put my arm around her and we sat like that for a few minutes. 

At this point I think - fuck yes dude, after 4 fucking months your countless efforts, the countless emotions you had to fight and the 10 years you lost of your life expectation finally paid off. Happy with myself, I went to take a long and very satisfying piss, only to find her standing outside and chatting with three dudes. 

I immediately notified my buddy of this troublesome situation that we had to deal with ASAP, no matter what. So we went over to her, surrounded her and started to make friends with the guys, edging my coworker away. This plan worked flawlessly and after we decided to leave and said goodbye to our new buddies, she looked at me (facial expression was a mix between being turned on and being surprised), laughed a little bit and held my arm as we walked to the subway station. 

I planned on kclosing her at the subway station, but we were about to miss the last train and had to sprint through pouring rain and jump into the train, so a simple hug it was. On my way home, she continued to text me with a lot of smileys and shit.

Now, there are a few things that I'm kind of unsure about.

First of all, I was REALLY insecure about escalating by myself. She touched me all the time, but I couldn't convince myself to escalate further. I don't know why. Maybe it's because we're coworkers and because of the rather big age difference (18 &lt;-&gt; 24). 

When I finally did touch her in a desperate attempt to escalate further, she didn't really respond at all. 

This situation is killing me, slowly, but it's killing me. I care about her a freaking lot and this inconsistency is killing me.

Please, any advice would be more than appreciated. She's not gonna be around work for the next 3 weeks. "

(Irish men, alert for you)",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/vsq90/am_i_just_headed_in_the_same_deadend_direction_or/,"I would apologize for this being long… but from what I’ve seen, ALL these relationship things are long, so you guys probably expect it by now :)
 

I’m currently in a long-distance relationship-ish thing with an Irish guy (we will call him Seamus). I’m American, 23, he is 22. We met a year ago while he was studying abroad, and had a relationship with the understanding he was leaving in a few months, and then simply parted ways. I sorta assumed that we would never see each other again, but definitely still had feelings for him. We kept talking online every day. During the fall, we kept getting seemingly closer rather than drawing apart so I mentioned that there was a possibility that I could get an externship for the next summer in Ireland (I’m in grad school). He seemed ecstatic about the idea, so I arranged it, and visited over Christmas/New Years to set up the internship. Everything went well, I met many of his friends, and so I planned out the externship. Fast forward through the spring, during which time we continued to Skype often and chat every day, even if to just check in. I’m in Ireland, doing my externship for nine weeks. Aaaand here we get to the issue.

 
What the hell are we?! And yes… I know I should ask HIM. But before I take that step, I want to make sure that I want to know. Because if he considers us a serious gf/bf relationship and we talk about it, at that point it becomes real. I was with somebody who was very controlling for 3 years, and at the end he became physically abusive enough to send me to hospital with broken ribs, followed by a massively messy breakup. I’m not keen to get into something like that again, and as such have taken to maintaining… distance… in relationships so I always have an easy out. Not necessarily healthy, I know, but it makes me feel more secure and like I can take my time to know someone and learn to trust them. His cousins and friends introduced me as ‘Seamus’ Girlfriend’ but Seamus himself never has. I think his hesitancy to ‘stake a claim’ is an Irish male trait from what I’ve gathered (Irish men, thoughts?). There have also been pictures of him on fb kissing another girl, back in the fall. I brought it up to him as an ‘I know about it’ sort of situation, and then dropped it since that happened before we planned on my coming for the externship and at that point, there were no plans for us to ever meet up again. More recently, there was some fb activity of his friends teasing him about being a player, which kinda bothered me but I ignored as he said they were just giving him a bad time. He has told me that he hasn’t slept with anyone else since we met last summer, and I’m inclined to believe him (a because I want to and b because it’s kinda hard to get laid in Ireland as a guy lol). 


The problem is, my past makes me suspicious. I’ve told Irish Guy about the past boyfriend, and how I am concerned about being hurt like that again. And Seamus is a very nice man. I’ve met his family (twice now) and stayed at their house. We spend every day together outside of work hours (I’m living at his house for the summer, with my own room but essentially just keeping my clothes there and sleeping in his) and go out together and do things together. We have differences, sure… not exactly the same in interests or opinions, but we overlap enough to have loads of fun. It’s just that sometimes he gets slightly more physically aggressive than I’m truly comfortable with. Not in the bedroom, ever (he is more laid back and hardly aggressive at all there) but in playing around and such… and I’m afraid to that I’m simply over-reacting because of my past. I mean, I used to play around snapping people with towels and it was fine, so I’m guessing I’m just trying to weird myself out. Or do I attract aggressive men and have the bad luck to find out about it later? Or is this normal and I’m freaking out? And how do I bring it up without being a bad person and basically making it sound like I think he is abusing me or I’m some damaged weirdo? GAH. 


All of that, plus us being across the world from each other and both in Grad programs makes it hard. Someone would have to leave their home country and go to the other person’s country in the eventuality of a serious relationship, which is an awful lot to ask.


So. Now that I’ve word vomited everywhere in a rather random fashion… what do you, the faceless internet, think? Should I be putting myself out there with this guy, or should I listen to my possibly broken instincts and just take this as a summer fling thing and not inquire further? Men, input on the best way to go about it without seeming like a typical girl saying “omg, where r we in this?”. Any advice in general? Seamus seems to be very fond of me, his friends and parents all seem to like me despite the fact that I feel like I’m tagging along sometimes (ah, the joys of being in a foreign country where you know one person… rofl).

TL;DR Unsure if I should take a relationship to a more serious level, and is that unsureness because of a past bad experience or because of common sense?"
vsohj,722,2012-06-29,"To everyone finding it so crazy that some people oppose Obamacare, let me respond to your massive generalizations.",fullblownaydes2,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/vsohj/to_everyone_finding_it_so_crazy_that_some_people/,"It isn't that conservatives want Americans go uninsured. The battling viewpoints are not: ""let poor people get sick"" vs ""let's get everyone healthy"". The viewpoint is: how much do we want our federal government involved in our lives. And conservatives stand on the side of less. Yes, in the party there is a disconnect between the religious right and this philosophy in terms of certain social policy, but this isn't every conservative. Lots of their concerns center around how this was hastily written and contains flaws. A lot of conservatives' opinions are based around the outstanding response from small business owners who fear the stress in the requirements of the law, many whom say will strangle their growth. And remember, small businesses employ almost 98% of employer firms, employ over half of the United States, have generated 65% of new jobs in the past 15 years [U.S. Small Business Association]. Republicans agree that the health care industry needs to change, but not at the expense of our already faltering economy.

To the Europeans/Canadians who are all amazed that we don't want ""universal healthcare"" (which Obamacare is not at all): America is a country of 313 million people, that is 3rd in the world. The next closest European country (I'm not counting Russia) is Germany with 80 million. America is 9.5 million square kilometers; the next closest European country is France with just over 500,000. Clearly there are differences, and let's quit with the ignorance of direct comparison, alright?

The supreme court decision effectively said this: the federal government doesn't have the power to force a citizen to purchase something, but they can tax them for not purchasing a specific good or product. You see where this becomes a slippery slope.

I work in the healthcare industry-I'm not a nurse or doctor or hospital administrator, but I work in a supporting business service field. [edit note:] I'm an intern for a business service company, still in college. It's not like I'm making the big bucks, if anything, I've just been immersed in the industry and been reading and researching a lot, so I'd say I'm familiar with what's going on. And the industry is screwed up and in need of change. But the conservatives want this change organically and from within the industry. And this has already been happening, the Health Care law was not something entirely new and unknown to everyone else. If you're curious, go read some things by Elliot Fisher of Dartmouth, a large proponent of Accountable Care Organizations, a significant trend in the industry. 

I realize that the majority of r/politics may disagree, but some differing views are good to see. I'm just sick and tired of seeing gross generalizations and plain misstatements about those that oppose Obamacare. What is differing here are deep political philosophies, not some small issue that can be spun to make either side look like the bad guys. One side does not want to expand our federal government, they would look at the track record of public programs, industries, offices, red-tape, efficiency, fiscal policy, etc vs that of comparable private entities and prefer the latter. 

For those that have made statements about hoping the Republican party will entirely ""fade away"" with their totally ""outdated views"". Conservatives want a smaller government, and as long as people are unhappy with what their government is doing, they will want less of it. This only makes sense. If I don't like vomit-flavored ice cream, I probably won't ask for two more scoops. Of course, the government could just tax me for not buying those new scoops now, couldn't they?

**TL/DR: Not all ""conservatives"" hate the poor and equality as they are being categorized as. I oppose ACA because: I support smaller government. I don't think comparing other countries' systems works with the US bc our size and population makes us unique. The industry itself is already undergoing a trend of reform, and I believe this will be better than government mandated. The Supreme Court decision itself sets up a scary precedent.**

EDIT: Because everyone is pointing this out. I mention that there is disconnect in the party today. As a young conservative, I'd say we have more consistent values of small government. This includes cutting military spending and size, doing something about the drug war which consequentially dramatically reduces prison spending, letting gays get married, etc because we want the government out of our lives. This is what I would say is TRUE conservatism. Wanting a small, reduced government and increased freedoms economically AND in social policy as well. 

EDIT 2: While this hasn't been discussed that much in the news, I'd like to throw in one more conservative issue with the bill: pre-existing conditions. The blanket coverage for all pre-existing conditions in bad. There needs to be some line drawn over fault-free pre-existing conditions and pre-existing conditions of your own doing. If someone has type II (that's the adult onset, right?) diabetes because they live an unhealthy lifestyle then they should have to pay more for insurance. If someone smokes cigarettes and has emphysema as a pre-existing condition they should have to pay more for insurance. Now if someone gets lymphoma as a kid that should be considered a pre-existing condition and should absolutely be covered. If someone has MS or something like that. I just wanted to throw this out there. I don't think we should have to pay more for someone's negligent unhealthy choices, but I'm okay with paying more for out-of-one's control circumstances. I'm okay with the government mandating coverage of most pre-existing conditions, just not unavoidable ones.

EDIT 3: Thanks so far. I tried to not sound too sensational, just summarize my views (and other young conservatives' views) so there would be a wider understanding. Some of you replied less respectfully than I think my language warranted, but overall, even amidst a sea of disagreement, this has been treated fairly well. So thanks r/politics!

EDIT 4: Wow. This blew up. Thanks for all the opinions, messages, replies, and generally well thought out responses. At this point I can't read everything, and its exposure now also warrants the trolls so I'll do my best. I haven't gotten a shred of work done all day (altho I'm glad my proxy doesn't block reddit). And regardless of your opinions, keep the debate going, make sure and vote in November, and if you think you're smart enough and can make a difference, run for office one day. Maybe one day reddit will be abuzz with controversy over YOUR political action.

ANOTHER EDIT: since my note about working in the industry seems to be an issue, I've clarified that, and I'll do so here as well. I'm an intern for a business service company. Still in college. It's not like I'm making the big bucks, if anything, I've just been immersed in the industry and been reading and researching a lot, so I'd say I'm familiar.

SO MANY EDITS: Quick note on my Canada/Europe/size/population comment. I know Canada is as big geographically as the US. I'm just meaning that the US is its own animal. There is no other country that equates in terms of size AND population, which makes any direct comparisons difficult. Because governance is strongly affected by both geography and population.

AND AGAIN: Since the semantics of ""conservative"" seem to be such a big deal for everybody, if that bothers you, go ahead and read it as ""one-who-does-not-support-ACA-or-the-democratic-party-and-tends-to-lean-towards-the-views-of-some-libertarians-but-without-being-entirely-libertarian-because-I-think-we-need-a-little-more-government-than-that-I-mean-don't-get-me-wrong-I-dig-Ron-Paul-but-prefer-Jefferson-so-basically-I-want-my-government-to-be-small""; conservative was just easier.

vskpp,4,2012-06-29,For those that started NoFap out of discipline or self control..,brilliancy,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/vskpp/for_those_that_started_nofap_out_of_discipline_or/,"This is only meant to offer insight for those that choose this experiment out of discipline. 

First off I didn't start this experiment for girls or to cure an addiction. I did this experiment out of discipline. I believe that discipline = self control = consciousness. Otherwise you're a slave to your animalistic self. 

**My story:**
NoFap allows you to control the energy wasted in PMO and direct it into other sources. As a result you have large amounts of energy at your disposal. Personally, I started networking, working out, and became more sociable. In addition I started a massive effort to read higher level texts. As a result my learning process has vastly improved. I’m a systematic thinker. After NoFap I quickly picked up different models, frameworks, decision making models, and my intuitive math skills also improved. Currently I’m an intern but I was able to offer insight into a problem beyond my years. After, some directors even complimented me on the idea.

**What can we learn from this?**
NoFap gives you energy to do many things. However, you still must initiate the action. In the past I’ve always believed in taking control of your own life but I never followed up on it. Now I’m not only a “thinker” but a “doer”

NoFap trains the muscle that is your discipline. It allows you to set the bar of hard work higher. Personally I believe this along with working ""smart"" will lead you to success.

vshk1,21,2012-06-29,Need advice on how to stop being such a drainer on my relationship.,iamashittygirlfriend,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/vshk1/need_advice_on_how_to_stop_being_such_a_drainer/,"Hi! Throwaway. I posted this a week ago, but stupidly forgot the TL;DR, so it was deleted. I also forgot all about the post, and I was told it was okay to post it again. I'm a 21 year old girl, he's 23 and we've been together just under two years.

It's been spectacular. Really. I've never been good with staying in relationships but this guy is just next-level wonderful. We met during my first year of uni through a society we're now both involved with running. We're both in our penultimate years of undergraduate degrees (he does software engineering, I'm a humanities major) and what we have together has been one of the best things that has ever happened to me. He's the kind of person I wish I were - smart, successful, sweet, self-assured. I just feel like these days I see no reason for him to stay with me, I get terrified and ashamed and lash out or something?

Here's some stuff about us:

* He's the kind of person who can get along with anybody. I get really anxious around most people I don't know. I close up, I find excuses to get out of there as soon as I can. I did a few nights ago - he threw a party and I stayed for all of eighty minutes before getting out of there, and lying about having work scheduled in the morning - I just couldn't handle being around all these drunk happy people while sober (I don't drink), so I went home, smoked weed and cried about the fact that I knew everybody was having fun and I wasn't involved. I'm a downer and I think I embarrass him sometimes with how pathetic and inept I am.
* He has a job and he's pretty well-off I guess - I can't hold down a job while studying because between that and an ongoing intern position I'm working in (I'm being promoted into a very-shittily paid part-time position in a month or two), I have no time to work casual or anything. I'm frequently broke - but that doesn't stop him from taking me to lunch or dinner, making sure I'm okay. I feel really ashamed about this, I feel like I'm taking advantage of him being so nice and I never want to suggest doing anything good together because I feel really bad about being inadequate in that manner.
* He's always doing me favours and I never seem to have the chance to reciprocate. Surely he's noticed by now? Why hasn't he said anything? I feel terrible about it.
* I have no motivation to do anything these days beyond finishing my degree and ending up in a career path that isn't entirely terrible. The mutual interests we shared in the beginning of our relationship drew us together a lot (things like art and music), but I can't bring myself to be chirpy and passionate about much anymore in between being stressed out from studying, interning, volunteering at this uni society thing, trying to find a job that will fit my uni hours, and failed attempts at a social life.
* I think he's planning on going overseas for six or so months sometime next year on exchange. He's talked about it with his housemates in front of me, but I've never asked any questions about it because, to be honest, the thought terrifies me.

**TL;DR: He's the perfect boyfriend and I'm a failure and completely uninteresting. I think I'm beginning to sabotage my relationship? What should I do?**

Because I find it impossible to really know what goes on in her head but can't talk about it all the time in order not to annoy her (it would annoy me if I was innocent).

**tl;dr** *some guy from her class has kinda been chasing after my girl and I'm growing more jealous by the day. He tried to kiss her, apparently she didn't let him and told him clearly that she has a boyfriend (me), but she will still sometimes see him (""as a friend""). How do I learn to trust her? She hasn't cheated (apparently) and we have a  ""zero-tolerance-policy"" because I was in a horrible relationship before and don't ever want to be cheated upon again or feel the guilt of cheating.*

We've been dating for about 7 months now and it couldn't be better. I had a long 5-year-relationship before that which turned bad after a few years but we stayed together for whatever reason. With this girl, everything is different, we have the same plans for the future, we've told each other that we love each other a few months ago already, and it's only growing stronger (at least for me). I can really see my entire future with this girl.

There's just one problem: a few months ago, when she was out, a guy tried to kiss her. She swears that he didn't even come close to her mouth because quickly she pushed him away. But he's that guy from class, if you know what I mean. Even though she insists she's not attracted at all, I'm not so sure (""I don't like guys who sleep with so many girls, I only love you"", etc., yeah, he's that guy. Although I have had my ""fair share"", he's in a band, does cocaine and whatnot). But they took classes together this year and apparently they're this group of friends who do stuff together. Now, during summer, she's staying in our university town to do an internship and he will be there. She has already announced that she will probably see him sometimes to have a drink after work because his parents actually live there and he's one of the only people she knows who will stay over summer. I'm abroad at a summer school and will start work in September (done with university, she has another year to go). At the moment, I'm also abroad because I'm doing a semester in another country and she came to visit me a few days ago and everything was perfect.

She tells me she loves me often and that she wants to spend her life with me and actually I have no reason to doubt this, it's just that I can't say the same of him. How do I know she will actually stay faithful? "

So as the title indicates, I'm looking for a gift for a friend of mine who is about to leave to go abroad for an internship. She's one of the most talented and motivated people I've ever met and I'd really like to give her a gift to take abroad that reflects that. I'm a designer myself, so I understand what we use and things that would be helpful but my main dilemma here is this:

I'd really, really like to get her a custom moleskin or equivalent journal with her personal branding logo embossed/printed on the cover. This one company jennibick seems to have a monopoly on this service and their charges are completely unrealistic for me for a one-off print job. 

Does anyone know where I might be able to find such a thing at a semi affordable rate? Or if not, maybe a cool similar idea?

We (my boyfriend and I) have been struggling to make ends meet since I've been pregnant. We've always struggled, but normally I'm working while we struggle. We've had to scrounge and beg, and get loans and gifts from reddit, friends, and family to make ends meet. Hell, we still haven't paid rent for this month because we're waiting on this scamming place to pay us for the work we've been doing. I haven't been able to afford the doctos bills, but I can't get medicaid because our employment has been less than legit and I can't even begin to explain how complicated it all is. It's nothing we've done. They're just completely unprofessional, and a horrible ""business"". They don't keep track of paperwork, and none of their shit matches ours as far as invoices and paystubs go. Even in the contract he signed he's not suppose to tell anyone that he works for them, share information (emails, paystubs, etc) It's just a nightmare and it's caused me so much stress. I can't even explain to his parents why I haven't gotten it yet, which has caused more stress. 

My biological mother has been harassing me because I refuse to communicate with them. (Abusive family, etc). And my boyfriends family has been crushing me with family-ness. I've never had family that actually treated me like family, and now they're treating me like one of theirs. It's not something I should be complaining about, but I don't know how to react to half the shit they do. Which puts me in an awkward position. They want to get all up in my business, and tell me how to do things, like what family does, but I'm feeling constricted; it's like I'm losing control of my life. I'm not use to people telling me what to do, or what I should do. Wanting to know everything I've done and keeping tabs on my life. And scolding me when things don't go how they want. I already know that tomorrow is going to be a fucking nightmare bc I'm going to miss my doctors appointment. (Can't find a ride). And his stepmother is going to ride my ass about missing it. But there's nothing I can do. 

Now, this week my boyfriend got hired onto a very cushy career paying him more money than I can even imagine. My whole life has been a struggle, and now we're being handed a golden goose. We're going to go from struggling to pay bills and eating on a regular basis, to making what we've been making in a month in a week. It's such an overwhelming thing for me. I don't even know what to do, or say... What should be the second or third happiest day of my life has become this horrible vortex of emotional hell. We're in this limbo between being horrendously poor (which is what I've always been use to) and unbelievably comfortable and being able to afford everything we need and more. I should feel so blessed, but I have NO idea what in the hell to do with money. And the long hours and commute means I get 4 hours a night with my boyfriend, 2 after he finishes his after work internet dates with his coworker and best friend. I'm just lonely, I guess, and things won't be as bad after we move (another stress/ blessing bc he wants to move ASAP, but there is very little that I can do as far as packing and moving atm. Not to mention it totally fucks my pregnancy plan bc I'll be two hours away from the doctor I'm currently seeing) 

There's just so much going on, and I feel like I'm being pulled into every direction imaginable... I really don't have anyone to talk to... I just feel so overwhelmed. Maybe it's just the pregnancy making this all seem so much more extreme than it is... I dunno. I should feel happy, but I honestly just feel miserable and exhausted with no sense of direction or control over anything. 


Edit: I was so afraid that everyone was going to down on me for being upset and call me crazy; but y'all totally get it! Thank you for all of your kind words and advice!

 I'm going to sit down and have a serious talk with him about the money situation, again, because y'all worded things much more clearly than I can atm :P I'm not concerned that he won't spend on baby, bc he's VERY excited about that, but I think he's just getting FAR too excited about it all. (ie: wanting to go from spending $400 a month on rent to $1000+, buying the new car, and everything else) and I think he'll get it after we talk. I just want to save ourselves a nice cushion in case something does happen, so we're not completely fucked. $4000+ A month is A LOT compared to what we've been living on, but it's really not going to amount to much after we have to pay out of pocket for the babies delivery, doctors bills, and the new place and all the deposits, getting things for baby, etc. Not to mention, we live in a small town where things are fairly cheap, and now we're moving to the city where the cost of living is going to skyrocket compared to where we are now. Another daunting reality. I've never lived, nor drove in a big city, and now we're moving to the state capitol. Any other time I would be excited about the change, but trying to find a new home in a place I've never been, adjust to the idea of living in the city, on top of adjusting to the baby, a finding a new doctor and birthing plan, packing, still maintaining the household we currently live in, AND not having my sidekick beside me as much as usual to go threw all of this with me is kind of driving me mental. He's getting the awesome end of the deal. He may work the long hours, but it's in his cushy office with his interns, lack of management, and his unlimited amount of free time and fresh coffee. The stress if VERY minimal. While he expects me just to whip this all together with no real support except the financial kind. He won't even discuss this with me he just says, ""You deal with it."" or ""You work it out"" and it's damn near impossible when I have no phone, no car, and no real idea of what in the hell he's really looking for in a home or a doctor. He gives me all the decisions, but none at all because the second I mention what I want he turns it down and says that it's not what he wants. I could strangle a man. I, actually, threw a fit like a little teenager yesterday and locked myself in the bedroom for the whole night bc he wasn't listening to what I was trying to explain. Every time I would try to explain why I was upset, I'd start crying and he'd go off about how being pregnant doesn't entitle me to be completely irrational and cry all the time. He's one of the smartest men I know, and he's completely dense when it comes to things that everyone else understands. 

 I'm also going to have a conversation with his step mother the next time I go over to their place and just explain my family background into a little more depth, and explain that she's making me very uncomfortable by prying into my life and then scolding me like a child when things don't go her way. I've lived my entire life on my own, or taking care of people; having the scenario switched is very overwhelming and confusing. We (her son and I) are going threw some major changes, and on top of the pregnancy, I just can't handle the extra pressure atm. She's a very hard headed nurse, so I'm going to have to go in with complete confidence and a firm hand about it or she'll eat me alive, but I can do it :]

vs7fo,0,2012-06-29,"Am I getting a mid-life crisis? 27 y/o friends going away, no motivation, no direction in life...",nimchip,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/vs7fo/am_i_getting_a_midlife_crisis_27_yo_friends_going/,"I'm sorry Reddit, I know there are a lot of posts about this but I just need to vent. And sorry for the length.

I am 27 year old computer engineer who is employed and lives with his parents. I am a virgin, sometimes I'm sociable and sometimes not. I find it hard to make friends, or real contacts. I find it completely difficult to talk to girls.

In college I fell into a deep depression, I felt truly alone. I had friends but I didn't really fancy going to hang out with them. My high school classmates never called me like they did those friends. I suspect because I tried to be ""friends"" with everyone that I didn't actually connect but with 2 of them. Everything seems superficial at best. I was nice to everyone and everyone was nice to me, but nobody ever called me. Those that did I quickly grew tired of their antics. My neighbor started to hang out with other people that didn't really click with me. My roommates did the same.

I dropped out of college because they didn't allow me to switched engineering concentrations and thus I transferred to a different campus. This is when it hit. I had to stay with my parents because it was closest. I just spent time on my computer every single night. It was frustrating and a suicidal time.

I beat my suicidal urges by focusing on my family. I would hate to break their hearts by doing or thinking about it. That made that stop.

Then suddenly I hung out with a friend's older brother and I met some super wonderful people through him that I've hung out consistently with for about 3 years. I really learned a lot from them both socially, psychologically and from the countless discussions we had about philosophy, religion, politics and general life (also microbrewed beer and a lot of social drinking). I also graduated shortly after I met them. We traveled a lot to FL to meet with the friend that had the older brother. It was and still is hella fun.

I learned that it was ok to be alone though some of them have GFs and whatnot. Their GFs are amazing people and I can say that having female friends was something I needed after all that. I hadn't had a female contact since High School. These friends have made it easy to actually talk to their female friends, but since I've been so ok with being alone my expectations for a relationship have skyrocketed to the fact that I want someone that can actually hold a conversation with me and not be a superficial moron (while still being sort of attractive I guess) whereas before I would have been satisfied with a girl just being cute.

Then after 1 or 2 years of searching for a job I finally found one. I was hired as an intern but then grew to be a full blown software consultant. After 1 year in work, my project is finally going live.

But now I feel... numb. I feel like I don't know what to do with my life. These friends I met are suddenly trying to find work in the states and want to move. One of them already is leaving next week. I feel like I'm gonna lose them, and go back to how it was during college. I feel like work is getting stale, boring, is too corporate-y and I haven't had any real relationships with my coworkers. My friends continuously tell me to move to the states since pay is a thousand times better.... but I can't. I feel like if I do that I will suddenly be alone again, but at the same time if I stay here I will be alone because they will move away. I don't know what to do with my career. I don't know what to do with my social life in the future. I feel like I won't have as good friends as I've had for these last years.

So these past few weeks I've been having depressive episodes... but not quite like I used to have, it's just more a ""I'm bored with everything, I wish I could do stuff, I wish I could hang out, I wish I could be more comfortable at my job, or look for something that is less corporate, and more importantly I wish I could meet friends as good as they are just in case they leave"". I have absolutely no motivation anymore.


Once again, sorry reddit. And sorry for the long post. This will most likely not be read by anyone but that's ok. The point was to vent.

TL;DR - bored with everything, my friends are going away slowly and thus I will be lonely yet again, and finally just feeling numb. No direction, no motivation in my life anymore. Terrible talking to girls, etc etc SAP."

Along with supporting all of our remote users (we had properties all over the country) we supported the ones in the home office as well.

Once day a ticket comes through from the Tier 1 group. Someone has spilled a drink on their keyboard, and now the computer won't turn on. I figure it's just a keyboard issue, so I grab a spare and head up to her desk.

I get up there, and she actually did a pretty decent job cleaning up the mess. I swapped out the keyboard, went to turn on the system, and nothing happened. No monitor, no tower, no nothing. I'm now curious, as she didn't spill anything on the tower or monitor.

I start checking all the connections, and everything's fine, but the system won't even power on. I had one of the other tech's bring up a replacement tower and monitor to see if I had missed something. We plugged it in to the power strip, tried to power it on, and nothing happened.

I end up crawling under the desk to see if we had missed something. Suddenly, the answer was as clear as day.

In her haste to keep her computer from being damaged after her drink spill, this lady had unplugged the power strip. Then, once she cleaned up, she plugged it back in. To itself.

I quickly deduced that this was probably the issue, plugged the power strip back into the wall, and magically everything booted just fine.

Sometimes, it's easy to get lost in obvious details and forget that the little things can be just as bad."
vs66x,0,2012-06-29,Problems with my husband and mother,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vs66x/problems_with_my_husband_and_mother/,"At first I thought about putting this in the relationship subreddit, because I have a relationship with them both, but then thought Askreddit would be better.

So here is my story/background.

My husband and I live about 8 hours away from where my mother lives. We are both attending school where we live and decided to come down and stay with her for the summer due to him getting an internship in her town. She is the only one that we know in her town that we could stay with. Plus, she would be able to spend a lot of time with her 3 year old grandchild she never gets to see during the year.

Now, my husband and mother have never really liked each other, but they can manage to get along for the most part. We have been staying with her now for about a month and a half and things have been going smooth until just the other night when my mother came out of the bathroom upset over how the toilet looked. Now, I do a lot around the house when I'm not working and I don't ask my husband to do a whole lot because he has his internship plus working a part time job for a pay check. Would I like him do do more, yes. 

Any way, she come out of the bathroom upset, not yelling, but upset about the toilet. Right away my husband starts to yell back and things just escalated from there. 

Now I have the both of them coming to me with the issues they have with each other expecting me to do something about it. My mother loves to tell me everything that she can't stand about my husband and all my husband does is ask me if Ive stood up for him to her or not.

I just need some advice on hon how to make the rest of our trip more bearable so I can keep my sanity.

Lately I've started to feel pretty anxious about my life and the path I've taken in the past few years. Nothing bad has happened, just some choices ive made that may decide the rest of my life.

I'm a senior in college this year, majoring in Finance. While I do have general interest in business concepts, and definitely enjoy the idea of having my own business one day,  I'm starting to wonder why I chose finance. I'm doing fine with the coursework but don't really see myself on Wall Street or with some big corporation. I'm graduating SOON. I cannot change my major or add a minor really without staying longer at school. Also, I didn't get an internship this summer- which I feel is pretty vital for most business related positions i'd be seeking after graduating.

My true passion is music. I love listening to, reading about, and discovering new artists and genres. I play guitar and have been making my own music with friends for the past year now. Everyone who knows me well is so surprised to hear what i'm studying in school. It doesn't seem to match their perception of me. I can't help but agree sometimes. I don't want to be stuck in a cubicle of some insurance company for the rest of my life. I would love to write about music. I would love to write and perform (ideally). Even to work for a record company or online music/media-based startup. I don't know!

Just looking for any advice from some recent grads or people who have had an interesting path. I'm afraid I'll take some job initially just to ""have a job"" and then be stuck in that field for life."
vrwxu,3,2012-06-28,Is the change to a looser immigration laws for poor refugees a fait accompli in Australia?,otterplay,australia,https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/vrwxu/is_the_change_to_a_looser_immigration_laws_for/,"I've just been hearing the news about my how own country - the USA - has just solidly started down the pathway toward the practice of every other developed Western country - where it provides a socialised medicine program - with our supreme court upholding the right for the federal government to tax those who don't wish to buy health insurance from private companies.

It seems to me that the current debate in Australia about boat people is analagous, in that Australia is the only country so xenophobic that it doesn't want to let poor refugees from conflict areas into its country, even though it will at the same time welcome with open arms rich people arriving on planes who wish to embark on the immigration process.

I don't know any other Western country, or English-speaking country, that interns people who are seeking refugee status... and it would be considered beyond the pale anywhere in any of these countries for a person to argue that you should ""turn around"" rickety boats which are full of refugees heading for your country's shores.

Is this how Australia makes social progress when it starts feeling that it needs to catch up with the rest of the world? Is it so that both major parties adamantly insist that they want what the common and misguided sensibilities of the country demand - but then they just can't bring themselves to actually implement that policy?

Christine Milne made a wonderful speech on the floor of the Senate a day or two ago which brought quintessentially Australian social mores to bear on the topic.

Will her voice, along with deadlock between the right and the left, prevail? Given how modern Australian history has progressed over the past hundred years, do you think that it is likely that we're on the cusp of a huge and progressive change in policy?"

I deal with numbers and minor statistic things at work on a regular basis and do enjoy the number playing and I have done well in all the math classes I've taken (typically high A's).  After much undetermined major thought, I've decided I would like to become an actuary.  I'm still a couple years away from graduating (almost done with my sophomore year of college.  It's taken a while to even get here.) and from what I understand, to be an actuary, you don't necessarily have to major in statistics but it helps. Also, from what I understand, I will want to start taking some actuary tests junior year of college, so when I get my bachelors degree, I can go to a company and get an internship or something, and essentially learn while I keep taking these tests to become a full fledged actuary.  
Now is this accurate?  Can I become an actuary with just a bachelor's degree?  I really don't have the luxury of time to have double majors, or taking a bunch of statistics classes and then discovering I need a masters and a cherry on top to actually become an actuary.  My classes need to count.  Is this something I can do with just a major in statistics and maybe a minor in something else, at just two classes a semester?  Or should I just scrap it and get the traditional ""degree just to have it""?  
Thanks for any input on this.  With the price of college nowadays I don't want to waste any money on a hope and dream that won't happen."

I'm doing an internship in the US and I'm used to have a bunch of easy/cheap recipes that I usually do in Europe (where I'm from).

Problem is, here, the cheap things are not the same as I was used to and there are also a lot of things available here that I'm not familiar to use / cook. Off course some of my recipes still works, but hey learning to cook stuff from here is part of the experience!

So I was wondering If you had easy &amp; cheap US recipes to share with me! 

Thanks :)

[How can I stop these calls from your campaign? Do you support and personally approve of robo calling?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57cbp9?context=5)|I know the calls can sometimes be annoying, and I know it's a lot of hard work for us making the calls, but we're competing with a very well funded incumbent and we have to do everything we can. I hate this system, and that is why I support publicly funded elections through constitutional amendment, but until then, we have to keep fighting.
[Related: Link to www.reddit.com ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57cbp9?context=5)|I promise I'll have my staff reevaluate our opt-out process. I apologize for the inconvenience. I sincerely appreciate your generosity and support. 
[Mr. Zerban, your opponent has gotten a lot of attention for his budget plans for the country.  Where do you agree or disagree with him and why?  If you got to introduce your own budget, what would you focus on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57c4ty?context=5)|First, I think I should point out that the Ryan Budget, is really more of an ideological document than it is a budget. It lacks numbers. Makes assumptions. Very few details.
 |I oppose turning Medicare into a voucher program. I oppose tax credits for already profitable oil corporations. I oppose extension of the Bush tax cuts. I oppose the privatization of Social Security. I oppose cutting Pell Grants.
 |I grew up in a single parent home where my mother struggled to make ends meet. I ate government cheese at home and free lunch and milk at school. I was only able to get a higher education with the help of Pell Grants and Stafford Loans. Because my government made a small investment in me, I was able to go on to start two small businesses and employ 45 people (who earned living wages and health benefits). Without my country making a small investment in me, I wouldn't have been able to live my version of the American dream. Ryan says these programs don't work - but I'm proof they do. 
[DO you oppose cuts to pell grants or not increasing pell grants (which they call a cut\) or both. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57gmf0?context=5)|Both.
[How will you guarantee that you won't be swayed by special interests,lobbyists, or party pressure?  How will YOU personally guarantee that you will be transparent, no last minute, Backdoor deals Rushed through congress without public opportunity to scrutinize, and no other sleazy behavior?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57bxqs?context=5)|2/3) Honestly, I don't know. I've taken strong stands and haven't always fallen into line with the Democratic establishment. If I fall into some DC trap and end up rolling around with lobbyists, I'd hope the people would vote me out of office. For me, this campaign for Congress is just as much about process reform as it is policy reform, and that's why my legislative agenda will be guided by constituent committees and not DC think tanks and lobbying firms.
[Where do you stand on Gay Rights issues? Do you support full marriage rights? Civil Unions? Or are you supportive of DOMA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57dauy?context=5)|I oppose discrimination in all forms. 
[What about transgender rights?  Do you support extending housing, employment, discrimination, and hate-crime laws to gender identity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57fluw?context=5)|I oppose discrimination in all forms. 
[Are there any parts of the Affordable Care Act that you disagree with? Why?What would you like to see done differently in it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57d8fy?context=5)|I support a single-payer, Medicare for all, system.
 |The ACA was a step in the right direction, but the premise for its creation was flawed. We have a healthcare problem, not a health insurance problem; so we need to approach the problem by first asking how we can achieve the best healthcare outcomes, not by first asking how we can get everyone to buy an insurance plan. 
[What do you think about the Supreme Court decision yesterday? What are you healthcare plans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57c95f?context=5)|The ACA is a step in the right direction, however I support a single-payer system. I was disappointed that single-payer models were never explored.
[What is your plan to fight against corporate money polluting politics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57dfcf?context=5)|I support constitutional amendment to remove money from our election process by creating a system of publicly funded elections. Corporations are not people and money is not speech. 
[In your view, what's the correct way to get rid of Citizen's United?  Constitutional convention?  I just can't picture congress passing legislature.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57c7ua?context=5)|Constitutional Amendment. A convention will likely be needed, but in the short-term we need to start electing candidates that support publicly funded elections.
 |Post Citizens United, more people have become aware of the influence of money in democratic process and how it corrupts our system... I hope this issue reaches a tipping point sooner than later.
[With the national recognition Rep. Paul Ryan is building for himself (budget plan, potential VP candidate, etc.\), how does this affect your confidence and ability in running against him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57d1z9?context=5)|I'm undeterred. It's become pretty clear that Ryan is going to use this district as a stepping stone to something else. People in the district see that he's spending less time in Wisconsin and more time in television studios and jetting around the country to raise money for Mitt Romney. It's difficult for him to make the case that he's working for the people of southeast Wisconsin when he's rarely here. 
[U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-WI. has a ""D"" rating by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America 2010 Congressional Report Card.  How do you feel about supporting the Veteran's?  It was in Wikipedia that Congressman Ryan was 16 years old when he found his father in bed, dead from a heart attack at age 55.  Do you know if the congressman and his family collected Social Security Survivor Benefits even though he was from a wealthy family?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57ettu?context=5)|Ryan's position on Veteran care is appalling - he supports spending more money on bombs and less on soldiers and their families.
 |Ryan did collect Social Security benefits at age 16. In the past, he's said he saved the money to help pay for college. The system worked for him, so it's curious when he works to deprive others of the same benefits he has received. 
[Welcome back. Do you feel the failure to recall Scott Walker hurt your campaign any?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57cudy?context=5)|I do not. Democratic performance improved in my district, when comparing the 2010 and 2012 results. My district is also home to the successful State Senate recall that gave control of the Senate to the Democrats. I think the results in the southeastern corner of the state were promising for November.
[Hi Rob, as a displaced Wisconsonite living on the East Coast I am rooting for you. One quick question for you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57eu1w?context=5)|You can help from anywhere! We have an online volunteer programs, so please sign up: [Volunteer for Rob Zerban for Congress](http://www.robzerban.com/crmapi/volunteer) 
[Rob Zerban!  I wanted to thank you for your hard work and dedication.  I've been supporting your campaign since you first appeared here on reddit, and will continue to support you until you unseat Paul Ryan.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57cuch?context=5)|Thank you for you support. Sounds like Jordan has has some technical difficulties, I'll let him know.
[That said, can you please ask Jordan Walker to not send me 9 copies of the same email in the same day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57cuch?context=5)|I know we send out a lot of emails and phone calls, but we have to do everything we can to compete with Ryan's warchest. I appreciate your patience and understanding.  
[Obviously, social media has become an important tool in campaigning. I see that you have accounts on various sites (Facebook, Twitter, Apparent ""Spam Emails"" etc.\) but, so does your competitors.  Have you thought about using the Internet to create new, unique approaches (ex: some sort of ""Rob Zerban's Weekly Podcast Fire Side Chat""\) to help spread your message?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57df6c?context=5)|I like it! I will forward this over to my communications department. Thanks! 
[I'm in college and have an interest in politics, any advice on getting started? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57ejuk?context=5)|Get involved with a campaign! Do some research, find a candidate you can support and ask them to volunteer. The best way to learn is to do. 
[Do you ever stare at Paul Ryan and yell ""CHALLENGER!""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57c04n?context=5)|No. We are cordial when our paths cross. 
[I finally heard of your campaign outside of Reddit.  I was sitting down next to the ""We Are Wisconsin"" folks on the big night(not a good night, just a big night\) and your name came up.  I'm glad to hear you're doing well.  How's your staffing going?   What are your internals looking like these days?  Most importantly, what would you say is the number one thing you wish you knew when you started your campaign that you know now?  Godspeed, take Ryan down.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57el4i?context=5)|Things are going really well and we're building momentum. We've raised over $1 million already, which is more than Ryan's last 6 challengers combined. We recently launched our field program, which we're very excited about. Lots of interns have joined us in the last few weeks, and they have been a huge help (thanks!). 
[The last time i saw Ryan do a town hall meeting he was almost run out on a rail.  basically being called out on his insane balance the budget plan.  do you conduct town hall meetings?  and how are you received? good luck to you!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57cb7n?context=5)|I don't have town halls meetings, per se. We have done a campaign rally in every county and they were very well attended. I do speak to a lot of groups. I do a lot of interviews. I try to talk with everyone. I try to be available to everyone. In general I believe I'm well received.
 |Ryan's town hall meetings, which are calls ""listening sessions"" are comical. He basically gives a 30-40 minute power point presentation, and then allows his constituents ask questions for 20 minutes. They should be called ""lecturing sessions"" ...
 |Edit: spelling 
[Mr. Zerban, what do you expect to do for the young voters of America, if you get elected? Personally, I believe that the young voters (like me!\) would come out in droves for someone who ACTUALLY would be fighting for us, as opposed to just trying to keep us okay with them while they get the older vote. So, what makes you the candidate for reddit's demographic?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57e4gf?context=5)|Well, I don't know. It's up to redditors to decide if I'm the candidate for them. A congressional district has over 700,000 people, so your going to need to equitably represent people of all ages.
 |It's sad but true, young people are often discounted by politicians. They have relatively little money and influence, and they don't consistently vote. But there is hope! Young people are becoming more organized online, and traditional barriers to getting involved and active are breaking down. Think about what young people on reddit and the greater online community were able to do with the SOPA protests... imagine if young people replicated that effort for other issues, imagine if they did it every 3 months.
[Just a small follow up. So what would you do to make sure that the youth know that you aren't passing them over?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57gmjn?context=5)|Decisions are made by the people that show up. It's easy to be cynical and bitch about politics on the internet, it's much harder to affect change. Wall Street doesn't get the legislation it wants by sitting around and complaining - they are ridiculously organized and active in the process. If you want Congress' attention, you are going to have to compete for it. I know the playing field isn't fair, and that means you're going to have to work harder.
 |You shouldn't be asking me how or if I'll 'pass over' the youth ... I shouldn't even have that option. It should be impossible to ignore you because your calling my office all hours of the night; because you are organizing in my district; because your waiting in the lobby when I show up in the morning. The greatest asset of the youth is its energy - that needs to be harnessed and directed.
 |I think you can tell a lot about someone's character by they way they treat those who can do nothing for them. I'm willing to talk with anyone and I try to reach out to everyone in every way I can.
 |The door to my congressional office will be open. The question is: Will you come in? 
[In the event Mr. Romney selects Mr. Ryan to his VPOTUS nominee, do you think your chances get better or worse? Any contingency plans in place? Do you think he would help or hurt Mr. Romney?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57j3l1?context=5)|There isn't a lot of precedent for this scenario, and I've heard it analyzed a dozen different ways by a dozen different politicos.
 |What I do know is that when Paul Ryan is spending more time in TV studios, more time traveling around the country raising money for Mitt Romney, he's spending less time here in the 1st District talking to the voters that elect him.
 |It's hard to make the case you're honorably representing the people of southeast Wisconsin when you're spending all of your time in Ohio and Florida hosting $5,000/plate dinners.
 |Right now, I'm on the ballot opposite of Ryan this November, and that's the campaign I'm focused on.
[Republicans love to attack government spending with phrases like, ""It's the spending, stupid.""  Yet their cornerstone budget proposal, Paul Ryan's budget plan Path to Prosperity, increases the size of government 30-40% over the next ten years.  Why do I not hear Democrats pointing out this hypocrisy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57e6u8?context=5)|Some do. More should.
 |It's laughable for someone like Ryan to style himself a deficit hawk, when he's voted for trillions in debt over the last 14 years. He's voted for the ""Bridge to Nowhere"" 3 times, but Pell Grants for college students are unaffordable? Give me a break.  
[Have you ever though about running a campaign with no money? Only using your free time &amp; social media to get your word out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57egm2?context=5)|Running a campaign without any money, would be very difficult. I have 7 staffers, interns, 4 offices, letterhead, postage, t-shirts, etc.  Social media is definitely changing the way campaigns communicate, but it's not at the point where you could be competitive using only social media. You still need to knock on doors, make calls, mail, TV, etc. Remember, senior citizens vote often and Facebook rarely.
[Hey Rib what kind of district are you running in demographically? what kind of things do you do to win over ryan die hards who are so fervent about his plan?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57fdy1?context=5)|Ryan's most fervent supporters don't live in Wisconsin. They live in NYC and Washington DC. You might assume that Ryan represents a heavily Republican district, but he doesn't. It's a moderate district that Obama carried in 2008.
 |Ryan hasn't faced reelection since authoring his first unpopular budget last year, and for the first time in 12 years Ryan will have a competitive challenger. We are reaching out to everyone and doing everything we can to gather the resources necessary to give voters a clear choice this fall. Ryan has grown out of touch, and I think when people hear my story and hear about the things I stand for, they will decide that I'm the one who is going to fight for them. 
[I really don't understand how any American can support a candidate (or, honestly a party\) who is willing to kill democracy by limiting voting rights/abilities/information, and yet we have seen quite a lot of it, mostly from the GOP.  I understand 'win at all costs' as a rallying cry, but why do Dems not wave this around like the tool it really is?  Why do we constantly hear flag-waving false patriotism from the GOP, but this (what I call\) suspension-of-democracy by limiting voting is never flung back in their faces?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57es2j?context=5)|It's unfortunate that voter suppression efforts around the country aren't getting more attention. The Republican voter ID law here in Wisconsin was struck down by our courts, thankfully. This issue doesn't share in the larger debate because the people most affected by these laws are people that have the least influence; the poor, students, minorities, the elderly.
[ I'd also appreciate a few less calls and emails, but I'm still happy to support.  Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57es2j?context=5)|The GOP has been working hard to perpetuate the myth of widespread voter fraud, for which there is little evidence. In reality, we should be more concerned with fraud on the back end of the booth, especially as electronic voting machines become more commonly used.
[If  how will you deal with an idea that you agree on, but your party will not. What will you do as an elected official to make our goverment solve problems?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57hni8?context=5)|Ultimately, I'll have my vote. I'll be there to represent the interests of my constituents, and if that means I cross party lines, then so be it. 
[**EDIT - It looks like you've answered just about every legitimate question in this thread except mine.  When I asked this question I wasn't holding my breath to get a reply and I'm still not. Saying you're gonna go after monopolistic banks who have committed criminal fraud in a public forum is political suicide and Rob Zerban knows who butters his bread, just like Paul Ryan  This is why we're truly screwed, no politician will stand up to power and say ""justice must be done or may the heavens fall"", instead all we hear is the same apologetic line about how we need to look forward and not backwards.**  Thank you for answering our questions Rob.  With all the financial fraud that's going on in the economy right now it seems that no one is being held criminally accountable and are only being subjected to corporate fines that are a small portion of the ill gotten gains.  Here are a few examples...  Wachovia Paid Trivial Fine for Nearly $400 Billion of Drug Related Money Laundering.  If you are elected into office, what steps will you take to make sure that the individuals who have perpetrated this fraud are criminally charged?  Will you go after banks that launder cartel drug money such as Wachovia did with 400 Billion dollars?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57epk4?context=5)|If you commit a crime, you're a criminal, and you should be prosecuted.  Given that the financial service sector floods Congress with money, it's unlikely you'll see the criminal indictments many deserve. What can I do about financial crimes depends in large part on what committees I'm assigned to, but I can always bring attention to an issue, and work with other legislators who may serve on relevant committees.  Currently, when financial institutions are faced with fraud charges, they usually settle... and somehow get to keep half of the money they stole. If we let them keep half the money and no one goes to jail, why would they stop? The system for holding financial criminals accountable is completely toothless. It needs to change.  A lot of this all comes back to campaign finance, and the corrupting influence of money in politics. That is why I support publicly funded elections.  
[How do you feel about your chances of being elected with the handicap of having a ""z"" in your last name?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57h0x9?context=5)|I'm optimistic that people with ""A-Y"" last names will overlook the sordid past of ""Z"" names and judge me on merits of my own character. I want little ""Z"" children to know that I too once stood at the end of every line in school, ever, and they can overcome their unfortunate alphabetically-determined position in the line to achieve great things as well. 
[General question for anyone in the political world.  But aren't you sick of politics? It drives me insane just reading about it. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57c6dm?context=5)|I hear ya... 
[Do you have an opinion on Gov. Walker's turning down of federal funds for high speed rail in Wisconsin? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57g3su?context=5)|I support high speed rail. It would create jobs (at a time when we need them the most) and it would reduce our dependence on foreign oil.
[Last November, your state legalized concealed carry with no major issues (and even some lives saved\). Paul Ryan supports concealed carry, opposes assault weapon bans, and has an A rating from the NRA. With your support of gay rights and other civil liberties, can you be counted on to support our second amendment rights too?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57h55q?context=5)|Yes. 
[Not a question, just saying good luck. Us Wisconsinites need to have our look changed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57iwu8?context=5)|Thank you! I appreciate your support. 
[Rob, I am encouraged by your candidacy, so thanks.  I'm not sure if you have answered in the previous AMA or elsewhere, but I was wondering what your position is on space exploration.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsx69/i_am_rob_zerban_challenger_to_rep_paul_ryan_in/c57d2v9?context=5)|I'm for it.

I have alot of experience in many different areas that might help me ( therapy for the mentally disabled, taking care of horses who were used in that therapy, six years of music training and eleven years of dance) and so does my fiance ( twelve years of music training and multiple nation-wide tours with two separate bands as well as acting with a local theater company and a very small part in a locally-filmed movie). I don't think I've ever wanted anything so badly and I want to do anything in my power to get us an internship with the college program there.
So, do any of you guys have any tips on ways thay could help me improve my chances? I'd really appreciate any help you guys could offer!"
vukua,4,2012-06-30,"Working university student looking to pay for the rest of my tuition; Harrisonburg, Virginia",[deleted],Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/vukua/working_university_student_looking_to_pay_for_the/,"**Update down below**

**What I need: $3,000**

**Situation**
I'm going to be a 5th year student in the fall and I received my award notice for my financial aid three days ago. I'd only be receiving $6,000 for the year, meaning I would only receive $3,000 per semester. Tuition for this school year is $4,404.

$4,404 - $3,000 = $1,404. I'm asking for $3,000 ($1,500/semester) in the high chance a class has some extra payments/lab fees that might be incurred.

**Factors/Situation**

- My parents have refused to assist in paying for college. According to my FAFSA, my dad makes too much for me to receive any grants or need-based scholarships. My mom isn't a full US citizen, never went to college and works as a seamstress. Recently, my was in the hospital for heart failure. He's out now, but those medical bills just deter me further for asking for financial assistance. He even refuses to cosign a private loan. It's always harder to ask for another working adult to cosign a loan than a parent. 

- I am the only child in college as my siblings have decided not to go. My younger brother found government assistance to get his GED and is training to be a nurse. My younger sister has been going from job to job trying to figure out what to do with her life.

- My GPA has been in good standing. I received a 1.9 my first semester (issue from both sides), and I've brought it up to a 2.9. Considering I work 30 hours a week, that's acceptable. With my first major, there was a GPA requirement I needed to be in the 300-level classes. When I didn't get into it the first two times I applied, I took more classes to boost my GPA. The GPA requirement changed, but I had ""too many credits"" to get into the class. I switched majors.

- I've been working at a dining hall on campus to help pay for tuition and other expenses. Because I work 30 hours a week, all of my shifts give me a meal. I've also worked with my managers and they sometimes offer to give me free meals when I'm not working that day. As of now, I've moved up to being a student manager. I get paid $12/hr but that only covers rent and bills. Over the summers, my normal location is closed and I have to work catering. My hours went from 30/wk to 10/wk and that's only if they have shifts available for me. July I am only working two shifts.

- I pay my own rent. I live in a four-person apartment. Each person has individual leases so I only pay $380/month, all inclusive

- I do not have a driver's license, so getting a second job off campus is practically impossible. At least this way I don't need to spend money on a car, gas, or insurance

- There's really not much for me to sell, if I could. I need my computer for school. It's better to use my computer at my apartment rather than staying at the library so late where the buses won't go back to my side of town. Most of my furniture came free or extremely cheap from craigslist. I don't buy clothes often since I'm almost always in my work uniform. Yes, I do have a smart phone, but I'm paying for that myself and I get a discount from my job.

- I can't drop out/take a year off because I would lose my job (""student"" manager), losing my job means I can't pay for my rent (I'm my own guarantor and I'd be evicted), and I'd have to start paying back loans with money I don't have.

- I have been able to pay the rest my tuition in the past, since it was only $500-$700 out of pocket. This year, the aid I'm receiving has been lowered, possibly because I'm a 5th year.

- Next school year, I should classify as an independent, so I won't need outside assistance except for loans. This year is the only year I really need the help.

- I have a plan for a job after graduation, and a backup plan if it doesn't work out, but that's later on. I need to pay for school to even get to the internship.

Any other details I haven't answered, I'll be happy to answer your questions.

**UPDATE:**
I tried to ask my mom if she could cosign, but it looks like she can't be approved. My dad still absolutely refuses on the basis of ""can't afford it."" I really feel like I'm out of options and at a dead end. "

It's OK if you know nothing. Just don't pretend like you do. Everyone's gonna be looking to help you out. Don't be afraid to take advice from everyone, including phlebotomy and admin and nursing. Especially nursing.

Focus on what's right for the patient. That's more important than your pride or teaching or duty hours. 

You're gonna make mistakes. It's going to be OK if those mistakes are honestly done and don't come from overconfidence. 

You're going to be under stress and you're going to be emotional and you're going to take things the wrong way. It happens to all of us. Let it roll off of you like water off a duck's back, and get home and sleep it off."

vug8m,4,2012-06-30,Who's being rude to whom? ,badlands2940,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/vug8m/whos_being_rude_to_whom/,"I had known you for so many years, but only in the periphery, not on a close interpersonal level. Then when we got to know each other, we found out how much we had in common, how easy it was to get lost in sex and conversation. I had to leave for an internship for the month, but we made plans to meet up. You visited me for four days, four incredible days - we had a picnic on the roof, celebrated my birthday with champagne, and when I dropped you off, we both left saying that it had been wonderful. 

Then the red flags start going up. I texted you that night that I was already missing you and couldn't think of anyone I would have rather spent the last four days with, and you don't respond until the next day, saying something about how you're ""not sure what you want to say right now."" I send you other messages later in the week, just casual stuff, not romantic in nature, and you are similarly erratic with your texting. 

Finally, after I ask you directly, ""What's wrong?"" you send me a wall of text with charges that I'm possessive, nervous, and dishonest. It's pretty hard to give you autonomy when hosting somebody in the same bed and room, and I have only one key to the place - what did you want, exactly, to go out to different bars at night? As for being nervous, I'm in a city totally unfamiliar to me, not the hometown where we were before. And as for being dishonest, that's entirely off-base: I've never been dishonest with you or misrepresented myself. 

I text you back all of this in a nicer way and you respond that what I've said is ""fair,"" but while you have a response in your head, you're not in the right mindset to send it yet. 

So it's in your head, okay, that's fine. But then for the next four days, I don't hear anything from you. Not a word about that message or about anything else. 

Finally, I break the silence and say something about how ""I'm not sure whether you made a conscious effort to avoid responding to this or what exactly is going on, but regardless it's pretty inconsiderate to leave someone in the lurch for four days. I'm moving on from this, good luck with everything."" 

Maybe less than diplomatic, but given the situation, I didn't think it was any less hurtful than what you had been doing with me, and I wasn't even intending to be hurtful, just to spell things out in a transparent way. 

You text back that you're extremely turned off and that you're getting an extremely bitter vibe from me, ""that was rude"" and ""this has all been too much for me."" I can't believe that you're pinning the inconsideration and rudeness on me.

I finished my degree in 3 years by taking classes over the summer, because of this I did not do any internships. Last spring I applied for developer positions at microsoft, apple, and amazon, had some phone interviews and was ultimately rejected by all three. I went to my school's job fair, searched on craigslist, and replied to /forhire/ postings, but so far I have only heard back from 1 out of ~50 companies. Unfortunately I haven't heard back from that one company in two weeks, so I assume I was rejected from that also.  I signed up on roberthalf and another temp agency and have not gotten anything from them. 

My resume is very empty because I have only worked at my father's company, where I basically make/update excel spreadsheets for a few hours a week. So to fill the space, I just wrote about all the projects and relevant courses I did to get my degree. 


Is there anything that I should do to help me find a job? Should I apply to jobs that I am not necessarily qualified for? (C# jobs when I have little to no experience) Should I apply for other jobs not related to my degree at technology companies and hope to get transferred?  It just feels very frustrating not to have any control and to just wait around.

Here I am, finally can say I'm an adult graduated from high school. Heres the thing, I need a little push or guidance from those who have done it. Who've pushed through it. Here is my story!

I had an internship my senior year of school with a web design company and that helped a lot. I was developing websites from hand (HTML/CSS with the newer stuffs involved) since 10th grade and a tech nut since 8th grade. I've got a (what I think) is a pretty good resume built along with a portfolio site. I can hand code sites from nothing in a text editor, and build it into a wordpress site/blog.

How would I go about marketing myself? I've applied at as many places as I could in my area and none are hiring. I got one interview, it went to a second, and I haven't heard back since the second. I just want to be able to use my skills and do something that I enjoy more. Currently I'm a bus boy and would much rather be developing websites or ANYTHING technology related. What can I do?

If it helps at all, in my area all the school get together and create an event for all students to enter their sites and designs. Out of 400 entries I won best of show. 

Oh! How forgetful I can be... I'm going to a local community college in the fall for a CS Associate degree.

Any pointers? Tips? Heres my portfolio: http://robertdelu.ca

She told me that I was going to hell once just because I held a single pro-obama position.  (Ron Paul!!!)  She accused me of wanting to rape her daughter when her daughter met me at a starbucks once in the middle of the day. She emailed my supervisors with a complaint almost every week.  it was awful. there was one time she showed up at a meeting we were having and screamed at me when her daughter didn't show up at home when she was supposed to.  i hadn't even seen her daughter.  The lady is nucking futs. The worst thing i ever saw church people do though was this:  there was a pastor in the church who had been wrongly accused and his family was still trying to support the church the best the could.  There was an old man that walked up to this pastor's children and told the kids that they would have been better off as bastard children and that they should pray that they never know their father for ""what he really is.""  I was livid. also, I was in a business meeting at a church in south carolina.  I had been youth pastor for 3 years at this location.  We were looking to hire a new pastor but word had gotten out that he had a black friend.  and that this friend was a black preacher.  One old guy stood up in the back and said, ""If he ever asks that nigger to come and preach at this church, i'll leave!""  To this he was applauded with cheers and amens.  I stood up and called them racists and then resigned that week from that church.

He had served 14 years at this church and had the love and respect of MOST of the congregation.  this guy who did this was just a turd in the punch bowl.

The world is in a fallen state, meaning it is not perfect.  I don't know if i believe it is the fault of a single man and an apple from a mystical tree, but i DO believe that God created something perfect and that perfection meant we have a choice, and that we ruined perfection with ill choices and that God cursed the ground.

[In my opinion, that all ultimately leads back to God as responsible for the trillions who have suffered and died over the course of human history due to nothing more than a natural disaster...ie no fault of their own.

At my most recent church I was a bit careless and allowed the students to text me anytime they wanted and I would text back.  This led to a lot of girls texting me TOO often and me being too young/stupid to really care about it.  They began confessing...things...and i began to get uncomfortable but in my stupidity would often just keep talking to them about whatever.  One girl persisted to talking to me and eventually began asking questions like ""if i were older...would you be with me?"" stuff like that.  I started to freak out and did my best to stop it.

I've made it a priority to treat them no differently than heterosexual students with the exception of any time they had to share rooms together.  I didn't force them to room alone, but they actually expressed that they would be more comfortable rooming alone.
 |My treatment of homosexual students has never clashed with churches...except once.  There were some parents who wanted me to throw out this girl who was openly lesbian.  I refused.  The parents left the church.
 |I had another issue with this same girl however.  She would purposefully target girls in the group who were straight...or who had at least never shown signs of homosexuality...and then try and convert them.  It was very underhanded and deceptive.

I think the kids do a pretty good job of educating themselves on HOW it works.  mostly...just that it feels good.  Honestly i think they need to be more educated on consequences and risks that they take.  Most kids, if they mess around, i believe it is because parents are naive or ignorant of what they are doing behind closed doors or when they go to bed.  Most parents believe that there is nothing wrong with their kids, and that they have perfect little angels....when in fact...their kid is sexting some kid in her algebra class and is about to have her private parts thrown up on the web.
 |Yeah, there is a lack of sexual education (i'm against the abstinence only methods), but the main problem is stupid parenting.  teaching an extra sex ed class may help...but it wouldn't solve the problems.

Reading through your answers makes me wish I'd had a pastor of your ilk rather than the procession of shuffling, dusty, mumbling septuagenarians who turned me off my faith during confirmation class. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsrp4/iama_youth_pastor_who_after_10_years_have_decided/c57fdrk?context=5)|I'm sorry to hear that!  hey look around a bit, there are a ton of churches out there and see if there are some other guys with the ilk you're looking for.  I just like to be real with people, and metaphors are fun!
[Upvote for you!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsrp4/iama_youth_pastor_who_after_10_years_have_decided/c57ixf9?context=5)|Very nice!  LOGIC.
[I'm an atheist. I am honestly confused by the people who identify as Christian and believe there's life after death but think miracles, virgin birth etc can't possibly be true. When I listen to them I'm thinking... you believe an all-powerful being maintains an afterlife for you but you don't think he could have altered a womb?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsrp4/iama_youth_pastor_who_after_10_years_have_decided/c57ixf9?context=5)|I think people who deny miracles, deny creation, deny most everything else but then accept the resurrection...they just aren't using the ol noodle.
[You mentioned encountering miracles previously. Have any of these affect your faith?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsrp4/iama_youth_pastor_who_after_10_years_have_decided/c57lty8?context=5)|Yes they have.  i look back at them as sort of, pillars of security.  there are times where I get frustrated, and i feel a bit alone and have some questions.  it takes revisiting those times in my past to remind myself of God's presence and his divine interactions in my life.
[That's good to hear. I was raised religiously and still hold on to a majority of core beliefs but have moved away from church. In my time there I saw some pretty crazy stuff like people being healed, prophetic words, and people speaking in tongues. Do you believe in any of that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsrp4/iama_youth_pastor_who_after_10_years_have_decided/c57m3f1?context=5)|Sure i do.  i don't really believe that they have much of a place in the contemporary church in america, mostly due to their abuse by people in the past, but i do believe that they have at least existed.
[Tell some funny stories?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsrp4/iama_youth_pastor_who_after_10_years_have_decided/c57c2bb?context=5)|Funny stories.  Here's one.  there was a year where I was an intern with another guy at the church and we were at youth camp for the week.  after curfew was over, he and i and another youth minister that we had met at the camp that week decided to take the van and go to waffle house.  So, we went to waffle house and then decided to light up some cigars and just hang out for a bit.  We got back to the campus at about 2:30am and when my buddy and I walked into the room we were immediately struck with the foul stench of teenage boys.  It was a mixture of awkwardness and sweat.  We looked at each other like...""oh god why?"" and about that time 7 teenage kids spilled out of the closets, from under the bed and from every little place they could hide in our rooms.  they had seen us leave and were hiding and waiting for us to come back.  I asked them how long they were hiding...those teenage boys had been hiding in the closet for 2 hours waiting for us to return.  it was quite hilarious.
[What training did you get to be a youth pastor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsrp4/iama_youth_pastor_who_after_10_years_have_decided/c57c2bb?context=5)|I recieved a Masters degree from a religious institution known as a seminary. I had no real formal training in youth ministry, my studies focused on preaching/teaching.

[What did you study there? What kind of classes? Did you study early church history, church fathers, ecumenical councils, that sort of thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsrp4/iama_youth_pastor_who_after_10_years_have_decided/c57cupr?context=5)|And my masters is a masters of ""divinity.""  i studied biblical languages, theology, preaching, communication, church administration, family and marriage counseling, church history, baptist history, philosophy and so on.  We studied the church fathers a bit in church history but didn't get too far into councils, particularly following reformation history.
[Southern baptist and still christian, that's some powerful ass faith!

Oooooooh i'm such a rebel!
[Do you think these teens should be ""forced"" to go to youth group by their parents, families, or friends?  Could you estimate the ratio of time you (and the group as a whole\) would spend reading the Bible and doing things directly related to worship (prayer, teaching, etc.\) and the time spent doing other activities like playing games and what not?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsrp4/iama_youth_pastor_who_after_10_years_have_decided/c57dzam?context=5)|You can call it ""luring"" in i guess.  in my opinion we're just trying to make it a comfortable place that students would want to be at.  why should they be stuffy and plain?  that sounds like a school classroom, and they already spend every day in one of those.  I just think we're trying to be relevant to their culture.  I think sometimes people attempt to be relevant in a way that is awkward however.  For example, 50 year old pastors trying to wear skinny jeans, cheesy christian movies and rap songs, etc.
[How do you feel about the new ways youth groups are luring kids in, such as in the form of food, video games, live music, etc.?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsrp4/iama_youth_pastor_who_after_10_years_have_decided/c57dzam?context=5)|As a group, on a wednesday night worship service we would spend about 20 minutes doing music, i'd speak for about 25 to 30 minutes and then we'd play a game or watch a video or something just fun for about 10 minutes.  I would also open the student building for them to hang out as early as they wanted to.  the first kids began showing up about an hour early.
[Do you believe it is ok to indoctrinate kids to religion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsrp4/iama_youth_pastor_who_after_10_years_have_decided/c57alu3?context=5)|No way.  I have always thought that kids, teens, and anyone for that matter should only go to church or get involved if they WANT to, not because they are being forced to.  I think that parents should be allowed to share their beliefs with their kids, but should always let the kids ask the questions and be real about answering them.
 |I get that this rarely happens. :/ and I also get that most of the time the only thing that kids ever hear are their parents beliefs....but i'd say that is pretty standard through all cultures.
[So how did you become a christian?  Was it because of your parents beliefs?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsrp4/iama_youth_pastor_who_after_10_years_have_decided/c57m92f?context=5)|Of course my parents had something to do with it.  i mean, i couldn't drive myself to church at 6 years old.
 |I just came to the realization that i wasn't perfect, but God was, and i wanted to be able to be with him.  i believed that trusting in Jesus would allow me to be with God.  so, i became a christian.  that simple.
[Well, he also lead you through your experiences as a youth pastor.  I presume you believe that was done for a purpose.  I can't imagine it was simply so you wouldn't want to be one, since you didn't want the position in the first place.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vsrp4/iama_youth_pastor_who_after_10_years_have_decided/c57mit7?context=5)|I gained a ton of ministry experience as well as experience in dealing with church polity.  that will prove to be invaluable.  i met tons of people and built a nice network of folks that will be supportive and helpful in the future.

Granted, it's kind of in the countryside, but no more than 30miles from Seoul. 

We get the IT department to install (as they've been doing for us every summer for almost twenty years) computers in our office. 

Before they leave, I check the install, and I notice that I can access only Korean sites !! (No INTERnet, just KOREAnet ?) For example, no acess to Yahoo... 

They seem lost, and try to solve the problem. At some point, they mention that I have to append /cnr at the url to reach international sites !?!(and then, of course, being Korea, only in IE...) I duely wtf, and tell them that it is unacceptable, and upon checking anyway, it still doesn't work.

They keep trying for 6 (SIX!) hours, and then they call me, saying that they have found a solution. 

You'll never guess what their solution is.

They have stumbled upon some default firefox internal page where, apparently, when the url can not be found, it reverts to an intern version of Google, which is not the online live google page. They tell me to enter yahoo in the search box (hahaha...!). I do, it gets me to the google results page for yahoo. I click on the link, it doesnt' work. They say no, no, not here, click on this link right beside it.

You've guessed it, they were clicking on the cached version of the yahoo page...!!!

With horror, I discover that they don't even know what a cache is.

.


I must insist that they are not students, they are the official IT team of a huge university.

It gets (somewhat) better, although I'm not sure what I just described can be topped...

After I make them leave with extreme prejudice, I check the system. I run a keylogger scan (we've had problems before), and find 18 trojans and 5 other malwares on each supposedly clean install...

Lastly, some hours after, I find the reason for the trouble : all pages are secretly rerouted from the local campus to the main campus in Seoul, by means of a hidden frame. The code seems to have been copied from Japan, and the guys obviously never thought of testing it on international sites...

I'll tell you what. Frankly, that's the lesson of Korea : it's obviously not personal competence that makes a country run.

I also have to make sure she takes her medications, gets to doctor appointments, etc. 
I am a college student on break for the summer, but I am working at an internship in the mornings, so my days are fairly routine and busy.  This has been quite a role shift for me and my mom, and has put quite a lot of stress and tension on our relationship.  As a result, I feel isolated, because my friends are busy having ""normal"" college summers (beach, summer jobs, vacations, etc) and they can't relate to the experiences that I've been having.  I'm not neccesarily complainig, but I'm more curious to see if there were any other redditors out there who fit the definition of a ""young adult"" caregiver, and how you managed to deal with all of these issues.

TL;DR: Mom was recently diagnosed with MS, and now I'm having to adjust to all that that means. Does anyone else have similar experiences?

Also, I workout Friday-Monday because I do 6 hours of walking from Tues-Thursday for my internship.  My routine looks something like this:

4x25 push ups
4x10 pistol squats
4x25 Crunches
4x20 arm exercise
4x40 leg lifts
4x20 ab exercise

I vary the second group of arm exercises with incline/decline pushups and dips.  Ab exercise tends to be reverse crunches or sometimes planks.  I'm hoping to shed a few pounds while building some lean muscles and I've seen some results and I'm hoping to increase the reps over time.  My main problem is that I'm exhausted after work, thus I find it difficult to workout Tuesday through Thursday.  I live in a condominium with people under me, and my doors are sadly too flimsy to rely on for pull ups.  Will this routine help me lose some fat and gain a small yet noticeable amount of muscle?"

I'm easy going, I'm very interested in cycling, lifting, hiking, fishing and whatever else ( I used to swim a bit... haven't in a while ). On the more relaxed side I enjoy all the normal aspects of life... good movies, food, and people.

I just graduated from college, and because of the whole being-fucking-unemployed thing, I had to move back in with my parents about 300 miles away from the Bay Area, which is where I want to be. There are zero opportunities in my hometown. It's a little suburb, and all I can do is work retail.

I've spent 6 months in new York working as an intern. I was going home today, at 6. I was going to land around 9:30, get picked up at the zipper by some friends and get some dinner. Then I was going to go home to see m my family. I've been here for 5 hours now. I was on a flight to Burbank, then changed to long beach due to an earlier flight time. They charged me $50I and then announced that the LB flight was being delayed an hour. 

Still better than my Burbank delay, and with amazing friends will pick me up two hours away at midnight, I deal with it. Just now they delay the flight another time. I can't ask my friends to pick me up at 2the in the morning and drive two hours back home. My parents will be asleep as well. My only option is to get back on that Burbank flight, which has been delayed *again*. I now have to pay an expensive cab ride to get home from whatever time I actually land. I can no longer change flights because there's no way for me to get home. Jet Blue is claiming that ""weather"" delays from more than 12 hours ago are the reason and they wont compensate my cab ride for weather delays. I've been charged $100me for flight changes jetblue must have known would be delayed at the time of charging me. They were coming from across the country and hadn't left yet, with supposedly 3 hours to boarding. The cab ride will cost at least $50, and that's hugely lowballed.  Im also now in a middle seat. I don't fit in a middle seat(height). What are my options for not getting screwed out of this money?"
