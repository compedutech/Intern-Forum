I recently met a girl during my internship that I fancy. She's gorgeous, cute, very tall, blonde =). Looking for tips to get more more attracted to me as I haven't really been able to.

Here's the first thing - she doesn't seem to respond to traditional PUA techniques. She met a guy during the beginning of the internship. They were hanging out and watching a movie. When he tried to escalate things with her (kino and all that), she got creeped out and it seems like she tries to avoid him.

Another snag ... only have about 2 weeks to really try things. From what I hear she is introverted and doesn't really like going out, so I am not sure what I can do here.

Any tips? Thanks..."

cw7xk,7,2010-08-01,A recent development,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cw7xk/a_recent_development/,"I've been searching for some answers to cut to the core of my dysthymia.  I decided to start reading some of the entries from my journal, which I started writing when I was 18 (I'm 24 now). I realized that back then, I was wrestling with a lot of the same issues that I am now. I didn't know what to do with my life, I didn't know why I was sad and upset all the time (though I understand it more now), and I had an extremely low level of self-esteem/confidence. I started to put the pieces together and I realized that, for the better part of my life, I've been going through the motions, and I never really asked myself ""what do you want to be when you grow up?"". I simply never had an answer. I was asked that a few years ago when I was at a stupid orientation for the second time at Starbucks, the guy was asking everyone ""what did you want to be when you were growing up?"" and I was the only one that stopped and said ""I don't know... I never had an answer"" and he made some stupid quip about how it's ""always good to dream"". I never put much thought to that. When I graduated college almost 2 years ago I was so depressed, and now I realize it was because I hated my major, and I did it because everyone said I was ""good at it"" and ""I could make a lot of money"". I really tried hard to like it. I tried a few jobs and an internship related to my major, and I just got fired from the one I had because my boss said I didn't like my job enough. I look at all my friends who have jobs that they like, they work hard and party after, and all I can think about is how I wasted a whole day at work and now I have to catch up on the things I like to do, not get totally wasted and celebrate. 

What this triggers in me is really negative, suicidal thoughts. Thoughts that I will never figure out what I want in life, and that all of these ""interests"" (music, audio engineering, film, photography, art in general, skating, social issues, whatever) are just hobbies that I will never be that great at, and that I could never possibly be able to survive on. The major that I chose (Info Systems) completely destroyed my love for science, because it reduced it to a service industry, just like my job right now, delivering pizzas. I worked with computers my whole life, but don't think I ever thought to myself ""I want to be a Database Admin/System Admin/Project Manager/Programmer when I grow up""...and yet I wasted 4 1/2 years learning how to do that. I moped around for the last 18 months wondering what happened to my life.  I think a lot of it goes back to depression, because a lot of times, I can't tell what makes me happy anymore.. nothing does, not even the things I like doing, so how can I decide on one thing to do? I wonder what if I chose to do one of these things, and then I wake up in 5 years and wonder why I'm doing this all over again? What the fuck is the point? I don't even know where to begin now. I feel like I was robbed of the past 10 years of my life because of depression and now I have to start all over again, with no direction, no support, no one to relate to. Everyone is off reaping the benefits of a life of hard work, traveling, working jobs they love, getting married, and I feel like I'm 14 all over again. Has anyone else gone through this? Can anyone tell me what to do? I almost don't even care anymore. I feel like just dying at like 32 or something, so I can at least live out my 20's and give up when it's over. It's incredibly short sighted, but that's the story of my life I guess."

So here's the deal - MIT usually wants us to put in our applications for medical school by the end of June, but I had my doubts at the time and wasn't even 100% sure I wanted to apply, so I didn't submit an app. I did some major thinking over the course of the last month and have definitely decided I want to do med for sure, but now don't know if I should apply this late or where to apply.

I'm not a shoe in by any means - average grades/average MCAT. (although I'm retaking the MCAT this month). I've been told I'll have better chances if I apply next summer (because applying as a senior shows maturity?) But if I pursue that route I have no idea what I'd then do with the next year. I keep hearing there are temporary jobs that take you on knowing you'll only stick around for a year; but so far the only things I've found have been either minimum wage sort of gigs or internships. (Even lab tech's usually require a two year commitment!) I've also been told that I should just apply to a masters program, but it seems silly to accumulate an additional 50k in debt if I won't use it at all.

I'm going to keep things simple: I've spent a lot of time on Reddit, time  which I could have made better use of, but I've also acquired quite a bit of comment karma in the process.

Most of you, if you have seen my comments, know that my comments are usually absolutely useless and add nothing to any discussion except for maybe a cheap laugh or two. As of right now, I have *31,000 comment karma* and I am more than happy to trade that karma for some in real-life karma.

I've decided that if I can lose 1,000 comment karma in **the next few days** I will donate $1000 to any charity of your choice. (I'm leaning towards donating to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, though)

I have absolutely no savings, and I'm about to start school in a new high school after moving into a new home. A lot of my old classmate have already had jobs at my age (17), and a few have managed to start internships, but I currently have nothing on my resume. I am willing to start over in my new high school (I'll try to make new friends), get a part time job (I'll try to earn some money) and give back in any way I can (I've battled depression for the last few years and my parents have been very supportive in helping me overcome it) As a way of improving my life I'm going to stop wasting my time online, and start spending more of it offline. I need your help Reddit, give me that push.

**TL;DR: if you've never liked my comments, downvote them now. if you've liked some of my comments but not all of them, downvote me now. If you don't even know who I am and already don't like me, downvote me now. Cunt.**

I went to high school with this guy, never really talked to him then, then we ended up going to the same college. We have a lot of the same friends and soon we become friends. He's a pretty typical geek - into video games, building computers, and doing web start-ups. So he did have some experience with start-ups and he and a buddy of his started up a web design firm. I ""applied"" to be an ""intern"" at this company and I use this term loosely. So I talk to his buddy and he said he has a project for me. To essentially make a hot or not site. His partner (lets call him Chuck) offers to help me out and I being a proud person, decline and just start coding away in php. The deadline comes, and I'm not finished and I meet up with Chuck and give him what I have and apologize for not finishing. My friend (lets call him Alex) calls me a couple days later - bitches me out on the phone saying things like ""I knew we should have never hired you (btw I was never paid nor offered anything) and we lost a big contract because of you and you really disappointed us and don't ever bother talking to me again"" - I never said anything to him (nor saw him again) since then. A couple of weeks ago while I was back home with the parents, he apparently came over with his brother after hanging out with my roommate. My roommate allows him into my room and he starts to mess with my computer (thankfully I'm running OS X and have a bunch of extra security installed and he isn't as smart as he thinks and wasn't able to do much more then log into the guest account) but it still really pissed me off. You'd think my roommate would stand up for my privacy and not let other people into my room. 

Everytime I see something about him on facebook or someone mentions him - I feel guilty for letting a friend down (when really that much responsibility shouldn't have been put on an ""intern"") and angry that he is a douche for yelling at me w/o letting me respond and then messing with my computer later.

That said, I have noticed a lot of demand for programmers of a wide range of languages and disciplines and some pretty phenomenal pay scales.  I wouldn't think of doing this strictly for the money, but it's an impressive increase over what I'm used to seeing for the typical advertising job.  So, my thought is to go back to school and learn programming.

My questions are,

Do you think the trend in more and more employers seeking programming professionals will continue?  I imagine it can only increase as people spend more and more time on their computers...

What would be a good approach to the educational aspect?  I was thinking something like a post-baccalaureate certificate, but I am thinking that wouldn't be taken seriously by employers?  This leads to a full-on masters in CompSci or something of the like, right?

Also I don't need to worry about getting rehired because I've got an internship lined up along with 4-5 other job opportunities.  Would it be ok to just stop showing up then collect my last paycheck when it comes in in two weeks, or should I go for this last shift tonight then leave?

Edit.  As for the reference thing goes I will not need them as a reference, I have 2 internships and 5 years at another restaurant.  A month and a half at Donatos isn't that important is it?"
cxx1o,21,2010-08-05,Politics in /r/Canada; a giant circlejerk.,[deleted],canada,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/cxx1o/politics_in_rcanada_a_giant_circlejerk/,"I like to read things about Canada, I'm educated in Political Science. I don't subscribe to the Politics section of Reddit. But, in the Canada section it's non stop. 

These topics are jammed with vitriol and it's like reading conservative blogs of American origins, except it's left leaning people spewing hate. It's horrific.

I'm a member of the Liberal party, I used to volunteer in my riding for them. I've been to a couple conventions. They did lots of things, when in federal power, that weren't the best. I loved Chretien. Martin wasn't horrible. The conservatives have made mistakes, they've done some great things though too. Thes are some of incredibly tired, and mostly ignorant points seen over and over,

1) Conservatives are ignoring everyone, listen to us, we, reddit, are the majority. You are not. Get it through your head, look at it in a more analytical way and try to move to useful solutions. We are extremely young and skewed left here. Realize this. Show other Canadians the respect they deserve and acknowledge this. Reading these topics is a lot like listening to kids in 1st year political science, before they're berated time and time again by teachers for being ignorant and frankly, making things up. This is the biggest give away that you haven't taken any political science and you have no idea what you're talking about beyond being 'self educated.' Sorry, your self education doesn't replace knowing the traditions and past of Canadian politics, which are extremely evident today. This 'forum' is extremely skewed, I can think immediately 3 ways any information taken from this forum is skewed to such a degree as to be useless in any kind of analytical manner. They teach you this immediately in political science.

2) Anyone who doesn't think the conservatives are evil, or the worst thing ever, is naive, stupid, wrong, or ignorant. No, they aren't, they have different goals than you. Actually shut up, and listen to them. I know a lot of you are young, but other people's points of view are equally important as yours, also as you're shouting them down, remember, they're in the majority in Canada right now (I'll come back to this). 

3) Think the jets are a huge waste of money? Guess what, that buys us into diplomatic relations we wouldn't have clout in, for probably the next 20 years. Don't like that way of doing things? Welcome to the real world. Realpolitick is dominant and has been for over a century. Have a better way? Let's hear it, instead of saying it's bad with no alternative. Don't jabber on about peace keeping either, every Canadian academic has written time and time again peace keeping was  a myth formed in suez canal and we never ever were a peace keeping force. 

4) The large majority of redditors that are vocal about this don't quite grasp our political system. In order to pass bills the conservatives need a majority. It's a minority government, but they need votes from other parties to get things through. So, every bill that's passed isn't a minority bill, it's a majority. Don't forget the implications of this.

5) We, as a community, sound exactly like those that compared Bush to Hitler, or Obama to Osama, when we say the Canadian way of life is being ruined and Harper is destroying Canada, look around. It's not. Can we have some actual thought provoking conversation? Don't exaggerate so much, we sound like screaming children. Want to make a difference, stop yelling your brother hit you, and instead think of something meaningful to say.

6) Every single person who isn't liberal, ndp, green, or the povs expressed aren't, is downvoted to oblivion. Stupidity.

7) So, you think your voice is the majority because in the circlejerk that is this sub reddit it seems that way? The Liberals can take down this government any day. The conservatives can't keep the rest on side if the Liberals want them out. Why are they still here? Well, the Liberals spend hundreds of thousands polling us, and they are doing mighty poorly, and have been for some time now. Iggie would love an election he has a shot at, but he doesn't have one, so they're waiting, trying to move opinion, but it's going the wrong way. 

8) Foreign policy and heath care win elections in our glorious country, always has (last 30 years), seems like it always will. Our economy is such that it's hard to move one way or another, we sway with raw materials. Our drug policy, forever, has been tied to America, it sucks, we've slowly trended away, but we do it slowly to not raise the ire of the south. Look at most of our policies through this frame, it's how politicians do.

As I said, I'm a Liberal. Like, an actual Liberal, in the party. Big L. I'd prefer them back in power, they made awful mistakes though. Their biggest shortfall was the system in place since Trudeau left, the party is all his colleagues. He was great, so was Chretien. It's possible though, with leaders such as that, who held the party for nearly 40 years, or was closely tied to it's inner circle, that everyone else is just not leadership material and there's no one hand that's different enough. I hope they find someone soon, in the meantime, not all the Conservatives moves have been poor. Some of the most prominent posters on this topic read like the kids who think the government is lizard people.

I'd love to see constructive posts, you guys want to actually make a difference, learn to do that. Heck, move to Ottawa, get directly involved. It's a great city. Liberal HQ is a little nondescript, but it's got a nice lobby with shiny elevators. Go to school, pop off a masters in Poli Sci, do it at the UofO! It's surprisingly not that hard to get internships in parliament, assuming you're smart, dedicated and not someone who shouts down every single person who disagrees with them. If that's your thing, try dog training, or maybe become a police officer. All those posts about the police silencing this and that, you're them if you're downvoting people who don't agree with you.

**EDIT

Everyone made valid points, criticisms of my post. Wit the exception of 
perspectiveiskey, who's post has many perfectly discussable topics, but has very little to do with what I was talking about and instead goes on a rant about G20, prisons and misquoting (completely), me.

 Maybe I was wrong and just stumbled into a few of the wrong threads because everyone else's opinions, including the ones saying I'm arrogant in this post, are valid points.

Final note, don't think you need a poli sci degree to post things about it or learn about it or vote. Just this, those without them, and with them, need to accept when they're wrong, or don't know about something and just own it, not brush over it, or worse attempt to make wild statements about how the government should function. We all mistakes, but it seems people in this subreddit think Canadian democracy is something they can define in their head, or as representing all the people, or every vote is equal, or some other garbage, which simply isn't true, and never has been, and given our constitution, never will be.

TLDR - Cheesewhiz, at the bottom, had a great suggestion.

So to my question I was wondering if anyone could point me in the direction of a place to research apartments in this area? I have looked on padmapper and rent.com (I did google it) but it didn't have too many places down there. Also I was wondering if anyone knew the costs normally? My guess from what I saw is more than I would like to spend, but hopefully I can find a good place.

EDIT:  I was thinking Capitol Hill also, is craigslist the best idea here? Though I have seen many more on padmapper type stuff. I was wondering if here are many places that are a little more legit? Like not just from other people, or is it worse to go through realtor type places?"

Now that I am legal, I will get state costs, which is a life saver, but I won't get a scholarship and my parents will be paying for my education.

I can now go to college after two years, where I had fun and took advantage of a lot free time. I had internships in radio stations, law firms etc.... but now I'm going back. 

I want to go to law school, what is the best path? (as in what should I major in, classes, extracurricular activities etc...). 

Now I am 20, should I be intimidated that I will be older than most of my classmates, having to take a lot of the freshman classes and all?

Should I graduate faster to make up for lost time or should I enjoy my 4 years of college?

This summer I've been working between as an intern at a software company in Massachusetts. I'd originally taken the position under the understanding that it would be a paid position. Unfortunately, the week before I was set to begin, the terms changed such that I'd no longer be paid an hourly wage and as notice was too short for me to arrange another job (not that many places are looking to hire a high school student) I was forced to acquiesce.


For each week of the internship, I worked a minimum of fifty hours/week on company premises sans lunch break to finish my project on time, with my longest week totaling 71 hours (none of this includes replying to email or submitting patches after I left the office) Throughout all this, my boss applauded my effort and told me that he was highly impressed by both my technical and intrapersonal skills. Today was my last day, and my only reward was a verbal agreement from my boss that ""If I start now, I may be able to have a recommendation letter by December."" Was it wrong that I expected even a slight reward for my efforts? 


**tl;dr**: High school junior worked ~390 hours over seven weeks at an unpaid internship, working in a normally paid position, and didn't even receive a Hallmark card for his efforts."

We had dated 4 years and some change, and were less than a month away from our wedding date.  She also stole my pet parrot on her way out the door, the bitch.  I'm not bitter or anything.  Ask me anything.  

EDIT:  More details, thought people would have asked for these.  How did I find out about them?  I was working a summer internship for my college and she had moved back home to her parents house.  I typically called her everyday on my lunch break to chat and then we'd usually talk again when I got home.  Well one day she didn't answer on my break. I thought it was strange, she was always around to talk.  So I went back to work thinking I would talk to her when I got home that night.  No answer that night.  Got a little concerned, usually if she wasn't going to be around I'd at least know what she was doing.  I called her parents house, no answer.  I figured maybe she had an emergency (strange she wouldn't tell me) and had to go somewhere in a hurry.  Well the next day, late in the evening I finally get a call back from her.  She said she's sorry she hadn't called but she had driven down to visit her brother who lived 7-8 hours away.  I said I wish she had told me because I was worried.  I hung up.  I immediately called her brother and said ""Oh heyyyy how's it going?"" blah blah random small talk mean while thinking ""haha bet she didn't realize I was going to call him.""  After a couple minutes of chit chat, I slip into the convo ""Ah so I heard Stacey was just down there to visit you.""  Confusion on his end.  So I knew something was up.  I didn't know what until about a week later, when she, perhaps intentionally left her laptop open and signed into her e-mail with an e-mail from the WoW guy pulled up.  It was some pretty sick stuff to read.  I still have part of one e-mail that I took out of there that he wrote her and it is as follows  (I did have a word document that had more e-mails in it but it appears to have been lost somewhere amongst the porn on my harddrive) :

Hello friend,

Obviously it would be optimal if I could intern at a radio station, but being a college student living on their own working a full-time job that's sort of out of my scope at the moment...

My question is what tips can you guys offer me?

cynde,19,2010-08-07,Should I play Division 1 soccer?,CCasio,soccer,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/cynde/should_i_play_division_1_soccer/,"I walked on last year. It was never my intention to play all 4 years (I walked-on off a whim) and I have no intention of making a career out of soccer. Playing means that all my energy goes into soccer and i don't really have time to pursue any other interests. I often miss out on other aspects of college because of the time commitment necessary to play, In addition I would probably be on the practice squad and not get any game time. 

I have the option to play club which is a level down, but still pretty competitive.

This is a list of pros and cons of playing

Pros:

Being in great shape.
Playing soccer at the highest available level.
Get the use of top of the line training facilities. 
Provided better food.
Status goes up.
Chance to create amazing friendships (maybe stronger than those that are created in another atmosphere).
Chance to push myself harder than I ever have.

Cons:

Tremendous amount of effort.
Less time for friends
Less time for partying. no drugs or alcohol. 
Less time/energy devoted to studying and looking for internships and opportunities that will advance my career.
Soccer in itself is less fun because so much level is so high that    creativity is stunted and a lot of the fun is sucked out by having to play within a rigid structure. Also sucking wind because of physical strain of playing against top athletes makes the game less fun. 
No ""trips"". (I like to go skiing, visit other cities, concerts, etc.)
Generally missing out on the college experience of being stupid, staying out late, living life day by day. 

I don't know what to do. Dammit.

It's almost as if ""the village"" is a distraction...  

""We're busy playing Team Deathmatch on the LAN, Jeeves.  *You're* in charge of the main project of everything we do!""  

All those TV cameras.  Did they give Halliburton the CCTV contract and then run out of money after they got the bill?  When Jeeves is at the front desk - no one is watching?  They should have thought about outsourcing or getting some interns!

What's the camera / viewer ratio?  1:1,000,000? Like, there was one camera looking sideways down the gutter at the top of the building?!  (cross shot shown as Joe was dangling Janet over the edge)  They want to keep track of the squirrels? ..  

OK, who's ""the chosen one""?  The next president, or the one to replace the doctor in charge?

OK jump to the father/reporter and editor.  Writing/acting still falls short for an otherwise noble effort in injecting some romance.  Some writers just don't do romance (David Mamet for one)

BUT, I had to write this post to begin with because toward the end, TWO MINUTES before the old priest got shot, I said to my wife, ""oh look, he'll get ready to tell them something very important but then get shot..""     HOWLS OF LAUGHTER ENSUED!  Do they really think we're that STUPID?

I've grown up in a middle/upper class community all my life. I love my family, and I have the security of knowing they'll always be there for me and would have dinner on the table in a minute if I were to return home. There is nothing my parents have given me that I have ever taken for granted, so this isn't some rebellious FUCK YOU to them. My friends are wonderful and if it weren't for them I'd be gone already.

I am a 22yo male currently enrolled in community college to earn my AA degree in business before transferring to a university, but have only completed a few semesters so the pressure of knowing how much time/money I'll be spending at school is daunting. College is not something I'm passionate about at all; I've always been a hands-on learner, and everyday it feels like more time, opportunities, and potential are wasting away. Currently the biggest concern in my life is keeping good grades, and I feel selfish because of it.

I also intern for an online retailer, essentially running my out-of-state boss's business which he may or may not be interested in growing after my internship is completed which makes keeping my own interest in the business very hard. I pretty much browse reddit and FB chat with my friends all day in between processing orders.

I can say that I've worked several 9-5 jobs enough to know that am not interested in trading time for a paycheck, and am not motivated by money. I have a strong entrepreneurial spirit and know that I will own my own business one day serving the community somehow on a great scale... though getting there is another thing I've yet to figure out.

I want to start anew. Get out of my hometown and experience the true insecurity of being essentially on my own and not knowing what tomorrow will bring. The most important thing I've learned working in an office on my own is that I need to be surrounded by people; I'll bear the rest of the 2 months I signed up for in my contract, but I absolutely can't stand being barred in an office alone; it feels like a prison I need to escape from everyday.

Reddit I need your help. What kinds of resources are out there for someone like me that will help me start a life somewhere else? Do you know anyone who has done something similar who could give me some advice? Where the hell am I gonna go; where the hell am I gonna stay; where can I go that I could have the biggest affect on my countryman? I have no idea, but not knowing is far more exciting than my current 5 year plan.

I don't need to hear that I'm being a selfish prick for not taking advantage of the opportunities I have here, because I feel that my life has a greater purpose than just making money so that I can have it when I grow old. A wife and children will come someday, but for now I need to experience life. If you would like to know more about me, I am honest and open to questions.

And thank you beforehand whoever you may be, your opinion is valued.

I have mentioned numerous times in non-argumentative ways how I have wanted this to change i.e. ""Hey it is really important for me that we have a strong sexual connection in our relationship."" Her: ""I know, I like sex with you, we will have sex tomorrow because I am too tired tonight."" Story repeats all the time. I asked if it was performance and she said no as she comes easily.

Now, one of the new interns at my work (CIO's niece O_o) started to really have a thing for me. We have hung out a few times (did nothing out of line) as a group with other co-workers. Another time, she asked me to come hang with her and her friend at her Uncle's(the CIO) house where she was staying. Went there, played video games, and again nothing happened. Nothing ever came up about dating or if either of us had a boyfriend/girlfriend (as I didn't get the impression she felt that way about me). However, she did know I had a girlfriend.

Now comes Saturday night. She was going to the club with some of her friends and a bunch of people from work. She invited me and I accepted. I met up with her there and danced a bit and I had a drink or two. Then when we were dancing, she grabbed me and we made out. I am in no way blaming the alcohol for me making out with her. I knew what I was doing but I did it anyway. My girlfriend is NEVER forward like this which is a huge turn on for me and I have mentioned that to my girlfriend as well but nothing changed.

I have decided to tell my girlfriend for two reasons. I want to own up to my mistakes, even though she will most likely dump me. The second, I know she will find out in one way or another and if I want any chance at a continued relationship with her, I know I have to own up to it. However, I am starting to like this new girl a lot.

In you experience Reddit, should I try to salvage my relationship or is it time to move on to new opportunities?

TL;DR I have a girlfriend, made out with CIO's niece, salvage relationship or move on?"

I will be living in the USA for a short time this fall (4 months) and won't be earning any money while there (a volunteer internship position at a University). While I will be bringing funds with me, it is likely the case that I will need to get additional funds from Canada while there.

Thus my question: Know of ways cheap methods to transfer funds from Canada to the US?

One option I considered was opening a Scotiabank account. They have a partnership with Bank of America to waive fees when using their ABM's to withdraw cash. Thus I may withdraw American using the Scotia account and deposit it into an account I open there.

tl;dr: Need a cheap way to transfer Canadian funds to America (assuming you are in America)."

I know asking reddit how to deal with internet addiction is probably the same as going to a bar and ask for help with alcohlism.

But as reddit is a pretty diverse place I hope to find some advice by people who quit pissing away a ridiculus amount of time on reddit and the rest of the internet.

I just quit my studies and should apply for some internships and should do some stuff prepare for the thing I want to study but fuck I just procrastinate about all of this. I can´t get anything started.

It´s not like I don´t go out with friends and stuff but everytime I have to do something worthwhile I get stuck at my PC wasting my time on the internet.

So has anyone some advice? A book to read or something else? I think I´m not totally alone with that problem here.

These things are getting me nowhere. I thought I'd turn to you guys to see if anyone knows of a place that's hiring.

3 years experience in retail sales (one of which is as an assistant manager), a year in Audio Engineering (along with a diploma from Metalworks).

Currently an intern at an audio studio, but that looks like it might be even longer until I get paid, I don't have that kind of money to burn anymore.

I'd prefer to keep doing one of those things, as I'm great with customers, and I'm even better with audio and artists, but at this point, I'm not picky.

Please don't shoo this off as spam, and I AM a good worker, and I'm good with interviews, but it's hard to get to that stage when people aren't hiring (especially in the audio industry).

I'm just looking to network through here to see what kind of options there are, and to work with a fellow redditor would be a lot of fun!

Majority atheists, a culture thats chill with a healthy gaming habit. I'm trying to convince my girlfriend (we live together in an apartment in Washington) and she's having none of it so far. We've got two cats, but she says house cats are so rare they have petting zoos for them... :/

Don't mind learning another language and getting reintroduced into another culture. And it's tough to find a place that's more expensive to live than Downtown Seattle. Are there any reasons NOT to live in Japan?

Edit: A bit more about myself because I guess I didn't give enough details. Yes, I don't mind spending 2 years learning Japanese. Life's too short without trying something new. Both me and the girlfriend are white. I'm about to graduate in 2 years with a mathematics/computer algorithms degree. I have work experience now through an unpaid internship, but no real job lined up after college. I bet there's a market for a computer techie that knows English, right? I just want to do something cool with my life and get away, and every time I see pictures of Japan, hear stories, of course I'm into anime/manga, it just seems like such a homely place. And every time I turn around, America just seems to get uglier. Maybe I just have a negative viewpoint, though...

Edit 2: Well thanks for all the advice! I might study abroad over there for a few months, but I'm definitely not making plans about moving anymore. I might even try somewhere else as well, like Pooh_Bear and ChingShih suggested."

We shared a house together, have two dogs, and until a few days ago, I thought everything was fine...

I'm finishing my doctoral degree in engineering (should be done in about a year), and took a summer internship which had me about 1000 miles away for three months.  She is a few years older and works for the government, so she obviously stayed in our home, no big deal, it was only three months. During that time, she expressed that she was unhappy that we are still in the area near my university (major metropolitan area, it's not like we're in the middle of nowhere) because she grew up in the area and didn't imagine we'd be still be here when she moved in with me three years ago.  We never talked about any of this at the time, it was just something that happened.  I told her I understood, and began to make plans so we could move to wherever we needed to be for her to be happy, I could finish my dissertation wherever and didn't need to be on campus.  The summer progressed, she visitted several times, and I made several trips to visit her.  Every single one of them was absolutely amazing.  During one of the trips we talked about marriage, looked at rings, and joked about getting married at some point in the future.  We've been talking about the future for a while, and I was taking the steps to make everything we both wanted happen.

Flash forward to my homecoming.  She says she doesn't feel well (in all fairness she had a terrible week of travel for work), but otherwise, everything is absolutely fine.  We had a nice dinner, played with our dogs, and went to bed.  The next day, we hung out at a baseball game, went to dinner with friends, and spent Sunday night like we spend most Sundays, watching True Blood on the coutch.  We go to bed, I lean over to kiss her good night, and I notice she is just kind of there and very diengaged.  I ask her if everything is alright, and she says ""No... I'm not alright... I'm not happy...""

She proceeds to tell me that she has been ""dreading me coming home every single day,"" and that she ""just wants to be alone right now.""  She thinks I'm ""an amazing, absolutely brilliant person who [she] has an amazing time with..."" but that she ""has a lot of amazing people in her life, and she doesn't want to be in a relationship with them either right now.""  She doesn't understand what after five years, she still doesn't want to be married, and she doesn't want to keep ""forcing it.""  To top it off, she added that ""you're not supposed to marry someone you can live with, you're supposed to marry someone you can't live without.. and there's no one [she] can't live without...""

After several hours of back and forth, we get down to the fact that we work well together, we have the same goals in life, we have the same interests, she is essentially the female version of me.  But... she is incapable of being happy with another person, because that would mean that she wouldn't be in 100% control over her future and herself, and that somehow makes her a weak person.  She is unwilling to be responsible for another person's feelings regardless of how much she enjoys being with that person, or how much that person loves her in return.

If there was a reason why things didn't work out, I could understand.  If we weren't good for each other, didn't enjoy our time together, or we wanted different things in life, I could understand. I just don't understand her, and I don't understand this.  I feel like I'm losing the person I am supposed to be with, and I can't do anything about it.  I have never met another person who understands me the way she does, or to whom I would give anything to keep from pain or hurt or to provide for.  We challenged each other, we supported each other being our own people and having our own lives, we had an amazing life together.  I don't understand how she just walks away...

I was completely blindsided.  I have no idea what to do right now, I feel like every plan I had made for my future is out of the window, and I am completely lost.  It's cliche as hell, but I feel like my heart has been ripped out, and I am missing out on the chance to spend my life with my soul mate.  This absolutely sucks."
d0fzv,21,2010-08-12,I worked in a Chinese Sweatshop that produced software for a large American software Company. AMA ,ShanghaiBounder,AMA,https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/d0fzv/i_worked_in_a_chinese_sweatshop_that_produced/,"I am a White American that worked for a Major Chinese software outsourcer. This company had other large overseas clients, but I worked in a group that was dedicated to and American fortune 50 company.
I used sweatshop for the title, but in reality a better name would be body shop. Workers were paid above market rates, were not over worked, and had plenty of free time for Ping-Pong, Video Games, Snacks, and socializing in a common area.

* I come from a software development background, but in China I was working mainly in a management role. I managed 4 software teams (Scrum) that I was billed out for. I also did side work for the Chinese vendor such as business development, strategy, and respond to Requests for Proposals (RFP.) I also met with potential clients.
I was also asked to do the company’s strategy for Vendor Managed Delivery. The client requested that we start to manage our own projects. This was very awkward time since the Fortune 50 still had Full time (all Chinese) management onsite.

**Key Observations:**

* Western senior management had a poor understanding of Chinese culture, this caused massive productivity losses. Maybe as much as 50%.  In their defense, western management was also responsible for managing many people and projects back in the States.

* The Chinese vendor was for the most part a pure outsourcing play, with very little system integration experience.  In the past the company had mainly acted as a staffing company, but was now being asked to manage end-to-end delivery, an area which that had almost no experience.

**What brought me to China?**

* I was just finishing up a large web project in the states and wanted to take a break. So I bought a one way ticket to Shanghai to check it out. I enjoyed China so much, and decided to stay so I posted my resume on some of the Chinese job boards. I found the Chinese outsourcing business fascinating since this industry is just beginning in china. While India had a head start with many recognized names, such as TCS, Infosys, Wipro china does not have any global brands in this space yet.

* I left the states making 120k a year; this position paid 15,000 RMB/about 2,200 USD per month. So I looked at it more for the experience. Like an internship. It is possible to make a western salary in China, but in most cases you have to be transferred. I was a local hire. This Salary gave me the same standard of living from the US city I was living in before I left for China.

**No, I don’t speak Mandarin. I am at a survival level on a good day.**

So here's the story:
My partner and I have a two-year-old daughter. I'm currently finishing up my bachelor's in Nursing, a field I sort of rushed into after finding out I would become a parent. I have found a love for the healthcare field through my studies and more recently an internship not associated with my school program. I have also found that I absolutely do not want to practice as an RN for the duration of my working career. Rather, I yearn for more autonomy. At a minimum, I plan to pursue a family nurse practitioner degree and specialize in acute care, with intent to practice in an ER or urgent care center setting. The ambitious side of me yearns to go to medical school. As I only have one child now, and seeing as how she would be in school by the time I would enter MS year 1, I feel that becoming a physician is a realistic, albeit very challenging goal.


Recently though, as our daughter reached her second birthday, my partner and I have started toying around with the idea of having another child. We're very family-oriented, and with the exception of the occasional night out at a bar once a month, our lives outside of work (and school for myself), revolves extensively around our daughter. Unfortunately, due to geographic constraints she will not likely grow up with any relatives of similar age. My partner and I both have a sibling, and we agree that it is very nice, particularly as an adult, to have said sibling.
So, redditors, what anecdotes or advice do you care to share with me?

TLDR; Disregard children, acquire degree? Or vice versa?"

I have a ton of documented professional experience with PHP, Javascript, modern CSS and HTML.  Much of my work is freelance; however, I have two formal positions that are relevant to my major, one of which I held for over a year, and another in which I am still working.

I have informal experience in Java, and have several games that I co-wrote several years ago (a Mario / Donkey Kong 2D platformer with working AI enemies, and a Pacman clone with original artwork and working AI).

I also am shit-deep in finance work, which is a hobby at this point, but I may want to make something out of it in the future.  I invest in companies using a growth and value investing paradigm, and I am interested in long term growth with debt or equity, or special situation opportunities (bankrupcies, recapitalization, etc).  At this stage, I am reading much more than I am analyzing companies (I started at the beginning of the summer and have gotten through about 11 books).

In addition, I also have a nice amount of experience in UI design (focus is on websites, esp given my stated background above).  I do not have a lot of recent work available, but I do have some.

I have moderate experience in Python, and I would consider myself a seasoned beginner with C++ (I have a lot of experience with C-like syntax and behavior, so it was very easy for me to pick up the basics of the language very quickly).

I would like to secure an internship for next summer.  I learn quickly and I like to be challenged on an intellectual level.  Ideally, I would like to land an internship at somewhere like Google or Yahoo, maybe even Facebook (moreover, a Silicon Valley company).  My lack of experience in Python, C++ may hurt me, but in eight months I am confident I can become much better in those sectors.

The obvious most important first step to obtaining such an internship is to have a kick-ass resume.  Typography and presentation are important, and from what I can see, LaTex will help me better achieve such a goal much more effectively.  Further, the content is also important, what adjectives should I use?  Is my experience more important, or my educational information (e.g. which should be at the top, which should be at the bottom?)?  Should I include anything related to my new found hobbies with finance?  Should I include some of my freelance work?  How many pages should my resume be (one seems like it is the Euro-American standard for most sectors)?  Could I ever score an internship in the finance world being self educated (e.g. an Engineering Degree)?

I thought I was doing a good job until I get a call from a buddy of mine in the same major.  He says, ""Hey, man I got an interview at the company your work at.  Put in the good word!""  I tell him I will, hang up, and then I start to think.  There are only 4 electrical guys at this place. Why would they need another intern?  I immediately think that I'm going to get canned.  I go to work stoned all the time, go in whenever I feel like it, and I have no confidence in my work at all.  

I go to work the next day (monday), talk to my boss (very intimidating.  In fact, he reminds me of Lunbergh from Office Space), put in the good word for my buddy, and then add, ""unless he's taking my job.  In that case, he's a moron.""  My boss just laughs and says, ""Let's talk about it later.  I have to go to a meeting.""  I don't hear from all week (I didn't have the balls to go up to him).  I finally go up to him today (friday) and ask him about it, fearing this is the end of me.  He simply says, ""We like what you're doing here, and we'd like to offer you salary.

From my (somewhat limited) experience, I've noticed that the vast majority of my colleagues (myself included) have some kind of entitlement where they/we rationalize only 'working' for only 2-3 hours a day.

Sure, at the end of the day you're being paid to do a job and as long as you do that job and meet utilization, why would you or your manager care?  I can somewhat understand and agree with that, but why is this characteristic so dominant in IT?

When I worked at the bank, the ibanking analysts who just spent 50-100k on their MBA worked 14 hours a day 7 days a week. every. single. week.  And when I say 'worked', I mean actually working, probably rather menial tasks like making powerpoints or discount cash flows, but nonetheless, working.  People who work food/retail get 15 minute breaks every 4 hours.  Plumbers work 40 hours a week, not including travel time.  Yet, I can get away with working 3 hours a day and 'investigating' the other 5 hours.. in between foosball and 2 hour lunches of course.

It's not like there isn't other stuff available after my high-focus coding tasks are done and sure, sometimes shit can hit the fan and you have to spend a night in the server room, but every job has moments like that.  

Lets face it, the perks are incredible.. almost absolute freedom to work how and where you want, as long as things get 'done', laid back work environment... usually with an assortment of foosball, table tennis and other games and high compensation.  

Is there really any wonder why there's that whole lazy IT workers stigma and so much outsourcing?"

Advice greatly appreciated.",grad_school_blues,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d18xu/im_applying_for_phd_programs_and_my_boyfriend/,"Hi Reddit, I'm a 22 year old female, currently dating a 25 year old guy.  We've been together for a year and a couple months.  (We don't live together; we live in the same neighborhood.)  Everything's been going great--but there's one big problem.  It seems that, at this point, our respective career choices are totally incompatible.  I want my PhD, and eventually a research position at a University, and he wants to be very active in the startup community in the city we currently live in.

We're both already more than on our way to our respective (career) goals.  He's currently working for a local startup, and absolutely loves his job.  I'm just finishing a research internship on the other side of the country (we live in the USA), and will be applying this fall for programs starting in Fall 2011. 

This across-country internship made us realize that 6 years of a long distance relationship isn't possible for us--2.5 months was hellish enough.  (We talked about it, and came to that consensus.)

So, it seems like the only option for me to pursue my PhD and for us to stay together would be for me to go to a University in the city we currently live in.  However, there's only one school in our city that I'd consider going to for grad school--and it's consistently ranked #1-3 for grad schools in my field.  So, if I get in, problem (temporarily) solved.  However, I obviously can't count on getting in.

So, it seems like my options are:

* If I don't get into the school in my city, say the relationship was nice while it lasted, and leave it at that.

* If I don't get into the school in my city, try to defer for a year for the schools I did get into (I think this is possible?), apply to said school again, and then make a final decision.

* Get into the school in my city, and then pretend this problem doesn't exist for the next 6 years.  (I can't really control where I get accepted for post-docs or research positions, either.)

So, any advice?  I just can't see how any of my options don't eventually make me choose between the career I want and a relationship I want."

I recently graduated and moved out to a new city.

By coincidence we both ended up on the other side of the country. She landed a summer internship and I just landed a job.

Most of the interactions have been harmless and I would have no problem telling my old roommate.

This weekend we were at a club, Michelle was adamant about taking me back to her place.

Initially Michelle was going to share her bed with her friend Kelly who also spent the night out with us.  I got the twin bed in the other room. 

Next thing I know I find myself sharing the bed with Michelle who is trying to pull my pants off.  (most of you are probably facepalming at this point, but stay with me) 

Michelle knows I normally sleep in my boxers so I really can't tell if she was trying to make me comfortable or **comfortable**. I decline and decide to keep my clothes on.

There was some physical interaction not quite cuddling /spooning but she was lying on me. We ended up talking for a bit and then went to sleep.

Was it the alcohol making her extra friendly or did I miss an open invite?

Then there's the issue of man laws. Your roommate's girlfriend is off limits. Since I moved out I'm technically not roommates anymore and there's no ring on her finger. It still seems like a dick move though.

so reddit am I reading too much into the situation or do I have the opportunity to be the other guy?"
d1z9k,9,2010-08-16,Another whiny post. Sorry.,ffoffail,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/d1z9k/another_whiny_post_sorry/,"I hate doing this. I'm sorry, I'm sure you read posts like this all the time. I just would like some anonymous advice coming from an anonymous person. 

My family has a history of depression, alcoholism, and other serious mental disorders. I've accepted that I am very prone to receiving them, and more so accept that I have one. 

When I was 15 my depression started. I was accepting my sexual orientation (gay), getting a fresh new start in High School, and continuing a rocky relationship with my parents (we are very passionate people who refuse to admit when we are wrong). This made me feel very lonely and upset. I started drinking almost nightly to help deal with it. One night I was about to kill myself when one of my friends came to my house and forced me to stay alive. Ironically my parents never let me speak to this person again because they believe that she made me gay (they don't believe this anymore) and that she made me have depression. 

I started going to therapy after my parents found cut marks on my arm. My first therapist literally gave me an internet test and diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and wanted to prescribe me some sort of anti bipolar medication. We didn't take it because it was too early to say that I have depression. Later we found out that she was getting paid by the company that makes those medicines and she lost her license. None the less, this gave me a complete distrust towards psychiatrists.

I went to another therapist later on but did not enjoy it. I faked my way threw it because I didn't appreciate his attitude and the way he treated me and my religion/activities (running, I hated it, he loved it). I kept on going to him because my parents liked him and I figured I could give an hour of my week if it eases their mind. I convinced him, my parents, and I now think myself that I was okay and over my depression.

During the rest of high school I devoted myself to extracurricular activities, mostly Speech and Debate and our Green Club. I have never been the best student for some reason or another, but activities have been my forte. 

Fast forward to college/present day. I moved 4 hours away from home to go to college because I strongly disliked my hometown and felt that I needed a break from my parents. During college I decided to follow up on the same path that I left in High School. I devoted myself to extra curricular activities (College Democrats (which I'm the president of), Alliance (Activism and Communications chair), and I was part of my hall government before I moved out). My schoolwork hasn't been the best, but it hasn't been the worst. I changed my major from Computer Science to Politicial Science. 

I love politics so much that I applied for an internship working for the 2010 elections. This also gave me a chance to get a head start on our 2010 GOTV plan for our campus.

During college I've met some of the best people that I could imagine, including my best friend/boyfriend. I've been in two long relationships before (neither ended on bad terms, but just happened to end) and can honestly say that I have told him more about myself and opened up more to him than anyone else, and I know that he has done the same to me. My parents and my relationship has gotten much better. 

Despite everything going right for me I still feel like the biggest failure on the planet. I feel that I will never be able to move forward or make any sort of small difference in society. Despite me being in a relationship with an amazing guy who I trust more than anything I feel more alone than ever. For some reason I can't bare to tell him how depressed I have become because I fear that he will view me as whiny and spoiled (he comes from a much more difficult background than mine which is obviously a very lucky background with a few small kinks) and him leaving me. 

I have never felt more empty in my life. Despite finding the best friends, doing exactly what I want, having a great relationship, having a better relationship with my parents, an extremely fun internship where I've met a lot of great people and learned a lot about my interests. 

What am I doing wrong?"

In Phoenix, the last time I weighed myself (End of June), I tipped the scales at 250. I am now 230 pounds.

In Phoenix, you have to drive EVERYWHERE. Even down the street to a friend's house cause it's so goddamn hot. In Boston, you can walk EVERYWHERE. Twice a week I go out to Wellesley on the T, get off the subway car and walk to my internship. I end up walking around 5 miles each time I go out there.

I also do not have a paying job yet so the grocery bill is being cut. I am not getting as much protein as I used to. On the positive side, I'm not drinking soda or eating fast food. I have no funds to join a gym. I walk at least a mile every day (besides going out to my Internship) between going to the library or walking a friend to work.

I am afraid that most of what I'm losing is muscle. In fact, I'm almost certain of it.

What can I do now, with no liquid funds, to reverse this trend? I want to lose fat, not weight (fittit has taught me so). Should I try cutting the carbs in my diet and putting more protein back into it?

What can I do in the future, after I earn an income stream, to continue the reversed trend? I am slightly skeptical that as soon as I have money I'll be out buying cigarettes and soda again, so I guess this is more of a question of motivation than anything else. 

TL;DR: Losing muscle, not fat. Help me fittit."

Frequent Fittit lurker here, and first-time poster.  Been through the FAQ but it doesn't specifically address my issue.


Background: I'm 19 years old, 5'10"", 155lbs.  A bit on the scrawny side and my goal is to get stronger and whatever growth comes about naturally as a result of that.


For several reasons, I'm in a situation at the moment where I can't really be eating the amount of protein/calories that Fittit recommends.  I usually eat two boiled eggs and a banana for breakfast, then two more bananas before lunch, and then lunch (which isn't especially nutritious or voluminous due to it being a free meal at the staff canteen of my summer internship company) and dinner (also at staff canteen, unless I go pay up for a Subway sandwich).  


However, I'm currently on week 3 of [Stronglifts 5x5](http://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5-beginner-strength-training-program/) and things seem to be going great.  I started with mostly empty bars (20kg) to get my form right, but each workout feels like palpable progress and I'm feeling great about the whole thing.


My question is, what can I expect from possibly not having my diet match up to workouts?  Is it alright, since I'm a beginner?  Are plateaus inevitable without sufficient intake?  Is it okay to start eating more *once I hit those plateaus*?  Right now I seem to be getting more toned and losing the slight belly flab I usually have, so I'm cautiously optimistic.


Thanks, and please let me know if there are more details I can provide."

Stats:  
Me:  23, m, graduated, employed
My lady:  22, f, finishing school, will be employed at my employer by summer '11 (but not nearly in the same part as me, so consider it another company)

Reddit, I'm frustrated/scared/etc.  I've been going out with this woman for over a year.  I met her while we worked here on an internship, we had a great summer, and proceeded to do the long distance thing.  We made it about 7 months and it broke down with about 6 more weeks to go before another summer together.  During this time, nothing of note really happened, other than we weren't officially together. This last summer, we got back together, and it was pretty great.  She just flew out to finish school and will be back here for good come mid-next year and here we go with the long distance thing again.  

Well, pretty great, save for one thing.  She won't have sex with me at all.  She says it just doesn't make her comfortable, which really hurts, as I've expressed to her.  She's told me (and shown) that she's physically attracted to me (hangs on me all the time, squeezes my arm because she likes that I work out, etc).  She's told me that she eventually wants to have sex, but she's just not comfortable with it now.  After a year of devotion, why wouldn't she feel this way?  It's frustrating and it really hurts, like she doesn't trust me (despite her claims to the contrary, of course).  

It also scares me since I really do love her, but I'm now getting fed up.  I'm a 23 year old man.  I'm a physical being and not having sex just doesn't really feel right to me.  Part of me says to just stick it out.  But, now, a much larger portion is telling me to just give up on the whole thing and end the relationship.  I'm just scared I won't find a woman this supportive (in everything else) or caring.  I'm not exactly the most outgoing person, meeting women is hard for me, and she really is the best thing that's happened to me.  I feel like she might be testing me.  A way of saying, ""If we make it through this, then we can make it through anything.  But until then, no.""  Well, then we aren't exactly in a fully committed relationship, in my eyes.  Unless I'm reading this totally wrong.

And when I say no sex, I mean no sex.  No oral of any kind (she doesn't feel it's safe, despite both of us having clean STD panels and very few partners with safe sex always employed).  She feels uncomfortable with her clothes off, even.  We do, when we are together, sleep together.  

I just want to hear your takes.  I'm not going to do what the majority nor minority say just because I can, but I need some input, especially from some of the ladies here.

Also, before you ask, no, neither of us are virgins.  

TL;DR:  Two non-virgins, she won't have sex after over a year together, despite mutual physical and emotional attraction

EDIT: I'm reading everything, even the stuff I don't like and stuff that I don't reply to.  I appreciate everyones' comments.  I plan to confront her about this, but not in an angry way.  I don't want to threaten her with leaving because of no sex, but I'm not sure I'm able to see my way around it.  "
d22el,4,2010-08-17,Boyfriend is heading off to college. I'm a mess.,collegebound,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/d22el/boyfriend_is_heading_off_to_college_im_a_mess/,"Lovely Reddt-ers, I realize this is a fairly typical story. All the same, I would appreciate the advice. 

My boyfriend of ""3 years"" is heading off to college next Sunday. I am 20 (F), and will be a senior in the fall. We have always been long distance. I addressed the length of our relationship so conspicuously for various reasons. The BF had broken things off three times in the past year. The first as a semi-mutual ""break,"" the second, over aim on my birthday, and the last, as I headed off to a new city for a summer internship. Luckily, we were in the same city this summer, and worked things through. We are both very happy and in love. He says that he had never taken advantage of our short ""breaks,"" and conducted himself in a sexual nature with any other person. He has a history of lieing to me, and it is difficult to develop trust once again.

After three years, and a messy past year, I realize that it is difficult to read everything properly. 

Now, to the advice....I am nervous as hell. I can't exactly pinpoint why, which makes it more difficult to deal with. I guess I am fearful that he will look for a more convenient relationship, or I don't even know what...I love him with all that I am, and I don't want to ever experience what I did this past year again. I have truly learned to forgive, and I am (finally) able to begin to trust him again. He is working so hard to be a better person. He has grown in so many ways this summer.....I know we will be okay, it's just SO intimidating....

I know this is a mess....It's late (or early) and I am finishing a paper for my summer course (No, I didn't fail anything, I'm graduating a year early, and had to finish my gen-eds.)

I guess I am just under a lot of stress, with senior year upon me, law school and grad school apps., (retaking) the LSAT, taking the GRE, Senior thesis, working two jobs, etc.

I don't know what I'm asking...I guess (maybe) I just needed to unload and analyze what, exactly, I am getting myself into. 

He is worth everything, seriously. I don't want to loose him because I am needy or worrisome....I know he needs space...But I am seriously freaking out. Help?"
d25ld,10,2010-08-17,I just don't know,quiet_night,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/d25ld/i_just_dont_know/,"She was my first girlfriend.  At the end of high school we found ourselves drawn to each other and through a month or more of intense flirtation we found ourselves falling in love.  At the end of the summer she had plans to be in Virginia and I in Germany.  We had planned to not be together- that our relationship was an end of high school experiment.  But it wasn't so.  We stayed together- the separation was painful and we deeply missed each other.

She was sexually harassed at school.  The aftermath tore my heart out but we lived through it.  Then through the next few years we lived through starry nights and early mornings.  We were different but we were the same.  She was my love, my best friend, and my alter ego.  Of course there were fights and differences.  But we always found a way through and around.

This summer she went to California.  An internship.  Partly because of Virginia I was worried.  But I was supportive.  A few hours ago she said that she needed to talk and that she didn't think we were going to make it.

There is no definite conclusion on where we are.  We may not be together anymore.  Everything may be fine and I may be blowing everything out of proportion.

The thing is my heart is in my throat.  If we break up I don't know if I'd make it.  I've never thought I'd be the kind of person to say that.  I've been there for friends during hard times and never really understood.  But it's irrational and crazy but I'm just not sure.

I'm just not sure...

I'm not this kind of guy.  I feel a bit silly posting through the tunnel of the internet but this is embarrassing.  I'm not the kind of guy to feel like this, I'm not the kind of guy that wonders if life is worth it.

If anyone has anything to keep me going, I'd appreciate it.

It looks like things might be decided Wednesday morning.  Then either I'll feel very silly or things will be even worse.

Ive' realized that I have room for about three more classes to put towards a minor.  If I take three more communications classes, I can finish with a minor in Business Communications.  Alternatively, I could take classes of slightly more benefit (as a programmer, I'm thinking math classes), but finish without that minor in Communications.

I've boiled my options down to the following:

* Stats II
* Business Calculus (cant do standard Calc II through the math dept)
* Linear Algebra

or

* Interpersonal Communication
* Intercultural Communication
* Visual Communication

I want to be over the top and funny and offbeat because that is what I do when I'm stressed. I make the thing I'm worried about ridiculous. After all, it is very hard to take life's problems seriously when you put clown pants on them.

But, I think I should do this as a stream of thought instead. So here goes. **WARNING: INCOMING GAME**

Fuuuck me! What the fuck is it going to take? Okay, here's my life, it's not glamorous and it's a little bit cry moar emo kid but this is the low down: My parents make a decent amount of money, but they've always had something in the way of that, I had cancer for a long time (whooole other post) so there were bills when I was young. We lost our home in the start of the recession, 2007 part of Wave 1 of homeowners losing a place that had decades of memories wrapped up in it. They are still paying that off. 

Right now I'm in a strange situation as far as college goes. My family makes too much to qualify for needs based scholarships, nobody gives a fuck what you made in high school when you are 20 so there goes my academic funds. My family can't help me out because they're still paying off what they owe on their old home (life remains life all around I guess). Additionally, my mom hasn't been filing her taxes on time since...okay I'm not sure she's ever filed on time. This makes my FAFSA late and rejected every year going on three years now. Any schooling I take MUST be out of pocket. And when CC is 500 (well that includes a textbook which I didn't buy so 400) for one class that adds up. To date I've taken one class, loved it, but I don't have the money to attend this fall.

So why don't I find another path? Well I had a mini-stroke (don't know the latin name) when I was very young, my hand-eye as a result is maaaybe as good as a sixth grader, perhaps worse. In High School I was never allowed to turn in hand written assignments because they were unreadable to anyone but me. I've always loved playing sports and working with my hands but I've never been any good at it. The trades are a no-no, I just do have the precision of hand. Fuck me.

The military is not a fan of cancer survivors, or at least they weren't when I tried to enlist. Medical waiver denied. Fuck me.

I've been saving my money up, being frugal and wise with my spending these past years but every time I think I'm good something terrible happens. A fender bender due to air in my brake lines is leaving me without any money at all and a serious worry that I'll be unable to pay rent. Fucking, fuck me.

At this point I just feel lost, I wanted earlier to pursue a career teaching high school but recent legistlation looks like the profession is just going to get worse. I'm making enough to get by doing data entry but I feel like I'm going to be stuck here...well not forever, that would be being melodramatic, but for a long time, 25 at the earliest as I can't seem to keep money in the bank, just random life shit gets in my way.

All this has made me just weary, not depressed, or maybe depressed but I'm okay most days. Just in general I am tired of trying so hard only to have it blow up. My friends make is seem so effortless. I've got one who just scored a high paying internship, another who is doing really well in state school, another at MIT and another living at home, being able to put every cent he makes in savings and then go to an expensive private school his grandparents are paying for until he figures out what his major will be. 

I'd be lying if I didn't say I felt some resentment. I know it's wrong and I don't stew in it, in fact I banish the thought every time it arises. Lifes not fair and it's not their fault they got the long staw. 

So here I am, two years closing on three out of high school and not a cent, and only 4 credit hours to show for it. I feel proud for surviving the shit I've gone through but at the end of the day, I'm swiming through rough waters being proud of myself for keeping my head above water, and not choking to death while everyone around me *surfs away.* My title refers to a treadmill because that is how I feel. You run and you run and you don't get anywhere and you are left wondering ""Why the fuck was I running in the first place?""

Fuck it, even with a dead end job I'm still doing better than most people in the world. I shouldn't even be complaining. Though I do feel a little better now.

TL;DR Life's not fair so cry moar emo kid. "

Literally, a SMALL company, it's just the owner (my boss) and myself. We also have an intern who comes in once a week (he's the son of one of our clients).

I'm getting to the point where I hate my job. Not because of the job itself, but because of my boss. He's a dick. He's pretentious and at times speaks to me like a child. 

For example, he'll start giving me instructions on what to do, so I start jotting them down. Whenever he's not clear on something and I ask him to explain, he'll respond, ""OK. GO....INTO...THE....SERVER...ROOM...GOT THAT?"" And I don't know how to respond when he talks to me like that.

Or sometimes he'll give me clear instructions, but assume I know something that I don't. For example, ""There's a new Dexis x-ray sensor that needs to be installed. Call Dexis support and ask for 'Imaging Support' for instructions."" Ok, I call them, they give me instructions. I follow them and install x-ray perfectly. Call him back to tell him I'm done, and then he says, ""They don't use Dexis software, they use Dentrix."" So I have to start all over again because he forgot to mention that small piece of information and he gets upset over it.

I'm getting fed up with him, but I can't tell if I'm just overreacting or he's really just an asshole. He recently told me he wants to get more business, so he told me to start a ""Marketing Campaign"". I was truly stumped with what I was supposed to do really. I understand that it's just us 2 and I occasionally have to do mundane things around the office (vacuuming and throwing out garbage) which is fine, but sometimes he'll ask me to call a big company and ask stupid questions because I feel like he doesn't want to call himself. Also, he says he only takes clients who are referred from our existing clients (which I've noticed have ties to his family).

He also doesn't understand why people hate Internet Explorer (he thinks we're just rebels who wanna hate collectively on Microsoft), and continues to recommend it to clients who are careless with their web browsing. He also makes me call him every hour to give him an update on what I'm doing, which is infuriating when I'm trying to work on something and I have to step aside and call him so he can ask me 100 questions on the process.

If anything, I just wanted to vent. "

I have tried everything I can think of, but it looks like I might have to get rid of her if I can't find a place for her to stay for 3 months. None of my friends can take her in, as they are either in college dorms or apartments that don't allow pets, and I am at a total loss. I really can't lose her just because of 3 months. 

So please, if you would not mind housing a small black kitty for 3 months, let me know. I would be happy to help with food and litter, and she has toys, a litter box, and a little bed she likes to sleep in already. 

Even if you can't house her, if you have any advice or know anyone who would, let me know. Thanks guys. "

Yesterday, one of my co-workers told me that someone in the office had a 'crush' on me.

Ever since then, I've been incredibly self-conscious about everything that I do around this guy, realising that everyone in the office is listening in to our conversation. 

At first, I didn't see this crush as a big deal, I talked about it with my boyfriend and he was fine with it too. The problem is with the rest of the department: people keep making small remarks and at the end of the day today, someone left copies of emails supposedly from this guy declaring his love for me, saying he wants to kiss me and saying he misses me.

I don't think that those emails are from him, instead from another guy in the office, pretending to be him.

I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this post, but I thought maybe some other ladies from TwoX had been in the same position? What's the best way to deal with this?

Specifically Vancouver.  I grew up in Oregon / Washington and *love* the Pacific Northwest.  The ocean, the forests, the mountains...  I live in a desert now and am going crazy.

Anyway, I'm a software engineer with 2.5 years experience (assuming my paid internship counts), primarily writing enterprise level software in C#.  I'm more than willing to find a job outside my field of expertise, or even my field in general.  I've tried the points calculator to see if I can immigrate as a skilled worker dozens of times and I get 65 points without a job offer, 2 short of the 67 needed.  If I wait another 6 months I could get 2 more points in the ""Work Experience"" category and just barely meet the 67 required, but if I can get a job offer I'm set.  I could apply for a work visa or I'd have enough points to just go strait to applying to immigrate as a skilled worker.

So, the key here is to find a job.

The problem is, it seems I'm in a sort of catch-22 situation.  Employers don't seem to look at my resume since I don't have a work visa, and I can't get a work visa until I have a job offer.  Heck, I haven't even gotten a single response back other than the normal ""Thanks for submitting your resume"" email.

Anybody here at /r/IWantOut go thru a similar process?  Any tips or ideas on how to job hunt while you're not in the country and don't have a visa?  Anybody know of another way into Canada that I'm apparently unaware of?  I'll continue researching and sending out applications, but any tips, ideas, hints, whatever would be greatly appreciated.

d2p0b,8,2010-08-18,"Alan Grayson (D-FL) recently reached out to me after I contacted him.  Just a reminder that when you contact your Congressperson or Senator, the most effective way is to show up, fax them, or send them a postcard (fax numbers inside).",[deleted],politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/d2p0b/alan_grayson_dfl_recently_reached_out_to_me_after/,"***I have spent several months attempting to contact certain congresspeople outside of my district and did not have luck until I faxed them directly.  So I thought that I'd write some tips on the best ways of contacting a Congressperson or Senator that is outside of your district.***


* Fax: A fax reaches their Washington office directly, usually gets read by an actual person instead of immediately discarded in the scan/dispose box.  This is because many of the faxes received by congresspeople are highly important and they cannot brush it off like generic letters.  Unless they are threatening faxes, which I would hope and encourage that none of you send, they are not screened for security because the physical copies are generated within the office.
* Postcards: Postcards, like faxes, do not require intensive physical screening as well because they are basically flat pieces of cardstock. These also rarely get scanned or screened because of the length of them.  It is much easier to be read by an actual person than to take the trouble of scanning and grouping them.
* Showing up: If you're not crazy or a security threat, depending upon the popularity of the congressperson, it is not that difficult to set up an official appointment with them at their office when they are home.  However, most of the time they are in Washington and this can prove to be more difficult. BE SURE TO CALL AHEAD TO SET UP AN APPOINTMENT.


***Obviously this depends on the popularity of the congressperson, but the other methods are not effective for the following reasons:***

* Calling: almost 95% of the time, an aide or intern takes a short note of a message and it rarely gets read or even passed on
* Letters: due to security precautions, it can take anywhere from 1-5 months for a letter to be even received by the congressperson.  These are then screened for keywords and given a generic response via mail.
* Emails: emails are typically screened for keywords and given a standard generic response right away before getting deleted.

**TIPS WHEN CONTACTING YOUR CONGRESSPERSON***

* Be courteous
* Be brief but stern about your issue
* Address them formally
* Don't send any anonymous messages (these get deleted immediately)
* DO NOT BE THREATENING UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.  Remember, even minor insults can be considered threatening.  These are your congresspeople for heavens sakes - just because you don't like them doesn't mean you get a free pass to be a dick about it. Remember that any threatening or abusive languages can be held against you in a court of law and you could be prosecuted. 
* Put a method by which they can contact you (phone, address, email)


***Apologies for this list not being the most updated, but I believe it was last updated in 2009.  I found it online and I didn't have the time to revise it.***

Edit: The list was too long to paste here so here is the direct link to the list to download in excel format

Yes it comes from a conservative website, but it was the most recent full fax list I could find.

(co-worker),lisa_doll,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d2puw/what_do_his_actions_mean_coworker/,"I'm 18 years old and I work at a video game store as an intern and I recently landed this new job in a foreign European country. The first day I was there the sales manager introduced himself to me, shook my hand (in English, since I can barely speak the language) and made me feel a whole lot more enthusiastic (since I'm usually very nervous around new situations). I'll refer to him as Bob. Bob is 24.

I've been working here for about 3 weeks and last week I really started noticing him. He's very cute, funny, and kind. He's always talking to me, doing funny things, and making me laugh. I think he may like me but I'm not entirely sure... Whenever Bob turns around and our eyes lock, we always does this cute grin and an eyebrow raise. Lately whenever we meet eyes we sustain eye contact for a fraction of a second longer. 

Yesterday, a few of the other workers went on vacation, and we were both assigned to go work together alone, in a small store. He biked there and I took the bus. By the time I had arrived, he was sitting at the counter grouchy and in pain. Apparently, he had pulled a muscle while he tumbled from his bike early in the morning. Poor Bob :(

Anyways he was was hissing in pain so I went to the grocery store for some ice, asked him a few questions about his shoulder, and tried to comfort him. 

He suddenly asks ""Do you think a massage would help?"" So I gave him a massage ^_^ Just on the shoulder though, and he was all thankful and relieved. Hehe I actually liked that part because it gave me a reason to touch him. He says ""I wish you could do this all day"" and then he said ""Thank you SO much. :)""

The rest of the day we spent just chilling by listening to music (he sang along in funny voices, making me laugh, and making our eyes meet, caus he always looked when I laughed). We shared a pack of cigs, had pizza, and drank from this 2 L bottle of iced tea :D

Then near the end, he gets all sad looking, and I ask why. This is how he told it:

""I was talking to this girl on MSN and she said to me 'I like tall guys :)' ""(He happens to be very tall)

""I said 'well i like you. how about we become friends (friends being used as bf/gf)?""

""She said she doesn't think it's a good idea.""

And then he got another message from her, and I didn't get the rest of whatever happened.

At the end of the day he decided to bike home, and he said ""Hop on.""
So I stood on the pegs on the back for a few blocks until we reached my bus stop. The whole journey we were literally glued onto each other :D

So I'm confused about two things:

-is asking for a massage a casual thing to do? A friend thing?

-he's sort of sending me signals that he likes me, but what about his other friend?

I need some enlightenment. I'd ask r/bioinformatics but I think it doesn't really belong in there and I don't know where else to ask. 

I'm a 27 year-old that just finished school, more or less. I've been spending the last couple months trying to find a job in bioinformatics (bnfo). I've had almost no luck. I'm sure in terms of qualifications I might be lacking in some areas, but a lot of the jobs that I've been finding have some requirements that are getting in the way, too. 

First of all, as far as qualifications are concerned, most of the work that I've been doing were just things I've done in school, such as assigned class work or random side projects from my professors. I didn't do much outside of that; in fact, I haven't even done an internship (which is a problem - more on this a little later). I did, however, double major in computer science for my bachelor's, so I have a lot more experience in that field than maybe typical bnfo students have (definitely the case in my university, not entirely sure about other college programs). Still, I can't help but feel my lack of outside projects is hindering my search.

Second, the other sticking point - a lot of the jobs ask for years of experience (which I probably don't have) and either an advanced degree or a PhD. I don't have a PhD, but I have a master's degree... sort of. Part of the program's requirements before I get awarded a master's is that I either get an internship or get a job which will count as an internship, so long as it's in the bnfo industry. I've done all the necessary coursework besides that, but in the end it still means I have no master's degree. I did have something lined up for this summer, but it fell through and it pretty much derailed my... master plan (yeah, that was terrible).

So! Now I am faced with a few options (there are probably a few others that I'm not seeing...): 

* Continue as I have for now, trying to find a job and hope that eventually I get lucky. Maybe I can start trying to pad my resume by doing a few open source bnfo-related projects? Still, this road has a few problems for me - I'm basically suckling on my parent's financial teat at the moment, and I've grown tired of it. I've been looking for a part-time job to pass the time but my main focus has been searching for a real job. Fortunately, my parents are very understanding and doesn't mind that I live off of them for a little while longer (a monetary blessing but a demotivating curse), but I really owe it to them to get out of here. I'm already 27 years old!
* Try to find an internship first instead. I've been juggling both, actually - searching for jobs/internships, but focusing on jobs mostly. I can't seem to find internships, either, and I'm not sure if that's because it's the end of summer or there just aren't many internships available yet. Once the internship is complete, though, I can present it to my committee and once approved finally get my master's.
* Just get a job. As I mentioned, I have a double major in bnfo and CS. I have way more networking contacts in CS than I do in bnfo (which is a problem in more ways than one with respect to searching for jobs in bnfo) and they're always, always offering their help. I usually respectfully decline, though, and explain that I would prefer to get my master's first, but every day that passes makes me lean more and more in this direction, just to see where it takes me.
* Go back to school and get a PhD eventually. I really would prefer not to do this, because I'd rather work in industry and not academia. And YET they ask for a PhD anyway in a lot of job postings (which confuses me a little), which keeps this option on my table. I'm also not really interested in research all that much at the moment, so I just feel like this path would be... wrong.

It's probably important that I mention that I graduated in May. My friends tell me three months isn't really that long of a time to start worrying already, but to be honest I've always been accustomed to knowing what I'm doing and where I'm going. This is a new thing for me and I want to deal with it as fast as I can preparing as much as I can.

And that's all I can think of right now. Any advice is welcome; if you guys have a few issues with the way I'm going about this, please let me know, too. I apologize for the lengthy post - I tried to make it as clear as I can; if it's still confusing I'd be more than happy to clarify. I really do appreciate your time. 

tl;dr: Recent freak undergrad/grad student hybrid graduated with a bachelor's degree (double major in bioinformatics and computer science) and a master's degree in bioinformatics hopefully on the way; fell into a pit of despair (not really... well, sort of) and needs some advice on what step to take next."

I'm just finishing up my double major in History and Political Science. I'm putting off going to grad school for a few years and would like to start working as soon as I graduate and work off my massive student loans. 

I currently work as a social media expert at a big federal department. It's a really awesome 6-month internship and I actually work on projects, build websites, learn about policy, etc (definitely no coffee fetching for me!). It's something I'm really good at - I've written thesis papers and have studied and worked in the field extensively. And it's really marketable in this environment with the whole social media craze going on. I feel like I have a good shot at actually getting a job in this area, and I could save a lot of money by living at home if I land a job in the Bay Area or Silicon Valley. And plus, any job is a good job in this economy.

But on the other hand, it's not something I want to do for the rest of my life. I'm really passionate about international relations and international security, and am interested in working in intelligence or data analysis. Those jobs are harder to come by, and harder to get into. My only options are government or security firms, and that'll definitely take me out to the East Coast.

I think I have a great resume and a lot of work experience, but I'm torn as to whether I should apply for easily attainable jobs that I don't necessarily see myself having a career in (marketing and social media) or grind it out and throw out my resumes to any entry level data position I can get.

And no matter what I choose, when is a good time to start applying? I want to start right after graduation. 3 months? 6 months? Will an employer offer me a position even though I'm still in school? Will they wait around till I graduate? And with the federal government, when is a good time to start applying since background checks and job offers don't come for months after applying? This is stressing me out and I have no idea when I should start. 

**TL;DR: Work an more-easily attainable job in a field I have no interest having a career in, or pursue my passion in an unsure field and economy? And how do I time my applications so that I start working after graduation?**

I knew he was a Redditor, but I didn't know what his username was. So we start talking and I forget all about the attractive girl. (I realized that having a conversation with a member of the Reddit-subculture would be better than awkwardly trying to make conversation with the girl)

I would expect us to add API’s to allow applications to manage security, privacy, and quality of service.  However, I do not see us in a position of making those decisions on behalf of our clients.

&gt; Google is a mix of inferred knowledge (derived from their search traffic) and voluntary knowledge like the on-line medical records.  Exploitation of either of these are unacceptable and any use of the former is intolerable.

The majority of them believe that we're quickly heading in to a double-dip recession, and that Government spending/taxation is killing the corporations of the United States. His final words of advice to the interns, was:

I am a 21 year old, 3rd year Software Engineering student from Canada looking for a job/adventure during the Winter 2011 semester (January-April).


The engineering program I'm in features co-op study program so essentially I'm in class for 4 months, then off working for 4 months and it alternates until graduation. I would love to take one of my work co-ops internationally in the United Kingdom (preferably Scotland :) ).


Now I have browsed the University of Edinburgh's career center for student jobs but it seems that the general idea is that most student internships are unpaid, this would pose a problem. Here in Canada thats considered illegal-ish but it is common in the United States because it is more of a ""learning experience"". 


Now I don't want to give up on my search just yet so I wanted to ask all of you if you have heard of temporary paid student positions before? I also wanted to know if you have heard of any software development or related companies that are successful enough to warrant a junior developer, I have heard that there are some big game development companies, any big names?


Just to give you an idea, I have a decent background in web development but I am more interested in control systems and automation. Not that I would be picky of course because if I wanted another work-term in a field I was interested in I could just stay in Canada... but I would like a change of scenery to something new and exciting. I'm really looking for anything as long as its related enough to my field of study so that it can count toward my degree.

Thanks for your help!"

When I came in to understand the structure of their system, they had nothing really to show for it except their code.  So, I had to spend days looking through packages, classes, and code to understand what was going on.  If they had use simple UML diagrams, I would have spent a few hours understanding what was being called where, what was accessing what, and the overall structure of their design.  (Needless to say, when I generated a class diagram of their system for fun, it didn't look well thought out).

Yet, when I see any UML articles or comments, I see nothing but negative opinions on it.  Why isn't showing an abstract design of your system a good thing?  Why isn't showing the relationships between classes a good thing?  Are they already obvious in the coding structure?

I would like your thoughts on this subject in more depth than the regular comments of ""I hate UML with fiery rage.""  "

I've been unemployed for a very long time after graduating.

You see, the way I see it, it should be up to the applicant to offer working for free. Having the employer offer it just seem like predatory behaviour to me. Especially since the internship is in an expensive city to live in and after spending 7.5 years in university I'm not exactly the richest man alive already.

d468d,1,2010-08-22,Ideas on how to green computing and electronics?,[deleted],environment,https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/d468d/ideas_on_how_to_green_computing_and_electronics/,"Hello all,

*So I've always wanted to make a comprehensive list of ways to make people's computer use as green as possible.  I understand this is a mammoth task, but here's the ideas I have so far:

*Conserve.  Don't leave your computer plugged in if it's at 100% battery or off.  Print double-sided when possible.  Use your computer as long as possible before buying a new one.  Try replacing hardware to keep up as long as you can.

*Conserve (sort of).  This one is more abstract: Use the appropriate service for your needs.  YouTube is not a music site; do not use it as one.  You get low quality audio (usually less than 128 cbr, which is very noticeable on good speakers) at high bit rate (the video stream, even if it's a static image, puts the bit rate over 300 cbr for most videos; it goes much higher for higher resolution videos).  This wastes a lot of data, which is moved about by electricity.  Use dedicated music services for streaming like Pandora or Grooveshark.  Better yet, if you plan to listen to a song a lot, just buy it.  Downloading a 4mb song that you listen to twenty times uses less resources than streaming that same song at 1mb per completion, twenty times.  (As for that, I don't know what to say about methods of data transfer . . . torrenting eliminates the need for server farms, but ratio needs at private trackers cause many to leave their computers on for extra periods of time in opes of seeding.)

*Volunteer your unused e-resources.  This is my fave: Let your computer use your extra CPU to perform calculations on a climate model through [BOINC](http://boinc.berkeley.edu/) (Berkeley Open Interface Network Computing).  I have mine limited to only running when my laptop is plugged in and to not use more than 60% CPU (to avoid overheating and slow down).  So if I'm writing a paper (and thus only using like 5% of my CPU), I donated half of my computer's power to improving UC Berkeley's climate models.

*Donate or recycle your computer and hardware.  If you want to donate it, but are afraid people will find a way to steal your personal info, either remove the hard drive or have it wiped by a licensed professional.  If you recycle, do it through a legitimate agency.  Unfortunately, I don't think there is a way to verify this in the US.

*Demand respect for the environment.  Many computer companies have only started recycling programs and environmentally-friendly design programs because the market has shown that those things are desired.  Make sure that you let companies know what you want by sending a message as a consumer.

Does anyone else have any ideas?  I hope to make a guide/presentation on this topic when I start my internship with my school's environmental office this fall."

I won't have a crazy amount of money, so I figured I'd live in Hoboken or Jersey City. Basically I don't really understand how you get around with an animal, which I assume you can't take on public transit. Right now I'm looking for a doggie daycare in these areas (Hoboken Unleashed seems to be the best) with the idea I'd walk there in the morning, drop him off, then go take the PATH into the city. Any other ideas? I'd like to live in Brooklyn or something else cooler/closer, but I figure I probably can't afford that. The internship pays $3,000 a month, and I'll probably have about $2,000 more a month to spend in savings, namely because doggie daycare is like $600 a month and since I'll be gone 8-10 hours per day, I need it!

d4haa,51,2010-08-23,[7] So I made a sort of smoking game once...I thought I'd share it with my fellow AstroEnts.,Science6,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/d4haa/7_so_i_made_a_sort_of_smoking_game_oncei_thought/,"A little backstory first.  When I was in college, I did an internship with NASA at the Kennedy Space Center (where the Space Shuttle Launches from).  I didn't have any trees, so my best friends road tripped up from Miami to visit me, bring me some green goodies, and watch a live Shuttle launch from this sweet beach condo I was renting in the area.

To celebrate the event, we invented a game. We called it Race to Space.  Preferably, you'd play somewhere where you can watch a live rocket launch; but if you're enough of a space nerd like me, you can also get away with playing against a recorded [launch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NeCvBCZbC8) on youtube. **Disclaimer:** *There is no point to this game. It's just an excuse to get really really high while watching rockets launch*

All participants must first aquire/assemble a gravity/waterfall bong. I made mine out of a Sobe drink bottle. Load the aforementioned waterfall bong with some green rocket fuel and wait for the Space Shuttle countdown timer.  

At approximately T-5 (read tee minus five) the main engine ignition sequence begins, so spark up your lighters and start bringing the flame over the bowl.  At T 0, the explosive bolts holding the rocket to the ground are detonated and release the shuttle into the sky.  This is when you release the water and start hitting that bong. The race has begun! You now have less than 9 minutes to get to orbit aka level [10] before the astronauts do.

Rockets often use staging to get to orbit.  This is when they burn all the fuel in a lower stage, and then drop that stage to light a new one.
AstroEnts can use a similar technique, in which multiple bongs are loaded in advance and then smoked sequentially in order of decreasing size.

TL;DR : Smoke weed and watch a rocket launch, it's really cool."

During the interview they mentioned I would be tested, but then when they went through all the pre-employment papers with me (2 weeks later) I didn't notice anything about a drug test, so i asked the HR lady, and she promptly stated they don't drug test interns. Now back to today... it turns out there was an immediate policy change, and now they will drug test me sometime this week. Ents, I have been smoking ever since she told me there would be no drug test... they just boned me. Luckily its an internship that really isn't what I want to be doing and a horrible commute, but still I feel like the world took a dump on me today.

The worst part is meeting all my friendly coworkers, knowing full well I wont be there next week. 

So now I'm sitting here in a bewildered state, not knowing what the next step is (it was slated for a full year). Oh, and my expensive Garmin GPS decided to stop working on my first commute there.

It's still related to my education, but not the same field as I was hoping to get into. Everyone at my company is great and I've made friends I see sometimes outside of work. Now that I'm leaving I've been getting asked by my boss about my intentions upon graduation and my desire to return. I've been honest and said I enjoy working there and would certainly consider returning. However something he said today hinted at him possibly making a more official offer in the next few days, and I am a little unsure how to play this. I know I'm very lucky to have a company that's thinking of hiring me in these tough times, but I was hoping to do a bit of job searching during my last year at school. I also know my company will pay a little less (8% or so) than other companies I'm interested in (but so far have no prospects at). 

I realize I'm young and will in no way be abandoning my dreams by returning to this company, but I don't want to take the easy way out just because it's there. If I do get an offer in the next few days, can I politely explain I'm very interested but not prepared to accept at this time? Also as far as salary negotiating goes I was thinking I might have a better chance if I had competing offers. Has anyone been in a position like this and feel like they made the right or wrong choice?"

I'm a county worker in California.  I have a Masters in Social Work.  I work with kids who have been permanently planned, meaning their parents have had reunification services terminated and the kids are either in permanently planned living arrangement (PPLA), legal guardianship or headed to adoption.  PPLA can mean a variety of things: Living with relatives, family friends, county licensed foster homes, Foster Family Agency homes, group homes and residential treatment centers (that's rare).  

Due to confidentiality, I will be non-specific with identifying details if you ask me about my clients.  All of my clients are pre-teens or teens.  Their histories vary, but I have kids with sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse, neglect and absent parent histories.  Some have family members who are incarcerated.  Some of them have had multiple placements (like more than 20) and some have been with the same people most of their time in the system.  Some have been in the system for more than 10 years, some less than 2.  Some of them are or have been Commercially Sexually Exploited Children (CSEC), which is the PC term for saying child sex workers.  They live all over California and one in another state.  One lives in a Transitional Housing Program (THP), where the client receives support from an agency and lives independently in an apartment.

I had an internship in another county.  My clients there were in Family Reunification (FR, kids are placed out of the home and parents are working towards regaining custody), Family Maintenance (FM, kids are placed with the parents, but the Court and child welfare agency is monitoring the family), Voluntary Family Maintenance (VFM, kids are placed with parents and there's no Court involvement, but child welfare monitors them) and Permanency Planning (just like what I do now).  All of my clients were toddlers or infants.  The unit specialized in parents with drug issues, so all of the parents had addiction issues, meth mainly.  Some of the kids were born with positive toxicology.

I also had an internship in mental health.  My clients were dependents (meaning open child welfare cases), some were in home and some were out of home.  They were ages 5-14 and had a variety of backgrounds.

What do I do at my current job?

* I see the kids at least once a month, face to face, except the cases where I have courtesy supervision (in state) or Interstate Compact on placement of Children (ICPC, out of state).
* I keep in contact with the caregivers, but I usually see them at least once a month too.
* I try to keep in contact with parents, but some have been out of the picture of years.
* I write court reports at least every six months for each kid.  The court report gives an update on how the kid is doing.
* I try to attend all the court hearings.
* I do referrals for services and keep in contact with those providing the services.
* If the kid's placement needs to change, I call for a special meeting to be held called Team Decision Making Meeting (TDM) where the important people in the child's life and the child (if they are old enough) give input on where the child should be placed.  Ultimately, the placement decision is mine, with input of the placement worker.  Sometimes I move their things and I have to see them in their new placement within 24 hours, unless it's a weekend.
* I try to keep in contact with my Absent Without Leave (AWOL) kids.
* I transport kids when needed.
* Fill out endless amounts of paperwork and enter contacts (anything I do for my clients, communication wise) into our computer system, Child Welfare Services/Case Management System (CWS/CMS).
* I keep in contact with the eligibility staff, who deal with the funding to make sure the foster care payments are going out and other funding.
* I help kids prepare for emancipation, which includes getting them signed up for Independent Living Skills Program (ILSP).  ILSP works with the kids from ages 16 and offers services to the kids till they are 21, in some counties till they're 24.  They help them with life skills through classes, signing up for college and financial aid, and getting housing.
* I ask tons of questions of my coworkers and supervisors.  I want to follow the law and our policies as well as making sure I'm doing my very best for my clients.
* Learning acronyms - We have so many.

There's so many other things I do too, but these are the main things.

Things that are important to me:

* Sibling relationships (visitation, finding siblings they've lost contact with)
*Placing children with family or family friends (also called Non-Related Extended Family Members, NREFM).  I look into reunification when appropriate.
* Getting the kid's perspective on their needs.
* LGBT youth being treated fairly.
* Indian Child Welfare Act compliance (if a child is Native American or may be, we notice the tribes and if the kid can be enrolled in the tribe, the tribe has the right to be involved.)
* Making sure our paperwork and computer files are properly updated and my court reports are accurate.

I understand that so many people have been negatively impacted by interactions with child welfare.  But please, ask questions rather than berating me."

I need some insight on my current situation: I have two internship offers and I don't know which I should take.

The first one is for a well-known investment bank (Merrill Lynch). However, it's unpaid and involves a lot of administrative work, cold calling, and filing. The main con I see with this is that I've heard lots of negative feedback and I won't be learning as much. However, it's a big company and I think it'd be a good thing to put on my resume. Even though this is a field I want to pursue in the future I'm not exactly working in that department.

The second offer is for a small software company. It's a paid internship for a good 8 months and I'll be doing a lot of budgeting and accounting work. It's not strictly related to what I want to do but it will give me the accounting experience that's helpful. The only con for this is that it's not as well known as the other company.

So which one should I take? A big well-known company where I will be doing lots of paper pushing and not really learning or a smaller company where I'll learn about accounting and get paid.

Any insight would be very much appreciated. If it helps, I really want to get into the finance sector (hedge funds, equity, etc.). Thank you again in advance reddit!"

It seems like up until college there is an emphasis on learning the English/US system of units. They then teach you conversions and you start to get an idea of the SI system. In college, almost all of my problems are in SI units. To me, the SI system is so much better in every way, and it makes doing complicated problems much easier. Whenever I get a question with English units on a test I groan.

But now that I am doing internships in the industry, everything is back to English units! The only time I see SI units is if we are selling to Europe.

It turns out she was unaware of my breakup the first couple times I saw her, but since she has found out I've been getting the impression that she's interested in me because she's gone from random coffee breaks, to dinners and drinks, etc.  In the latest case I had mentioned that I was going to a particular concert and within the week I got a message from her saying she had bought a ticket to it too.

I'm unsure how to proceed.  Mainly I'm trying to figure out how to get more kino in as I didn't touch her much before (remember, I was in a LTR) and it would seem kind of awkward to start doing that now.

I'm trying to find something, anything, that isn't another sales job, but I'm about desperate enough to say yes next time one comes up, just so I'll have something to do during the day.

I'd love to get something doing non-profit fundraising, as I've done fundraising calling for the Walnut, but applying for those jobs feels lately like throwing myself up against a brick wall, as I haven't had an internship or any development experience besides phone solicitation. I took the test for a Clerk Typist job with the state of PA, and scored 82, but nothing has come of that yet.

Extra complicating factors: I don't have a car, or a license, so that would make going to work outside of the city rather difficult.

[This is my basic résumé (.doc format)](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/502172/RAndersonResume.doc), though I've been sending a different, targeted version to the various non-profits I've applied with.

Jobs and areas of particular interest to me include:

* Writing/Editing
* Web design [(This is my website)](http://www.sanspoint.com)
* Non-profit fundraising
* General office/clerical
* Arts marketing

At this point, though, I'm up for almost anything that doesn't involve cold calling and selling things.

I'm at my wit's end. Help, please...

Edit to add: I haven't even *interviewed* in the last six months. That's how bad things are."

",jdv25,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/d50u9/i_need_your_advice_fellow_engineers_2_job_offers/,"I just graduated in May and was searching for full time jobs for several months.  I have had an internship in manufacturing for 4 years and my current internship is where I received the first job offer. 

The first job offer is in manufacturing.  It is with a fairly large (5,000-10,000 employee) company.  It would be a production engineer role.  The pay would be really good and job security great.  However, I want to get into design.  That is where the second job offer (probably) is from.  It is from a design firm that has been doing very well, has their hand in many different industries and needs a new Mechanical Engineer.  It is exactly what I think I want to do.  However, the pay would not be near as good and the job security working in the smaller firm would also not be as good. 

Any thoughts?  should I sell my dreams for a lot more money and job security or screw it and go with the job I want?

Edit:  Thank you everybody for your responses.  I am taking the night to think about it.  I have until Thursday morning to decide.  Every one of you has given me something to think about.  I am truly grateful for the internet strangers. :) I will continue to check this and send out responses to questions that you may have for me. 

Edit 2: I met with the smaller firm again today.  I got a really weird vibe from the entire experience.  Further, there were some dishonesty issues. They flipped my initial responsibilities from design engineering to a project management and manufacturing role, they were not clear on compensation reviews, not clear on vacation expectations, etc.  

I am going to tell the the first/larger employer that I will take their job.  This was based on my 5 and 10 year goals, the culture, the available resources, and a variety of other things.  If any of you have any questions regarding this, feel free to ask!

Thank you all very much for your thoughtful advice.  It was a tough couple of days for me and many of you gave me things to think about. "

Can I please get some advice or words of wisdom?,solosthatinglife,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/d52y7/hey_yallfeeling_incredibly_down_about_myself_can/,"Hey everyone. I recently took a sales job. I took it because I couldn't really find anything else and it pays pretty well (salary + commission). It's only been a few days and I hate the job, hate everyone that works there, and hate myself for taking the job. I'm a college graduate with a telecommunications degree from Penn State, so I feel like I'm wasting my potential by working a job that is door-to-door sales, and reciting some dumb script to people who don't want to talk to me in the first place.

I need a job that is fulfilling. One that helps people, one that I feel good about. For a while I wanted to be a teacher, but I'm not sure why I didn't follow through with that. I've also wanted to do a few other things. Join the Air Force only because I don't know what to do with my life. I'd love to work in film, but have no idea how. I'd go back to school to become a middle or high school teacher but I only have a 2.8 gpa. I just feel so lost.

I live with my parents and they're upset that I'm quitting this job (even though it sucks and you only need a high school diploma to work there). I feel bad for letting them down.

I'm sorry that I'm rambling, but I need advice. I feel like I've never been good at anything, my self-esteem is at an all time low, I'm depressed right now, etc. Any way you guys could help me would be great. Job advice, job suggestions, internship advice or suggestions. I feel like I've made nothing but shitty decisions so far. I'd love it if someone told me what to do.

Again, sorry for rambling.

**bold** TL/DR **bold** - I'm quitting my job of a few days, feeling guilty about it although it sucks. Have no idea what to do now, kind of want to be a teacher, not sure of the steps I should take to do that. Any advice is appreciated."

I'm currently in school on my way to a double degree in CSE/EE. School is going to take longer than I anticipated, for various reasons, so I had a sit down with my boss to talk about options for me with the company.

 Long story short, we decided on staying full time with a pay increase and going to school part time, while taking advantage of my company's tuition assistance program (reimburses you out of pocket expenses based on grades for the courses taken. A=100%, C=70% evenly distributed between them.)

We agreed that if we went this route it would not be just for a semester or a year, but more long term. 

He told me he would talk to HR and put together a package with an offer in it for me by the end of the week, so I'm hopeful I'll get it this Friday. 

My question basically is what can I expect? We're a fairly large business, we were recently bought by one of the top manufacturers in the world that is based out of Sweden, and business has been good. I currently make $12/hr. with as much overtime as I'd like.

What should I do with my life?,LtArson,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/d5fkj/im_a_junior_in_computer_engineering_what_should_i/,"Hey guys. I'm a junior in Computer Engineering at a top 10-ish private university in good-ol' US of A, and I don't know what I want to do after I graduate, but I need to figure it out pretty soon.

I'm taking a heavily software-oriented track in computer engineering, and I'm very good at it and I find it really interesting. The only problem is that I don't enjoy actually doing software development or computer engineering, I just love learning about it. I couldn't picture myself being a software developer at all, and judging from my summer internship I wouldn't enjoy it. Some of my friends were recently hired as software developers for Google and Microsft and Disney but that's not something I can picture myself doing.

There's two things I'm considering, at this point, that I think I WOULD like to do.

I'd like to be a lawyer, but I'm not really sure that's a good idea - I mean, there are a lot of lawyers in this country as-is, and even if I'd like being a lawyer I wouldn't like being an unemployed guy with a JD and a bunch of student loans. Do you guys think that's a bad idea?

I'd also like managing other software developers, I think. I don't know what a job title for something like this would be, though. Product manager? Project manager? Team lead? And I'm not sure what sort of classes I could take that would benefit from something like this, or even if companies will hire new graduates for these positions - I've already taken a software project management course, but I'm not sure if there are any other sorts of classes that would work out for this. I have a decent amount of management experience. I'm working on a web startup with some people I met through a class (planning to push out a beta release in a few weeks), and I have an administrative role in the university's student-run IT department (we employ 40-50 students during the year, and me and a few other people are responsible for hiring, firing, performance reviews, raises, pretty much everything in the day-to-day operations).

I guess what it comes down to is that I like the ""solving problems"" aspect of programming, in the sense that I like to look at a problem and say ""okay, we'd go about solving it this way"", and I tend to be pretty good at that, but I don't like actually solving it (that is to say, writing the code that implements a solution I've laid out). So is there any kind of job that would let me do that?"

I eventually obtained a paid internship which evolved into a full time position, and have since moved to another agency.

I've been going back to school for night classes for the past 3 semesters. It's becoming increasingly difficult to keep this secret, so I just this moment decided to not go this fall semester. I am fairly successful and figured I'd do this AMA to basically confess. It's not especially interesting, but over the past year or so, I've started feeling enormous amounts of shame. 

I don't think this is even that interesting compared to the great stuff that's usually found in this subreddit. I just thought I'd share. *And we need a confessional reddit. I'm only doing this because it's almost like group therapy.*

Just recently graduated from Masters in CS and had an undergrad in molecular bio. Got lucky with an bioinformatics internship at a big place. Now they want to keep me around (alright!) but there's catch. My boss can't open a permenant spot for me until next year (so he says) but he certainly seems sincere. The big wigs up above keep a cap on permenant employee numbers. 
Right now I got two options, either go through this staffing firm the company uses (named Yoh) for all its contract positions or sign on as an independent consultant. He said Yoh could potentially take 40% as overhead but they do offer benefits and ""stuff"". Independent consultant also means I'll have to spend a week filing my taxes next april (my dad has an LLC that I'm part of, maybe use that?). Either way the goal is to keep me around until that permenant spot can be opened (may take up to a year?).
I asked some friends of mine but no one really is knowledgable enough to help. So now I turn to the experts at reddit. Should I go consultant or contract? I'm sorry if there's lack of details, we just started the transition process. Maybe hints and suggestions on pros and cons of both choices?

A buddy of mine just finished up a program to become a medical assistant. The end of that program was to work for free as an intern at a medical facility. Tomorrow is his last day and then he'll have all of his hours.

All of the other interns have been dismissed, and they were told at the outset that ""if they did a good job, there was a job opening waiting for them at the end of the internship."" My friend was great, apparently. So great that for the past two weeks they've been working through paperwork saying that they're going to hire him.

Today rolls around, and they pull the offer, claiming ""they want to avoid a lawsuit"" on account of them having a high number of female patients, and his being male may cause the female patients to be uncomfortable and sue.

Yes. Seriously.

My knee-jerk reaction was to tell him to find a free law consultation, but after we bounced ideas off of each other, we decided he would be best off as a first step to consult his career adviser at his medical program. Apparently he has now sent her a message.

I understand that you can be fired for no reason, and even denied employment without being given a reason, but my question is, is if they deny you employment because you're male isn't that more or less the definition of sexual discrimination? Should he even bother with a lawyer, or are we outraged for no real reason?"

**First, a little about my writing background:** I've always felt a very deep connection to the written word, and writing, in various forms, has been an important part of my life from an early age. During my childhood (from about age 5 to 12), I wrote a lot of short stories and aborted bits of novels. During my teenage years, I added fanfiction and the requisite angsty poetry. While in high school, I did a lot of student journalism (this was a bigger deal than it might sound—our paper usually placed in the top 10 at national competitions and I won several writing awards at both the state and national level). In college, I majored in literature and minored in history, which meant A LOT of paper-writing. About a year in, I discovered my university offered a minor in Professional Writing, so I decided to take that on as well. Some of the courses I took included business writing, writing for education, and two quarters of professional-level grammar and editing. In the last quarter of my college education, I snagged an internship at a relatively well-known (for its niche, anyway) reference publisher. After a few months, that internship turned into a full-time position, and I've now been working there for about 5 1/2 years. A lot of what I do is administrative, but my job also involves a fair amount of writing, editing, and reviewing other peoples' editing. Since starting work, I've also earned a Technical Writing certificate from a local college and done some freelance projects (mostly writing for encyclopedias and magazine editing). I've slowly been working on creating my own freelance website so that maybe one day I'll be able to quit my day job, work a little less, and earn a little more. In 2008, I completed NaNoWriMo (and probably took a few years off my life in the process).

**And now, the issue:** Although I have very little problem writing in a professional capacity, whether at my day job or doing freelance work, I absolutely cannot motivate myself to write for fun. It's hard to pinpoint when it first began because it's been so gradual, but I think it started sometime during college. I've never been one of those prolific writers who seem driven to write—I've always been slow, methodical, and apt to grow tired of stories/novels and just abandon them. But I used to very much enjoy taking the germ of an idea, planning it out ad nauseam, and then sitting in front of my computer to gradually eek something out until I dropped that project in favor of the next great idea. But, slowly, I stopped enjoying the act of actually writing, although I still had lots of ideas and still enjoyed planning them out in my head. Over time, though, I stopped getting ideas or feeling creative in general, and everything has more or less ground to a halt. Right now, I want to *want* to write and I want to enjoy it and have a finished product I can be proud of, but when I sit down to actually do it, it ends up feeling like a chore. And since I have enough writing ""chores"" in my life as it is, I end up stopping pretty quickly. If I actually managed to get something written, I was hypercritical of it.

**My theory:** My suspicion is that, over the course of the last 10 or so years, writing has become more of a means to an end rather than an end in and of itself. I increasingly needed to get something out of my writing (a good grade; a paycheck; a reputation as a dependable, high-quality freelancer) and that took the fun out of it. Since it wasn't fun and I was pretty busy with other things, I stopped doing it, which in turn led my creativity to grow rusty from lack of use. After that, it was just a vicious cycle: I'd work up the motivation to sit down to write, it would seem mentally painful and/or boring, I'd try to muscle through, that would make it feel even more like a chore, which would put even more pressure on me the next time I tried to write. 

I think not having to write for a living would be a huge help, but that's not very practical. I don't foresee independent wealth in my future, and my ability to write/edit is pretty much my only really employable skill (unless someone wants to pay me to play with baby animals or take naps). I think eventually transitioning to full-time freelance work would be a step in the right direction, as it would cut down on the stress from my day job (although it would, of course, create its own unique stresses). But even if I was able to actually do less work, it would still all be writing/editing related.

**What I've tried:** It seems that most motivational advice falls under the category of ""just keep doing it until you get into it again."" That can be subdivided into two categories—""force yourself to write a certain number of words every day/week"" and ""force yourself to spend a certain amount of time writing every day/week."" I tried the former first—as I mentioned above, I did NaNoWriMo back in 2008. (For those that aren't familiar with it, NaNoWriMo is basically writing a 50,000-word novel in one month. You aren't supposed to worry about quality; you just get it down on paper as fast as you can. The idea is that at the end of the month you'll have a rough draft to work with that you can then spend more time expanding and polishing.) Although I completed it and am glad for the experience, it in no way jump-started my desire to write. In fact, I think it may have made my issues worse, because for that month I was perpetually anxious about meeting my word count and exhausted from that much writing. (As I said, I've never been a fast or prolific writer, so that many words in that short a time was a big deal for me.) Although I now have a rough draft, I don't like it and I have no interest in going back and editing it. (I've always been one to edit as I go—if left to my own devices I will always produce one draft and then make only small edits here and there. This applies to every type of writing and seems to work well for me.)

In the last month or so, I've tried the set amount of writing time approach, but I can't seem to get into the habit. Again, it feels like a chore—like something I need to schedule into my day—and it's always low man on the totem pole of tasks. I rarely actually make time to write, and when I do, it's with a ""got to get through these next 30 minutes"" attitude. I don’t want to write this method off completely since I haven't been trying it for that long, but my suspicion is that it won't work. So both of these brute-force methods don't seem to be effective for me.

**A few things that I suspect are either contributing causes to my writing issues or other symptoms of a larger problem:**

* I've found that my enthusiasm for doing anything fun has tapered off, although not to such a large degree as with the writing. It seems like work, eating, sleeping, and the basic responsibilities of being an adult take up about 95% of my time and energy. I have fewer hobbies and interests than I did 10 years ago. (I swear, if I could just have my summer vacations back…)

* My reading (and, by extension, writing) habits have changed since I was a child/young teen. I used to read a lot of fantasy and horror, but, beginning in high school and definitely continuing through college, I started reading a lot more of the genreless books—classics and more contemporary ""good books you should read."" (Actually, these always made up a decent proportion of my reading; it's more that I'm reading *fewer* fantasy, horror, and other more clearly ""genre"" books.) Similarly, I used to write a lot of high fantasy, dark fantasy, and horror stories, but have since transitioned to more genreless stories (although the NaNoWriMo novel was dark fantasy). I've always been picky about and critical of what I read, but that pickiness and criticalness has definitely increased since college (undoubtedly from having to pick apart so many books for lit classes). I know I've gotten much more critical of my own writing as well. As with writing, I've always been a slow reader, but after college the amount of reading I did dropped off precipitously. I'm now slowly getting back into reading regularly, though.

* I have been in a very stable, reasonably healthy relationship for the last 8 1/2 years. He is very understanding and would certainly give me the time/space I need to write, but I do find it harder to make ""me time"" because it's easy to use him as a distraction.

* I spend much less time with my friends than I used to. I've always been one of those people who has a few, close friends, and I usually don't enjoy making new friends and that awkward ""getting to know you"" phase. My good friends are people I've known since elementary/middle school, and I have literally spent thousands upon thousands of hours with them at school, at each other's houses, on the phone, having little adventures, etc. But, of course, we've all changed over time, dispersed, and gotten busy with our own lives. I still talk to/see them regularly, but I think part of me really misses that constant day-to-day interaction and very deep connection I had with them when I was a teenager. (I realize, though, that having that now isn't necessarily healthy or feasible.) 

This has become an epic post—apologies again for not condensing it more. Anyway, what does Reddit think my problem is, and how might I fix it? Has anyone else been in a similar position and managed to rekindle their lost love for writing? How did you do it? Any words of wisdom? Are there some self-help books you recommend?

**tl;dr:** I used to enjoy writing for fun. Now I do it all the time for a living and I don't enjoy it as a hobby anymore. I've tried writing x number of words each day and spending x number of minutes writing each day, but neither has worked. What do I do?"

3. I've read horror stories of Pharmacy majors being overworked and completely broke due to the demands of their major. I need to have a part time job while in school to be able to live. Is Engineering this intense? Will I have time to work?

Any other words of wisdom would be fantastic! Thank you in advance!!"

Are you a lawyer, a consultant, a GS-X, an intern, a staffer, political appointee, or non-profit idealist? Or do you have a non-traditional DC job like artist or musician? What's your day like, how do you pass your weekends, and where do you go out drinking? What are some crazy stories you have from living in town?

I'll start. I'm a 20-something consultant for a big company doing programming stuff for a government agency. I've been an intern on the Hill, the White House, and OMB before going private sector. I grew up around here and currently live in Arlington. I drive out to Reston for work every day and go out to local spots in Arlington on weeknights. Weekends I generally go out in the city, where Georgetown and H Street are equally fair game. A recent ridiculous incident was me smoking J's with a friend on top of her lobbying firm's roof, while being within plain site of a Congressman's fundraiser on the other side of the rooftop. Good times.

Your turn. I want to know about you."

d6yfw,26,2010-08-29,Depressed girlfriend making me depressed,fdsa1,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d6yfw/depressed_girlfriend_making_me_depressed/,"1. Ages: Recent college graduates, she is a little younger than me.

2. Relationship type: Met in college and we've been together for nearly 1 year. Because of my housing situation, we actually lived together for about 4-5 months (we had been together for about 4-5 months beforehand). We have each since both finished college and moved back home to our parent's house, we now live about a  40min car ride away. We used to hang out together 24/7, but since moving back home we now only able to see each other a few times a week. While I do miss being with her daily, I am okay with this but she has not taken it so well. It has been about 3 months in this situation and my love for her has not changed due to the drop in time spent together.
3. I have talked to her about this, and she knows I am upset, but I don't think she truely understand how unhappy it makes me feel. I don't think I can ever tell her everything I'm feeling (not good with expressing my emotions in the first place), but more so I feel like she will not be able to handle how unhappy I am. For the last few months, I have not been able to sleep very well, which has led me to stay up very late at night because my mind is always 100mph before bed. She has been to a school counselor before our relationship, and also went to a few sessions while we were still in school. Also, she is currently working at a temporary internship, in a very bad environment where she feels overworked and under appreciated. I feel like this environment is 10x worse for her than it would be for anyone else in that situation.
She has talked to her mother, and is planning to speak with a professional soon.
4. Problem: She has occurances, about once a week, where she feels anxious and depressed but doesn't know why. I try to lift her mood by telling her I love her and that everything will be okay, but it does not ever seem to help much. She  also sometimes feels like I don't care or love her enough, and misses me so much even when we just recently hung out for the entire day. She gets very sad when I have to, whether it is off the phone or home.

5. Her past: she has been through a lot, especially with her parents, family, and past boyfriends. Talking to her, it seems that she has never lived up to her father's expectations. She has a better and good relationship with her mother. Despite this, I can tell that everyone in the family really does love her, even though their way of displaying affection is different or not the ""norm"" (i love you, hugs etc). A few years ago she found out her dad was cheating on her mom, a little after that time, she found out that her boyfriend was planning, or already (i'm not sure) cheating on her. I am definitely not planning or thinking about cheating on her, I love her too much. I don't think she is afraid I am going to cheat on her, but the thought still affects her because of her experiences.

6. I am not a psychologist nor do I think I am qualified to diagnose her, but I believe she possibly is codepedent, manic depressive, or bipolar. Not all these things, but I feel she displays many of these symtpoms.

tl;dr: I think my gf has mental illness; some sort of depression. I try my best to help her through it but I am now it has caused me to feel very depressed myself. I can't tell her how I truely feel because i think it will just exaccerbate her situation, and make her feel more depressed. I have told her that I really think that she needs to seek help, she has agreed and has taken a few steps to do this.

Please help me, I love her so much, but I don't know how much more this I can handle :( I know this is A LOT, but please let me know if I missed anything or if you need anymore additional information. thank you for taking the time to read all this."
d717r,0,2010-08-29,"Reddit, my love life is currently non-existent.  Can you possibly help me out?",TescoValueThrowaway,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/d717r/reddit_my_love_life_is_currently_nonexistent_can/,"Hey reddit, I've got a problem and you guys always seem so good at sorting things out so I'd like some advice.  Obvious throwaway account because I do not want to personally identify myself.  I'm going to offer a bit of backstory and some of the problems I seem to be faced with.  Apologies in advance for the length of this post and thanks for reading.

I'm a 22 year old guy and turning 23 in December, and I graduated from University in early June and am starting a Masters degree in October.  All summer, I have done nothing of note apart from a one week family holiday because there are very few jobs or internships available where I live (south West England).

Essentially, my love life is non-existent.  While I was at University I feel like I worked too hard and as a result I didn't socialize as much as I probably should have done which ruined the experience somewhat.  At the grand old age of 22 I have *never had a girlfriend*.  Sounds weird but it's true, and to be honest it's starting to wear me down and make me feel inadequate and feeble.

My first kiss was aged 19 towards the end of my second year at University and since then I have only pulled about six girls.  I have done lots of groping, spooning, kissing and heavy petting but never anything naked, and I have never had foreplay and am still a virgin.  All of my activity with girls has involved at least a small amount of alcohol as I am a bit shy and lacking in confidence, and there are a number of girls I grew pretty close to and them to me (some of them were definitely interested with some even texting me like girls do when they're interested).

This is hardly anything considering my friends are all screwing like rabbits on viagra whereas I have nothing, and I really feel like life has passed me by.  I can't turn the clock back and it feels like such a waste.  I've only been on three sort of half-dates which was nice although I didn't ask any of the girls out - I went to a show with a girl and her friend and I met up with the girl before the other guy turned up and we had a drink (I liked that girl) and the second one was with a girl I lived with at University as we were meant to be going out as a group, but the others decided they didn't want to so we went on our own.  It was also quite nice, we had a nice chat and a quiet cozy drink in a pub together but we fell out weeks later when it turned out she thought I was coming on to her, so she began to shun me which made me very angry and upset because I could see no clear reason for it.  In December 2008, I got hopelessly drunk and came within 10 minutes of having a one night stand and losign my virginity.  We got back to the girl's (not one of the aforementioned girls) flat but she suddenly changed her mind and asked me to leave despite she had been leading me on basically all night previous to this, and I still can't work out why.  I have several long term close female friends who have rated me as an 7.5 or 8 out of 10 on the looks scale (sorry, no pics) and they have tried very hard to encourage me and cheer me up.  I have had problems with unrequited love on a small number of occasions and I think I'm getting too hung up on looks as there was one girl who obviously really took to me and I liked her personality, but she just wasn't good looking enough somehow.  There was another girl who texted me for the whole of Summer 2009 because I met her in a club and kissed her, but again it was my fault that we never dated or made anything of it.

I was teased and picked on at school whenever I showed an interest in anything at all, including girls so I think this has damaged me because even now I'm conscious of what my old school peers might think if I were to ever enter a relationship.  My sense of humour isn't what it was (I used to really make people laugh but now I can barely crack a smile) and I think I subconscioulsy push people away when they try to get close which makes relationships difficult so I do wonder if I'm suffering from a form of depression.  I can't really relate to other peoples feelings beside my own (this is quite a recent change)

I basically have one more crack at University to get all this sorted out, but I'm worried that I'm going to be far too busy to socialize enough to make it happen.  At this rate I can honestly see myself hiring escorts and using online dating, sad and pathetic as it is, next October as I leave University for good and any opportunities I had will be gone forever.  Society says I'm screwed and destined to live alone and miserable forever because I didn't get my first girlfriend aged 12 or have sex at 14.  My lack of sexual experience at age 22 is embarrassing and it would be really obvious if I ever slept with a girl properly.

I realize most of what I have written here is self pity and I've probably brought some of it on myself, albeit involuntarily, but I do genuinely want to put it right and I need some help in doing so.

Thank you for reading.  I'll answer any questions as best as I can and all comments and suggestions are welcome."
d76ng,5,2010-08-30,Going back to college for physics after a 3 year break. Any advice Reddit?,museparade,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/d76ng/going_back_to_college_for_physics_after_a_3_year/,"I screwed around my first few years of college and then ended up dropping out due to a lack of motivation. After three years of dead end jobs and spending all of my free time playing world of warcraft (not an uncommon story I'm sure), I now realize I want to do more with my existence. Out of the variety of courses I did take, I am most interested in physics, in learning about our world and universe. I do realize that this major requires a lot of passion and hard work, and I am ready to dedicate myself to it. I also realize that if I plan to do any major research, I will need to attend graduate school. I am not too concerned about money, but I do hope that I am able to scrape by until I finish up. Fortunately financial aid is covering all of tuition for my first year back at least, as well as future semesters I am assuming. 

I am also pretty concerned about employment in the field, for both internships and full-time employment, as I am confined to Connecticut - but I will post these concerns in the physics subreddit. 

Any tips, advice, anecdotes, or words of wisdom are welcome and appreciated! I am now off to my first day of classes, and what a beautiful day it is....."
d7am7,2,2010-08-30,"Wants to be a citizen activist to impact local government, but require an education, halp?",sirdavethe2nd,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/d7am7/wants_to_be_a_citizen_activist_to_impact_local/,"After years of post-High School doldrums, I've finally put my finger down on a general direction I'd like to go in;

I would like to find some sort of career or vocation in politics, one of the guys working behind the scenes to spread awareness or lobby for popular change.  A speechwriter, a leafleteer, hell, the guy who brings the coffee (and makes an occasional quote of Chomskyan-significance.)  I have no ambitions to become a politician, but I feel the people who can make the most change are the ones who help push these guys into office from below; campaign managers, organizers, citizen activists etc.

 I feel like I have some potential talent as a writer, but the journalistic and literary fields are a bit depressed right now, and I've realized the sort of thing that might be the most practical way to use said talents is pressing for progressive change in local government.

**I want to support an honest politician or party in tangible way, but right now I have no idea of which direction to start educating myself.**  Some information relevant:

 - I'm 21 years old, minimally employed, living at home (the latter two would make eventual internship a possibility, as I could work for little/nothing and still get by)

 - no criminal record, High School graduate (with poor marks however, just slipped by)

 - no money saved, no assets to fall back on, leaning towards financial aid

Where can I start?  I live in southeastern Pennsylvania, and I think my first stepping stone would be the local community college, but I don't have any resources or knowledge about which step comes first.

And also; what courses might be relevant to this path?  Political sciences, sociology, psychology; the field of politics encompasses so many vistas, which one should I set my focus on?

**tl;dr**  This is essentially the same ""How do I enroll in college reddit?"" question, but I'm interested to see if there are any suggestions unique to my aspirations in the field of citizen government.  I will try to stick around as long as this thread is getting replies to help anyone who thinks they can help me =) thnx

The one story that I keep telling over and over was this incredible healthcare internship I had in Sierra Leone. While it wasn't quite near death, it was very close. Here's an excerpt from my essay:

""Living in the rural village of Jokibu, Sierra Leone was the most physically and emotionally demanding three months of my life. I ate the same two daily meals as the villagers. The little meat available was goat, monkey, and cuttingrass, which we had to slaughter ourselves. There were bats living in the bottom of the latrines, and spiders the size of my fist living in the hut. Malaria-bearing mosquitoes were ubiquitous; many infants contracted uncontrollable fevers. Thousands of army ants, capable of stripping an elephant to its bare bones in hours, poured across the bush paths. I contracted three large cysts (Furunculoid Myiasis) that contained larval Tumbu flies, and had only toothpaste to coax the worms out. Alone in the villages with only the three other interns, for the first time in my life I experienced being truly vulnerable.""

TL; DR - I had a tough time in Sierra Leone, but not quite near-death. Has anyone had a near-death experience? If so, what was it?
