a005h,12,2009-11-01,I'm not getting better,hadsomeharddays,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/a005h/im_not_getting_better/,"My depression stems from not having a job. Here's my situation:
I got a Masters degree two years ago and moved to a new city with my wonderful girlfriend, for her new job, which is awesome, if not terribly high-paying; I get domestic partner benefits, so that's great.
I couldn't find a job for a long time and got super depressed. I finally got an internship at a publishing house after looking for a year (and waiting tables and feeling awful about that), and have been working there since, but it's less than 20 hours a week and i make $8 an hour. I'm not advancing; it's terribly hard to do right now at this company, and I'm doing a terrible job advocating for myself.
I have to start looking again and I'm terrified. I also need to throw myself into freelance work, which I should be semi-qualified for by now, but again, I don't feel any confidence at all and I'm terrified.
I'm just so scared I can't do anything. I always thought I'd be somewhere, someone, by age 29. I just feel like such a loser.
Every time I get inspired to action, I get overwhelmed by all that needs to be done, and I don't want to get my hopes up too high. I just hate myself right now, and I... well, so that's me."
a0me0,5,2009-11-03,Dear Master's students of reddit: how much of your time is dedicated to actual research in your program?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/a0me0/dear_masters_students_of_reddit_how_much_of_your/,"I recently enrolled in a computer science MSc program only to realize slightly too late that the totality of the first two semesters is so loaded with courses that it doesn't leave any room for actual research. At first I thought I would be able to do research for a lab in my free time, but that hope was quickly squished by the course work load. The only research experience I'll get will basically be over the summer if I'm lucky enough to find an internship and during the thesis semester. 

This got me wondering: how bad is it elsewhere? It seems as though there is a stronger focus on research in North America, at least from what my friends who study there told me.

a0sk4,13,2009-11-04,"The reasons to stay alive continue to dwindle, now only outweighed by the amount of rage I would cause among those who care. ",[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/a0sk4/the_reasons_to_stay_alive_continue_to_dwindle_now/,"I am really hesitant to post this, in fact I've tried posting it 3-4 times in the last hour, but just couldn't bring myself to do it. I feel utterly powerless, completely alone,  and isolated from anything that matters. I'm not really sure I'm suicidal, but I've had suicidal thoughts [jumping in front of cars, overdosing, the ilk]. I'm just so depressed [I'm not even sure that's the right word]... and I don't have a clue what to do. I wouldn't normally pester Suicide Watch, but ask reddit didn't seem to be the appropriate place for this, and outside of Reddit, I don't think there are many places I could post this that would prove useful... Well Useful isn't even the right word, I guess Reddit's really the only community I feel safe telling this to. 

I'm a college student, I have been for 4 years now, By credits, I'm a senior, by class standards I still have 2 years to go [I transferred from my community college with an associates degree to the college I am currently attending]. In fact I have a class at 7:30 EST and I'm worried to death I'll miss it, but every time I try to go to sleep, I just end up crying. I feel even more terrible because while it was not the sole cause, I know what has pushed me to this point, and the person that reason is associated with doesn't deserve that, because they didn't do anything, it was just the last bit in a long line. How fucking sick is that, that 1 single stupid, trivial thing is enough to push me to write something as god awful as this. That the only way I even think I can come close to getting better is by telling thousands of anonymous strangers that I feel like shit, so they can pat me on the back and tell me it will be ok. 

Its frustrating, there is no magic, no gods, no Vishnu, no Shiva, No Jesus, nothing, absolutely nothing. All I've got is me, and me isn't looking to promising as a source of anything useful. People say you're supposed to make your own meaning in life, that you're supposed to create your reason for being. I'm having trouble finding a reason to live beyond ""If I die, others will be sad"". It's fucking terrible, to know that the only thing that keeps you from taking that final step, is the thought that it will just irritate others.

I'm the first one in my immediate family who has made it this far / this close to a bachelors degree. I've prided myself on never failing a class, I've never been an A or a B student, but I've always passed, and I've never been one to give up. But right now I just want to give up. The worst thing is I don't want this school to break me, that would be a failure beyond words, mostly because of how fucked up our post secondary education is, just a massive grab at money. Its just frustrating that a disgusting organization like that could even come close to beating me down so much. Its even more disgusting that we live in this world where you have to have a bachelors degree, all so you can just wind up some disgusting social slave in the system. 

They keep telling me ""Oh you can get an internship with X company"", and all I can fucking think is ""Oh look, slavery to a company, for a whopping 60k a year, great, I can live"". When the truth of the matter is, that in reality you're still not in control. Nothing you do is free, because the world is ruled by a bunch of assholes, and there is nothing we can do to change that, nothing. Every time a riot sparks up, they are destroyed, any attempt to change the world so that this slavery of the masses ends is put down. I crave that I'll turn on the news and September 11th will have happened again, if only to shake things up. How sick and twisted is that? 

And worst of all is everyone knows it, that the world is so fucking disgusting, and there is no one that's going to save it, there is no light at the end of the tunnel, it only gets worse. We prepare children so they can go work at some pointless job making enough to give them toys and keep them amused. 

I don't want to be beaten by this machine, I don't want to drop out of college, but its becoming to the point of almost impossible to justify remaining here. I put my self in debt 18k every year here, and I am running out of reasons to stay, and its just sickening because I got myself and my family into this mess. And now my family has to pay for it, because by putting myself here I sink them and myself into debt, that I'm not really sure I'll ever repay. 

On top of that, they say college is supposed to be the best years of your life, that your supposed to enjoy everything. But all I'm finding is that I'm isolated, I'm lonely, and I'm crying myself to sleep at night. And I dread telling my parents, I'm terrified that if they were to find out they'd want to get me out of here, but that's just letting this system beat me, and I don't want that. 

I can't change majors at this point, because I'm so far in that it would just be more time, more debt, and more money. I don't have any goals in life, and I have created anything that will make me of note in history. They say that you're never a failure in life, but every human being who was worth anything had always done something amazing when they were some kind of senior in undergrad, the most I've accomplished is creating a level 80 character in WoW. And you know the really stupid thing there? I told Reddit I put the game down, that I was never touching it again. And there I was in September picking it back up.

I can't even keep a fucking promise to myself. Add to this, I'm out of shape, I'm in what is supposed to be the easy major [C&amp;IT - Net] and I'm still doing terrible. This is supposed to be the major that CS students sleep through, and I struggle to get by. And what's worse, is computers are supposed to be the things that I'm good at =/. I don't know what in the world I'm supposed to do, my only worthwhile skill and I'm probably the last in the field at it. 

I don't know why I'm posting this, maybe I think by being an attention whore, that Some golden light will shine its way through, I really don't know.. 

I'm going to try and go to sleep again, so I can wake up and go back to lab in the morning, I'm sorry for ranting, or venting, or whatever, I guess thanks for reading =( "

I find it that my friends are in the same position. Aside from applying to countless companies and writing endless cover letters I'm out of ideas. I'm a young guy but working as an intern with no pay isn't an option for me since I do have financial responsibilities. It's *extremely* discouraging to spend thousands of dollars and years of hard work towards a degree without any noticeable benefit right now. I suppose it's because of the U.S. crippled economy. I have many friends with no education after high school making thousands more than me, they find it easy to refute my work towards a higher education with the aforementioned facts, and how can I blame them when its the truth?

I'm wondering if any of you redditors have been in this situation. How did you move forward or find opportunities?"

The problem is with my degree graduate school is the best option, but I have no motivation right now to do it.  I'd like to work or do an internship, but most of those seem to require a Master's in biology or an internship when still in college.  All the jobs I can do are too far away.  I'd have a car, but I always get discouraged from getting in.  I believe my mom thinks I'm going to die if I have a car.  My driving isn't the best. Everytime I wanted to go look at cars they would be ""busy"" or ""tired"" to go.   In reality, the car would give me confidence and make me feel control.  I've been sad since sophomore year and my friend just said to me that when I was motivated this summer that it was the first time she had seen the old me since freshman year.  idk what to do.  I want to be motivated and succeed, but I feel useless at the moment."
a2ilj,3,2009-11-09,I Had A Friend...we had a falling out and haven't really spoken in over 1.5 years. Last night he called and left a teary message begging to hang out. What should I do?,AmIABadPerson,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/a2ilj/i_had_a_friendwe_had_a_falling_out_and_havent/,"A little back story: He was my roommate in college Sophomore and Junior year (we haven't lived together/hung out since May or June of 2008), and in all honesty, at the time, my ""best friend"" in college. Now that doesn't mean he was a particularly good friend, but that fact didn't really became apparent until towards the end of the 2nd year of living together.
 
At times, he could be pretty selfish and act like a bad friend, but I wouldn't say he's a ""bad person"" (ironically, he would always try to help out homeless people, etc.). And I'm a pretty easy going/nice guy so, in general, we got along. But there were several times we got into verbal fights about things (sometimes he'd take things to far/hurt my feelings purposefully, it seemed) but then we'd make up. We had a particularly nasty fight at the end of Junior year and didn't talk that summer. Senior year, I got an internship working 3 days a week and the lifestyle of my first 3 years at college (doing drugs and bumming around/doing nothing with my free time) was a way of the past. But not for him (or at least that’s what it seems). I was also dealing with a lot of my own shit and was generally pretty busy. I ran into him maybe twice (if that, we went to school in a city) senior year but everyone once in awhile he'd call me to see what I was up to. Sometimes I'd answer/call back and say ""sure, let's do something"" but that wouldn't end up happening. A few months ago, he sent me an email at 4AM apologizing for everything and asking to hang out again. Despite knowing he was probably on painkillers (I've seen him write emails like this to other people while doing them), I responding saying that I appreciated the apology and that we should hang out. Again, it never happened.
 
So last night, after my GF broke up with me (oh cruel world!), he calls and I don't pick up because I was clearly not in the mood. He leaves a message and has that sound in his voice like he's trying not to cry. He says he's not mad that I've basically ignored him, but that this was the last time he'd reach out because he didn't see the point, but that he would really, really like to hang out ""even if it's just for an hour"". Idk, it sounds like there might be something wrong and I feel bad not doing something if he's in a bad spot. But at the same time, I really don't need him in my life, and it'll probably just be awkward and uncomfortable. But what should I do? Ask his now roomates/friends from high school (we're friends on facebook) if he's ok? Just ignore it? I dread running into him on the street (not likely but not impossible).
 
Honestly, it felt like we were dating and broke up or something and he's the weepy ex who wants to see me again. As a sidenote: he's gay, came out to me first and had fallen in love with one of our roommates sophomore year (we had 2 other roommates that year) and had subsequently acted quite cold towards him and that led to them having a similar separation.

a32nr,2,2009-11-10,"Salaries, Experience, and Potential.  What do I do?  What am I worth?",confuseddeveloper,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/a32nr/salaries_experience_and_potential_what_do_i_do/,"Hey guys,


Just a few things to start off with: 1) This is obviously a wall of text, but if you feel like hunkering down and helping a fellow redditor out, I'd greatly appreciate it.  Many thanks in advance. 2) This is a throwaway account because I know my cooworkers and employers read reddit and I'd rather not them know I wrote this.


First off, a little background.  Last May, I graduated from a prestigious private college with a BS in Computer Science (focus in software engineering) and a Minor in Social Science.  For the two previous summers before my graduation I had internships at two different multi-million dollar revenue per year companies and I know that I was one of the more experienced ( in terms of work ) graduates of my class.


Last January, I started working part time with a start-up company in my college's town with two of my classmates and friends.  Let's call this company greenStand.  I worked as a web developer mostly, but, like at many start-ups, all the employees wore many hats.  I was often charged with writing specification documents ( including database design ), server maintainence, graphic art ( for cutting up PSDs of websites to then build ), and requirements engineering ( meeting with clients to determine what they want from their software).  


A little more about the company:  We are essentially a web design and development firm and we specialize in e-commerce solutions (i.e. non-out-of-the-box, custom modifications to existing ecommerce packages).  We also do intranet software on occasion.  I work primarily in PHP, MySQL, HTML/CSS, JS, jQuery, and VB.NET for most of the intranet stuff.  When I was working part time with greenStand, I was expected to and enjoyed working late hours for ridiculous deadlines set by management.  I can say I enjoyed it because I was getting paid by the hour and I wasn't missing class at nights to be there making some extra bank.  The company consists of 8 people right now ( 1 CEO/Salesman, 1 COO, 1 CIO (my boss), 1 Salesman, 1 graphic artist, 1 Tech support, and 2 development people) and we enlist contractors often.  My boss, although a great coder, doesn't have a degree in CS or software engineering.


Just before graduation, I got an offer from greenStand to come on full time.  I would be lying if I said I didn't accept the offer at least a little out out laziness.  I was content at my job, comfortable with the people there ( two of which are my good friends) and with my role(s).  However, the offer was for $50,000/year salary, expected 40hrs/week, w/  50% benefits on medical, dental, and vision.  However, the average starting salary for graduates of my major from my school was $65,000/year.  I negotiated to $52,000/year and 1000 shares of stock in the company every year I stay there (however, they aren't public and, to be honest, I have no idea what the worth of these stocks are).  My bosses argued the point that if/when we grow, I'll have gotten in at the ground level and will be able to manage sooner than if I started entry level at another, larger company.  


Now it has been quite a few months.  I have been doing the working thing for a while.  All is well and good but I CANNOT for the life of me shake this feeling that I am getting screwed.  I hear of my classmates, with no real work experience, getting $56,000 and upwards and I immediately want to rush into my bosses office and demand more money.  The other important fact is that I feel like I am not learning enough ""big-picture"" skills.  Sure, I learn a few programming tricks a week, but I am not learning how to BUILD GOOD SOFTWARE.  I feel like I do not have a mentor like I have had at previous internships.  Deadlines are consistenly rushed and projects are unorganized and ad-hoc.  Coming from a traditional CS/Software Eng education, I cringe everytime I hear my boss say ""just make the changes on the live server, we need this out there now."" or I see my team not even interested in using version control software.  On the other hand, I am getting experience that I wouldn't necessarily get at an entry level position in a big company.  The work I do actually makes money, it is launched and ""works"" more than just proof of concept or ""busy work"" and this feels very good when compared to the dull labor of some internship experience.  I have also realized that myself and the other developer are the crux of profit.  Not to toot my own horn, but we are fast, good, and creative.  We solve problems for some clients who say they have tried X number of other firms who claimed either they couldn't do it or that it couldn't be done.  If we left the company, it would most certainly flounder for quite some time ( until they could find more quality developers ) or forever.


Reddit, I know this is really ambiguous request but I need advice.  I was hoping that maybe some people here would be able to share some experience.  I want to ask for a raise to $60,000/year.  This is still less than what I think I am worth but the tradeoff for the experience and potential for growth is more fitting then.  The thing is: I know they don't have the money.  At such a small startup, I am aware via grapevine and eavesdropping that we maintain with an average 5 thousand dollar in the bank every month, but I also know we are growing.  Work has been ridiculous the past 3 months and more and more contracts are signed daily.


Should I be concerned with what they can offer or just know what I think I deserve and if they can't give it to me, I have to look elsewhere.  Even writing that last sentence down makes me feel like I KNOW that's the answer and I am just looking for rationalization to stay in a comfort zone.  But then again, there are benefits to where I am working now ( to reiterate: working with good friends, good experience, growth potential, stocks).  My most recent plan was to hang around until my first set of stocks kicks in, then see what else is out there.  But every time I hear of another lesser-qualified classmate getting more money than I do, I feel like I deserve more, I know I do.  What should I do?  


Please ask me anything.  I know this is really ambiguous and incomplete but it would be quite difficult to elaborate on everything.  I'll try to clear up as much as possible.

Thanks again,
ConfusedDeveloper

The DJs where very impressed with us, and we regularly called in to make comments.  About a year later, my best friend and I moved to the town the radio station was in, and became interns for the show.  This lasted for about 4 years.

The show aired from 2-7 p.m. Monday through Friday.  It was a 100,000 watt FM radio station.  It would generally reach about 100 miles out from the station.  . We were not a Clear Channel station, so outside of this area we were unknown. Sadly, I don't have anything audio or pictures from the show to link here. But I have lots of stories.

Okay, so first I'll just basically sum up the context of the situation. Four years ago when I was 13 I went to a summer camp in Maine on the recommendation of my mom's friend, for three out of a maximum seven weeks. I loved it and decided to go back every year (which I have done thus far). I made a lot of friends there and generally the same crowd of people return each year (obviously with many not returning each year and many newcomers each year). The next year I met a guy my age who'd been going for many years but whom I hadn't met the previous year, and we became friends. The next year we were there at the same time again and of course we were still friends. The next year (2008), my age group's first year on staff as JCs (junior counsellors), he didn't return. However, his 13-year-old sister (we can call her ""Christine"") who had also been going to camp for many years recognised me as his friend (and she seemed kinda sorta familiar to me so I must have seen her around in previous years), and we started talking and hanging out a fair amount (not like super super close, but casual friends; we'd sit down and talk once in a while, we'd hug whenever we saw each other, she'd frequently tell me she loves me and I'd playfully reply ""I love me too"", and as per her request I gave her one of my name tags, but I digress). Anyway, Christine and I became friends, and after camp we kept in touch via AIM and Facebook (we talked on AIM a fair amount in August, and from there talked at least once or twice every couple months; aside: she would initiate every conversation). I would also occasionally Gimp pictures of her at her request, putting Brian Peppers into the background of all of them just to freak her out (which worked *thoroughly* well, by the way). In April I gave her my phone number.

Now, fast forward to this past summer. I'm 17. Christine's 14. It's precamp (late June). Christine texts me, but I don't recognise her number so I have my friend call her, curse her out, and threaten to kill her. She and I eventually talk on the phone for real a few days later while I'm doing laundry and I find out who she is. Summary of the next couple weeks: Christine and I text each other a fair amount until she arrives; camp starts on June 28; I get arrested on July 2; I wrestle a girl in chocolate pudding on July 4; Christine arrives on July 19 (for the last four weeks of camp). Christine and I immediately got close again, and hung out all the time from the first day she arrived. We became a lot closer than the last year, to the point where people would always ask us if we were dating (to this we would each randomly choose yes or no; sometimes we both said yes, sometimes we both said no, and sometimes our answers were conflicting). We were pretty much always together whenever we could be and she was always physically clinging to me. Eventually, I started picking up on this unexplainable chemistry Christine and I had, and while I always knew she was hot, I actually started to see her that way; before I knew it I was returning her ""I love you""s. I also thought she smelled good, but that's irrelevant. Anyway, we became a lot closer than we'd even been before. She would also occasionally give me some sort of memento of her love like a napkin she drew and wrote all over or a bracelet. Last few days of camp: during the last dance we snuggled together and listened to her iPod, and planned on going in and slow dancing for the last ""With or Without You"", but she was afraid of the owner breaking us up so we didn't; her mom and her brother (whom I hung out with for a while) came to visit the last day of camp; during the last night before she had to go to her cabin we held each other very tightly as she cried hysterically and screamed ""**Don't leave me!**""; when she was about to leave the next day we hugged tightly for a long time, then she clung to me like normal as I walked her over to her mom, who asked on the way to the car if we were allowed to be that close with each other (we weren't :P), to which Christine replied ""**He's my husband!**"", eliciting a dismissing laugh. After Christine was gone I felt a sharp pang of loneliness that persisted until the end of postcamp, though talking to her on the phone and AIM helped cheer me up a lot.

Also, before she left Christine gave me the most adorable card.

&gt;""I think Rick is hot too!"" *(inside joke)*

half the time.)

Christine

Second day back from postcamp, and I'm starting a new internship (huge step down from being a junior director, considering there was basically no work for me to do). My and Christine's mutual friend Emma and I are talking on AIM (she's 17, but was still a camper). That's when a ton of shit starts coming out. tl;dw of the next few months: it turns out Christine's life is *really* fucked up; she and I talk at least once per day on AIM, texting, and phone; we both miss each other *a lot*; I buy her a dozen roses; we plan on me visiting her for Labour Day weekend with a small fraction of my camp salary but my mom decides to be a bitch and stop me; we plan on me visiting her for spring break; we discuss sex on several occasions in a semi-jocular manner; we cam a few times; starting in mid-September there's some sort of drama every once in a while where she'll get really pissed over something small or literally nothing and push me away then get over it eventually.

Anyway, the big tl;dw of the post and the point I've been leading up to; I sent the following email to Christine's parents on the night of Halloween:

&gt;**Subject: This is Christine's friend from camp. I know she'll hate me for sending you this, but I'm really worried about her.**

&gt;Dear Mr. and Mrs. XXX,

&gt;Below are Christine's most recent posts on one of her blogs. Out of concern for her well-being, I've been paying close attention to her blogs ever since I found out about them from our mutual friend Emma; the things she writes are generally very candid and depressing. Taking these most recent posts into account, I'm really worried that she might try to kill or otherwise hurt herself, so despite the invasion of her privacy here I feel obligated to bring the severity of this problem to your attention, if it hasn't been already. From my understanding, you never found out about this (though I may be mistaken), but Christine did attempt to kill herself a while back (I'm not sure exactly when), so the things she's writing here are very serious and likely reflect her true intent.

&gt;As long as I'm telling you all this, I may as well let you know everything I've thought you should know about for a while now. First of all, according to Emma (the aforementioned mutual friend), about a year or so ago, a guy who currently goes to Christine's school tried to rape her (thankfully she was able to get away), and then blackmailed her not to tell anyone about it; I'd personally like nothing more than for him to be forced to apologise to her for what he put her through and thrown in prison. Second, since Christine got home from camp she's been smoking cigarettes as a way to try and ""escape"" her problems; some of our friends told me about how easy it is to get addicted when you're depressed, but she just refused to talk to me for two weeks when I tried to get her to stop. And, as you'll see an allusion to below, she apparently used to be anorexic.

&gt;I really think she needs to see a psychiatrist. I don't know how you or Christine would feel about her having to take pills for the rest of her life, but I know how a lot of antidepressants work, and, depending on the exact neurological causes of her depression, medication is probably the best thing for her (at worst, it's better than her attempted self-medication of cigarettes). I know she has gone to see a therapist, but, while I am not a doctor, it's clear to me that her symptoms are indicative of much more than just typical teenage moodiness, and need to be treated by a trained psychiatric professional as such; this isn't something that will just go away on its own, and it definitely should not be ignored.

&gt;I understand how hard all of this is to deal with, but Christine needs your love and support right now, as well as rational and decisive action on your part. I can't say whether or not directly confronting her about any of this would help her, but whatever you do, please at least keep all of this in mind. It might be best at least initially to not let on that you ever received this email or read her blogs, as she probably wouldn't take it well. I've read about parents of girls in similar situations just throwing them in mental institutions, and all it did was make them more miserable, so I'd also like to warn against such drastic ideas in advance. Maybe you could just think everything over for a few days while keeping a closer eye on her than usual; I honestly don't know exactly how this situation should be approached, as far as getting her to go see a psychiatrist goes (though I do believe that she would go willingly).

&gt;I've also discussed all this with my school guidance counsellor XXX, as he is a professional and has a lot of experience in handling these types of situations. He's going to contact the XXX High School guidance office about Christine on Monday. His email address is XXX.

&gt;Please reply to let me know you received my email and that I have the correct email addresses (I got them off one of the camp Gmail accounts). Thanks.

This might come across as a bit of a sob story but i seriously need advice.

Out of highschool, I was the typical whiz kid. Smart, but very very cocky about it and didn't put the work in that I should have. I got into a very illustrious school despite my lack of effort. That didn't change when I got to school, and I realized that maybe I just wasn't that into what I was learning. Either way I basically pissed that opportunity away after 2 years. The one good thing that came of it (in terms of careers and all that) was I found a great internship with an awesome company and excelled at what I did. My boss there loved me and said he'd hire me full-time in a heartbeat. About 8 months ago he says he has a job for me but it needs to go through some red tape, so I decide to leave school A, do another internship with this boss, and hopefully walk away with a job after it. Wow everybody again, but this company still had a hiring freeze on, so I got a new internship for another 4 months in the development department (which I hate). I tried to get back into a school here in town, but they say since I did poorly at the first school, I couldn't get in. I figure that's not a problem, hiring freeze has been lifted. I start talking to some people in my old department, and turns out they just hired 3 new people, so I think ""Great, freeze has been lifted"". I contact that boss and it turns out he doesn't have a spot for me, and has basically fucked me. I now realize he was jerking me around so that I would keep going back, and was being held in his back pocket, and all the fancy promises were garbage. Now I'm stuck with a month and a half left in dev, no school, 23k in student loans and no idea what to do next. I would love to go to culinary school, but that would be ridiculously expensive. I can't tell my parents until I have a plan and I have no idea what to do. My dad was crushed when I left the first school ( he never went to university, so it was real important I went, ala Tyler Durden). Any advice is helpful, I'm seriously at a loss.

tl;dr: Dropped out of school for a job that was promised and never delivered, can't get into different school due to poor performance at first school, want to go to culinary school but can't afford it, world unraveling."

My parents tried to have a few more kids but they ended in miscarriage probably because my mom smokes like a chimmney and did massive amounts of cocaine. I've had a few moments in my life where I've had friends but they never last long. I'm nice and friendly but I have problems communicating, making eye contact, and knowing other's intentions. I'm usually the one to push people away. Elementary school was a breeze, I had a high reading level, participated in math and science teams. Middle school was nothing but fights, drugs, and everything was the proverbial end of the world. Grades started falling drastically. When I was 13 my mom made me see a therapist because she thought there's something wrong with me but prozac should make everything all better. After talking to me for a few weeks and then talking to my mom, the therapist told me there's nothing wrong with me and if anything my mom is the one with problems because she's upset that I'm not the thin beautiful girl that she was.    
High school was a little better but grades didn't improve much. My hobbies have always been music and sewing. I had to give up music when my instrument broke sophmore year and I couldn't afford a new one. So when senior year approched and my 17 year old self had to decide what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, I chose fashion design (like omgz lol). Yeah, I love sewing and making things that you can't buy in stores but I chose it mainly so I didn't have to go to community college with everyone I've grown to hate.    
So I go through my first year of fashion school with decent grades. Then my grandparents, who I've lived with my entire life, fall ill and it's cancer. My grandpa would be crying and screaming in pain when he wasn't on morphine. I couldn't sleep and my grades were in the crapper. He died that same semester and I ended up having to take most of my classes over. I couldn't take internships because I had a lot of reponsibilities at home with my grandma ill; besides, I couldn't get an intership with my low grades.     
So I barely get my diploma and take a few months off. I end up working for my dad, which I highly don't reccommend and quit after a few months. I used most of my money to buy musical instruments. I'd make a few bucks by making clothes but one day I have an accident - a roll of manilla pattern paper fell on my foot. My parents said that if it's broken then it will heal on it's own. It never did, it's still broken. I really like making music but most people and I feel it's a waste of time so I sold all my musical instruments and use this money to move out with a friend. Soon after moving I find a job working in a fabric store. After a year, I quit because standing on my broken foot for 40+ hours a week made me suicidal. 8 months later I'm still unemployed. I feel completely worthless and unqualified for any job. I'd like to go back to school and study something practical but I don't have the money and I feel like I would just screw up like every other time. I would try to make some clothes to sell but I feel like everything I make is shit and I can't do anything right. I have no idea how I'm going to pay for rent in a few days.    
My room mate use to be my friend but everytime I do something wrong or act slightly strange he points it out and makes fun of me. This makes me sad then he gets mad. For example, this morning he helped me load some bags of glass bottels in my car to go recycle. He has a bunch of crap in my trunk so I start to take it out and put it on the ground but he said ""NO!"" so I put it back in the trunk. Then he gets impatient and says ""I want to put the bags on the floor of the trunk!"" I look at him puzzeled then he says ""Put this stuff in the back seat!"" I felt worse than an idiot because even an idiot should have known to do that. I sigh because I hate being so dumb then He starts saying ""OH I'M SUUUUCH A JERK, HOW COULD I DO THAT TO YOOOOU?! WHAT AN ASSHOLE I AM."" Since then, I locked myself in my room with nothing to eat or drink. Things like this happen everyday with him. I'm horrible at communicating so I can't explain to him how this makes me feel. I've tried before but he just said I'm delusional. This adds a great deal to my sense of self worthlessness.    
I've tried hanging myself twice this year but I'm a complete failure and ended up just strangeling for a while before giving up. I've come up with a new plan to take a bunch of muscle relaxers and whatever else I can get my hands on then tape some plastic bags over my head. I'm unemployable, lonely, possibly retarded, and probably the fattest and ugliest girl in Hollywood.        
**TL;DR:** Always had problems communicating. Did well in school as a kid but grades fell starting in middle school. Dying grandparents kept me from doing well in ""college"" and getting internships. Self-loathing and broken foot keeping me from employment. I think I'm retarded and I want to die."

Think of this as a list of red flags for beginning programmers to check against their ignorance of programming practices and paradigms.

a7vr6,3,2009-11-24,Scrubs fans: What are your thoughts on Season 9 coming up?,roastedbagel,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/a7vr6/scrubs_fans_what_are_your_thoughts_on_season_9/,"So to the people who do not watch Scrubs regularly or know what's up, I'll give it to you in a nutshell. 

Scrubs previous season was it's 8th, and was written as if it were it's last. The show got picked up for another season, literally at the last minute, however, the final episode last season was really like a series finale. (Mind you, by far the most moving episode on all of TV I've ever seen, I cried. Literally cried the last 4 minutes during the video montage [Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiJGk3Rzbvs&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=3CD2AC73B8774710&amp;playnext=1&amp;playnext_from=PL&amp;index=7)) This can likely be attributed to the fact that I had been watching Scrubs since day one, and watched it probably more than a normal person should, I was/am very attached to the show and it's characters, which is unlike me because I don't really watch too much tv to say the least.

So, basically there are many people I've found out that are genuinely upset they are coming back for another season, stating it ruined the last episode of season 8, vowing to never watch another episode again, etc. etc. 

Personally I'm thrilled it's back on. Granted the ""ending"" scene was better than I could have ever expected. All throughout Season 8 I was wondering how they'll end it, and honestly didn't think it could end as good as I had hoped, and they exceeded my expectations. It was awesome. I loved everything about it, JD and Turk still being as close as they are, Dr. Cox's relationship with them, JD and Elliott together. Loved it all. (Understandably it's not exactly what truly did happen, but as JD put it, ""it could be anything you wanted it to be"")

So I wanted to know how fellow redditors here feel about it? Also as you may or may not know, but it's now going to be focused on the ""new wave of interns"", and really I'm excited about this.

I tried having a discussion over on tv.com but unfortunately the comments there are a rift between digg and youtube. "

My school has some resources but I'd want to go through other routes besides them. Plus I'm on break right now and this would result in a faster response. 

I'm an average student trying to stand out against the shining beacon of my university's engineering program. Anyone have some guidance?"

a92vs,0,2009-11-28,Dear Reddit: Im a CS undergrad student at one of the top US CS colleges and I need help coping ...,shy_guy_needs_help,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/a92vs/dear_reddit_im_a_cs_undergrad_student_at_one_of/,"I am originally from a shitty third world country and was accepted to one of my dream schools for computer science, one of the best in the US. In high school I was always the top performer, teachers favorite, student body president, started a company et al. I had (and still do) high hopes from my journey at doing what I like at the best place I could be for it. My plan, when I entered college, was to later go for a PhD and further my career into academia or industry and slowly pay off my loans. 

After spending 2.5 years here (I'm graduating in June 2011), I, at the moment, have barely a 3.2 GPA, a decent bit of research experience in the fields I like and no internships (I spent summers doing research). I did a calculation and it seems I won't be able to hit the 3.5 mark at all, over the next 1.5 years. From my understanding, that is too low to even apply to PhD programs, or even Masters programs. This isn't even competitive for getting hired at a good tech company. I did not foresee myself in this situation and I don't know what to do. I feel like a huge failure but I know I'm smarter than what my credentials portray. It pains and disappoints me because I love research, I love academia and I know I can do it and I have wanted to do it since I was a kid. I understand the material but my grades don't reflect it. I play around with theoretical concepts, I talk to random people about them, but my grades don't seem to agree.

What do I do? Do I have a future? If not higher education, am I still competitive in the job market? How can I make the best use of my remaining time at college so that I can look back and not feel a crunch in my stomach.

Thanks..."
a957m,8,2009-11-29,Stuck,deliciouscupcakesplz,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/a957m/stuck/,"So I am not really sure what to expect from this, any advice would be good.  First off I'm not suicidal, really, I wouldn't even say I was depressed or even sad (and I believe me I have known depression).  My main problem is that despite my life being neither great nor unbearable, I just feel completely stuck and devoid of any hope for an improvement.

I graduated college last year, after struggling with fairly severe depression, (took several years off over the course of it).  Ended up discovering that quitting drinking (alcohol and caffeine) and finding a sleeping medicine that actually worked (off label prescription yay) ended up fixing some sleep problems which were kind of at the core of issues.  So I wouldn't say that I was depressed anymore, instead now I just feel, numb?  It is like I don't want anything, don't have any real goals or desires which I feel are both worth obtaining and are obtainable.  In short I feel stuck.

  I graduated in physics, hated it, and went looking for a job as a programmer to basically find that I didn't have the experience to get anything really.  I have been debating doing grad school, or going back and taking some more CS classes, (I am currently taking a grad CS class just to beef up my background), but the idea of spending the next 2-5 years of my life flagellating myself just for the chance of starting my life makes me nauseated.

The job market is kind of shit, and I have no non-academic experience to draw upon, so I am pretty much out gunned in the job search by all of the normal CS/SE grads (looking for programming type jobs).  Internships are generally off limits to me now, even though I would be totally willing to work for free just for experience.  So basically I feel like I am at a career dead end.

Relationship wise I feel totally screwed just because it so hard for me to feel attached to people and meeting people who I am actually attracted too is somewhat tough (gay dating is hard) (conversely I have almost no interest in sex).  Of the guys I have had emotions nearing anything like love I would say they were all really close straight male friends, I am pretty wary about any sort of friendship with straight guys now.

Socially I have become a recluse, it just sort of happened, and I'm making a renewed effort now to make friends with people but I am not really getting my hopes up for a couple of reasons.  First off my attempts at making gay friends seems to wind up in me hurting other people and just bad stuff.  I don't get along with straight guys, and I don't really even have any female friends right now.  Granted I just moved to a new town and I've been making a lot of effort to meet people but it's not been so great so far.  

I feel totally empty, in that I feel my life has been devoted so much to pleasing other people so far that I am just totally lost in figuring out what I want or even who I am.  I am pretty easily swayed by other people which makes the whole social living aspect pretty difficult, balancing some interaction while at the same time maintaining a sense of who I am is very hard.  I am both dreadfully lonely and isolated and at the same time craving isolation and independence. 

I don't even know where this is going at this point, I just feel stuck and really just lacking any sort of hope / ability to change my life / potential for happiness.

I guess I would appreciate feedback or just any sort of talk about things."
a99w8,11,2009-11-29,Everything just keeps hurting,DGrlIT,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/a99w8/everything_just_keeps_hurting/,"I'm 20.
I have been deeply in love with the same guy for over 3 years now. We have been good friends, had something that might be called a relationship. We did all the intemate things there are in a relationship accept for penetration, wich is why I'm still a virgin (circular logic there).
I've always been that odd kid parents get frustrated with. I'm dyslectic and slightly autistic so even though I'm quit smart but I was lagging behind in some classes beceause of reading difficulty and excelling it others. This made my dad so frustrated that he would yell at me and call me an underacheaver that didn't use all HP (horsepower) that was given to me. I liked secondary school for the biology/history/chemistry/fysics/math (aspecialy math &lt;3) classes. But the language courses I had to follow (German, French and English) were really touch. Being an perfectionist didn't help preventing me from failing that. But I always just didn't fit in with classmates. They were from a different planet where ok schoolresults were ok and were interest lay in unimportent things like clothes and make-up. I must have come accross quit bitchy at the time. It is hard to not feel supperior if you put in more time than anyone into school and are basicly the lively version of Hermiony Granger.
But than 3 years ago I went to college to study Electronic engeneering. it wasn't my thing, but I met this guy. He also wants to know all there is to know about the world. He also has a strong oppinion about things and we talked for hours. He was one of the few that wasn't total afraid-of-the-sun smelly kind of geek that there were so many of wich were at that department. And he had great social skills and a lot of friends. He always said he didn't want a relationship with me, but things happened. Now i'm here 3 years later. I'm still madly in love with him, wich is something he finds highly anoying of me. He has gotten a girlfriend over the summer. I don't understand why he finds this girl interesting. He is doing a double major, she doesn't even go to college. I don't want to give up on him. I've got a lot of energy invested in him and the guys I meet just aren't more interesting. (I study in IT, I'm pritty mutch the only girl I meet on a daily bases) I can trust him with all my weardness. I love him so mutch more than I love myself. That love is beautiful even thoug I know it's eating away at me. It doesn't help that my dad still thinks I'm a total loser for lacking social skills. I worked hard in school to take that point of disapointment away. I all just feels like I didn't put enough effort into winning him over. 
These past few weeks I've been coming home from my internship trying not to think about ways I could end feeling miserable."
