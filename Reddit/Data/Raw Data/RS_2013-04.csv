My brother offered me his couch, but he's got a roommate also and I'd kind of prefer my own space if I can find the right deal.

Ideally i'm looking for something in west Raleigh from mid-May to mid-August. I don't wanna lug furniture out there for 3 months so furnished is definitely preferred. If it's just missing a bed, I could probably figure something out. 

I don't have any friends out in Raleigh and so you don't have to worry about me being rambunctious. On the weekends i'll probably be exploring the town and enjoying my time in a new place. I'm interested in basketball, snowboarding, video games, and the internet. 

Any feedback is appreciated!"
1bgq1c,1,2013-04-01,"I'm 17 and a career in finance has been my dream for a while now, can I ask you guys some questions?",[deleted],FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/1bgq1c/im_17_and_a_career_in_finance_has_been_my_dream/,"Pretty much all in the title. I live in England so things may be slightly different to the US, but I doubt that it's anything really significant. I'm in year 12 (11th grade), and got the whole university applications coming up in about 6 months, so I need to nail down everything now and get sorted.

So, here are my questions:

* **What degree would be best to do?** - I'm intending to apply to various courses. Economics, economics &amp; finance or PPE depending on what universities. But I've also been told I should apply for history because I am really good at it. I had never really considered it though, because I assumed it would hinder my chances of getting into the finance sector. Is that true?
* **What extra curricula things should I be doing?** - By this I mean, just in my free time or at school. I'm currently on the board of the school's Young Enterprise company, and also I regularly attend the political economy society. I follow the stock markets and have had accounts on various stock simulators but recently haven't been doing that due to lack of time. 
* **Work experience - what do I need to have done, where, and how can I go about making it happen? (Links appreciated)** - I did a few days work experience at HSBC but it wasn't as much as I'd have liked. I've been looking around for work experience at various investment banks, but it all seems to be internships for undergrads. Is there any available for people like me? 
* **Can anyone explain in a bit more detail the main jobs in the finance sector?** - I have a rough idea of what an investment banker, stock broker, etc. does, but I think it's good to know in more detail what they do so I am prepared for any work experience interviews, as well as generally being able to decide exactly what I want to go into.
* **Finally - any other tips?** - I am 100% serious about going into the finance sector and I want to make sure I do everything I can to get into it when I get there.

Just a little bit more info: I'm currently studying economics, history, maths &amp; physics at AS level, and I'm dropping physics for A2. A few people have told me to take further maths, but my school won't allow me to (not because I'm not good enough, but because of timetabling issues). 

Thanks in advance, all responses will be appreciated!"
1bgpmf,0,2013-04-01,Considering switching out of engineering. Rough idea of where to go next. Help please?,PrinceRhaegar,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1bgpmf/considering_switching_out_of_engineering_rough/,"I'm a second semester sophomore EE major, and for this past semester, it seems like with each lecture I go to in my engineering courses (Electric Circuit Theory, Mechanics I, and Intro to Logic Design), the more and more I think to myself ""Wow.  I really fucking hate all of this and wish I was somewhere else right now.""  Not a good sign.  The biggest problem is that since I'm already half way through with my degree, if I switch now my major's set in stone, so I'm a little hesitant.  Another problem is that most of the other fields that I'm interested in (music and film) aren't exactly lucrative, and after spending $100,000 on a college education I don't want to get a bullshit degree that'll likely only leave me the option of working in a restaurant come graduation.  I would go for other sciences that interest me, like math or neuroscience, but I really have no intention of going to grad school and the unfortunate reality is that a bachelor's degree in either of those fields isn't going to give you shit (as far as I know so correct me if I'm wrong).

A friend of mine's been going through a similar situation, and we both have a rough idea of what to do next, but I'd appreciate any advice I can get before making a decision as life altering as this.  My school also has a school of communications that offers degrees in general communications, journalism, and film &amp; TV.  I'm considering switching to something like that, but what's holding me back the most is the fact that communications has a rep for being a useless major.  My friend said that if I do something like that and do a minor in engineering (which I'd only have to take like 2 more engineering courses to finish), I'd be specialized and if I do a couple internships that I'd still be able to find a job working for a technical company even if I wouldn't technically be an engineer.  But do jobs like that even exist?  Would anyone even look at the fact that I have a minor in engineering and can program in 3 different languages or would they only see the communications degree and base everything off that?  What sort of career options are there?  And if all else fails what else could I go for that wouldn't leave me in massive amounts of debt?  Comp Sci maybe?

Apologies in advance if I came across as a bit of a dick so far.  I have 2 exams this week, not feeling confident about either of them, and combining that with the stress of having no idea what I want to do with my life, I hope that my sounding a little irritable is at least somewhat understandable.  Thanks for any advice you can give, sincerely."

Ever since I graduated college, I've had a very hard time finding work (I'm sure that doesn't sound familiar at all!). So, I'm looking for some advice specific to my situation. I did some searching in the forum, but couldn't find any posts very similar to my situation, so I apologize if anyone else similar to me has previously asked these questions and had them answered.

Basically, here's the story:

I graduated NYU's Stern School of Business with a B.S. in Actuarial Science. I had a hell of a hard time in college due to a very abusive and unhealthy relationship, and as a result I messed up really tremendously badly and graduated with a 2.5 GPA, no internships, no VEEs, and only Exam P passed.  I graduated in May of 2011. I've spent the past two years back in my hometown licking my wounds, so to speak, and for about 9 months I've been working as a Financial Analyst for an insurance company.

Right now my job is basically just excel data manipulation and report making to provide information that the executives need to make decisions. I would say I have a pretty great grasp of Excel, aside from macros.

My question is really just how do I continue from here? I've applied to thousands of entry level actuary jobs and I had 1 interview and didn't get the job.  My current thinking is that I need to show employers that I actually know the material, so I'm currently studying for FM. 

Should I do the online courses for VEEs? What software besides excel should I be proficient in? Should I apply to internships instead of full time positions?

I am really thankful to any of you who are reading through all of this, and any advice anyone has to offer I greatly appreciate!

tl;dr: really messed up my college career with a 2.5gpa, no vees, but did pass exam P, working currently as a financial anaylst for a title insurance company doing excel data manipulation. Also studying for FM. should I tackle the VEEs? should I apply for internships instead of full time positions? How do I break into the field with my situation?"
1bfvxb,5,2013-04-01,How to choose a nursing school?,dontmovedontmoveahhh,nursing,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1bfvxb/how_to_choose_a_nursing_school/,"I live in Florida, there are 10 state universities here that offer nursing in addition to  numerous ADN programs. I applied to 4 universities as well as my community college program and so far I've been accepted or waitlisted to multiple programs (haven't heard back from all of then yet). Considering how competitive it is, (over 700 applicants for 40 spots) I wasn't expecting to have so many choices. My local community college has an exceptional program and everyone has tried to convince me it is the way to go and I'm guaranteed to get hired right away and the hospital will pay for my BSN, however I don't plan to stay in Florida forever and plan on going to grad school, I want to choose the best program with opportunities and name recognition.  In my previous major, the rankings were clear cut and there was a lot of emphasis on choosing the right program, I have heard this isn't the case with nursing, but I've also heard that GPA doesn't matter (which doesn't apply to me since I definitely want to get an MSN, not to mention internship opportunities and residencies). The only guidance I've been able to find has been from those who are unfamiliar with my areas of interest and have very different goals then me, I would love mentorship and guidance (no one else in my family or friends even works in the healthcare field) and have no idea how to go about finding it.


All the programs seem very strong and have good NCLEX pass rates but I wonder how they'll be viewed by potential employers. Will a BSN from one state university be seen as equivalent to another? It seems like a lot of the newer universities that don't have a reputation as being very strong overall are know for good nursing programs, but I can't help but wonder how much of that reputation is regional. Is it better to go to the biggest, highest ranked school I get into for the name recognition and reputation. Is a smaller program better or a larger one?


I know I'm lucky to have so many great options, I don't have a strong preference between one or the other and am tempted to choose the one with the earliest start date. At the same time, I know the job market isn't great for new grads and I don't want to handicap myself. What should I prioritize when making this decision? 

Also, I'm pretty sure I will be offered a hospital scholarship. It's not my first choice, but is it stupid to turn down guaranteed employment as a new grad? "

I have been looking for clues in the email I received, trying to read between the lines and assess how formal I should be, but I'm not certain.  It doesn't help that being Berkeley, sometimes things tend toward the more informal.  Here is the email I received from the museum:

Wow, this is a late birth story...",AfterTowns,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1bfe3o/miranda_jane_born_january_27th_wow_this_is_a_late/,"This little munchkin was born on a Sunday morning after a pretty delightful labour.  I'm not even joking. Sorry for the wall of text!  

Friday (Jan 25) was a very silly day.  We had been given a gift card from hubs parents to buy a washer and dryer as a Christmas present.  Sears had delivered the dryer the week before, but there was no washer to be found and our old ones had already been sold.  So, I spent most of Friday doing laundry at my parents' house.  My cat was also throwing up a lot and I'd made a vet appointment for him that afternoon.  We were *also* picking up a futon that day (can anyone say 'nesting'?) as my parents had given us money for Christmas instead of presents.  So, what happens that afternoon, just as I'm leaving my parents' house to pick up the cat?  My water breaks.  Awesome.  Actually, I peed, stood up and kept peeing (something that had started happening in the last week or so and I was used to by now) I hoped it would stop in a second, like it had before, but either way I had a panty liner on and was in a rush, so out the door I went.  I took my dad's truck and as I'm driving down the freeway, I fart (you guys are getting all the details!) and a BIG gush of water soaks my jeans.  Thankfully it didn't get on the upholstery.  So, I get home, call the vet, tell them I'll be late and change my pants putting on a much heavier pad and throwing the cat in the truck.  

Turns out the cat is fine.  He was allergic to the antibiotics given to him and the vet just tells me since there was only a day or two left, to just stop the antibiotics.  Okay, cool.  Time to pick up husband and futon.  I text my doula and tell her what's going on and she confirms that those were almost definitely my water breaking and that I should take it easy.  Cool.  So, with angry cat and slushee in hand, I text my husband, telling him my water broke.  He's a little annoyed, as am I.  This is the wrong day for waters to break!  We've got too much shit to do!  

Pick up the futon and we're helped by first-day-in-the-warehouse guy.  It takes him upwards of 45 minutes to find the futon. We get home an hour after hubs gets off work.  He runs out to the store and grabs all sorts of deli foods for labour and when he gets home, we finally both smile and relax. 

 Friday night; my contractions started around the time warehouse guy got lost looking for our futon, a couple hours after my water broke.  We both go to bed and I sleep as much as I can, getting up every couple hours to have a really hot shower, do some stretching, and get some water on my back.  I think I had about 5 showers from 10pm - 8am.  

Saturday morning, I text my SIL who is also a chiropractor who specializes in prenatal patients.  She tells us to come by after clinic hours and she adjusts me and talks about the wonder of life and birth and all that.  I'm not a sappy person but I smile because, to be honest, labouring is kind of awesome and I'm just feeling so excited and good at that point. We stop by my parents' house because I'd left my keys there and they invite us in for lunch, but we don't want to let on that I'm in labour, so we tell them we've already had lunch and are in a rush.  

We head off to the mall because I want to walk through my contractions but it's Canada and January so inside the mall it is.  I have a MASSIVE burrito and it tastes awesome.  We both talk about feeling like it's our honeymoon all over again and we end up going to the grocery store in the mall and buying more deli food.  My contractions are starting to pick up and we get stuck behind this very annoyed woman in line who insists all her food that's just been rung through needs to be switched to the customer service desk because she can't reach the debit machine.  I remember leaning over the counter having a contraction while she's bitching out the manager and just thinking, ""Man, I never used my pregnancy to get special treatment.  Maybe I should do that now?  Nah.."" I was seriously on a labour high at that point.

So, we get back home and labour is still going, but slowly.  We hang out while I have contractions and around 9 pm, SIL comes over again to adjust me.  Hubs says that after she leaves, he'll take the dog for a run since things seem to be going pretty slowly still.  Cool.  Little do either of us know, but she's triggered some points on me that significantly kick my labour into high gear. The feeling of her adjusting me was crazy.  I could actually feel the baby's head 'clunking' lower into my pelvis.   I go back to bed after she leaves and wake up at 10:15 with DELIGHTFUL contractions.  I text hubs from bed to find out where he was.  He was still running the dog and had his phone turned off.  

He gets back and we decide bed is the best place to labour.  I lay down and he sits beside me on the floor.  Every 10 minutes, I wake up with a good contraction and he does some hip squeezes.  If your birth coach doesn't know these, make sure they know them.  They were great.  I start talking about going to the hospital and labouring in one of their massive bathtubs.  We text the doula some more, but we're doing well on our own so it's only when I mention that yes, I'm ready to go to the hospital and we'll meet her there that she tells us to wait and she'll come meet us at the house.  

She gets there 2:30 am and I'm half naked, laying in bed and moaning from the contractions.  I get a thought that ""Hey, I must be in transition because I've lost my modesty!  I'm almost done!"" but don't worry too much about that and instead tell everyone I want to puke.  We only stick around at home for a little while longer and at 3:12 (I checked) we leave the house for the hospital while I'm yelling my fool head off.  

We get to the hospital and I go straight to the head of the line.  Finally, I get to take advantage of this preggo stuff, but I'm too far gone to care by now.  We get to assessment and I have 5 fucking people ask me the same 4 fucking questions time after time.  I start gutterally yelling at one poor intern who starts asking me the same questions while I'm having a contraction.  He leaves after the third question is shouted down and we never see him again.  (Ha!) When I'm finally given a cervix check, after telling them that I have an urge to push and them telling me that I'm not 'allowed' to push and then my body trying to push anyways a few times while I'm on my side, they tell me that the baby has lots of hair and that I'm ""9+ cms dilated.""

So, off to the delivery room I go!  By the time I'm up on the table, I'm 10 cms and ready to push.  I get two contractions where I push a couple times each and after the second, the doctor tells me that the baby's heart rate is going a little slow and that if I don't push her out on the next contraction, she'll have to ""help"" me.  I know what that means and I don't want an epesiotomy, forceps or vaccuum extraction.  The time between the second and third contraction, the room has so many people in it, but it's very quiet and I stare at the ceiling and thank whatever power is letting me have a break from the contractions.  It was actually a really powerful and serene moment and I felt close to something.  I don't want to say God because I'm an atheist, but it was something powerful.  Anyways, I just want to say ""I'm sorry"" to all you ladies who have to labour under pitocin because I've heard that you don't get breaks from your contractions and I can't imagine going through that.  It sounds like hell.  

The third contraction I pushed her out (the only push that hurt because they encouraged me so much and told me to push more than I was comfortable with) and she was born!  I just want to say, holy crap.  I was confused.  There was a baby inside me this whole time?  I knew that there was a *theoretical* baby there, but an actual baby, that cries and breathes air and flails around and is covered in gore?  What the fuck.  

It was an awesome experience.  Got a second degree internal tear (something I'm sure I got from the third contraction), but I'm healing nicely and Miranda, a very real, very sweet and laid back baby, is here and, I'm sorry to everyone else, but I got the cutest baby.

I'm Director of Marketing at a digital agency with offices in Ottawa (among other places) and I am looking for someone with aspirations in the digital space (you know, like the internets) who's early in their career and looking for some work experience. 

I'm planning to offer a formal internship opportunity through Carleton's journalism school next fall but in the interim I'm reaching out through some of my own contacts and I figured, why not Reddit?

You are:
- Post-secondary student or recent grad with writing chops and an interest in web technologies 

You get:
- Two weeks (15-20 hours per week is ideal but negotiable) of work experience with a pretty sweet digital agency (starting soonish) 
- A longer-form whitepaper and several blog posts / videos published on our site that you can add to your portfolio

As the title says, it's unpaid (boo!) but could lead to summer/part-time/freelance work if things go well and will definitely give you some experience and networking opps. Oh and I'll throw in all the free coffee you can drink. 

And yes, I know unpaid internships sort of suck. But I'm being upfront about it. 

PM me here for more details.

EDIT: For clarity, it's the internship that would start soonish. The agency's been around for 17+ years."

There's plenty of stuff to do around, lots of bars and restaurants. Big room, quiet. There are five other roommates and a dog, all of which are great. Roommates are all in mid-20s (four M, one F), mostly young professionals (and one law student). The dog can be a little skittish of new people at first, but he's a sweetheart when he gets used to you. People mostly keep to themselves and we're all on pretty different schedules so it never feels as crowded as it might otherwise. 

The bedroom itself is in the basement, but as far as basements go it's a decent one. I like to think of it as my cave, to which I retire at the end of my day to slumber. I'd leave behind a few small bookcases, a little coffee table thing, a standing lamp, and a light timer (I use it with a string of Christmas lights). I could leave an air filter for you too, if you'd like. The kitchen is small but fully stocked, and you'd have some decent cabinet space.

So I'm attending university in MA. Everything is pretty sweet, I have a high paying internship at the moment, and I expect it to cover my expenses for senior year. 
  
  
The problem is that I will have little to no money when I graduate, and I'd like to move to the West Coast. I'm thinking Seattle area. I'm not expecting to have a lot of money, so I'm not sure how I would do it. 
  
  
I have a pretty impressive resume for a college grad. I could probably get a job pretty easily, but I'm worried about that risk. How does one line up an apartment/job in another state? I'd like to visit before I move, but I'm not sure the money is there. 
  
  
I don't have much stuff I couldn't sell. I'd have to ditch my books, which would suck, but they are replaceable. Has anyone done this? Can I pick up and go right after college? Or should I get a job here (basically guaranteed one after I graduate, and it's not a bad position) and pay down some of my loans/save some cash?

I graduate with my JD next year. I am seriously considering becoming an LEO. 

My JD will be from a good (top 50) law school. I have a BA in political science. I'm fit enough to pass any physical requirements.

I have a minor in possession charge. As an undergrad I smoked a lot of pot and did some LSD/pills/etc. None of that shows up on my record, and I am currently clean. I have no credit, good or bad. 

I have weak work experience (food service and retail for ~4 years) and none of my legal internships are from criminally oriented organizations. I plan to take a fair number of criminal law cases during my last year of  law school.

I suppose my question really boils down to this: will a JD help me and will my background hurt me?

Thanks guys."
1bet0q,1,2013-04-01,Stressed out and depressed.,throwaway766969,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1bet0q/stressed_out_and_depressed/,"I want to avoid being too long-winded and boring here, which may be difficult because the way I’m feeling right now is just a conglomeration of stupid shit and first world problems. But I’ve kind of had a lingering cloud of depression hanging over my head for a few months and maybe this will help. I don’t think I have real depression or anything, but sometimes I feel depressed. I just feel shitty a lot of times, and here’s my best go at explaining why.

A little background: I’m married, 25, in graduate school, no kids. When I graduated from college in 2009, I had a hard time finding a job like a lot of people. And I didn’t feel like I was setting my standards very high but in spite of that I still had a hard time landing the job I was aiming for. Long story short, I ended up with it, but it took me 2 years to get where I wanted to be and I felt like I should have jumped right into it after school. A year went by, I didn’t like it that much so I figured I should go back to school to attempt to change the direction my career was going. I sort of decided to do it on a whim, too. At the time, I was the primary wage earner between my wife and I and I said “Honey, I really want to do this. I will pick up a part time job, we’ll cut back and we will make it work. It will all be much better in the long run, I promise.” 

So I entered my master’s program last August and it has been a lot of work and pretty stressful. But I keep my head above water. They really load you up. And unlike undergrad where you can pick a schedule and it’s fairly flexible to some extent, my school basically said “here’s when your classes are, be there” and there really isn’t any other option. Classes would be like 10AM to 5 PM which didn’t bode well to finding an evening job or day job. To make things worse, I live an hour from campus so I spend 2 hours per day commuting on school days. 

The only jobs I could really find that would work with my school schedule would be working graveyard shifts. This is the type of program where you’re not supposed to do anything outside of school. “Fuck that,” I thought. “I’m harder working than most people. I can make this happen.” The dean who talked to me when I got admitted said just take out loans for living expenses, you can’t work more than like 10 hours per week in this program. I got clever and thought that if I worked graveyards I could squeeze in a bunch of work time. 

In theory, my working graveyards idea would work. It’s front desk at a hotel and it’s pretty slow when I’m there. They let me bring in my laptop so I can do homework while I’m working. 

Problem is, day sleep sucks. When I try to sleep during the days (on the weekends when I’m not at school) I will sleep for like 4 hours, wake up, and can’t go back to sleep. I feel like my weekends when I’m working these graveyard shifts are just a 72 hour period where I feel like shit and am sleep deprived. I usually work Sunday nights so that that it feeds into Monday morning and I go straight school. It’s hard to make it through Mondays. 

I’ve been looking for an internship for the coming summer and I’ve been struggling. I’ve applied to a ton and talked to a lot of people. The companies I was really interested in weren’t interested in me. And I’ve told myself that I’m not going to make the same mistake I did when I was in undergrad. I’m going to network, I’m doing to do internships, and I’m going to make sure I have a decent job lined up when I get out of here and that will be my top priority. Well as I said I’ve been struggling. It’s April now, I still haven’t found a summer internship, and that has been stressing me out. I feel like once I get out of school I will be in the same position I was in when I finished undergrad – struggling to end up with the job I actually want. 

This weighs on me because being successful is important to me. Call it vain, call it shallow, that’s what I want. Some people want kids, some people want to devote their life to worshipping God. I just want a good job. That’s what I want at this stage in my life. 

I feel like I don’t have time to spend with family or friends. I don’t have time to keep the house clean. I feel like shit all weekend, I go through weekends feeling like a sleep-deprived zombie. I’m not motivated to eat healthy and stay fit. I just feel like I’m half-assing everything in my life and I’m super paranoid about this graduate school thing not paying off in the long run. 

TL;DR: I'm afraid of not being successful, I'm really stressed out, and it's depressing me.

I was just accepted into Hopkins' Masters of Arts in Teaching program, which is a one-year intensive and includes a student teaching internship with a Maryland public school. Five years ago, when I was nineteen, I was convicted of a class 1 misdemeanor (trespassing). I've demonstrated remorse, and frankly, I beat myself up about it on a regular basis. Regardless, do my prospects for getting hired after graduation look grim?

A few reasons why:
-fosters sentiments of entitlement where minorities get more opportunities from under-performing.
-penalizes others that may be more qualified based on race alone.
-sends a general message that minorities are not expected to do as well (mainly academically)

I recognize the value of a diversity of backgrounds and experiences. I believe that engaging with others from different experiences is a great way to grow and learn. I realize that a school may wish to create a richly diverse culture for this exact reason. Yet I still don't think this is justified. Average GPA and MCAT score for black students admitted to medical school is significantly lower than for white and asian applicants. I love all people and some of my best friends are black, but I would not feel comfortable going to a black surgeon because I don't know if they got where they are because they are the most qualified or because they were products of affirmative action and quotas that needed filling. If I was African-American, I would find it offensive that my standards were lowered and I wasn't expected to achieve at the same level. I think the cons significantly outweigh the pros. Additionally, there are other ways to increase campus/workroom diversity without lowering standards for, and giving benefits to, a specific race. I'm all for need-based financial aid, but I think scholarships that only consider African-American applicants are total bullshit.

I passed P/1 and FM/2. Then I saw a job opening as a part time claims representative at one of the biggest P&amp;C insurance companies. After I got the part time job, I applied for their actuarial internship, and got that. I will be going to their corporate office this summer. After the summer, I will return to school as a senior, and hopefully pass exams 3 and 4.

My questions:
Does being a claims rep and being an actuarial intern count as related work experience?
Will taking the 3rd and 4th exam make me too competitive? 
I really like working for a top insurance company. However, I do not like the city their HQ is in. It'll be a tough decision for me once I am done with the internship and, if they offer me a full time position. My question here is, will working for a top p&amp;c insurance company, coupled w/ my exams and claims experience, make it easy for me to get jobs elsewhere?
What insurance companies hire actuaries in Texas? 
Lastly, I really like the communication part of being a claims rep. I like helping customers out. This makes me confused on whether I want to be a consultant or work in insurance. Do you think w/ my background, getting a consulting job would be easy?

Basically, I'm looking for sentence structure (re-structuring) and grammar.
Please don't post this sucks...I already know. Thanks.

Background: I'm applying to the same school that I am currently attending for undergrad. I am a ""pre-law"" and mechanical engineering double major.

**Here goes:**

Curious, observant, obsessive, meticulous, logical, these are words that describe me. But I am, first and foremost, a person of principle. I believe strongly in equal opportunity and justice. My dream is to become an intellectual property lawyer so I can protect the ideas of the people and strive for equality under the law. I want to protect the ideas that not only drive our nation economically, but also develop our society in a positive direction. 

I am a person of many passions. I am passionate about technology- it is never-ending, it challenges our society, and it dares me to imagine. I am passionate about law- protecting people, protecting ideas, and providing equal opportunity. I am passionate about energy- it will be the next revolution not just in technological development but in human history. The world needs to develop sustainable energy technologies in order to have a future. 

I joined the IDEAS program at Lehigh to learn about engineering applications and about society. The program has accomplished what I hoped it would. I have gained many perspectives through my pre-law concentration: political science, international relations, economics, environmental science, business ethics, the legal system, etc. I have attained a practical background in mechanical engineering that has enabled me to work among engineers during my summer internship. But the biggest benefit of the IDEAS program was the seminars with Professor Best. The seminars helped me understand technology in the social context. It explored and analyzed how modern research, innovations, industrializations, and practices in many technological fields affect people. It has developed and enriched my critical thinking and problem solving. 

When I look through the past decade, I observe that many of the world’s problems stem from a lack of alternative and sustainable energies. U.S. dependence on foreign oil has seen wars waged in Iraq and Afghanistan, killing thousands of people while putting our country in serious debt. Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy, created and intensified by increased global warming, have destroyed countless homes and lives. The U.S. economy continues to suffer because our government is handcuffed by ethanol, natural gas, and oil lobbyists. The U.S. government spends billions of dollars every year subsidizing corn in order to produce ethanol even though ethanol is a non-sustainable form of energy. At the same time, overproduction of corn in the United States has long created global trade imbalance, causing starvation in Africa and other third world countries. When I hear about politicians pushing for energy independence in the United States, they talk about using oil reserves in Texas, drilling in Alaska, new discoveries of natural gas reservoirs, and the Alaska gas pipeline. These are all short term solutions for energy independence and do nothing in terms of controlling global warming and creating a sustainable energy future. The world continues to burn fossil fuels to warm our winters, cool our summers, run our machines, and worsen our addiction.

I want to study energy systems because there are so many possibilities for alternative energy. Biofuels and biomass, produced sustainably and eco-friendly, is a promising form of energy that can provide energy for transportation such as cars, boats, and airplanes. Geothermal energy can be used to directly heat homes and buildings. Solar cell technology, wind power, geothermal pumps, and hydropower (dams, tidal power, etc.) are inexhaustible and can generate enormous amounts of energy for homes, agriculture, and industry.  

Energy generation is only part of the solution, the world must also change 
the way energy is being used. A change in our energy infrastructure could distribute energy more adequately, to needed areas during the right times. Improvement in energy storage is crucial for adopting new energies. The primary reason that electric vehicles are not more popular today is because the storage capacity limits cars to short distances, meaning fossil fuels still have to utilized for cars to be practical. Another area of interest is energy transfer, transferring energy between energy reservoirs (e.g. solar farms in a dessert) and where energy is needed (e.g. homes and industry). One development is trying to use direct currents (Edison) instead of alternating currents (Tesla) to transport energy, which could significantly reduce energy loss over long distances.

I believe that my background in mechanical engineering will be greatly enhanced by an education in energy systems and energy technologies. Intellectual property rights protection encompasses not only energy technologies but also energy systems operation, implementation, manufacturing, etc. Lehigh University’s Masters of Engineering in Energy Systems will combine my three passions (technology, law, energy) into my career as an intellectual property attorney.

I've been looking into substitute teaching, and possibly teaching career oriented, but also still very interested in internships (museums, government facilities). Do note, I am not looking for lab work or academic work so this is not a CV for that reason. 

So, old vs. new: 
1. font - from serif to sans serif, 
2. layout - ""normal"" single page to two column single page layout, 
3. got rid of my ""objective"", 
4. got rid of ""references available by request"", 
5. added curriculum highlights, 
6. added semester academic honors (it's not cum laude or anything... *cries* ) 
7. changed ""Wording""; old was ""responsibilies included..."" 

personal critiques: 
Good: aesthetically, I prefer it. It looks more modern and crisp. I think it's easier on the eyes.  

Not so good: first and foremost, i will most definitely be sending / uploading this new resume in PDF exclusively. Also. removing my objective I feel like I don't provide a concise ""mission statement"" and it seems my experience is mis-matched. why I removed it is because I read that that mission statement is supposed to be found in my cover letter and it's redundant to say ""find a job as a sub..."" because they know that and it wastes space. 

I feel like turning it into two columns I was losing valuable real estate to explain my strengths and achievements in these areas. 

I don't know how I feel about ""coursework highlights""; I see it in a lot of reddit resumes, and I haven't read anything recommending for/against it. I personally feel like it's used to pad inexperience at work, but I have good chunk of work experience that I think is more pertinent than what I took in class... :/ 

and please, rip this shit apart (spacing, font, colors, layout, etc). I want every little possible issue scrutinized!

The best of everything was here and it was the only city that really mattered.

Now that I've been in NYC for just about 3 years, I just can't make excuses anymore: this place sucks, seriously.

-Subways blow.  Unless you have immaculate timing, you'll have to wait 5-20 minutes just to GET ON the train, and god forbid if you have to make a transfer or two.  People complain about car traffic in big cities, but I feel like I can't get anywhere outside of my neighborhood in less than 20-30 minutes, which could get me halfway across a city like Houston in a car.  

-Nobody you meet lives here.  Everyone I seem to meet is a tourist from the midwest/Europe, a bridge and tunnel person from Jersey/LI, or lives in some weird off-the-wall part of the city that is painful to get to (Red Hook, Bed Stuy, Crown Heights, Harlem).  In 3 years, I have not been able to find a single person that lives local to me and I've lived in the West Village, East Village, and Williamsburg.  FFS, they were supposed to be the most happening parts of the city, but NO ONE LIVES HERE, well, except for cunty old ladies on rent control that will gladly chew you out for making a peep after 8 PM.

-Jobs are total bullshit.  Somehow, everyone just decided that they were doing you a favor by giving you an internship that doesn't even pay enough to buy groceries.  Everyone I know in this city has either a menial job or a virtually unpaid internship.  The only people I know that seem to make any real money here are in finance, but they work so much, they could live virtually anywhere and not even know the difference.  Of the one real job I've had (engineering), I was treated like shit and paid a salary that was mediocre by midwest standards.  I tried starting my own freelance business, but everyone is so fucking broke here I can't get anyone willing to pay enough for it to be worth it.

-There's nothing to do.  I can't think of anything that's here that isn't present in other large cities.  The highline is the biggest load of horseshit non-attraction I have ever seen in my life.  There's just bars and restaurants (which are in ANY city and good ones in any large city) and parks, but why the hell would you move to a dense city to go to a park?  There's some cool events at the Javits center, but for the money you'd saving living somewhere else, it makes more sense just to fly in every once in a while.

-Holy shit is it dirty.  This city is the grimiest place on the planet.  I fear a piece of diseased ceiling paint will fall on me every time I go into the subway.  Everything is in such disrepair from the 70's and can't be fixed because the city is built on top of itself and it's too hard to shut anything down long enough for meaningful repairs.

-Mom n pop shops suck.  People tout how great NYC is for rejecting Wal-Mart, etc., but I'd take a Wal-Mart over these awful overpriced mom n pop shops that have crap inventory.  I feel like finding some of the most basic life essentials becomes a city-wide scavenger hunt to get the brand you actually want.  Let's not even get into how bad it sucks to haul shit back to your apartment, either.

-Not having a car blows.  I know some people don't like driving, but I'm not one of those people.  Being out in the world without a car makes me feel basically homeless.  A car is like a portable lock box for all of your ""rainy day"" supplies like a sweatshirt, umbrella, etc.  Left the house and realized you didn't need a jacket? tough shit, you're carrying it ALL GOD DAMN DAY.  Want to go to the beach?  Hopefully no one will jack the wallet and phone stuffed into your shoes since you can't put it in a car to lock it up.

-No one dates.  I thought the idea of random hook ups would rock, but having a basically set-in-stone policy of ""one date and then I'll never speak to you again"" is fucking annoying after a while.  I don't want to get married right now, but someone I can see more than once would be nice.  The only people I know with girlfriends moved to the city while they were dating already.  Then again, considering how fucked out the rent situation is and how no one seems to live in a remotely convenient neighborhood, that probably has something to do with it.  Oh, and I swear if I meet another gold-digging ""artist""/non-profit worker making $20,000/yr looking for a guy to buy them out of their $100,000 debt...

-Central A/C, what is that?  Nothing sucks more than a New York summer where you have to trudge outdoors in 90+ degree weather only to wait in an EVEN HOTTER subway in hopes that your train might have an ever-so-slight bit of climate control.  Even restaurants and bars barely have even a shitty window unit that is about to fall apart any minute.  The South might be hot, but at least they know how to install a god damn A/C unit.  Oh, and the few places that do have A/C will politely drop condensation on your head to make sure your hair gets disgusting fungus drops in it.

-The rent.  I don't know why it took me so long to get to this one, this is probably the #1 problem in the city.  The price of living here compared to the quality of life is like a 3rd world country.  A $4,000 apartment here would be $600/month anywhere else in the US just about (excluding San Fran and parts of LA I guess).  Oh, what's that? you wanted to do laundry in your own apartment? Fuck that, gotta haul that shit down the street to a laundromat or MAYBE your basement if you're lucky, well, that is of course if someone else in your building hasn't already hogged all of the machines.  Rent is also largely responsible for horrible business arrangements that underpay and have you elbow to elbow with co-workers instead of, gee, I dunno, an office or even a cubicle.



So, have I nailed it?  Have I finally removed the rose-tinted glasses from my eyes to see the truth?  You can throw some tired saying about ""making it in New York"" or ""You just can't hang"", but then I'd just have to inform you that you have come down with a severe case of Stockholm syndrome.  It's one thing to have a professionally difficult life to enjoy a spectacular personal one, but I feel like this city just works you to the bone and gives you shit on a shingle in return.

Am I wrong?  I'd love to hear any valid counterpoints to what I've said that proves NYC to be worth a single damn."

1be4ke,1,2013-03-31,Some Motivation For Those Struggling with Job Searching / life,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1be4ke/some_motivation_for_those_struggling_with_job/,"Hi Everyone! 

The purpose of this thread is to motivate those who feel like they are about to give up. And at the same time, this is necessary for myself to keep things in perspective and to remind myself that I'm worth it, and that things work out! 

This day, about two years ago I was homeless living in the Salvation Army. The exact reason as to why I ended up there could be subject for another post, however the point is I was homeless. Almost nothing to my name and on the verge of loosing any and all family support. I was in a dark spot and anyone familiar with living in a homeless shelter can attest. 

After getting acclimated to the conditions and to the brevity of the situation I got myself into, I created several goals to accomplish. And one of those goals was to get back into college and finish my degree. After sticking it out almost 1.2 years at the Salvation Army, I finally got accepted into school. Talk about a culture shock. Going from living in a bed bug invested communal homeless shelter, to a college campus is quite the upgrade. So Yes, if anyone is currently homeless and looking to get into school with little to nothing to your name there is hope! 


Anyway, from there I set another goal. To graduate with the highest marks possible. And come May 2013, I will be graduating with honors and a degree in business administration with concentration in financial planning. 

From the time I moved out of the homeless shelter, to this present day, networking has been key to ensuring a payable job. I learned at the shelter the importance of communication, friendship, and networking. I networked with Social Services to get on food stamps. I networked with several colleges to get admitted. I networked with financial aid to ensure maximal funding for a homeless 21 year old with virtually no money to his name. 

Anyway, the importance is networking. I joined groups associated with my field of study. I networked with non profits around here as soon as i got out of the shelter and on campus. Through networking I found a nice spot volunteering for a refugee school. And ended up designing their financial reporting system in Excel to ensure sustained federal and state funding. I networked with professors, ensuring good referrals if graduate school comes around. I networked with the president of my school to give me pointers before my first ever business breakfast meeting with people established in the field I'm studying. 

Alas that gets me to where I am today. At that breakfast meeting mentioned above, I networked with a very amazing individual who today is my mentor. We ate a delicious breakfast; listened to a terrific speaker, and out of that grew a job offer as their first ever intern. After working there for about 2 months, I received a full time salaried position post graduation in May. 

I am so very blessed to be where I am today. Through hard work and networking, I went from living in a homeless shelter in one of the roughest parts of town, to graduating with high marks and a salaried job position. All thanks to hard work, luck, and networking. Although, at times, the trauma associated with what happened during that very dark period of my life sneaks up on me, telling me I'm not worth this. Not worth the amazing things in life. You see, I lived a very chaotic and unhealthy life for a while, and sadly I found comfort in that. So I need to do things like this to remind me how strong I am, how far I've come, and how the darkness is a scary place and should never be returned to. Rather it should be used for motivation for myself and others!"

Thanks!,frisbeemaniac95,compsci,https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/1be33k/trying_to_choose_between_colleges_any_help_would/,"My four choices are Berkeley, UW Seattle, U of I Urbana-Champaign, and University of Michigan, but I'm pretty much choosing between the first three. I'm going for a BS in Computer Science. All of these places offer a great compsci education, but which one would give me the best resources, the best possibilities for internships or research during school, and then jobs afterwards, etc? I really value the things the college gives outside of just a great classroom education. 

Btw, I live in Illinois, so UIUC is the cheapest, but I also got a scholarship at UW that makes the price comparable to UIUC. 

In the opinion of /r/compsci , which school should I go to?"

I'm currently a senior at Baruch College (NYC) graduating in 2 months. I majored in Finance, and am at a loss for what to do. I didn't get an offer post graduation, and am likely to be unemployed.

A bit about me:

-3.5 GPA

-CFA Lvl 1 Candidate June - I know the material in and out.

-Read the WSJ daily, Barons/Economist occasionally

-No (relevant) internships, but took an ibanking course and practiced valuation/LBO modeling

-english first language/great comm skills 

-good with #'s, have a phenomenal memory, and am a very logical person

-genuinely have a passion for finance



My ""mentor"" so to speak advised me to stay off the grid and keep building my knowledge everyday (rather than blindly submit applications that won't get past filters). I never found any of my coursework difficult, nor the CFA lvl 1 material. But now graduation is looming, and I think I made a horrible mistake not networking better. I've been to a ton of corporate events on campus, but I never reached out as much as I should have b/c I thought I wasn't ready - although I asked ques at these events and got cards.

Can anyone offer any advice for what I should be doing now? Whether it's networking and setting up for the next recruiting cycle, or last minute cold calling till June? I've read the M&amp;I/Wall St Oasis articles, but I'd prefer opinions specific to my situation.

I'd really appreciate any help, whether it's advice, constructive criticism, or even criticism at this point. "

I recently found out that I'll be spending a year working for a veterinary hospital on Long Island, starting the first week of July. I would love to take care of your (special needs? medicated? healthy but need lots of attention?) pets in exchange for living in your spare bedroom or basement while I'm there. I'd be willing to pay some rent as well, but I will be living on a budget, so hopefully we can come to some sort of agreement. I'm clean and quiet, and I can provide references as well as proof of employment and licensure, etc. I am bringing a cat and I would like to bring my dog as well - a quiet, well-behaved 25 lb couch potato - but I have arrangements if he can't come. I would obviously be interested in meeting you and your pets and making sure that everything is the right fit. I travel to New York regularly and can arrange a visit most weekends.

A little about me: I'm a 25 y/o recent graduate from Kansas State University College of Veterinary Medicine, currently working in Baltimore, MD.  I love what I do, but internships do not pay well.  As a result, I would love to exchange some of my skills and knowledge toward defraying some living costs.  

Maybe you're not the fit for this situation, but perhaps you know someone who is. Email me if this interests you or you know someone who might be interested.  "

[What was your best experience during your time working there? What was your worst experience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1b95jz/i_am_a_former_walt_disney_world_custodial/c94scp8?context=5)|Well the college program is one of the best experiences you can have. It's the most entertaining form of poverty that exists. But for an actual work experience, I loved playing around with the characters (Stitch is so much fun to mess with), and making magic. Yes, i said it, making magic. The people that come to Disney are usually celebrating something. I've participated in three marriage proposals, countless happy birthday songs, and drawn water art for literally, thousands of people. The feeling you get when you make someone's day exponentially better by drawing a picture of mickey mouse on the pavement . It really feels great.
[What kinda surprising stuff would people not know about Disney World? sorry for being vague.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1b95jz/i_am_a_former_walt_disney_world_custodial/c94qvmo?context=5)|The entire haunted mansion ride is a metaphor for death. Splash Mountain only has restraints now because parents would pick their kids up out of the boat and tell them to walk to one of the marked EXIT doors, which is triggered to stop the entire ride. Magic Kingdom is on the second floor, there are tunnels, and yes, I worked in those too. Disney gets all of their popcorn and Coke products FO FREE. In exchange for free advertising for Coke. each hot dog costs Disney $.50, and each loaf of buns costs them a dollar (keep in mind, my favorite hot dog on property, the mac-n-cheese and bacon dog at hollywood studios costs about $8.99 before tax) there you go. a little bit of everything.
[A $9.00 hotdog? Better get the Disney dining plan...sheesh. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1b95jz/i_am_a_former_walt_disney_world_custodial/c94r3zi?context=5)|ALWAYS DO THE DDP. ALWAYS.
[Hey! I just got back from Disney World.  If there was a zombie outbreak, what would be your zombie plan?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1b95jz/i_am_a_former_walt_disney_world_custodial/c94r0w5?context=5)|First of course acquire basic weaponry from orlando shops (which is the tricky part, if you've ever been to orlando, you know that everything is spread the fuck out) Set up shop in the Cinderella Castle suite. Not because of the luxury, but because of the tower and access to the utilidoor (the tunnels under MK). have the zipline that tinkerbell flies on to be prepped and ready to go in case of an evacuation, as well as contemporary resort speedboats, and the monorail, all docked at MK, as well as an aditional monorail to Epcot docked at the TTC. find a way to tap into the security cameras, all of which are visible from a room in the utilidoor. in the event of being overwhelmed, take the zipline from the tallest tower, behind tomorrowland. hop a speedboat to the TTC, get to epcot, Send out a distress signal from control, the base for all of the radios from merch to custodial to security. then set up shop at the highest room in spaceship earth. only one way in and one way out. 
[That's the coolest zombie plan ever.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1b95jz/i_am_a_former_walt_disney_world_custodial/c94se3b?context=5)|This has been perfected by many people. Very very foolproof. 
[Tell us more about this room in spaceship earth. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1b95jz/i_am_a_former_walt_disney_world_custodial/c94ran7?context=5)|Well it's the big ball, the symbol of Epcot. That top room is just a room that, on the ride, is just where you're looking at the stars and earth.  and it's pretty rad. BUT. with the lights on, there's tons of steel panels. great for hidign behind and ""control"" a room with a window sticking out of it, that has a view of every camera on the ride. no one will get through without me knowing.
[What happens in the event of a power outage? Any back up plans for the monorails &amp; security cams?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1b95jz/i_am_a_former_walt_disney_world_custodial/c95191h?context=5)|Start hightailing my ass out of florida somehow because zombie tourists will likely be annoying.

[What's the atmosphere like behind the scenes? Is it generally happy and positive like the park? What's the employee lounge like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1b95jz/i_am_a_former_walt_disney_world_custodial/c94r9zz?context=5)|It's different because not all of the roles are involved with one another. Our workday revolves around the CDS (Cast Deployment System) area. It's a computer to clock in and such. Some roles use the same computer. My girlfriend worked at the Winnie the Pooh and Teacups, and we used the same computer when i was in fantasyland. and with the college program kids, we're all pretty good about being positive. there's our fair share of ridiculous guest experiences, but we stay happy. And there are several breakrooms, my spot was the smoking area behind winnie the pooh. just a nice shaded area with tables out of the public's eye. but the main one for magic kingdom is the Mousekateria. It's got a subway, and a grill and food and such. they start serving breakfast at 3:30 AM, so when we have a late night, we'd all get breakfast. It's a pretty great work atmosphere.
[What was your worst experience with a guest.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1b95jz/i_am_a_former_walt_disney_world_custodial/c94rkum?context=5)|I had a guest yell at me for asking them to move to a non smoking area. and i'm not just talking yelling, this dude was coming up to me and just about trying to fight me. being a smoker, and understanding the stress the park could put on a large family, I tried to straighten it out, but he demanded to see a manager, who promptly told him to put the cigarette out. like i said above, custodial has a lot of non confrontational drama. maybe I'll get the gf on here and she'll give you some real horror stories. 
[I hear alot about paranormal activity at these parks. Anything odd ever happen to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1b95jz/i_am_a_former_walt_disney_world_custodial/c94rkum?context=5)|OH HELL YEAH MK IS HAUNTED. First of all about twice a month, West MK custodial (adventureland, frontierland, and liberty square) is called to come and clean up a Code Ash on haunted mansion. People dump the remains of dead relatives on the mansion very regularly. But paranormal for me, I've never experienced anything. However, on the haunted mansion, you have a ghost join you in your doom buggy. Those ghosts are Ezra (skeleton), Phineas(lantern), and Gus (ball and chain) they are bad luck, normality, and good luck. and they've never failed. and of course there's the story of charlie, the ""haunt of Pirates of the Carribean"", if the opening manager doesn't say ""Good morning Charlie"" when they first start the ride at the beginning of the day, the ride is doomed to break down several times. and it has proven to be true.
[When you say the three ghosts never fail, do you mean the riders will have these things? Could you explain?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1b95jz/i_am_a_former_walt_disney_world_custodial/c94tino?context=5)|The ghosts go into the doom buggy, like you see a mirror whwer you see yourself and the ghost is in/on top of/just outside of your car. and their super stition to me has always been proven true.
[What is the grossest thing you've ever had to clean up? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1b95jz/i_am_a_former_walt_disney_world_custodial/c94qmfh?context=5)|Personally, Dumbo's new area was the biggest headache any day of the week. The custodial world is divided into zones. Dumbo zone has about 15 trashcans (to put it into perspective, space mountain has about 28) but kids have a new play place inside of the circus tent. where they cannot resist the urge to piss and shit and throw up in. One time a kid bumped his head at the top, and bled all the way down to the bottom and out to the ride. took the CM two hours to clean. But the biggest single mess was a pretty bad Code V (vomit)) in one of Peter Pan's pirate ships.
 |Oh, but there was this one time. during night of joy (a non denominational christian group takes over magic kingdom for an entire weekend of christian music) my friend had to clean up spunk in a go cart on the speedway. he told me it was a lot more than he expected. and that's all that we spoke of the incident. 
[What sort of uncompromising situations have you discovered?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1b95jz/i_am_a_former_walt_disney_world_custodial/c94rjcb?context=5)|Like a stubborn guest? Brazilian tour groups in the summer make the job nine times worse. They enjoy sleeping in the walkways, clapping and chanting at all hours of the day, and going in restricted areas. like this one time i was working in the area behind the castle, and i loked up at the lights coming from cinderella's royal table and i saw people running around. i went up to find a few brazilian girls, i asked them to please come down, they reminded me that they no speak english, so i had to basically hand motion to get them to come down. But that's secretly the best part about being a custodian. We very seldom have to tell people ""no"". My girlfriend has been screamed at and one of her fellow cast members have been spit on when they told someone they couldn't bring their electric wheelchair on the ride.
[As a former blizzard beach lifeguard I can confirm the Brazilians are the worst especially in the cave.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1b95jz/i_am_a_former_walt_disney_world_custodial/c94vti9?context=5)|Um. story time.

Would you recommend this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1b95jz/i_am_a_former_walt_disney_world_custodial/c94qmmq?context=5)|The Professional Interns are the only ones I saw. Those are people who are just finishing up school and they are given a manager position. The ones that worked in my area I worked under nearly every day. Any internship with Disney is good, especially if you want to actually work with Disney. They love hiring from within.

[They better add Oswald to that list!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1b95jz/i_am_a_former_walt_disney_world_custodial/c97b4f8?context=5)|I WISH. Doubt it though. apparently it's been an uphill battle trying to work pluto in for years.
[Did you ever get to operate the special trash can in Tomorrowland?  Did you have to work late into the night?  Can you tell us of any trends in park population that people might not know? (What day of the week is the most crowded, where most people go at certain times\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1b95jz/i_am_a_former_walt_disney_world_custodial/c94s42d?context=5)|No, but Push jokes around with us all the time. The latest we were open till while i was there was about 4 AM. which means we clocked out by 5. People want to start and end their trips at MK typically. so avoid Magic Kingdom on Saturday-Monday. Epcot gets stupid busy at the end of Food and Wine Fest in mid october, and Hollywood Studios is always busy because it's so small. Animal Kingdom is so big it never hits capacity. everything else is really play by ear. just know what you want to see, and set a plan. adjust plan accordingly.
[I'm going to Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom tomorrow. Is this time of year crowded? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1b95jz/i_am_a_former_walt_disney_world_custodial/c94ra0t?context=5)|I hope you like lines. Because there will be plenty. Time your fast passes well and you'll be golden. always remember that NO ONE does ANYTHING during the fireworks. so if you waited all day for space mountain, watch Wishes from Tomorrowland and hop on as soon as they end.
[I go to Magic Kingdom several times a year and definitely will be getting fast passes and skipping the parades. I went September 2012 and it was surprisingly less crowded than normal.

In the summer they WILL sell out. and you WILL be stuck watching me push water into a drain in my hot as hell rain gear.
[What is the oddest abandoned item you've ever found cleaning up? The most disturbing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1b95jz/i_am_a_former_walt_disney_world_custodial/c94s2xa?context=5)|Most disturbing was a used condom outside of it's a small world. And i found half a bottle of captain once, which is odd because MK is probably the park adults need to drink at the most, and why the hell didn't they finish it. MK is the only park where you can't purchase alcohol (except at Be Our Guest)
[Do they still allow for usage of fast passes after the allotted time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1b95jz/i_am_a_former_walt_disney_world_custodial/c94rx8n?context=5)|Nope. they ended that shortly after I got there.

[Hey Sam, thanks for doing the AMA. My girlfriend is doing the program in the fall and is going to be custodial just like you.  You mentioned that your girlfriend also did the program, so as a couple, what kinds of things can couples going through the program expect? For the record, I'm staying home while she's going.

I've been reading what I can, like the 'Moving to SF' threads in the sidebar, but I was hoping I could get some candid advice from some friendly Redditors.

I'm a student, 22, and I've been living in Boston for about 4 years. I've been to San Francisco for a whopping 1 night, so I know pretty much nothing about the city and don't know anyone that lives there. I'm mainly trying to figure out where I want to live, so if people want to suggest any areas that would be awesome. Obviously I'd rather not live anywhere too dangerous; I'm used to the shit that comes with city living, but I don't want to live in the hood.

I'm working in what I believe is the northern Mission/Potrero Hill area. I don't mind having some distance between where I live and where I work though; SF doesn't appear too big, and I don't mind riding a bike or whatever. How's the city's public transit?

Something else that was suggested to me was looking at places in Berkeley, anyone know what it's like living there? Commuting into the city (no car)?

Sorry that this post is kinda a mess, let me know if any other info would be useful. Thanks!

Current CS Junior, CS GPA a sliver under 4.0; I am very good at the types of questions that are typically asked in these interviews (Have been reading books/studying/etc. for some time). I have zero extra projects, or internships besides some minor CS tutoring work.

For this summer I have been offered several internships, and am hoping to apply to google summer of code as well. What should I do to maximize my odds of getting interviews with the Big 4 (Google, Amazon, FB, MS). The offers are as follows:

1) 20$/hour, Basically junior IT. Some shell scripting, likely not much more than that. I literally live next door to this place as well.

2) 15$/hour, Android/iOS development. Long commute to this place, was not really 'feeling' the workplace when I interviewed there.

3) 24$/hour, some sort of work with databases/SQL. Not really sure on what is going on here and they were rather vague with me which leads me to believe I may end up being a coffee bitch. Long commute to here as well.

4) Google Summer Of Code, 5k/summer, working with one of various companies on open source projects. From my research this is not a full-time thing and I could do this nights/weekends while doing one of the other 3 during normal working hours.

5) GSOC + Independent project. I am not to keen on this, but if there is a specific type of project I could do that would make me more attractive to the big 4 for that initial interview then that is what I would do.


Any input is appreciated, thanks for reading!"
1bjqhm,6,2013-04-02,"Thoughts on how we got to where we are today. (A two-part essay by me, YoungCubSaysWoof.)",YoungCubSaysWoof,gaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1bjqhm/thoughts_on_how_we_got_to_where_we_are_today_a/,"**Full disclosure: A friend writes columns for this magazine, and I've met some of the people that work there.**

So I made a [post earlier on]( http://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1bjeb8/from_civil_disobedience_to_civil_unions_40_years/), and a little bit later, I got the chance to go back and read through it. So as I'm sitting here, reading through the article and smoking this J (cuz that's how I do), I noticed something. [Go back to it](http://outfrontonline.com/focus/features-focus/from-civil-disobedience-to-civil-unions-40-years-of-colorado-lgbt-activism/) and look back at the era of the 80's and 90's; kind of thin, right? It could be a variety of things that led to more coverage for the 00's and 10's; more stories, writers' decisions, research limitations (though this is comprehensive), the demographics dilemma (by readers/writers' age), deadlines, etc. It could have been a myriad of things, right? Right.

What I am interested in, is the thought that the limitations are due to a lack of documentation of LGBT history.  Namely, the oral history of our people.  

Think about it; before writing, mankind learned our history through stories. Your parents probably have laid one or two on you before, if not your grandparents. These stories revealed our family to us: who they were, what happened on that day, and stories that fill the range of emotions. Think about it also from a cultural stand-point, too. How many of your family members are good at something? Woodwork, singing, hunting, painting, numbers, poker, guitar, child care, cooking, or whatever it is. How have they shared that gift with friends and family? Maybe they were even able to have a small business, and they opened up a store, owned and operated by the LGBT community. How cool is that?! That coffee shop? Gay owned. That hardware store? Also gay owned! Apprentice, internships, and part-time jobs in a safe environment are possible for the LGBT youth and young professionals. These are big words to announce! We’re movin’ on up!

Now, lets bring this home and speak directly to and about us gay and bisexual teens and men here. Even though I can’t see you, raise your hand if you’ve ever had sex with a man that was at least 20 years older than you were/are. *Come on! Get them up! My hand is raised!* OK, how about a man at least 10 years older than you were/are? *This would be a fun poll!* So now, most of you.  OK, hands down.

Think of one of those men. Remember him. How did he laugh? What was his full name? What was he like as a lover? As a boyfriend, or a spouse? Do you remember his smile? 

Do you have that picture in your head? Good! 

Now, kill him off.

* AIDS has hit your neighborhood.

* Do it. It’s 1981, and he got infected. Within six months, pneumonia will have gotten the shell that was once him.

* Everyone's asking, 'why are we getting sick?! We've been healthy this whole time?!'

* Your political leaders are watching you all die, and they aren't doing a damn thing about it.

I can’t make you feel it, but I hope those words hit. It’s like our semi just met a concrete wall in a head-on collision, and the semi losing… bad.

Imagine the wake, the funeral. See him, lying in his casket. Only dead people lay in caskets. He's dead now; you’ll never touch, see, or hear from him again. Feel your anger rise as the priest carries on and on about how merciful god is, as you seethe with tears, questioning why god would take this man away from you. Your mind floods with memories, and you cry harder.

See the people in black. Hug one of them, feel their body jump as they’re sobbing. Ask them how they are, and listen as they lie to you as they tell you the auto-pilot answer of, **“I’m good.”** Look at the other people there; why is the strong-man looking gaunt? He *was* 6”1 ft., 225 lbs. of stacked daddy muscle; now he’s 155 and getting thinner. Look at the couple over there; you don’t know them, but they’re holding hands tightly, and one of them looks like he could go any day now.

It’s raining in Denver this day… The gay coffee shop is closed. The owner? Dead. In a year, the hardware store shutters its doors, too. And you went to both funerals, plus four more that spring. Your neighborhood is changing; it was once male gay-borhood. Now, it’s less populated. Over the years, it’ll give way to an influx of women, just like what happened in Fire Island.

That dystopian view, was what a gay man in his mid-50’s shared with me over coffee. That was life back then for our people. And it connected the dots for me…

***Our gay and bi male community is seen as youth-centric, because we lost our elders.***

We lost the guys we could look up to as mentors, friends, helpers, lovers, role models and heroes. We lost our small business owners; our woodworkers, painters, entrepreneurs, and guitar-playing friends.  If you’re in ANY way interested in politics, think of how many LGBT leaders we could have now [at the federal level]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_first_LGBT_holders_of_political_offices_in_the_United_States), rather than the paltry number of 10. Our young LGBT people lost a spectrum of different men whom they could confide in, those that had been through the wringer of coming out. The guys to share your story with, the dudes you’d grab a drink or a smoke with, who’d let you crash on their couch (without trying to bang ya), the guys you could be yourself around, are dead.

Is it any wonder that so many of us felt *so* ***alone*** when we were trying to come out??? 

That’s because we literally were.

me and my SO are looking for internships in the US as it's been a dream of mine for a long time to move there. We are both doing grad school ATM, me in IT and she is in business/marketing. She has loads of experience from different marketing gigs and I'm working currently part time for a small game studio, developing games for mobile devices (working with Unity 3D). I'm Norwegian and she is German and we're both living in Germany at the moment. 


So that's a little bit about our backgrounds. So any advise on where we can find internships? Doesn't really matter where in the US. Obviously we are not expecting top money, but hopefully enough to be able to survive.


Anyways, any tips whatsoever regarding internships in the US are warmly welcome! Thanks /r/jobs!"

I would love it if I could find a job that let me do this in Europe. Is it a pipe dream? Perhaps, but I'm an optimist. I studied abroad in Ireland while in college and also had a Summer internship at a Non-Profit in London. My degree was in International Relations with a specialization in Europe. I also had a minor in Business and one in Political Science. My situation is a bit tougher because I need some sort of job that would look good trying to get into business schools, so I can't really go the teaching English route. My degree seems to push me towards two options for this pre-MBA work period: the business option and the political/diplomacy option.

My question for you all is what fields/types of businesses should I be looking into? Where should I be looking? I would be content working for a company based in Europe or for a business based in the US that either had a branch in Europe or simply required travel to Europe. Working for a diplomatic service, political entity, or a non-profit are also all viable possibilities as long as I am gaining valuable experience towards apply to an MBA program.

I live about 600 miles away in CT so this is a big decision for me and yes I did visit Tech a few months ago.
I want to transfer into Computer Engineering.
Thank you very much for your time.

1. As my 'home home' is very far away. What will I be able to do during breaks when the halls aren't open? What do you guys do? 

2. Is it worth it to spend about 10,000 more a year to come to Tech as opposed to my state college? I hear most say that undergrad may not be worth it. But with a scholarship and aid, its not that much more expensive. 

3. How are the internship opportunities? Another college I am looking at has companies already lined up for you to intern at and later maybe work for. College is what you make out of it, but I'm not really the kind to be pro active in looking for a job. Blacksburg also feels VERY isolated from the rest of the world kind of. How do job oppurtunities 'pop up' or even internship ones? Is Tech one of those schools where companies will 'just' come? The open house made it seem like that. What is the actual situation here?

4. What will one do for fun? I didn't explore the surrounding area much but comming from the suburbs where city like locations are a short drive away, Blacksburg and its area felt very alone.

5. Do you guys like it here?

6. What is with the ludicrous computer tablet($1,000 swivel touch screen laptop)requirement? I know you can just get a cheap USB writer as I heard most classes will never use it but why keep it?

7. Would it be easy to go from Univ. Studies and get into the engineering department? Freshmen year isn't very major prone classes I know but I am a bit fearful I may not 'make' it in.

Thank you all very much. This and Umass Amherst are my top descisions. Thank you."

It's really made me question my aptitude, and I'm wondering if I can even get into grad school here (or elsewhere). So how hard is it to get into grad school here? The more I think about it the more obstacles I find. I don't really speak up in class or go to office hours so my list of professors I can ask for recommendations is rather short. I'm more involved in my math classes. I've got maybe two good recommendations. I also don't have any real research experience. What I do have is an alright GPA (I carry a ~3.7, and the only reason it's not higher is because of one really bad semester where I got a 2.3, and it's been 4.0s or close ever since) and a buttload of classes under my belt (I think I'm signed up for enough so that when I graduate in the fall I'll have around 190 credits). I'm pretty sure I can get the required GRE scores, so can I redeem myself any with a double major and some good recommendations? 

Also, I wasn't really planning on taking classes this summer (hence why I was looking for internships), but now that's not panning out, I might still take some to lighten my course load in the fall. All the while doing some side projects while studying for the GRE and completing my application. Should I look for somewhere to do research? Is that a good idea?

My work history is weak, with only one good internship during college and a smattering of high school jobs. I also don't have much in the way of professional contacts as I haven't been out of university for long. Is it still advisable for me to create a Linkedin account?

Here's the web site: [Pathways: Pharmacy Technician Training](http://www.pcc.edu/career/pathways/professional-technical/pharmacy-technician/)

What I'd like to know is if it helped you get a job as a pharmacy technician. Was it worth the $2,800? Is it actually helpful to do the second part of the program? How hard is it to find internships for the second part of the program and how involved/helpful was PCC during that process?

It seems like something I'd really like to try out after scrounging the money together. I just want to know it won't be a total waste of money; $2800 is a lot of money, and one can't get financial aid for it unless it's a private loan.

Anyway, thanks for any advice on this. I know another option is to just study for the Oregon Pharmacy Tech license without a program, but I've seen places like Kaiser Permanente give preference to candidates who have taken a certified program. When Kaiser says ""certified program"" (I'm not sure if it was in those exact words), would the Pathways program count? If you just took the certification exam cold without going to a training program like Pathways and got a job, tell me about that process.

Thanks!"

But for the most part, its not about practicality, but scratching each others backs. Networking results in the best candidate getting turned away because someone else has a connection.

1bjcyo,1,2013-04-02,[Update] My recent ex[22m] still wants to have a friendship with me[20f]. (x-post from r/relationships).,stunningpocketrocket,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1bjcyo/update_my_recent_ex22m_still_wants_to_have_a/,"So I'm just going to copy+paste what I had written in /r/relationships and add my update down at the bottom.

This past Tuesday, my live in (now ex) boyfriend of 2 and a half years decided we should break up. Now from my perspective, it came out of nowhere. There were no sudden changes, no fights about anything, and there wasn't anything that should be considered a warning sign or an alarm that things were starting to go bad. He sat me down after he picked me up from work, and opened with, ""I'm moving to San Francisco.""


I laughed and replied with, ""Yeah, next year with me right?"" and he just looked at me and shook his head.


""No, two months from now.""


Now, we had just gotten over a long distance thing because I had an internship in NYC for about 3 months and we decided to stay together because it was only temporary. I thought it was just going to be another long distance thing until I was done with my year at work and I could go up with him.


He then said, with tears in his eyes and his voice wavering, ""I'm breaking up with you, stunningpocketrocket.""He explained that for the past two months, he felt his love for me was dying and that he tried to find it again, but he couldn't. I asked him when he decided it was over for us, and he said about two weeks ago. Of course, I'm devastated because I honestly felt that nothing was dying. We were still showing affection for each other, we'd kiss each other goodnight and say I love you and just did what we normally did as a couple, such as go on dates and such. We were both sitting there, crying and holding each other because we realized it was over.


However, I'm still totally in love with him. I know that time will heal my pain, and there is no telling where the future goes for both of us. The dilemma for me is that he said, word for word, ""You're still one of the most important people in my life and I still want to be friends."" He's still very important to me, but for me to move on, I need to cut off contact with him. Some of his stuff is still in my apartment, and I keep telling him that he needs to get it, but he keeps putting it off. He keeps disregarding that rule I set up for us after we sorted everything out, and is contacting me occasionally. Truthfully, I haven't been following the rule myself and have contacted him, but I was inebriated for those times. The thing that confuses me the most out of all of this is that this is the first time I have ever seen him cry. He never really shows any emotions other than irritation, happiness, or being tired, so it really threw me off. It's making me feel that he doesn't really want to go through with this decision, but I don't want to give myself false hope.


**TL;DR** My boyfriend dumped me and says he doesn't love me anymore, but says that i'm still very important to him and that he wants to be my best friend, leaving me confused, sad, and angry.


So what do I do? I feel we have another shot in the future, although it is a very slim chance and I'm not counting on it because anything can happen. However, I don't know if I want to continue being friends with him right now.



**UPDATE**: I sent him one last goodbye email telling him not to contact me and that I still love him and miss him, but I'm giving him the space he needs. I told him I'd contact him when I thought I'd be ready to be friends again. That was 3 days ago. Today when I'm at work, he's coming over to pick his stuff up. In my head I ended up convincing myself that things would be better between us and he just needed to cool off, but now that he's getting his stuff, it's finally settling in that he's not coming back, not for a while at least.

 It doesn't help that I have people that are mutual friends with him giving me updates on how he is. His new roommate's girlfriend texted me, saying that he hasn't been sleeping much, or saying much, or doing much of anything and that she hears him cry sometimes at night. I keep asking myself, *Why did he break up with me if he's going through this much pain as well?* Yesterday, I visited my old roommate that used to live with me and my ex when we were still together. I thought it would help, and he'd try to cheer me up, but all he did was ask how I was doing and talk about my ex. We ended up wandering around downtown and mistakenly walked past my ex's work. I saw him in the window and he saw me and smiled, but it looked like he was in pain. I went home that night, alone, and drank and cried as I talked to my old roommate over the phone. We pointed out the bad things that happened when I was still together with my ex, hoping it would make the pain lessen, but really it just made me feel stupid for falling for him. I feel like he's been so out of character lately, and this isn't what he'd do, but it was all his choice. It was his decision to leave me, and if he's in pain because of it, that's his fault. He told me himself I did nothing wrong, so I feel that once he realizes that, he might come back. And the fact that I don't know what I'd do if that ever happens scares me. Everything that's happening recently is confusing me and it's really making me feel like there's a chance we can work it out. But really, I just need to focus on myself and I don't know how since I've only ever known how to put others' needs before my own.

I don't have a question this time. I just needed to rant and hopefully get support and advice."

1bjbls,2,2013-04-02,I recently graduated college and I'm reworking my résumé. Right now it is quite bad and I have a couple of general questions about how to make it less bad.,DerogatoryPanda,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1bjbls/i_recently_graduated_college_and_im_reworking_my/,"Like I said, I recently graduated and I'm beginning the job hunt. I'm in the process of redoing my résumé so I would prefer to wait until I have fleshed it out before linking it here, but I do have some general résumé questions.

1. I studied abroad while in college. How should I implement this into my résumé? Should I just include it with my High School and College info in the Education Section like in [this example I found on google](http://imgur.com/rORrtuh)? Should I put a little blurb under it saying something along the lines of what I did or how the experience helped me?

2. I just graduated college, but a lot of the stuff on my résumé is still from when I was in High School. Stuff like High School clubs, some volunteer things, Soccer team captain. Should I keep this stuff or take it off? In college I didn't do much in the way of clubs and such, because I was focused on grades. 

3. My work history is very weak. I had a job in High School as a Soccer Ref and then as a Grocery Store Cashier. I also had a brief internship in London, England working for a non-profit. The High School jobs obviously aren't very relevant to my career aspirations now that I've graduated, whereas the Internship is relevant and taught me a lot of valuable skills even though it was only for a summer. Should I include all of the jobs or just the internship? Should I expand quite a bit more on the internship since it is the most important?

4. Languages. I took Spanish all through high school and a couple of years in college. I would say I was Intermediate when I stopped taking the classes, but that was a few years back and I'm quite rusty now. I also had a year's worth of German classes. Is it worth putting them on the résumé? How should I list it so that I wouldn't be expected to be carrying on fluent conversations.

5. Thoughts on an ""Objective"" section? Personally I feel like they seem a little generic and for specific jobs where you feel they are necessary a tailored cover letter is probably a better option.

Thanks for the help everyone. In a few days after I'm feeling a little more comfortable with the content of my résumé I will be back with an image so that you can actually see the formatting."

Looking into Master's in IO,bean154,IOPsychology,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/1bjakg/soon_to_be_college_grad_with_a_ba_in_psych/,"I'm at a pretty confused point in my life. I have no idea what I want to do as my career! I really am late in the game for applying to grad school because i'm in the process of trying to figure out what to get my master's degree in.

I love psych. I thought I was interested in social work but I realized that I just don't think i'm cut out for it (way too emotional). Also, I heard the money isn't really that good in social work, even with a MSW. 

So, i've been searching into IO. It looks very interesting; however I would love to learn some more about it from people who are actually in this field. 

Would anyone be so kind to tell me why they decided to go into IO? What does their job entail? What kind of skills do you need? What is the most interesting part of their job? 

Also, anything about the master's program for IO would be helpful! I'm basically still clueless about this profession.

Lastly, I would like to get an internship this summer; do i search for HR internships? I don't really understand the difference between HR and IO? I think the only way to know if i'm interested into getting a degree in IO is through an internship. "
1bja6z,1,2013-04-02,To PhD or to industry?,tamakyo7635,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1bja6z/to_phd_or_to_industry/,"I could use another sounding board, and Reddit, you're it. Be mean.

Me: I'm a 23 yr old master's student. I went to West Point for three years before being medically retired/forced out. I transferred to a small private school for personal reasons, and finished my undergrad in physics. Still at the same school, I'm now getting my master's in mechanical engineering (Master of Engineering (all my school offers, I'm the only mech grad student), thesis option).

My passion is structures and materials for aerospace engineering, and ever since first looking at what I wanted to do in/after college, I've known I wanted to design and build spacecraft (I know, I know, the aerospace industry isn't growing much right now). I've worked towards that (my thesis is in composites, involved in SAE Aero 2013, etc.), but I've been... under-performing. My undergrad GPA is crap (2.7), and after leaving the military academy, I lost direction a bit, and haven't been super involved in clubs or anything (changing that now, as much as I can).

My grad GPA will be fine (3.7 or 3.8), and I have good relationships with my engineering profs here, so I will have at least fairly good letters of rec.

So. While I want to get my PhD eventually, and I think I have a fair chance of getting into a PhD program (feel free to disabuse me of this notion), I know that in certain circumstances (especially right now), having your PhD in engineering can even hurt your chances of getting a job. And yet, doing PhD level research is still my goal.

On the flip side, I have some familial connections in industry (Boeing, mostly), and have fair chances of getting a job after graduation (August, or December if I land an internship this summer). Also, I AM technically a disabled veteran, so I have disabled veteran's preference for government jobs (NASA, Air Force civilian, etc.).

So what does Reddit recommend? To PhD program or to industry (assuming both are open options)?"

I am an economist of trade and one of the reasons I want this job is because I want to learn more about how to effectively use social media. I don't think they expect me to be a guru, but it would be nice not to be completely stuck if they ask me any pointed questions.

What I would really appreciate would be the following:
i) Links to some good and concise sources to read up on best practice in regards to creating a and maintaining a (profitable) media presence.
ii) Some insight into the latest trends in social media.
iii) Suggestions on how to do well on an interview in a very 'hip' firm.

All help would be greatly appreciated."

1bj5of,15,2013-04-02,[Request][53704] Heart broken and crushed. Boyfriend left me with bills and an empty stomach,MuffinTin,Food_Pantry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Food_Pantry/comments/1bj5of/request53704_heart_broken_and_crushed_boyfriend/,"I apologize ahead of time for the length, but I truly believe that without knowing the situation it might be hard to understand what on earth is going on (not to mention it makes me feel better).

Yesterday morning I woke up in an empty bed.  It's not unusual, my boyfriend of three years is usually at work by the time I get up as I work from home and he works 1st shift. What was weird was the lack of clothing in his dresser, his laptop was gone and several of my necklaces were missing from my open jewelry box.

I called him immediately assuming, perhaps stupidly, that we were robbed while I slept early in the morning. No answer.  I, stupidly, didn't call the police right away hoping that I could get ahold of my boyfriend and he would help me out.  At about 10 AM I got a text from my bank saying that funds had been withdrawn (we do this because we have a joint account for bills so we know when certain things are paid, etc).  Only this time it wasn't $100-$200, but the entire balance of the account $2,600 or so, mostly of my money which I recently received from a stipend for an internship I did.

Then I knew. He left me. Later that afternoon I called his parents who hadn't seen him and told them what happened. They had always been kind but suddenly they seemed cold and offstandish. I assume he made up some story about how I cheated or something. In reality I am a hardworking individual starting my own business selling vintage items and clothing and working with at-risk kids for a local non-profit business. I love (still do unfortunately) my ex dearly and recently moved here to accomodate his want to live near home.  Even though I work from home I clean the house, have dinner cooked every night, care for our garden and animals and budget money very well to afford small camping trips to places my ex enjoyed or nights out at his favorite places.

I haven't heard from him since and have filed a police report for the missing jewelry.  I went through his history on my laptop (which he uses when his is upstairs and mine is in reach) and found vaguely fishy usage on okcupid.com which is where we met three years ago and pages that link to a locked bank account profile at another bank that he never told me about (which I have no problem with except that's probably where my money is now).

I have no way to get funds currently, no family in the area (my mother lives about six hours away and is not in any shape to help me out), and I'm utterly devastated. 

So here I am, with rent to pay, utility and cell bills calling my bank and trying to figure out how this happened (I'm a fucking idiot that's how).  I have about $8.00 to my name until I get money from my e-commerce business which means I need to be able to sell stuff and spring is slow for me. I have a little food in the fridge but I haven't been shopping in two weeks or so and thursday is my usual shopping day. 

I am willing to provide any details, proof, etc you need and can even provide you will a listing of vintage items if you are interested in purchase. I know it's embarrassing to have to ask, but the soonest I will have more money is likely April or later and, honestly, I'm so overwhelmed even now all I can do is lay down with my dog and cry into his fur.  

I don't know what to do, Reddit. Not only would I sincerely appreciate funding for food through walmart or grocery store gift cards or however it might for you, but stories, words of encouragement or advice would really make my life a little bit better now.

TL;DR: Boyfriend left me in the worst of ways. Stole my money, jewelry, and self-esteem. Food and/or advice welcome.

I just wanted to share this with you since we need more happy here and I don't really have many people to tell.

Due to some family issues, I dropped out of high school at 16 and got my GED. I bounced around community college for awhile while trying to decide what I wanted to do, and finally got my AS so that I could transfer into the school I really wanted to go to.

It's been a tough few years - but I just accepted a well-paying  8 month internship as an information security analyst! There are very few women in my major, and it's been a constant challenge to be taken seriously. I have been told by several group members that before seeing my work, they'd assumed I had just flirted my way through my programming courses. It's sort of soul crushing to hear that about something you're actually passionate about and I started to doubt if I'd even hear back from employers.

Turns out, I received 2 fantastic offers and accepted the best one. I'll be doing security policies, intrusion detection and some network forensics work. When I graduate and have to look for a permanent job, I won't be so self-conscious anymore.

Don't worry fellow tech ladies - we can kick ass too. :)

1bixoc,1,2013-04-02,I got fired today. Just need to vent a bit.,Phalanks,venting,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1bixoc/i_got_fired_today_just_need_to_vent_a_bit/,"First off, hello ex-coworkers! Not sure if any of you read this subreddit but if so I guess you know my reddit account now. Anyway,

I work for my university's helpdesk. At the beginning of this year, we got a new manager from the corporate world, who promptly made everything so much more strict. Where we used to have 3 days to get a ticket worked on, which wasn't a big deal if you didn't in that time every now and then, we now had 72 hours exactly. One hour over? Write up. If you had to take a day off, just send an email at least the day before. Now it's 24 hours exactly or that's another write up. While I understand that in a corporate world, maybe exactness matters, we are a team of about 12 people with one manager. And it's a student job. My life after college is a bit more important to me than that job was so I put in more effort towards my schoolwork than towards the job.

Now, I understand that I may have broken policy by sending in a report late, but if I'm being honest, they are only going to have one highly technical person next semester. Everyone else can eke by on the easy tickets like setting up wireless or whatever, but if they get a more difficult ticket in, only one, maybe two, people will be able to handle it.

Also, my manager asked me to apply for next semester. So she's firing me, but wants me to come back next semester. Seriously? The worst part is that I'm most likely going to have to because I have bills that will need to be paid.

Maybe I'm being childish, but this just seems absolutely ridiculous to me.

Btw, I got fired because I turned in a report late, and I missed the 24 hour deadline to send an email telling the manager that I had to take a day off due to an interview for a summer internship (I told her about it verbally about a week before hand, and it was up on our internal website for about that long)."

1biu8h,3,2013-04-02,I know I'm not the only one struggling with my future.,enon1,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1biu8h/i_know_im_not_the_only_one_struggling_with_my/,"I apologize for this being so long, it's just me ranting for the most part. There is a summarized tl;dr at the bottom

I'm currently 18 in Michigan, a freshman in college, and I have nothing in life that brings any form of positive energy.  I didn't want to go to a university, I told my parents community college would be a better place to start as I would have more flexibility in deciding where I wanted to go into a career, without having to worry about insanely high tuition.  They decided I wasn't in a position to make that choice, and sent me off to a university (They practically did the application for me).  I didn't know any better, so I didn't argue.

After the first semester, I came home for break.  I was honest with my parents:  I hated it there, I had only a little interest in my major (CompSci), but I hated everything about the place.  I'm an introvert, so I'm always more comfortable alone.  I hate being told to make friends so I can have business connects in the future.  I hate being told to network and internships and it just bugs me for some reason, I can't put it in better words but everything feels so ""fake"".  I told my parents I wanted to find a job-training type of route that would take less time (such as taking up a trade).  They both tried to convince me otherwise, telling me without a college education, I was either going to end up in prison or homeless.

Anyway, after the first semester they told me I could explore other options, but I have to finish the year out, so I went back for another semester (currently doing this now).  I have no motivation to do much, I find myself skipping classes and falling behind in homework.  I just can't make myself care about this anymore.

Now what really frustrates me, is that I've researched all these different trades, and I just can't find anything that pertains to my local area.  I like the idea of being a machinist, or doing something involving technical data, or electronics or something.  I'd prefer not to do a whole lot of customer support type of talking, as I'm not a people person.  I'd like a predictable job where I go to the same workstation each day and I have a general idea of what I'll be doing.  Some job that is pretty much always going to be needed, and that I could move out someday and find work in another state (I want to eventually move out west somewhere).

As I was saying before, I can't figure out where to start with these kinds of jobs.  I live in a suburban area, with one community college nearby that offers some related trade courses, but I have no idea how one finds employment these days.  I can barely get hired at a minimum wage job for pete's sake.  I check online job sites, and I turn up with very little or vague descriptions of jobs.

And then there's the money.  I realize I may not make as much if I don't get a degree in college, but I'm surprised anybody can stay out of debt these days, unless you're making over $60,000 at least.  This is all on my mind 24/7 and my parents only tell me how disappointed they are, because I don't want to graduate from Uni.



TL;DR:  Going to a University is most certainly not for me.  The only thing that seems like my kind of thing is going into a trade, preferably working with technical things, and not so much heavy lifting, but I have zero clue as to how one gets into these things."

Seems like every time someone says something or mentions certain details, negative memories inevitably are triggered and I become miserable.

People say mean things and I get pissed off. Then I use negative coping skills and do self-destructive things (someone called me a fu%$ing idiot on reddit so I went and engaged in self-destructive sexual behavior.)

I'm so agitated by external stimuli. When someone's opening a wrapper, when someone makes too much noise, I just want to hit them.

Couples drive me crazy. I hate seeing their happiness. I hate that I will probably never find a long term relationship because I am so messed up in the head.

I almost got into three car accidents this week because I was so manic and irrational.

My job and school performance are suffering and I can't concentrate at all. I've backed myself into a corner.

I work at a psychiatric hospital, so I feel like I can't reveal my disability to anyone because they will think I'm incompetent or unworthy and then take my second year internship away from me (currently in the first year of internship.)

My parents piss me off to no end with their judgmental comments and hovering.

I forget everything. My short term memory is gone.

I hate how it seems like people are so hateful toward gay people. I didn't choose to be a gay man, I hate it when people say ""it's a choice."" Believe me, I wouldn't have selected it. The whole ""sin is sin."" ""hate the sin love the sinner"" sh%$ pisses me off. It's patronizing.

All I want to do is stay in the library and hide. I just want to isolate myself. I can't stand people, I can't stand being in public.

Lately I feel like I'm either agitated and pissed off at the world or extremely depressed and hating myself and my life.

My medications don't work well and I can't get an appointment to see my psychiatrist till the end of April.

It's hard for me to make friends because I'm so socially awkward and I guess people don't want to embrace some of the bizarre things I say. The things I say USUALLY aren't socially inappropriate, but I guess they are usually off topic and considered ""abnormal.""

I just wish I could be balanced and settled. I wish I could be performing well and well organized. I wish that every day I didn't feel like I screwed everything up and my life is over (at 28 years old.)

I'm tired of the hypersexuality. It's annoying.

I just want to blend in guys, I just want to blend in, but that's not possible. No wife and kids, no stable periods, no nothing.

Blah."

Should I know something about his work visa that would give me an area of the job market to look at? I feel like I'm just not looking in the right place or asking the right questions.

I just turned 25 today and I'm a bit freaked out these days, since I really don't know what to do with my life. 

I'm a young graduate in business. I'm currently doing an internship which is not interesting and underpaid, and with no hiring perspective. I have no boyfriend, I don't have my own flat, I don't know what job I'd like to do. 

I only have 1.000€ on a savings account, which is not enough to go travelling extensively. 

I really, really don't know what to do with my life. Any clue ?

EDIT: Thanks a lot for all your answers. I was expecting a lot of ""do what you like to do"" stuff, but got actually pretty good advice and feel slightly less anxious about next moves and career plans."
1bik2i,3,2013-04-02,Who has overcome Burnout,endlesswhitelines,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1bik2i/who_has_overcome_burnout/,"first off, english is not my native language, so forgive me my mistakes i'll possibly make.

as i want to keep it rather short in order for you not to read for hours, i want to begin with shorty stating my situation:
i am 25, male and have had episodes of depression for about 14 years now. but not until about 14 months ago, my symptomes changed from having those feelings of sadness etc to complete emptiness and numbness, which goes hand in hand with extreme procrastination. i was in therapy back then when this burnout syndrome started and was given SSRI-medication, which helped me getting things done, but my emotional live didn't change (and since i moved to another city i had to stop therapy and quit the medication). i've always felt huge pressure from my parents when it came to stuff concerning school, which after all these years i sort of 'internalized', even if i'm free from their judgement, since i am at university now. and now, i have these huge issues with learning for exams, doing homework etc. It's a kind of vicious circle, where i feel this pressure of doing some work, so i procrastinate, and therefore the pressure gets even bigger, which in turn ends up in more procrastination and so on. i've now come to a point of almost being completely unable to do anything linked with university, even though i like the idea of studying and enjoy the subject (at least when there are not exams). and additionaly, the burnout led to the usual symptomes of not being able to enjoy things such as music, food, sports or being able to love. i have my few windows where i get 'normal' again, but it's rare.

typical suggestions to deal with burnout aren't doing anything for me, as i am doing a lot of sports, i eat properly, take rests, sleep enough, even meditate. and i exactly know why all this is how it is, but i cannot really change it; i can't quit university (but i am planning of doing an half-year internship in order to escape the whole learning thing and maybe get some new motivation)...


anyways, do you have any stories of how you dealt with similar symptomes? how did you get rid of that numbness? how did you start to getting things done again and enjoy live?"
1biia3,0,2013-04-02,"Reddit, how do I deal with incompetent interns that I am stuck with because of extreme nepotism?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1biia3/reddit_how_do_i_deal_with_incompetent_interns/,"Edit: Resubmitted cause I dun goofed.

I work for an independent game studio that does contract work with publishers to pay the bills, then self publishes games when the money is good. We don't have a flexible budget, and get a lot of use out of awesome interns from the nearby university, my new hires are not these people.
I've managed a coffee shop before, and a bar, so responsibility is normal to me, a long with handling difficult employees, but every one of my subordinates at that job was at least competent. What's worse, is that these two hires, (one unpaid intern, the other paid) were brought in through nepotism, and not actually interviewed. One of them is my managing director's nephew, and the other is the girlfriend of our systems administrator, the guy who single-handedly runs our network, and is extremely valuable to the company. How do I deal with an intern who is so awful at this job, and makes more work for me and my other team members, without any option to fire him, because he's my boss's nephew? (He was my personal intern the last month, he just went back to school, it was literally the longest month of my entire professional career.)

Here's the twist, the girlfriend is also my roommate, so is the SA, and she's also completely incompetent and useless. I only worked with her for a brief time before I moved into the company fully (when I was an intern and she was just finishing her internship) and when she left to go back to school me and the other two members of my team had to pick up her slack, which was everything she was supposed to do in the 3 months she was there, which made for a ton of overtime.
The worst part is that she has an extremely strong sense of entitlement, and wears her boyfriends status as her own, and since he's been here for 6 or 7 years she feels like she's god's gift to the company, like they are both irreplaceable 'veterans', I've been here for one year and I will be her team lead. At some point I just know that I'm going to have to correct her, like any normal leader would have to do, I'm going to have to lead her, and due to her strong sense of entitlement I see her very easily taking it negatively and personally, then I have to go back to our shared house.

Another bit of added information, I will be moving, but by that time I will have worked with her for 6 or 7 months, my husband and I both live in this house with the two of them and another coworker, it's just that moving in the area we live in costs an extreme amount (damage deposits are equal to 3 or 4 months rent, plus a 1-2k euro fee for the Realtor) of money and we have to wait until late summer/fall before we can escape the roommate situation.
Any advice? I've had subordinates before, but never ones that were so incompetent, and NEVER any that were so closely related to my boss, or so closely connected to my home life. Halp.

Edit: It's not really a 'how do i be firm' question, it's more about the fact that how do I handle it when 1 is my boss's nephew that he holds in such high regard and the other is my roommate that has the potential to make my life hell at home based on how I deal with it at work. "

The accident broke the cars wind-screen and dented the bonnet slightly.

Since the accident I have been constantly pestered by the driver's lawyers asking me to pay 6000EUR! for damages to the car.  I was sent a mechanics bill where it shows that the driver had everything replaced.  Wheels, mirrors, bumpers, all windows etc. Damage that was not caused by me.

I was advised to ignore any approaches they made asking for money, however in the past few days my bank account has been frozen and I have been told that unless I pay I can not enter my account.

Does anyone know of an English speaking lawyers I could get in touch with or perhaps is familiar enough with German law to advise me on what I should do.  

I'm conducting an internship here and the amount they are asking for is my entire savings from working in Germany.

Thank you for your help.

 After years of lurking I have come to ask for your help. I'm applying for a social media internship at a small company and have an interview tomorrow. I've got all my research together, made a snazzy little presentation and feel pretty confident that my knowledge of social media is up to scratch.

HOWEVER I'm not really sure about more technical side of things, like goal setting, algorithms and keeping up a consistant brand across several platforms. 

I know these are all things I should learn on an internship but I'm really trying to wow the socks off of this company and make myself sound indispensable. This subreddit has been an gem in my initial research, but now I just need these final tips and some advice.

**TL;DR**

1. How do I determine goals for promotion with social media, and what is a reasonable target for a month?

2. What should my first moves be should I get the internship?

3.    In your opinions, is Google+ good for small companies (this is my presentation title, just curious to see what others think!)

Thanks!

It's been 11 months of LDR fun for me and my SO. We see each other every 4-6 weeks for two days at a time (a week at most, one time). We went to college together and dated for 2.5 years before I took a job 7 hours away. She is now graduating soon and is looking for work in my area.

The Rant:
I just want her to get fucking hired. Somewhere, anywhere. But she can't get a break to save her life. She has to do an internship within her course study (hospitality, tourism, event planning) but everywhere she applies she gets some bullshit answer or let down. She applied to the internship program I got hired into. Denied. Requests transfers from the hotel she currently works at? Oh they aren't hiring until Mid-May and wont do interviews until that time. Other Hotels in the area? Nah. we aren't hiring. Another position at the Hotel I work at? You have to come in for a personal interview on a weekday. 

Seriously, this shouldn't be that hard. I'm sick just thinking of the fact of having to do the same bullshit routine every month because she might not be able to move here. I can't just pack up my shit and leave. I'm established and like where I work, plus I'm in a lease that I can barely afford because I'm expecting her to move in with me. 

Then, on top of all this bullshit of her trying to find a job, her dickhead roommate is calling her a dumb bitch anytime he fucking gets. She turns up the heat a bit in the apartment? ""You're a dumb bitch"". One of her guests uses his bathroom accidentally. ""You're a dumb bitch and so are your friends"". Seriously, I'm so fucking tired of feeling so useless. She's stressed to the max and now I'm stressed because I feel like a leashed dog that's watching it's owner get the shit beat out of him. This distance can suck my dick, I'm tired of it. I just want it to be over and have her back again and happy. I also want her to have a good job so I can stop feeling so guilty that I'm holding her back. 

The End.

With this one, my parents have been trying for years.

They've consistently attempted to set me up with girls ever since it became obvious I'm incompetent at romance. (The last time I ""picked"" one, she was a Kentucky basketball fan; this should explain everything.)

We'll be sitting at dinner, and they'll bring up some girl who commented on my Facebook wall, or the ex they loved to death, or some nice intern from my mother's public school job, or almost anything else capable of bearing human children and being a Protestant. This whole process will be over and done with after a few weeks of somewhat lovable nagging about their lack of grandbaby prospects. I'll laugh at their attempt, eat their food, drink their non-alcoholic cider, sleep in my high school bed, and drive back to university the next day. The next time it comes up, it'll be another weekend, a new girl, another fit of borderline derisive laughter, and so on.

With *this* one, though, they've been consistent. This goes beyond my college days, even beyond my high school days, back to my childhood when puberty started and my beard flowered into glorious full bloom.

Let's call her Megan McCarthy. I had met her before, when I was eight. There was great chemistry, especially considering she was told she had type-a diabetes the previous week. Really great time.

Actually, I don't remember this at all, but *my parents do*, and they assure me that she's, ""not like that anymore."" No, not the diabetes, but the not wanting to talk to anyone because you're eight and were just told you can't have cake again.

Consistently, over the years, every half year or so, they bring up this girl to ensure that the memory of my parents casually reminding me that Megan isn't a sad, angry, eight year old girl anymore and is a good marriage prospect becomes permanently fixated in my mind.

Lately, they've ramped up their efforts substantially. Over the past year, they've been reminding me about Megan, and how well she's doing in Louisiana, especially her creative writing program--you're a writer too, you'll get along so well--and she's even going to that fancy private school you *really* wanted to go to but couldn't, and, *from what her parents tell us*, your personalities are very similar, very creative and quirky. She watches *Doctor Who* too, remember that. Her parents, the McCarthys, you remember them, are so generous and kind; Mrs. McCarthy is an author; you'll get along great with them.

I grow *suspicious*. There's some future tense verbs and pronouns being thrown around *far too casually*. They're making plans. It was the first I had heard of communication between the two camps. I must be on my guard. In response to this resolve, I do the obvious solution to avoiding the situation entirely by looking up Megan on Facebook, browsing a few of her pictures and looking at her About page.

She's cute. She likes *Avatar: The Last Airbender* and *The Brave Little Toaster*. She's wearing an absurdly tall brown top hat in her profile picture.

*Really* cute. Adorable even.

I am mortified.

The next day, Mrs. McCarthy sends me a private message asking if I've ever heard of this fiction publishing conference that just so happens to be hosted in the town her, her husband, and her family live in and, wouldn't you know it, Megan is coming up from Louisiana too--you'll enjoy meeting her--and if you're able to attend we'll let you stay at our house; here's a scholarship application.

I start searching the house for the dowry. After finding nothing, I return and send her a message thanking her for her generosity and hospitality, and that I would think about it.

Later that night, my parents ask me whether I want to go to the writing conference. I hadn't told them anything about the offer.

They're all in cahoots. There's a bag on the floor and its cat is nowhere to be seen.

In that moment, sitting at the dining room table, staring at my parents, while my little sister beside me is stifling laughter, already knowing where this was going, I knew I was in too deep. So, I laughed *hard*, big booming laughs that could be heard beyond the kitchen walls.

I'm a writer. This was too ridiculous a premise to miss. I have to go through with it. It's going to be awkward. It's going to be amazing.

I fill out the application, complete with a required resume, a writing sample, and summary of literary accomplishments. I've been published once, so I don't have to write that shameful sentence: ""Seeking first publication."" Still, I'm trying to convince these people to give me around five hundred dollars. I didn't know it before I started filling this out, but this conference is kind of a *big* deal. Tons of agents, authors, and publishers are coming in from New York to Colorado just for this conference. I looked at the guest list and saw people I recognized, authors I remembered friends reading during my high school years. If I got in, these people would read my work. So, knowing I had to give it my all, when the application asked, ""Are there any other reasons why we should consider you for this scholarship?"" I answered:

&gt;My mother and father are scheming with family friends, who are attending your conference, to set me up with their daughter. If you don't help me attend, you would rob me of the greatest creative nonfiction opportunity I've ever had.

The next week, I get a reply from the scholarship committee.

I've been given a full ride.

I post the news on Facebook and within *seconds* Mrs. McCarthy posts a congratulatory comment and sends me a private message with plans to pick me up from the airport in Colorado Springs, that I wouldn't need to bring anything besides toiletries, and, since scholarship awards require volunteering for the conference, she assures me that she would assign myself, herself, and Megan to banquet room duty together.

A few days after that, Megan ""shared"" an article I posted about conditions in North Korean concentration camps. We talk a little bit about that, and we just might share some commonalities in concern for social justice.

It's been just over two weeks since then. Tonight, there was a new development. Mrs. McCarthy posted this comment on a status of mine:

&gt; Hey [Immaneuel], FYI: when I take you to the airport after the conference, we'll have a literary agent in the car (Pam van Hylckama Vlieg), and an author/actress (Amber Benson, who used to be on Buffy the Vampire Slayer). Just thought you'd want to know if you'll be conversing with them!

At the end of this story, there is going to be a car with myself, a cute girl, her mother, a literary agent, and Tara Maclay.

That's the situation I'm in, PLounge."

Many have been misses, but a few have called in for interviews. After a few interviews with this one company, they made me an offer to come ""intern"" within their business consulting division. Great! I was happy to finally have something set for myself straight out of college when I graduate this May 2013! However, they neglected to mention one important aspect: salary. 

""You plan on moving and will be living in D.C? Great. We will pay you minimum wage.""

Excuse my aggressive tone, if it is, but how dare you companies do this? How can you expect a fresh-out-of-college student (whether or not I have loans) to work and live in one of the most expensive cities in the world for minimum wage? 

Recently, someone posted a chart of how many hours someone in D.C would have to work just to pay the rent on minimum wage. Not sure the exact amount, but I believe it was somewhere between 80 or 90 to 120 hours. 

What of those political careers that expect you to work as an ""unpaid intern"" in places like D.C?

I realize it is an employer market right now, but this is literally taking advantage of young individuals who just want to make it in life.  


""Students who acquire large debts putting themselves through school are unlikely to think about changing society, Chomsky suggested. “When you trap people in a system of debt . they can’t afford the time to think.” Tuition fee increases are a “disciplinary technique,” and, by the time students graduate, they are not only loaded with debt, but have also internalized the “disciplinarian culture.” This makes them efficient components of the consumer economy.""

As someone who has neither the skills, capital, or infrastructure to implement this idea, does anyone have any advice on what avenues I have available?

I would like to potentially present it to others, but have no idea on how to go about preventing them from just taking it for themselves.

It was supposed to be 70 degrees today so my friends and I were set on going to the beach. We packed the necessary supplies (bowl, 2g's, eyedrops, munchies, grinder) and scooted on out. We smoked a fat bloint on the way up. I say bloint because it was way too big to be a joint, but not quite a full on blunt. All I know is it was some incredible, top notch herb. 


By the time we got to the waterfront, I'm peaking at a [9], barely able to function. It was chilly out at this point (3:00 in the afternoon), so I bundle up in a little cocoon on the beach. Total tranquillity. Eventually we walked around for a bit, got pizza and ice cream and candy, and juggled a soccer ball with some guy tweeking on crack at some sketchy makeshift carnival. At this point it starts to rain a bit, so we head out. It's 7:30 at night and I'm still coasting at a [6].


So now to the bad/scary/awsomeinretrospect part. I'm chilling in the back on the way home. We pass by a cop car on the side of the highway, but don't think much of it as we were going below the speed limit. 30 seconds later, however: blue and red lights. My biggest fear. The four of us in the car yelled a collective ""fuck!"" We pulled over quickly and tried to pull ourselves together. The girl driving nearly broke out in tears. Two cops came up, one to the driver side and the other on the passenger side. Both shined lights through the windows. The backpack with all the weed, grinder, and bowl was sitting right by the passenger seat. The cops looked around and asked for her license and registration. We still had no idea why this was happening, and being high made the anxiety 420x worse. Our lives and wellbeings were flashing before our eyes. My relationship with my parents, college plans, and summer internship all held in the balance as the one cop marched around the car with his flashlight. 

Two minutes later, the main cop comes back. 

He says, ""Your headlights were off,"" gives us the license and registration back, then goes back to his car.  

Not only did we have cannabis and drug paraphernalia, but it is also illegal in my state for someone under 18 to drive more than one non-relative. The driver was 16. That alone warranted a ticket and/or search. 

Instead we screeched on out of there, laughed nervously, and lost all composure. My whole future almost changed tonight. Be safe out there ents!"

I did not get a practical reason as to why other than ""budget cuts"". Apparently now I won't be able to start until May 6th.

A couple days ago, she messed up one pie, and they fired her on the spot... Just ONE pie... 

I feel like the real reason for firing an otherwise perfect employee who was literally working for free is that they never intended to pay her...

1bh6l5,2,2013-04-01,Want an idea of my chances (Electrical Engineering PhD aspirations) (xpost from /r/GradAdmissions),k3blu3,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/1bh6l5/want_an_idea_of_my_chances_electrical_engineering/,"Hi guys,

I figured I'd post here as well just in case some other have any input. It's a bit long, I apologize.

**Backstory:**

I graduated with my BSEE from a small reputable school in 2011. Since junior year, I realized I really liked signal processing, and I landed an internship my junior year summer at a large defense contractor doing signal processing. After school, I went to go work for a (different) defense contractor also doing signal processing, very R&amp;D focused group with tons of PhD's. I left jobs after a year and a half (got an offer that was very tough to refuse) and now also still do signal processing at a different smaller company (also R&amp;D oriented). I am currently doing my MSEE part-time at a well-ranked university through their distance education program part time. I've been on the fence about PhD for awhile (about six months), but about a month ago something inside me pushed me over the edge and I really want to apply for programs for next fall. I plan to finish my MSEE (non-thesis, courses only) before then.

**Education Statistics**:

Undergrad GPA: 3.2 (school was tough, major GPA is slightly higher)
Masters GPA: currently 3.5 (hoping to push it up to 3.7ish by application time)

I took a lot of advanced courses in signal processing in my undergraduate studies as well, which I'm hoping will show my passion and dedication to the subject.

GRE Scores:

Math: 780
Verbal: 630
Writing: 4.5

**Publications**:

My notable publication was from an R&amp;D program that I was working on at the company I joined after undergraduate studies. I was able to get it published at a peer-reviewed conference in the intelligence community, and also gave a conference presentation. I worked on it with two other people, but I am first author.

I did some pretty significant undergraduate research in signal processing related applications as well, although I only entered some IEEE student competitions and did fairly well (no real publication in a peer-reviewed journal).

**Recommendations**:

When I left my first company after undergraduate (where I was able to publish), I left on very good terms. I'm planning on getting one recommendation from a guy who ran the entire group I worked in (boss's boss) who helped me publish and knows my skill-set and my contributions very well. He is also a PhD in signal processing from MIT, which is my #1 school. 

I'm planning on getting a second recommendation from a professor who I am on extremely good terms with from undergrad (we still talk often online) who supervised my undergraduate research. I think he can speak well of my abilities from an academic perspective, and I'm going to tell him to heavily emphasize the research I did (although it was not officially published).

I'm unsure who to get as my third recommender. Since I am doing a distance education masters, I really don't have that much face-to-face interaction with any of the professors, and I'm not doing research or extra projects for them. Should I get another recommendation from my undergraduate school, or should I try to get another one from work?

**Schools I want to apply to**:

Mostly all the top-ranked schools: MIT (#1 choice), Stanford, Berkeley, USC, UCLA, Princeton, Columbia (maybe a few others as I decide later on)

I feel like my entire schooling and career so far has been leading up to this moment. I haven't wanted something this bad in a long time. I feel like having been in an R&amp;D oriented industry has really opened my eyes to research and my future career prospects. I really do like my job a lot, which is why I feel like I either want to go to a top-ranked school or not pursue a PhD at all. My question to you guys is: am I being delusional? Do I actually have a shot at getting in to some of these schools, or are my credentials not good enough?

I am also working every angle, utilizing every network, and doing preliminary research into different professors so I can send them some e-mails over the summer and see if they would be interested in working with me. I am also applying to the NSF fellowship and the NDSEG fellowship.

Thanks for reading.

As we mentioned in the application, this position is all about having a ""get things done attitude"" and right now I really need your help getting something done. Specifically, we are making some big decisions in the coming weeks about Artsicle's next steps and need as much input as possible from artists all over the country. We've created a survey to be used as a baseline for interviewing artists.  I've included details below - shoot me a note when your interviews have come through. 

&gt;Details: Interview 6-12 artists located in the US (but outside of NYC). There are about 20 questions in the survey below, which you can ask in person or on the phone, or you can email the survey. We don't want to blast this (no social media please), but you can cast a wide net to friends, family, hometown, etc and the type of artist can vary as long as the work is visual (vs performance). 

It looks to me like the company is trying to use eager intern applicants to conduct free market research. I don't mind writing a few pages or completing a small task to show off my skills (start-ups routinely give a real-world performance test), but this is taking advantage and perhaps the worst business ethics I have ever seen.

It is pretty rough. Sorry! I just finished my degree in International Relations and I'm looking to work for a couple of years to gain some experience before applying to some quality MBA programs. The jobs I've been looking at are mostly in either the Business arena or for NGO's/Non-Profits/Diplomatic Services. It is also worth mentioning that the Resume is 1page long in Word, but for some reason slightly over in the google doc.

Please give me any advice you can!

That said, there are a few areas in particular that I would like opinions on:


1. Font/Formatting. I really just kind of winged it here. Is the Font too big or small? Is they layout particularly poor?


2. Do I need to put the years I was getting my degree next to the degree in the education section? When I tried it, it looked cluttered and I wasn't too happy with it so I removed it.


3. How much coursework should I put in the ""relevant coursework section? I tend to tailor the courses listed to the job I'm applying for so it will in most cases be about half of what I have listed for you all. I think its necessary to list at least some as it shows knowledge of the field that I can't really convey with my week work history.


4. The skills section is a little unusual, but it makes up for the work history a bit and allows me to flesh out my character a little bit more without simply listing some generic stuff like ""strong work ethic and desire to succeed"" that seem a bit cliche to me. Thought? Should I have just gone a more generic route?


5. Old jobs. Aside from my internship experience, I worked as both a cashier and a Soccer referee. Neither are directly relevant to my career aspirations now. Should I include either of them? Just leaving the Internship made the section seem even weaker, so I included the Referee position as it seems to show some coordination and management ability. The people that interviewed me for my internship also liked it.


6. Is my year placement on my work history ok? It seems kind of strange to me, but I couldn't figure out a better option.


7. Should I say ""Intern at a Global Non-Profit""? That was my job, but I'm not sure if it is frowned upon to actually say you were an Intern. I could just use the title ""Global Non-Profit Peace One Day"", but then it makes it seem like I was more than an intern for Peace One Day (name of the non-profit).

A distant friend used to work for CDW out of Chicago in Sales and his experiences were nothing good, despite making 70k.

This sounds like it is all about money, and really I am just trying to make some decent cash while I grow my skills. I honestly want to be involved in dev/DB/BI kind of work, but it is easier said than done it seems. 

My only job offer in dev/BI/DB field so far is some $11/hr internship that doesn't even offer benefits. With a title like ""Business Intelligence Solutions Engineer"" I may have expected a little more than $11/hr.

I am a college grad in my mid-20's with several years of end-user support experience - and finally I have been growing skill sets in deployment/administration/management at a managed service provider, but of course this is not the kind of work I reallllly want to do (despite getting better at it everyday).

Help a college grad out guys, I know you are a good bunch of people."
1bmeem,5,2013-04-03,"CLPT: Grades are important, but they definitely aren't the most important part of college.",megthegreatone,CollegeLPT,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeLPT/comments/1bmeem/clpt_grades_are_important_but_they_definitely/,"College is a transition period. It's the time of your life where you get to practice being an adult before you're thrown into the real world. You may hear people boast about grades, complain about grades, and talk about grades like they're the only thing that matter. But I'll tell you this: 10 years after you graduate, you won't remember what grade you got in orgo, nor will you care.

I recently had a conversation with a friend of mine who was convinced that the average GPA at our university was a 3.6, and she was feeling inadequate about getting B+. That really didn't seem right to me, so I talked to my academic advisor and he informed me that the average GPA was in fact lower than a 3.2 for our school. 

As long as your grades are above a certain threshold (usually 3.0) or you have to have a certain GPA to maintain a scholarship, the actual number doesn't matter much. Here's a list of things that are more important than your grades:

* Networking - getting to know your professors, especially if they are in the field you want to go in to

* Learning - the knowledge you gain is more important than the difference between an A and a B

* Discovering yourself - you are young, and college is the time to try and figure out what you want to do. If it takes you longer, that's fine. If you already know, that's fine too. 

* Experience - get jobs. Get internships. Do independent studies in the field you're interested in. Explore other fields. Do research. Build your resume. All these are WAY more important to future employers than your GPA.

* Having fun - I can't stress the ""you are young"" thing enough. Some of my friends NEVER have fun and do no extracurriculars because all they ever do is study. But a little secret: you can have fun AND do well in school. A 4.0 is not really that important, and you will regret not taking every opportunity your school had to offer.

So for all you fellow college students, just remember to not kill yourself over getting a 4.0 - it really honestly won't matter that much. Should you skip class all the time and slack off on all your work? Absolutely not. But are perfect grades worth not enjoying yourself or taking advantage of everything you can? Absolutely not.

You don't have to be perfect. You only have to be happy."

But, I know we will both have to start committing to a long distance relationship once this summer break begins. I really despise this because it reminds me of last summer when he was working here in the States and I went to intern in Taiwan. We didn’t see each other for three months, and it made me really upset. I missed him so much everyday that I felt I wanted to die. 

Starting this summer, he said that he would visit me, but I know he’s a workaholic so he’ll rarely have time to spend with me. He’s also very frugal in spending money on airplane tickets. Additionally, he’s a type of person who would rarely say something sweet over text messages, phone, or webcam. But, he’s been really nice to me and took care of me really well. I’ve always knew that he would leave me once he’s graduated, but just the thought of it made me really upset every time I think about it. I know that he loves me and he’s not the type of person who would cheat on his girlfriend…but, is it really worth continuing dating him over long distance? If yes, what are the tips for staying a long distance relationship for a really long time? Anyone has the same experience and would share your stories?

It's life outside the hospital.  

Now other interns and residents may disagree, but my personal life has been crazy this year.  Here is a quick list of what has happened so far this year.  
1. My apartment exploded.  Literally.  I lost almost all of my stuff and had to find a new place to live.
2. I got eye syphilis.  Was sprayed in the face with amniotic fluid from an RPR positive patient.
3. Just about an hour ago half of one of my molars disintegrated.  I just went to the dentist 2 months ago.  Fuck.

I started crying while walking my dog, and then again as I reached for yet another beer from my fridge.

Earlier this evening when I got home from work to my filthy, smelly apartment, and started drinking again I realized I really wanted to talk to somebody. I can't talk to my family or friends, they all think stuffs been going so great the last two years and I don't want to disappoint them again.

So I thought I'd try just writing it out here. I haven't actually had any drinking problems through my life, but I have had some periods where I have been drinking too much. Not like this time though. Since late 2012 I've been drunk 2-4 times a week alone. Not going to lie, it's been fun and really creative. Though hard to hide from people at times. Not so fun tonight though. I haven't cried in a really long time.


Weird thing though. After moving to a new town two years ago I've been feeling really great. Full of self esteem, goals, funny and social, and just having a really good life as a student. I'm pretty good at what I do and landed a internship at a great place. I've been meeting some girls from time to time, actually supposed to go on a date to morrow. But starting to make up excuses for not to in my head.

I'm hiding in my room with my computer. Drinking and smoking. Smelling like shit since I haven't washed my clothes in weeks, just digging for old fresh sweaters when I have to see people. Today I ate a hotdog. My bills and debts are building up because I waste my money instead of paying them.

I should have had a better grip, and not have let my depression eat me away like this. I dropped out of one of my classes this semester too. I should have seen it coming, and I think I did. But I did nothing. I just want it all to go away and have the strength to shower, clean my dishes, pay my bills, clean my place, do some homework, go outside and meet people. Be the awesome guy I've been. Sorry to boast, but I have actually been really proud of myself before this shitty feeling came back.

Now I don't know if I'd rather die. It seems really hard, and giving up is so easy. Not going to do it myself though, but if it happened...

My head is cloudy and my hands heavy. Can't think about anything but insecurity about myself. I feel careless.

Much appreciation will be supplied!",Dante2k4,Portland,https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/1bm6tp/web_devs_of_portland_i_seek_input_concerning_cwes/,"Alright so, basically I plan on taking a CWE course at CCC for Summer term, but I think I misunderstood exactly what it was. My assumption was that I'd be given some kind of a position on campus that would give me experience in my field of interest.

Of course, as I found out, it doesn't quite work like that. The CWE is something where I have to actually *find* an employer to work for, paid or unpaid, over the summer, and that employer has to be able to work with the CWE instructor to setup some kind of goal or project or something like that. This has lead to a few questions on my part...

* Where exactly do you go to work if you're interested in web development? I mean, I want to help build/maintain web sites, and I understand that the way to *get* such jobs is to start off by interning... but once I actually thought about it, I realized I have no idea where I should be trying to intern! Where do you go to find these kinds of positions?

* What exactly *are* these positions? Currently I have a novice knowledge of HTML and CSS, and I'm learning PHP/MySQL, Dreamweaver, and Fireworks this term. I have *made* some pretty basic web sites, but I feel like the full-on creation of a web site is more something you do as a freelancer. So, when I'm looking to intern somewhere, what job am I actually looking to *do*?

* In regards to the CWE, how exactly do I bring this up with potential employers? I don't fully understand what it is myself, so how am I supposed to apply for a position, and ask the employer to work with me on it as well? Do I just say, ""Hey, I'm interested in this position, and I'd like to use it for my CWE credits at my college. Would you be willing to work with my instructor and myself to set some kind of goals, figure out what my ""project"" is, etc?"" Honestly, that sounds kindof vague.

* To those of you who have done a CWE, do you have any insight? A better explanation of what it is? Any knowledge at all you can share that might help me wrap my head around this task a little better?

I really want to do this, since I know I need to seek out internships to get experience and make connections anyways, but right now, I don't feel like I truly understand what it is I'm doing, or how I'm supposed to go about doing it.

Just thought I'd see if any Portlanders knew anything of this process and might be able to assist. Thanks!"

It is a state school, and I would be paying in state tuition. My father is paying for room and board, and some misc expenses, and I am responsible for books and tuition. The school has great placements in co-ops and internships so I am going to pursue them to avoid taking out the higher range of the estimated total debt. The university is highly ranked in engineering, has great programs, and is one of the most recruited schools in the nation as ranked by the Wall Street Journal.

From my research everything about the school is great, I visited multiple times and loved it. The bad part is I was offered no scholarships, and wont be getting any aid from the FAFSA because of a family situation this year. I only applied to in-state schools that offered engineering, the other schools are marginally cheaper, but aren't nearly as highly ranked or have as many support and supplementary programs. The average starting salary for engineers is $55,000 - $60,000. Considering this information is it fiscally irresponsible to commit to a college in which I know I will take out at minimum $50,000 in debt? Any other advice?

Note: I would take out max federal stafford loan amount over the four years($27,000), and the rest would be from private lenders cosigned by my father.

TL:DR Am I making a mistake in going to a University that will put me in $50,000 - $60,000 of debt?

I just can't imagine staying in those places for more than the ~2 weeks a year vacation time from work.  I get that many people in this subreddit quit their jobs etc etc but in a field as quickly moving as computer engineering, I'm certain ""I was dicking around in southeastern Asia"" isn't a very good excuse for a 1+ year gap in employment.

I am 19 year old sophmore in college majoring in computer science at UMD-CP who was originally doing the army rotc path. Thought about doing ARNG/USAR but there is much more limited branches, less organized/laid back compared to their AD counterparts unlike the USMCR, I also I heard the reserve forces you to select jobs within local units and then go to the subsequent MOS school. The AR contracts are also less flexible, and doesn't have the same prestige/tradition.

Anyhow, what makes me interested in the reserves is simply that it allows the flexibility to pursue a civilian career while in the military. I'm lucky to have nice job prospects and current have a well paying internship from a big company you guys probably all know (an ISP), and opportunity/offers for more (one being microsoft), not trying to brag btw just trying to describe weight of this factor. Also because of family, I think I should stick around the area for awhile to take care of them. 

**TLDR; 19 yr. old rising college sophmore; Computer Science Major, did arotc, but bleh, wants to do SMCR to also pursue civilian career**

Also a nice coincidence is that I live in northern Virginia, only about 35-40 min north from the Quantico Marine Base.

**Questions/Clarifications:**

(1) One thing I'm confused about is how the SMCR reserve officers are commissioned, I've only heard for a fact that OCC-R is the most common path after selection, but what about PLC? If you do PLC in college, when/where do you indicate you want to be a SMCR reserve officer? Is OCC-R less competitive than normal OCC/PLC?

~~*(2) How long is training? I read that its 12 months total of OCS-TBS-MOS including waiting periods? Are you paid and does it count as time in service?*~~

Answered below by patriot_1776

~~*(4) After successfully completing training, is it true that as an SMCR Reserve Officer specifically, you get the option of going on a deployment with the Fleet Marine Force? What does this mean? What is the FMF, where would you deploy and for how long? Is it like normal deployment to the middle east or do you get stuck on a boat for a whole year? Is pay same as AD? I want to be deployed at least once or twice. (apologies for my ignorance)*~~

Answer: Yes this is true, qualified SMCR officers get to go on a deployment right after training for up to 12 months to gain experience (found in the SMCR document).

(5) Is moving up in rank in the reserve from O-1 to O-2 and O-2 to O-3 roughly the same amount of time as an AD officer?

(6) My cousin was an AD enlisted marine for 4 years, then instead of going into IRR for a full 4 years, he did 2 years in reserves, then 2 IRR and became SSGT all while attending university. Can SMCR Officers do something similar? Stay in reserve instead of IRR for as long as you want until the contract expires, without extending to a new contract? Is this a paperwork hassle?

(7) How do SMCR Reserve Officers get selected for their MOS? Make a preference list of local units' open positions? Do you get interviewed? I would be interested in the LAR Infantry and MI units at Quantico or maybe COMM units elsewhere near my area.

(8) Any Reservist Marines, particularly officers out there, please tell me about your experience, what you like/dislike about it, and how much you balance civilian/mil-reserve life. Are you looked down upon for being a reservist?

(9) Do you think AD would be overall better for me?

Any other words of wisdom and advice will be much appreciated. I hope I didn't come off as being an naively cocky guy who thinks getting a commission is a cake walk, because I don't. I accept that there is a great chance of not making it and they are currently cutting in force-size, but I will do my best. I'm ~158 lbs, 5'9 and the last APFT I had a 270 flat, highest I got in rotc was a 275?, what should do more physically to prepare for OCS?

1blpuc,2,2013-04-03,How to establish FWB relationship with girl I've already hooked up with?,unionmade,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1blpuc/how_to_establish_fwb_relationship_with_girl_ive/,"So over the summer I started an internship and developed a liking for one of my co-workers (though she was in a different department) we went out frequently as a group to bars, clubs etc. and flirted all the time. She had a boyfriend though and while I wanted to hook up with her didnt want to cross that boundary, the last time we danced (in which we knew we wouldn't see each other for months) she was all over me more than usual, we were pretty much dry humping on the dance floor (although what other kind of dancing is there nowadays)

Fast forward to last week, we havent spoke in months and I receive a text from her, she tells me she's in town and wants to meet up for drinks, we meet up, and the flirtatious environment returns rather quickly, speed up a few hours later and we're hooking up in her hotel room.

Thing is, she is moving to the city where I currently am but I moving to another city for work I'll be down every few weeks to visit friends/family and would like to see her and hookup whenever I get the chance, how do I go about establishing this? "

I was hoping some of you could help me by telling me more about the cities, climate life and how relative safe they are.

1blm5l,3,2013-04-03,Young biology student who needs advice from r/biology,marvin_ate,biology,https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/1blm5l/young_biology_student_who_needs_advice_from/,"Hello r/biology, 
I apologize for the wall of text, but I would really appreciate it if someone would respond to some of the questions I have.
I am a 3rd year biology major at a large university in the southeastern United States and I will be graduating a year from now (hopefully with a minor in entomology). My science GPA is a 3.80, overall 3.93, if that even matters, and I study like I’m going to med school (OK, maybe not THAT hard). I have enjoyed learning about the natural world since I was very young, and have wanted to become a biologist since I was 8. So far, I still want to become one, but I’m not sure yet what field to specialize in. It has been my goal to go into research and discover cool new things about ecosystems, organisms and biological solutions to people problems. At least, that is what I tell people. However, I have many worries about the future (what adolescent doesn’t). 

Since starting my undergraduate experience, I have sought out research labs to get a feel for the academic environment. I volunteered and worked two years in a forestry lab, helping a PhD student phenotype wood cores, and trying to be as involved as possible in the creative process of streamlining data collection, as well as data analysis. Currently I am volunteering in an ecology lab, looking at the ecology of tree epiphytes, after having decided forestry/forest resource management is interesting but maybe not something I want to do.

First of all, I am not sure what field I want to go into. I like entomology, mostly because bugs are easy to use/manipulate, but also because they are really cool. I like thinking about community ecology, population dynamics, solutions to problems in pest management, but also evolution and organismal ecology and behavior. What kind of thought process do I need to have to work out what I should focus on? Do I need to know yet? Does it even matter? I assume it is based on connections that you gain while working as an undergrad, that turn into internships, etc.

Second, the field of academic research scares me. I hear from people that it is a competitive, sink –or-swim part of academia. That being said, I get mixed signals for my PIs and professors. While they work hard, a lot of them have a very laid back way of approaching life and they seem happy doing their thing. As someone going to graduate school and beyond, what should I expect from starting out as a lowly graduate student? Obviously nobody starts out with tenure at a big name university, so what is life like, as a grad student doing research in prairie grass ecology (for example). Can a PhD student sustain himself and maybe a family? Or are you a stressed out sexless wreck like those medical students I keep reading about over at r/medicine. I don’t expect this to be the case, but you never know.

Third, for some reason I am very anal about things like data, and how it is collected. For example, when phenotyping wood cores, the x-ray images are very grainy, and identifying resin canals is hard. Sometimes you have to make a call and say ‘yes, I’m counting that as one’. How do you justify your research when data is collected that is so subjective. I mean I’ve heard the phrase ‘science is triangulating over multiple fallible perspectives’, but for some reason I feel like I’m just sitting there, wasting time, money and brain power. This is part of the reason why I want to probably go and do something more quantitative than assigning mites in tree foliage to a feeding guild based solely on some amateur entomology knowledge (which was the lab I’m currently in).  

So to round up my ramble, a few more questions: 
- What do I do with my life? Seriously though, how did some of you come to be where you are now, and what personal mindset/questions brought you there?

-  Do I need to stop bitching about data, and just get with the phenotyping?

- How do I academia? Seriously, at what point do people start becoming competent at even writing an academic paper, let alone coming up with fantastic ideas for research projects.  I feel like I am in kindergarten learning ABCs compared to people a couple years into their graduate program, writing comprehensively and efficiently. 

- Is it strange to feel humbled and utterly stupid next to people who made the connection between property values on the northeastern coast and snail-eating crabs in salt marshes?

- Where should I Xpost to for maximum response?

tl/dr: need advice, from fellow biologists, on my future.

I love my job, and I love to share it with people, and I try really hard to be a good team lead/boss/supervisor, because I've had a lot of shitty ones in the past and I know what's like to be at the bottom of the food chain.

I recently moved accross the continent, to a new job, at a company run by a former collegue that went under and is wavering back into it's prime. I am one of two managers in my department, and it is my job to lead new hires and interns. Because we just moved, we don't have a ton of money in the bank, so we made the decision, albeit reluctantly, to move into a roommate situation so that we could save more money faster and then move into a house.

My roommates are all coworkers at the company, and they are all fine except two, lets call them S and E. S has a very important roll at my company, he's been there for 7 years and is extremely valuable, they don't want to lose him, S is awesome, we need S. E is S's girlfriend, she used to work at the company before she went back to school, she did a horrible job before she left, and when she did leave, I started, and me and the others in my department had to pick up all of the work she did not do.

E rides on S's status in the company, and has an extremely strong sense of entitlement, even though she has contributed very little to the company itself. Recently, she was hired under me by the managing director because, in her words, ""they don't want me to take S away from them, and they need help.""  (Okay, I'm also ranting about annoying roommates like I'm in college again, how sad is this &gt;.&lt;)

Anyway, because we live together and because she isn't any more pleasant at home, I am finding it extremely difficult to be assertive with her. If we didn't live together i would really have no problem being firm, and/or guiding her, but since she is my roommate, and a very entitled, egotistical person, who really seems to not realize that I am her supervisor, I'm just not sure how to go about it.

I don't want to embarrass her, or humiliate her, or risk her taking what i'm saying as personal offense, and then go home to an air of awkwardness and tension because of what happened at work, but suddenly I'm just at a loss. Has anyone dealt with this before? 

Sorry for being a huge baby, I've just never been in such a weird situation before. Any advice or shared experiences would be sweet. Thanks for listenin'!"

Ladies... ladies are you listening? They were **amazing**! 

Sooooooo nice. Answered all of our questions (we had a two page print out), showed us the birthing area, and spent over an hour with us. Even nicer, we asked about how we contact them after hours, how they felt about questions, etc. She said they are available 24/7. Email, phone, whatever. She said something to the effect of that's how it is when you are pregnant. Hubby and I just exchanged a glance and she said ""No? Have you had an issue with that?""... So I launched into the current drama and general shittiness of the other office. She was appalled. But ladies THEN.... she was so nice and comforting and says that in her opinion, the baby is almost certainly just fine, and was just reassuring in general. 

So anyhow, we are waiting until we get the HcG results to give her our final yes or no, but we both want to start going there. Oh, and! They are only going to charge us $2500 instead of the $4000 we saw on the website because they are connected to a midwife school and we are agreeing to let their intern help with my care. (So two midwives and an intern instead of just the two midwives) My freaking deductible is $2000 alone. We are happy, and will be happier when we know for sure the baby is ok."

We will have two, and the duties will be basically focused primarily around maintaining a working environment for all our trainers.

1bkvxj,3,2013-04-03,Looking for advice from the graduate ECE students,Beignet,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/1bkvxj/looking_for_advice_from_the_graduate_ece_students/,"First off, it's long, so if you make it through to the end, thanks for reading. 

I'm a undergrad at Georgia Tech double majoring in EE and applied math. I'll graduate at the end of the calendar year, in the fall semester, Dec 2013. I always thought I'd go to grad school, once I figure out what I'd like to focus in. I still don't really know, but at least I have a better idea and I'd still like to go to grad school. I wanted one summer away from school so I've been applying to internships, but haven't been accepted to any, and it's really made me question my aptitude, and now I'm wondering if I can get into grad school here, or elsewhere. 

The more I think the more obstacles I find. I don't speak up a lot in class, so a lot of professors don't know me, so the list of people I can get recommendations from in short. I'm more involved in my math classes, and I've been working on getting to know my professors this year, though I've still got maybe two good recommendations. I also don't have any real research experience. I spent a little bit of time at a professor's lab, but I was more of a code monkey, and didn't do any real work. So when people say research, I still don't really know what that means. I have two other internships that were spent at a small company doing work I also became disinterested in. And since then I got really discouraged at my major and had a few other life issues, overall making me a little depressed and unmotivated. 

What I do have is an alright GPA, about 3.7, which supposedly puts me pretty high up here. It would be higher, if it wasn't for a semester where I did really badly (3 C's made for a 2.3 that semester, and a 3.55 cumulative). I'm afraid that'll show up badly on my transcript, but literally every other semester has been 4.0s or close. Instead of research I've also been a TA every semester I've been in school, just not in ECE classes, but various MATH courses. I've also been involved in IEEE for the past year, doing various projects and competitions, which looks good for employment but I don't know about academia. I'll also have a buttload of classes completed. It's at least 2 majors and a minor's worth. That took nearly taking the maximum allowed credits every semester, so getting those 4.0s weren't easy. If getting into grad school is about work ethic I'd like to think I've got that in spades. 

Still, I'd definitely do it over differently if I could. Take some less classes, be more involved. I'm pretty sure I could get the required GRE scores for here, and most schools. Can I redeem myself with the above? I understand it probably means no funding, but I would definitely try to get funding if I could first get in. 

Also, I wasn't planning on taking classes this summer, hence trying to find internships. But now that's not panning out the way I want it to, so I thought I'd take one or two classes to lighten my load in the fall, all the while doing my own side projects and study for GRE. I would also ask to do research with someone, but is that asking on short notice?
 
Basically anything anyone can tell me would be great. And thanks for reading. "

1bkpy7,1,2013-04-03,Job Search Advice,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1bkpy7/job_search_advice/,"Let me start from the beginning. 

I graduated in May 2011 with an Associate's in Special Business in Computer Systems. My only job experience at this point was the internship from the program. I found a job through a temp agency in June, doing Internet call center support for CenturyLink, making $10 an hour. I have an hour long commute, each way. In Feb 2012, they hired me as full time, and bumped me to $11 an hour, and in August, I got promoted to level 2 support at $11.36 an hour. Last week I got a raise to about $11.85 an hour, but that was just a yearly cost of living. At this point, there isn't much elsewhere I could go with CenturyLink. I live in York, PA, and since New Years I have been searching for better paying jobs. 

The real issue is, I don't see many decent IT jobs in York, and the ones I do see all require tons of experience, or experience with things that I am not even familiar with. When I was getting my AA, we learned a lot about Server environments, but since then I feel like I have forgotten most of what we learned. I kinda feel like what I really learned was how to google things efficiently and learn as I go. CenturyLink gave us paid training, is this common with some companies? I am worried that I will end up getting a job and then being unable to perform it since I won't understand the software that the company uses. I am 22 years old, I feel like I should earn more than this with a degree, even just an AA. I am starting to consider going back to school for a Bachelor's in Computer Science or maybe a Business Degree.

I have mainly been looking online (spending several hours a week just searching every site I can and submitting my resume to most positions I feel I could qualify for) and I hear nothing back. Is there a better way to go about this?"

1bkkns,7,2013-04-03,Being stressed has made me a jerk,biggfist_69,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1bkkns/being_stressed_has_made_me_a_jerk/,"Hey guys,

I've tried posting this under another acct but it keeps getting stopped by the filter. I'm hoping if I'm more succinct it will post.

I'm in grad school, I have a part time job, and I feel overwhelmed and very stressed. I feel like things haven't been going my way. 

When I finished undergrad in 2009 I couldn't find a job like a lot of people. To keep things short, it took me 2 years to get to the point where I wanted to be career wise. I worked at that job for a year, didn't really like the way things were going, so I went back to school to change the direction of my career. 

I told my wife that I could find a part time job and things will be better in the long run. The job was front desk graveyard shift at a hotel. I work over the weekends. It's been really hard on me because I never sleep adequately during the day and I feel bad physically all weekend because I lack sleep.

This year at school, my consulting group put me on a ""performance improvement plan"" because of my attitude. (Usually this is reserved for people who do a bad job with respect to quantity and quality of the work they do.) But not me, I managed to be put on one because 8 other people thought I was a douchebag. I also just got chewed out by the professor that I tutor for because I led a tutoring session and some people complained. I thought it went really well but I guess people didn't like it. 

I have really struggled with finding a summer internship. It feels like 2009 when I got out of school the last time. I am really afraid of not finding an internship and not being successful in the long haul. This is the biggest thing that's stressing me out. The companies I was really interested in weren’t interested in me. And I’ve told myself that I’m not going to make the same mistake I did when I was in undergrad. I’m going to network, I’m doing to do internships, and I’m going to make sure I have a decent job lined up when I get out of here and that will be my top priority. Well as I said I’ve been struggling. I feel like once I get out of school I will be in the same position I was in when I finished undergrad – struggling to end up with the job I actually want. 

This weighs on me because being successful is important to me. Call it vain, call it shallow, that’s what I want. Some people want kids, some people want to devote their life to worshipping God. I just want a good job. That’s what I want at this stage in my life. 

Please help me feel better or give me advice anything you think might help. "

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[What does infrared astronomy help to observe than other methods?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96ttl6?context=5)|Looking in the infrared is awesome when your sources are enshrouded by dust, which prevents you from observing in the visible of ultraviolet wavelengths.
 |There are large quantities of dust inbetween us and the galactic center (we're on the outer parts of the Galaxy so think of the spiral arms). So it's impossible to observe the center in visible wavelengths; however, in the IR we're able to see through all of that dust and find out what's going on (see the picture!)
[Does the same principle also work with radio telescopes? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v567?context=5)|Yup! And with radio telescopes you can observe in the day.
[How much do you get paid to do this, and if I want to be you; how much time and money do I have to put in? Also, are these all from tax dollars?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vabs?context=5)|I get paid pretty comfortably. But keep in mind that this is coming right out of undergrad so not technically having a real job. I know my friends who pursued careers in business are making much more than I am.
 |The time and money is all pretty much put into going to undergrad and doing good there. Unfortunately, most people don't have that opportunity which always leads me to wonder about all the brilliant minds that are out there that go on never fulfilling their potential (sorry that was a bit off topic)
[What altitude do you fly at and why can't you preform the same operations from earth?  Also can you tell us what were looking at in the first picture?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96u0yw?context=5)|Ah, sorry for not being more descriptive about the picture. It's the inner 20 lightyears of our galaxy! That ring that you see is a ring of hot dust circling around the supermassive black hole 4 million times the mass of the Sun in the galactic center. Those bright Y-like streamers are streamers of dust and gas falling into the supermassive black hole.
 |We fly at altitudes greater than 4000 ft to get above the clouds. This is key! We can't perform these same operations on land because the clouds prevent us from observing in the infrared.
 |Also, since it's not a space-based observatory we can make changes/upgrades to the plane very easily since it comes back home everyday.
[Where can we find more pictures?  It looks like a giant pissed off flame ouroboros, and I need to put that fear to rest.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v8dl?context=5)|Haha, here's another image of it in the radio ([Link to ircamera.as.arizona.edu](http://ircamera.as.arizona.edu/NatSci102/NatSci102/images/sgra_lg.jpg))
 |Notice that we see the full ring in the IR, as opposed to that radio image!
[Wouldn't the movement of the aircraft screw with the pictures?  How is this compensated for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vsz2?context=5)|The German-made telescope assembly is really well done, and effectively isolates the telescope from movements of the aircraft.
[Wait, it's a picture of sagittarius A?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vo66?context=5)|We can't actually ""see"" the black hole at our wavelengths. We can see the structures that have formed from its gravitational influence. The region is referred to as Sagittarius A West.
[Why do clouds stop infrared light, but dust doesnt? Well its obvious that the specific wavelength interacts with the watermolecules, but why? What makes water special compared to the dust?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c97nhxb?context=5)|You've got it right that it has to do with the specific wavelengths that are absorbed by water. But different molecules have different absorption properties. Dust grains in space will block UV and optical light much more than it does infrared light because of the different wavelengths (infrared light has longer wavelengths than UV and optical light).
 |However, if you have a dense enough concentration of dust, it can even block out the infrared light.
[Wow that is amazing, thanks for sharing! Is there a website with these photos? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96w6iy?context=5)|[Link to www.nasa.gov](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/SOFIA/13-010HQ.html)
 |There will hopefully be more in the coming year!
[How does it work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96typ2?context=5)|SOFIA is really an amazing feat of engineering. It is literally a 2.5 meter telescope mounted in the fuselage of a Boeing 747. The project was in the works for over 10 years since they had to strip down the airplane and retrofit it with new electronics to operate the telescope and run the instruments made for it.
[I worked with a guy that helped to engineer the telescope mount in the back of the aircraft. Nothing like digging an old 747 fuselage out of storage and adding extra structure to support massive amount of sensitive equipment. Or so I'm told.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v2ie?context=5)|Hah, it would've been cool if they just made an entirely customized plane from scratch.
[What exactly is your assignment on board?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v2ie?context=5)|My role on board is mainly just to look at the data form our camera in real time to make sure things are looking ok, and also to do some quick image analysis.
[How quickly is that, as in how fast paced is your work? Do you get a new image every few minutes or is it somewhat slower? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v5vi?context=5)|It can be really fast-paced, especially since we're essentially at the will of the pilots and the flight path. This means we can be looking at a huge series of images over several minutes, but we also have some downtime when the plane is changing directions so we can look over our data.
[That's cool, I would've thought I'd be slower than that though. Thanks for answering. Another question, how long is your typical flight? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v85u?context=5)|About 10 hours. It's pretty much a red-eye flight except you're landing in the same place you took off.
[""red-eye""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vvb6?context=5)|Haha it could be.
[Do they charge you extra for the telescope? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v5kl?context=5)|We actually get reserved observing time on it! but we can't touch it or we get in trouble.
[How do you feel, knowing that you're sometimes Higher than Snoop Lion ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v7oz?context=5)|Like a G.
[How difficult is Astronomy to get into, such as work load, study time and other courses you decided to do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96ui02?context=5)|You typically major in physics in undergrad, which can be a lot of work. I'm actually done with taking classes but in my first year of grad school I was taking courses as well as TAing which took up a large amount of my time.
 |It's a lot of hard work but I find it to be incredibly rewarding both teaching and shedding light on the crazy unknowns of space.
[Will you come back and do an AMA when it's done?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96tyqu?context=5)|Sure! It might not be very exciting though.
[Can you take some pictures of the cockpit? I love the old 747 classics, especially the SP. I'm jealous you get to fly on one! And of course do amazing scientific work.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vp5o?context=5)|Sure, I can do that. They completely redid the avionics so it might to look a little different. There's actually a picture of it floating around some where...
[ off, very awesome! Second, what kind of camera equipment do you use up there? Has anyone used a DSLR like a canon 60da up there? As for the telescopes you are using, what are they? And how do they work? As for the photos, do you/your company stack these photos for a final image? Or are they just single shots?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96u8mx?context=5)|The camera is a one of a kind thing that costs millions of dollars. It has two 256x256 arrays that can image in the short and long infrared wavelengths simultaneously. They need to be cooled to a temperature of 4 degrees Kelvins (4 degrees above absolute zero!) in order to work properly. Here's some more information if you're interested, the camera is called FORCAST ([Link to www.sofia.usra.edu](http://www.sofia.usra.edu/Science/instruments/instruments_forcast.html))
 |The telescope is a German-made 2.5 meter telescope mounted in the fuselage of the plane. It's quite an amazing thing, it rotates on a single bearing and is isolated from the vibrations of the plane. So it's really awesome to see it in flight, especially in turbulence.
 |The image processing that goes into creating our images--keep in mind that our atmosphere emits heavily in the infrared and so it introduces a large amount of background which needs to be subtracted. The images are averaged over a large series of data.
[Do you guys come up with the acronym first?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96ub8b?context=5)|I actually have no idea.. I always thought it happens at the same time, like when you're writing a song and you have both the lyrics and the melody in your head if that makes any sense.
[If you could have picked the acronym, what would it be? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v60a?context=5)|I actually like SOFIA, but I'll think about it...
 |Ok how about ICARUS. Infrared... something.. Stratosphere..
[Well, if you take out the Infrared part, you'd be doing visible-light astronomy, which is often done from the ground, so you'd end up just sitting on a SOFA. Not nearly as cool. Therefore, leave things as they are and enjoy sitting in a plane for ten hours.  Oh, wait...  Anyway, the better acronym is GREAT (German Receiver for Astronomy at Terahertz Frequencies\), which discovered two new molecules not so long ago. One of them was OD, the deuterated hydroxyl radical, so my question is: How do they tell it's OD and not OH just by looking at spectra?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vist?context=5)|Ah, I haven't seen that yet. I believe OD will have different emission lines than OH.
[If any, what kind of training did you have to do for this job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96uabq?context=5)|4 years of undergrad as a physics major and several years of grad school. I actually joined the project right as our instrument was finished and being installed on the plane. So it's been a crazy experience getting involved with flying aboard the plane and doing some amazing science.
[Also, coke or Pepsi?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96uabq?context=5)|I don't really drink soda.. but coke.
[How much pussy have you gotten since the axe deodorant commercials came out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v4m0?context=5)|I'm pretty sure there's an anti-correlation between axe deodorant and getting laid*
 |*assuming you're not in high school.
[So wait you haven't taken the suit out to the beach yet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v6ng?context=5)|Nope, nor out to a burning building.
[I'm not an astronaut but I pay taxes and if you're not getting laid then it's time to start this country over. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v8m1?context=5)|Thank you for your concern, gnipeekitlaer.
[As a real and legit astronomer, how would you encourage young people that doesn't even understand your job and your contribution to the world, and how would you tell young people what could we achieve if there is more people in this area? Thank you sir. May god bless you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96uyok?context=5)|I actually went back to my old elementary school a year ago to talk to them about what I do and what it means to be an astronomer. They were incredibly bright and it's amazing how aware they are of what is going on in the field--I had several ask me about exoplanets and black holes.
 |I simply tell them that it's not the astronomers of this generation that are going to solve all the problems of the Universe.. It's their generation that will ultimately drive forward and build upon the progress we've made. Witnessing the look on their faces when I told them that was one of the most rewarding things I've experienced as an astronomer.
[What about the magnetic fields?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v9sl?context=5)|&gt; :(
[What can be learned from the pictures you will take up there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96uxn3?context=5)|That picture that I put up there is the sharpest image of the galactic center at those wavelengths. You see the clumpiness of the ring? It's not quite like Saturn's rings which appear more smooth. That's because something interesting is going on around the vicinity of the supermassive black hole and we're trying to figure out what it is.
[Also, how valuable would my background in development be? My guess is that it can definitely come in handy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96w5wr?context=5)|Having a background in software development will definitely come in handy, since a lot of what is involved in astronomy/astrophysics is running models and messing with data.
[What does your typical day include as an astro grad student and how long exactly is your grad program?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v2mf?context=5)|Typically people take about 6 years.
 |A typical day is really quite boring. I sit in my office in front of a computer and analyse some data.. Then at the end of the day I realize what I did was wrong and spend the rest of the night or next day redoing it. Rinse and repeat.
 |Somewhere in between, science gets accomplished.
[How do you handle calibration images with SOFIA?  I imagine the bias and dark images are the same as ground-based scopes, but how do you take your flats?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96uaa1?context=5)|Calibration as you can imagine is incredibly difficult, we take a series of images of different calibrator stars throughout the night using multiple filters to characterize any sorts of variations from flight to flight or from being at different altitudes.  Don't even get me started on flat fields... we've spent countless hours in the lab trying to figure out the best way to do this, but it the end it feels like we've just been chasing our own tail.
[What would your advisor say if he/she knew you were on Reddit? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96w8h9?context=5)|""your username is Ultraballer2000?""
[Why not chuck this  thing in space as a long term observatory?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v2ez?context=5)|Because we can have it come down everyday to do changes/upgrades to it. It's incredibly expensive to fly up to space to make repairs and changes to space-based observatories.
 |Ultimately, it comes down to money and fulfilling a method of observing that isn't accomplished by the other observatories out there.
[Thx for the reply, could your project be achieved with a budget comparable to Hubble, or is constant adjustment fundamental to the concept? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96v5q9?context=5)|The running cost of SOFIA is cheaper (but not by much) than any of the space-based observatories like Hubble, Spitzer, Herschel, or especially JWST.
 |That's why airborne astronomy hits that sweet spot between cost and getting above the atmosphere to achieve ideal observing conditions.
[What are the goals of the observations?  Are you looking for certain things in particular?  Is it possible to image other galaxies or is the focus on our little patch of stars?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96uwt2?context=5)|The goals in our flight tomorrow are pretty much just to run a series of tests with our instrument aboard the plane to make sure everything is in order. Our real observations are taking place in June, where we'll be getting more images of the galactic center.
 |As far as studying the galactic center, we're looking for an understanding of what's going on there. There's this huge ring of dust around it that is slightly difficult to explain. There's clusters of massive, bright stars--even one that's believed to be the brightest star in the Galaxy. It's an amazingly unique place in our Galaxy that seems to be full of surprises. The latest one being this gas cloud falling in to the black hole and is expected to be crossing its event horizon in January.
 |We have definitely imaged other galaxies, so we are capable of seeing things far beyond on own galaxy.
[ITT: People who don't know the difference between an astronomer and an astronaut.  He (she?\) is not leaving the atmosphere, guys. They're just hopping on a badass 747 that is a flying telescope. Still cool nonetheless.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vfms?context=5)|Haha thanks. It's way better than mixing up astronomer and astrologer.
[Whats the average flying altitude for your plane? Is it higher than most jet airliners?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vyab?context=5)|It's about 41000 ft, but I believe it can fly higher. It's higher than most typical commercial airliners.
[It's actually comparable, commercial airliners also can go up to 41000 ft.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96w5p8?context=5)|Yeah, you're right.
 |SOFIA can actually go up to 45000 ft.
[What is your worst fear, of what could happen? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vigk?context=5)|Worst rational fear would be that the instrument/telescope/airplane electronics fails and we don't get anything useful from the flight, which would push back our schedule and potentially my thesis.
 |Worst irrational fear would be that I oversleep and miss the flight.
[That Space Dragon in the first picture. How do you plan to destroy it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vhq0?context=5)|My side project.. but the jedi must never know.
[Let's say i wanna be an astronaut and I can't join the military because of a shoulder injury.  What would I need to be a good candidate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96uyyh?context=5)|I'm not quite sure. I've never really looked to in depth at the requirements to becoming an astronaut. I think NASA was looking for astronauts a year ago or something, here's a PDF I found just doing search on that ([Link to www.nasa.gov](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/pdf/606877main_FS-2011-11-057-JSC-astro_trng.pdf))
[How has being an astronomer helped your social life vis a vis relationships? In other words, have you gotten laid because of it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96uued?context=5)|I'm in an 8+ year long relationship so I suppose you can take that into account for both your questions.
 |I don't think she cares much for what I study specifically, but I know she supports the crap out of what I do.
[Congrats, man. Is she also in the science field?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96uyhi?context=5)|Public health. So she is actually pursuing something that directly focuses on improving peoples' lives.
[Will you be my friend? Also, what's your take on DOMA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96u1wa?context=5)|Haha, sure.

[What's your opinion on UFOs? :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vvi8?context=5)|There's gotta be life out there somewhere.
[Not exactly really specific for your job, but I'm extremely curious; How long did it take you to get your job? And do you ever see people that don't have masters or doctorates getting hired? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96tr6f?context=5)|I'm 25 years old and came to grad school right after undergrad (as a physics major). Most of the people working on the science have PhD's or are students associated with the project. We have several engineers on the project who designed our instrument from scratch, and I believe that doesn't require a masters. 
[Do you have a favorite space picture? If so what is it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vbgn?context=5)|There are so many awesome images, but I'm particularly biased to this one ([Link to www.mpi-hd.mpg.de](http://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/pages/home/som/2009/12/images/Som_12_09_p0.jpg))

[I think most people see pictures like that and think, oh cool, that's shiny and I bet here and there are some stars.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vkvp?context=5)|The small point sources are luminous stars and the extended features are regions of ionized gas that I believe are shaped by strong winds from the stars and the strong magnetic field in the Galactic center. 
[Do you or have you played Kerbal Space Program? I'm so addicted to it! That first time I got into a circular orbit was magical!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vomh?context=5)|I've never seen that before, but the trailer looks awesome..
[I'm surprised that SOFIA is viable, given that the 'scope has to a. track continuously; the vectors must be much more complex than a ground based instrument, b. compensate for atmospheric distortion as well, and c. run on a budget that includes aircraft maintenance, fuel, and flight crew. How can this be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96w3v2?context=5)|Airborne astronomy has actually been pretty big, but SOFIA is definitely the most ambitious project as of yet.
 |We don't have to worry too much about atmospheric distortion since we observe at longer wavelengths, but we do need to worry about the background emission from the atmosphere.
 |The project is employing lots and lots of people, so I think it's great that it's providing lots of opportunities for people (including myself!). You're right though, the costs are fairly high; but it still comes out to be cheaper than launching and maintaining a large space observatory.
[It has adaptive optics, right? i've always wondered how this looks in action. can you actually see the micro-mirrors moving?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vwxh?context=5)|Nope, no AO. I think there are some videos out there of the adaptive optics in action on some other observatories.
[Hmm, i must have misread this.. would make sense on a moving platform, no? anyways, have fun in the stratosphere!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96w58x?context=5)|We don't need to worry too much about atmospheric distortion in the IR wavelengths so AO isn't a necessity. it's always a good time up in the stratosphere.
[You're doing fantastic work! Is putting a 2.5m telescope on a plane cost-effective compared to the somewhat more stationary 10m Keck and 8m VLT?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vder?context=5)|It's more expensive than those ground-based observatories, but less expensive than space based ones.
 |We have the advantage over ground based observatories in that we don't need to worry about the weather or 99% of the atmosphere.
 |We have the advantage over space based observatories because we can fly home every night to do upgrades, repairs, or changes as needed without flying in to space. However, we don't quite get the ideal observing environment that being in space allows.
 |So I feel like it's a nice blend of the two. 
[Does mirror size always correlate to image/data quality? Is it possible to make smaller telescopes that can do the same things as the larger ones? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vcnj?context=5)|I like to think of telescope size like a bucket. The larger the bucket, the more water you can collect in a set amount of time. Same thing with a telescope and photons. And you want as much photons as you can get! Larger telescopes also grant you better resolution, but this also depends on the wavelength you are observing in.
 |It all ultimately comes down to what you want to accomplish. A series of smaller telescopes have been used to discover transiting exoplanets, so it really all depends on the kind of thing you want to do.
[Are you nervous about whats gonna happen when you poop?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vblw?context=5)|I've pooped on planes many times beforeso I feel like I'm ready for any poop-related challenge.

[Hello! This is just stellar \[excuse the pun :D\] to see an AMA on one of my future career choices. My question is, what more about our cosmos has this mission discovered as of yet? If nothing, than what is its eventual goal?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vriz?context=5)|The SOFIA mission is really just getting revved up. The image that I posted and the other images taken in that flight series tell us about the environment around the supermassive black hole in the center of our galaxy, which gives us an idea of what's going on in the center of other galaxies.
 |Ultimately, SOFIA's goal is to probe the Universe in the infrared wavelengths to reveal things in greater sensitivity and sharper resolution than most other observatories.

I actually only got interested in it in my sophomore year of undergrad when I had a conversation with one of my friends about how much we don't know about space. From there I went on and did an internship at a research institution and got a real taste for what doing research in astronomy is like and loved it.
 |There's this awesome sense of freedom involved in pursuing research, and as I mentioned in a previous comment it's incredibly rewarding.

I think we're starting to evolve out of the phase of finding exoplanets, and into a phase of trying to characterize them--to see if we can find one with conditions similar to Earth. My office mate is working a project involving exoplanet characterization, trying to determine the contents of an expolanet's atmosphere. It's really cool stuff and just shows you how close we are to finding the ""holy grail,"" a truly earth-like planet around a Sun-like star.
[What inspired you to be an astronomer?

The Germans did a good job with the telescope and isolating it from the turbulence experienced by the plane, but it still affects our images. This is especially true since the telescope is exposed to the air (there is no window!) so air can be trapped in the telescope cavity and introduce some noise.
[Do you have Twitter and would you be able to post some photos of it all? :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bi0wt/i_am_an_astronomer_flying_on_nasas_stratospheric/c96vvmo?context=5)|Nah, I don't have a twitter.

[Hope I'm not too late, but I'm planning on being an astronomer. I'm only fourteen right now. But I just wanted to know what your favorite part of the job was?

I've considered myself nominally heterosexual for the majority of these past few years and have only now come to re-question the way I am. 

Now, I say 'nominally' for two reasons: **a.** I've had more intimate relationships with males than I have with females and **b.** it was more of an unconscious 'default', if you will, rather than a self-conscious evaluation of myself. 

To elaborate on my first reason, it started when I was very young (perhaps 10-11 y.o.) and the son of one of my mother's friends and I began a relationship that lasted several years. As adolescence is wont to do, it changed things and we were no exception. After him and I quit seeing each other and hanging out, I had a couple relationships but nothing *nearly* involved and by the time I was about 14 or 15, I had ceased in having *any* sort of intimate relationships for a very long time. I suppose I tried to bury that (repressed?) part of my life until I finished high school. Then, when I was 18, I met a girl that was a bit younger than I and we sort of fell into a relationship. She was fairly open about being bisexual but my previous history was a secret until about 2/3 through our relationship. We dated just shy of 2 years when one day we ended it; we haven't communicated at all in the 8 months since then. 

Subpoint *'b.'* is where things start to become a little more muddled. You see, I had considered heterosexuality my default because (at the time) that is what my environment and circumstances dictated was correct. Subsequently, I considered my past and the inclinations/desires/etc. inherent therein to be a deviance that was just that, in the past. 

I guess things started really changing about 4-6 months ago and I started becoming more aware of myself being attracted to individuals who were 'non-conventional' (tomboyish females and more feminine males, for example). Those feelings and attractions have come to a head in three very *very* specific examples:

**1.** My best friend and I, whilst drinking *heavily* at Old Chicago one morning had a very deep conversation covering a myriad of subjects. This came to a head where we got on the topic of me and he confided in me that he thought I was gay. Now, I balked at the term but I thought there might be some truth in perhaps the term 'bi' as applied to me.

**2.** We had a younger intern start at one of my jobs on a different team and all I could think of was how attracted I was to him. Now, this feeling wasn't entirely unique in the raw feeling but what *was* unique was just how natural and quick the attraction came.

**3.** Now, this is where it gets real *real* sideways: I attended a party on Friday (my first after turning 21) and everybody proceeded to get shit balls drunk...including myself and my friend from number 1. Him and I are both IT workers in a corporate environment and we started talking about how shitty his small corporation help-desk duties were and how shitty my large corporation reorganization was. The conversation progressed and others ducked out not wanting to hear shop-talk. From there, the conversation progressed further into various relationships (his girlfriend, my ex, etc.) and we naturally got onto other inclinations. He returned to our Old Chicago topic more forcibly wanting to know if I am gay or not. I told him (truthfully) that I am not sure and he dropped a bombshell on me: he asked what I thought of him, as a sort of litmus test I guess. Alas, I can't recall exactly what I said to him but I will recount how I feel about him here: I would be lying if I said that I wasn't in some way attracted to him physically but emotionally he's too dear a friend to have that sort of relationship. He then dropped *Tsar Bomba* on me essentially saying that we could fuck as a 'one-time only' thing. It was right after that that somebody knocked on the door.

If they had come in, if they had needed me, it might have shaked out differently but as it happened they didn't. They muttered something and were clearly engrossed in something different. He got up to leave and I caught his arm telling him that what I was about to do was out of emotional turmoil; I kissed him. That's as far as I meant it to go but it wound up with us making the beast with two backs. 

So, here I am: confused but at peace, in turmoil but oddly happy, unsure yet inexplicably deliberate...I do love him but still just as a friend. But he *did* open a door for me I think. The problem is I can't see what's on the other side and can only barely make out what's behind me. 

Has *anybody* had an even *remotely* similar experience or know of somebody who has? And, if so, some insight would be greatly appreciated. Sorry for the wall of text and thanks. 

**TL;DR** Had formative homosexual relations then one real important heterosexual relationship which was followed by questioning and has culminated in me fucking my best friend. Words of wisdom appreciated.

**Edit:** Added the *tl;dr* and I am actually 21, not 22...I haven't slept much these past few nights due to practically mainlining caffeine and ODing on various metal songs..."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[Do you critique obits or know when a writer like you wrote it? Oh and do you always read obits since you write them?  I picture you on vacation reading an obit and thinking ""Ha, this is definitely hack work! Survived by!? Come on what is this 1999!?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c9586aq?context=5)|Ohhh yes! I don't read obits on vacation (I try to forget about work), but I do critique obits written by people I know. And even people I don't know. People in my area are really awful writers.
[Why do obituaries rarely tell what the person died of? I mean, that's really the only interest I have when I look at that part of the paper. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c957y9j?context=5)|It's up to the family and/or the funeral home. Most of the ones that I do include it. It's a personal thing, not a requirement. The reason we don't make it a requirement is because if the person dies by suicide, we don't want to force the family to include that information.
[I can think of many more reasons why a family would want to leave out the cause of death.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95llps?context=5)|Well yeah, of course. Our main reason is that we don't want to force the family to give out that kind of information, and that's the example we use when saying that it isn't a requirement isn't enough for people who call in to complain about the lack of a cause of death.
[People actually call in to complain that your obituaries don't include a cause of death?  What the hell.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c96upbe?context=5)|People love to complain. It's really annoying.
[Have you ever done this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c958718?context=5)|HAHAHAHA. No, oh my god that would be terrible. We make typos sometimes and when they're submitted they often have mistakes, but I hope that something like that would be caught before printing. Obits go through a pretty serious editing process before we publish for that very reason.
[Whats the most interesting obituary you've wrote?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c957us2?context=5)|Our best obits are WWII veterans because they are usually filled with little historical tidbits. I once did an obituary for a guy who served under Gen. MacArthur. I also did an obit for someone who was part of the [Caterpillar's Club](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterpillar_Club). The most interesting obit I did was a double obit for a married couple who both served in WWII - I think he was Marines and she was Air Force, but I don't remember perfectly - and died a week apart. Their obit was very long but it told a beautiful story of their life together. Brought me to tears.
[I have 24 hour window to post about the caterpillar's club before it is no longer a valid TIL. I wont post about it, but thank you for giving me the option.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95bybk?context=5)|You're welcome, though I think you should post it.
[How did you get the job?  How much does it pay?  Have you ever had anyone who was dissatisfied with your work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c957v8z?context=5)|I applied for it after seeing the notice online. I make $12/hour, which is standard for entry level positions at a small local paper in the midwest USA. We don't send proofs, but we do make sure that we print only the information requested. The only complaints I get are from readers of obits who are pissed that we didn't include a church's address (which may change the price, as our prices are based on length) or something dumb like that. They don't even know the person most of the time. 
[Let's be honest, finding a job at a newspaper in 2013 is nothing short of a miracle. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c959875?context=5)|Depends on what part of the country you're in, but yes. I'm constantly looking for a reporting job but I'm not having the best of luck. Our newsroom is full of young reporters though, and a lot of smaller papers are like that.
[Ever had to write/edit an angry obituary? Where the person who died was hated by their family, so the entire obituary was just about how shitty of a person they were? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c957pjl?context=5)|No, because we don't tend to print stuff like that. However, I have talked to family members that were angry they had to do an obit. They just wanted the basic information and said, ""If it wasn't for the fact she had a lot of friends here, I wouldn't be doing this."" They didn't even list survivors.
[Do they HAVE to do one? Why would they be angry about it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c959g21?context=5)|They don't have to do an obit, but they felt pressured to do it because she had a lot of friends in the area who kept calling and emailing them asking about their grandma. They just said that they didn't like her. I didn't get why because I didn't want to pry - could have involved abuse or something.
[Are obituaries written differently if the person dies from murder?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c957y4h?context=5)|Nope. The way obits are written are purely up to the family, funeral home and/or writer. And sometimes the newspaper. My newspaper is very affordable for obits, but bigger newspapers can cost upwards of $300 or more dollars just for two sentences.
[Why do they cost so much?  Does that include someone else writing it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95a7sh?context=5)|Because it takes up space in the newspaper, and that's valuable space. It's cheaper than an advertisement, but it's basically the same thing. The bigger/more popular the paper, the higher the cost.
[What's the most outlandish obituary you ever wrote/edited?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c957t9g?context=5)|We don't really get too many outlandish ones. I think the strangest one was for a guy who died after drinking a gallon of vodka everyday for 30 days. We didn't end up including that info in the final obit though (at the request of his landlord, who submitted the obit).
[Is it usual for a landlord to submit ab obit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95a988?context=5)|Oh no. Usually it's a family member - child, spouse or sibling - or the funeral home.
[I enjoy writing obituaries for fictional people who lived awkwardly tragic lives.  Is it possible to have my obits published in a respectable newspaper without confirmation from a funeral home or any other source?   ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c958tio?context=5)|I highly doubt it. We require verification at our newspaper, and we won't even begin writing an obit until we have verification from a funeral home, cremation service, medical school (in case someone donates their body to science) or someone else who handled the body. I'm sure that this happens at bigger newspapers too.
 |ETA: The main reason for this is to avoid angry friends or family members who submit an obit for someone who is dead to them, but still actually alive. I haven't had a situation like this, but someone I used to work with did. She ended up leaving the person who submitted the obit a voicemail and never heard back. 
[Does anyone ever request a negative or bitter obituary? If so, what do you do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c9584ty?context=5)|Never have, but we wouldn't print it, depending on how bad it was.
[What about negative sounding but positive intentioned?  ""SmartBacon was a salty old fart and the world is sadly a sunnier place without his griping, rest in peace friend.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95axeo?context=5)|We've never encountered anything like that, but we'd probably discuss it (our whole department and probably a senior editor) and decide. I'd say probably not, even though it'd be funny.
[Have you ever found out about a friend/acquaintances death from having to write their obituary?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c958a38?context=5)|I haven't, but my co-worker did. It wasn't a person he knew too well, so he wasn't broken up about it. I'm writing a short story about a person who finds out about his mother's death that way, though.
[Did you ever packed an easter egg /hidden joke into one of the obituaries?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c9599ki?context=5)|We haven't, but the funeral homes do sometimes I think. We had someone who died of an accidental electrocution and somewhere in the obit, it said, ""the world is now a dimmer place."" We lol'd a lot in the office at that.
[Do you ever get emotional when you are writing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c958dez?context=5)|I used to when I first started, but not anymore.
[Do you see death in the same way still?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c958qy8?context=5)|Not at all. Actually, when I first started, I used to have panic attacks if I thought about death too much. I didn't realize writing and editing obits would be part of the job until my first day. Writing/editing obits and working with funeral homes and mourning families has really made me more comfortable with death. It's just a thing, now. I still have panic attacks, but they're rare.
[I DO NOT WANT an obituary.  is there any way to make sure my horrible parents don't make an obituary for me even though they know it's against my wishes?  (child abuse, sexual abuse, you name it.  and i will die before them most likely.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95aros?context=5)|Put it in your will that you do not want an obituary printed in the event of your death. That's the only legal way that I can think of if your parents are still in your life and you die first.
[How did you get into the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c958ded?context=5)|I applied at the newspaper I work at. They had a notice online for it and I needed work.
[What is the most badass story the family asked you to put in the deceased's obituary?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c958slm?context=5)|We had an obit for someone who was part of the [Caterpillar Club](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterpillar_Club). That's super badass.
[What do you think of this man's obit? Link to imgur.com  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c959sj5?context=5)|That's really, really funny. I don't think we'd print something like that, but we would print ""He loved cars, guns, booze and women"" or something like that. There's some opportunity to have fun in obits.
[Why do obituaries need to include the names of the deceased's parents, even if they aren't still alive? I understand it could be for identification, but it seems to detract a bit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95a2p0?context=5)|We don't require it, but I understand why a lot of papers do. Obituaries were originally started for genealogical purposes. That's how families were tracked over generations and family trees were built. We prefer to have them in case anyone starts looking back into family history. Obituaries are an easy way to connect all of that. 
[Can you write a pretend obituary for me? I'm a 19 year old poor college student. You can make up my cause of death:\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95akv0?context=5)|Sure. I just need to know your gender identity/preferred pronouns and I'll whip something up for you.
[Awesome! I'm a male - don't really have preferred pronouns, just be as creative as possible.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95atrz?context=5)|Okay, give me a bit. I'll work on it.
[Good one..made me laugh. Someday I would rather have an obituary like this that makes people laugh. Maybe I should write my own to use someday in the future. Great AMA, thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95f7sg?context=5)|Thanks! I definitely suggest writing your own - or at least having an idea. The funny ones are rare but they're the best.
[Wow this is fantastic! What goes into this work and how long does it take you to finish someone's whom you do not know.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95fysx?context=5)|Thank you! :) We talk to the family member(s) pretty extensively. Once we have all of the necessary information, it takes about half an hour to write it up and edit it well. Sometimes longer, depending on how much information the families give us.
[Do you enjoy your work? Would you rather write about something else?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c9584hn?context=5)|My work isn't awful, but it isn't what I want to do. I eventually want to get into reporting.
[Can you please decode the common euphemisms? Like ""died at home"" is suicide. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c959qv9?context=5)|I think you're reading too much into obits. You can definitely die at home without killing yourself. Old people do it all of the time. A lot of people go to sleep and never wake up. We get calls on the police scanner all of the time. The only common euphemism is the way people say ""died.""
[Have you ever written your own obituary for ""fun""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c959bfz?context=5)|Nope! I refuse to tempt fate. I know what I want it to say, but I'm only 23. I'm not giving the powers in the universe any reason to justify killing me early.
[Why don't obituaries include cause of death?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c9587j0?context=5)|The family or funeral home doesn't include it. Many of the ones that I do include the cause of death though.
[Are you guys allowed to publish home addresses? We are not for liability issues. Also, do you guys have a special program that you work on that transfers the obits to the press? We have a program called Mactive. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95aeiz?context=5)|We will publish home addresses in certain circumstances, but we don't like it and we'll do our best to convince the family not to include it, probably for the same liability issues you guys want to avoid. Sometimes we just outright delete it. We receive obits via email, and then we put it into our CMS and start editing.
[Has anyone been angry about an obituary you wrote?  Why were they angry?  What happened?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95b0sn?context=5)|I get angry phone calls from readers who usually aren't related to the person who's obit they're calling about. They complain that we don't include the address of the church, or we don't clarify maternal grandparents vs. paternal grandparents, or things like that. I just tell them, ""if you know the family, you can call the funeral home for a rerun. If not, then you can just make sure that your obituary has all of that information.""
[Do you ever wish you didn't have a job? I mean, I know everyone dies. I'm not even a person that normally wishes less people would die (I see overpopulation as a very serious problem\), but a job like yours must be tough sometimes.  So, do you wish that a job like yours wasn't needed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95l589?context=5)|I mean... I don't want people to die, but at the same time I understand that death happens. I would like it if overpopulation wasn't a problem and we just all were immortal beings... but it doesn't bother me that I work with death, and I'm glad that my job exists. When people ask me questions like this, I think of like a robot/computer taking over my job, and that makes me sad for two reasons: 1) the families of the deceased wouldn't have someone to talk to about their loved one, which really does comfort them and 2) journalism is already hard enough to get into, getting rid of more newspaper jobs is more depressing to me than death.
[Is it true that you don't print the address and funeral time in the same Obit anymore?  I heard y'all stopped doing that because thieves would strike, knowing that everyone everyone would be out of the house at that time.  Any truth to this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95aipt?context=5)|At my paper, we generally don't like to print the home address of the deceased for that reason. We'll say if they lived in a nursing home or assisted living center. We also don't like to put ""Memorial contributions may go to this specific residential address"" for the same reason. Anytime a family member wants to print an address, we pretty much tell them all of the terrible things that could happen and convince them to let us take it out.
[Has this changed your sense of humour?  Do you feel you could cope with personal death any little bit more from finding yourself immersed in mourning much more than the average person?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95b37p?context=5)|Yeah, definitely. I'm a little more morose in my humor now. I think I'd still mourn a lot if someone I loved died, but I'd be able to go through the motions of taking care of arrangements a lot better than I would have a year ago before I started doing this.
[Have you ever thought about who you would want to write your obituary? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c959n6m?context=5)|I've told my coworker that if I die while we're working together, he and my boyfriend and parents need to work together on it, but to give it some personality. I'll eventually write it myself when I'm older, but I do feel some superstition about writing my own obituary at 23. I'm not trying to tempt fate.
[Have you ever got an unusual request?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95azwe?context=5)|Someone wanted us to just get all of the information from the hospital, which we can't do because of HIPAA. One person included that people could send memorial donations in her honor to President Obama's re-election campaign (this was last June), which is really funny regardless of your opinion of Obama.
[I research, google street view and contact the families of the deceased (i get the names from the obits\) to see if they have a quality used car to sell (they usually do as someone just died\) and always get a good deal. have you heard of anyone else doing this as their business?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95eqmc?context=5)|Nope, nobody around me does that as far as I know. I personally would be a little creeped out by that, but if it's working for you then keep it up. 
[How am I going to die?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95bjbm?context=5)|You'll have to write your obit to find out.
[Do you have any good stories about mistakes made in obituaries?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95auur?context=5)|My ex-co-worker once put her own birth date down for the birth date of a dead person, and the family thought it was funny. Most of our mistakes aren't funny mistakes, unfortunately.
[What do you want you obit to say?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95ao0u?context=5)|I want it to be straightforward (say I died rather than I went to meet my maker or something like that). I want it to include any of my accomplishments and career info and my family info. I don't want anything fluffy though - no ""she loved life and never knew a stranger."" I'll probably write it out as I get older.
[Have you ever got a fake obituary?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95b0va?context=5)|Nope. We tell everyone who isn't a funeral home that we need to talk to someone official who handled the body (funeral home, cremation service, medical school) before we can run the obit, so that prevents us from receiving fake obits.
[Are there other newspapers that you think have particularly good or bad obituaries?  Is there any particular newspaper whose obituary section you look to for ideas when you're stuck?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95at0s?context=5)|I think the bigger papers that write obits in incomplete sentences and don't include much information - especially their survivors and predeceased family members - all suck. I think people deserve a little bit more than that. I also think that most large papers charge too much for obits. I understand why, but they forget the point of obituaries when they charge so much and forget about at least including immediate family information (parents, siblings and children).
[Have you written/seen one like this?  He was my aunt's ""boyfriend."" Yes, we share it often. I almost peed myself when I read it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95ah8z?context=5)|I love when people include their pets (I assume that's the part you find funny) in their obit. That's a really funny way to list the pets - most people just say ""and their furry children, Fido and Fluffy"" or something like that. Our obituary style is a little different than that one. 
[It's actually the loved by two women part - and the pets. My aunt was ""the other woman."" It was creepy that they both went in on the obit. They also split the ashes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95b1zb?context=5)|Ahhh, I guess I read that as first wife and then girlfriend or wife after the first one died or they got divorced or something. That is really funny and a bit creepy, but hey, that happens! We haven't gotten anything like that but we'd run it for sure. No reason not to if that's what they want. I do think it's weird/funny that they split the ashes. Ashes still creep me out a little.
[I've read that at major newspapers, they write the obituary before a well-known person is dead, so that it's on file. While obviously you presumably are not at the New York Times or anything, have you ever written a obit (even as practice\) before the person was dead?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c959a65?context=5)|Nope, we don't do that. We get 15+ obits a day on average, so there's plenty of practice.

[My husband's mother died about a year ago and her ESTRANGED ex-husband quickly wrote and submitted an obituary without anyone's permission or input.  is this really allowed?  it seems wrong.  it was very painful for her children.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95g5mz?context=5)|Unfortunately, there's nothing that the newspaper can do to deny the estranged ex-husband from submitting the obit first (or at all). It's really best that we don't get involved with family situations. Situations like that do happen, and it's terribly, terribly sad. That's why we at least offer to run a second obituary at my newspaper. Granted it starts at $25 for the second obituary and goes up from there, but we do try to give families that option.

I like the people who write about their travels or their relationships with other people. My favorite obituary I ever partially wrote/mostly edited was a double-obit for a couple who died a week apart. Their obit was more of a love story, and it was so sweet. Their kids really paid a great homage to them.
[I have a similar job, but obituaries aren't the only thing I do. We've had competing obituaries come in before -- where the family is so divided that they can't agree on an obituary for a family member. Has that ever happened to you, and what were the circumstances?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95abn0?context=5)|All the time! Usually one side of the family wants it written a certain way, or they intentionally left out surviving family members that they didn't like. Our rule - which is the fairest thing we can come up with - is that the party who submits it first has the free option and then the second party has to pay a second day publication fee. Usually the second one is submitted a few days after the first one.

We tend to be humble and make it all about the family, but I think that's what makes the families and funeral homes we work with so thankful. I just try to treat people right, because it's the least I can do. Going through the death of a loved one is hard enough. If I can ease a small burden, I'm glad.
[Hows the job market nowadays?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95smq1?context=5)|Pretty bad.

That way, my spouse and/or children won't have to do much.
[How long are these obituaries usually? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1baymh/iaman_obituary_writer_and_editor_ask_me_anything/c95e6r5?context=5)|At our paper, anywhere from 3 column inches to 20 column inches. Most are between 6 and 10.

I like to know the cause of death. Some funeral homes that we work with a lot will call us and talk about the dead person though, so sometimes I get to find out even if it's not in the obit.
[I work at a funeral home and provide the information to newspapers for their obituaries. Rarely (in my area\) is the cause of death printed.

We get so many Christian ones that it's just a nice change sometimes to see a creative wording for ""died"" based on a different religion. There's nothing wrong with the Christian ones, I just like seeing things changed up.

[The problem with euphemisms is they are confusing to people, especially children.

I go to a large state school that deals with many companies, and have a list of potential political internship contacts (namely city governments and things). 

Is it weird and uncommon to email these contacts and simply inquire if they would take on an intern? Does anyone work in a company that has had HR interns now or in the past? If these contacts don't pan out is it unacceptable to just start emailing law firms and other companies that would most likely have a HR department?

I plan on going to grad school and getting my masters in HR, but I have always heard internships will increase your chances of being hired as well as your chances of getting into grad school. Should I not narrow my field when contacting these people and just ask for a general office internship as that will probably be easier to obtain?

1bk035,1,2013-04-02,Stressed and depressed.,throwaway766969,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1bk035/stressed_and_depressed/,"I want to avoid being too long-winded and boring here, which may be difficult because the way I’m feeling right now is just a conglomeration of stupid shit and first world problems. But I’ve kind of had a lingering cloud of depression hanging over my head for a few months and maybe this will help. I don’t think it’s serious. I just feel shitty a lot of times, and here’s my best go at explaining why.

A little background: I’m married, 25, in graduate school, no kids. When I graduated from college in 2009, I had a hard time finding a job like a lot of people. And I didn’t feel like I was setting my standards very high but in spite of that I still had a hard time landing the job I was aiming for. Long story short, I ended up with it, but it took me 2 years to get where I wanted to be and I felt like I should have jumped right into it after school. A year went by, I didn’t like it that much so I figured I should go back to school to attempt to change the direction my career was going. I sort of decided to do it on a whim, too. At the time, I was the primary wage earner between my wife and I and I said “Honey, I really want to do this. I will pick up a part time job, we’ll cut back and we will make it work. It will all be much better in the long run, I promise.” 

So I entered my master’s program last August and it has been a lot of work and pretty stressful. But I keep my head above water. They really load you up. And unlike undergrad where you can pick a schedule and it’s fairly flexible to some extent, my school basically said “here’s when your classes are, be there” and there really isn’t any other option. Classes would be like 10AM to 5 PM which didn’t bode well to finding an evening job or day job. To make things worse, I live an hour from campus so I spend 2 hours per day commuting on school days. 

The only jobs I could really find that would work with my school schedule would be working graveyard shifts. This is the type of program where you’re not supposed to do anything outside of school. “Fuck that,” I thought. “I’m harder working than most people. I can make this happen.” The dean who talked to me when I got admitted said just take out loans for living expenses, you can’t work more than like 10 hours per week in this program. I got clever and thought that if I worked graveyards I could squeeze in a bunch of work time. 

In theory, my working graveyards idea would work. It’s front desk at a hotel and it’s pretty slow when I’m there. They let me bring in my laptop so I can do homework while I’m working. 

Problem is, day sleep sucks. When I try to sleep during the days (on the weekends when I’m not at school) I will sleep for like 4 hours, wake up, and can’t go back to sleep. I feel like my weekends when I’m working these graveyard shifts are just a 72 hour period where I feel like shit and am sleep deprived. I usually work Sunday nights so that that it feeds into Monday morning and I go straight school. It’s hard to make it through Mondays. 

I’ve been looking for an internship for the coming summer and I’ve been struggling. I’ve applied to a ton and talked to a lot of people. The companies I was really interested in weren’t interested in me. And I’ve told myself that I’m not going to make the same mistake I did when I was in undergrad. I’m going to network, I’m doing to do internships, and I’m going to make sure I have a decent job lined up when I get out of here and that will be my top priority. Well as I said I’ve been struggling. It’s April now, I still haven’t found a summer internship, and that has been stressing me out. I feel like once I get out of school I will be in the same position I was in when I finished undergrad – struggling to end up with the job I actually want. 

This weighs on me because being successful is important to me. Call it vain, call it shallow, that’s what I want. Some people want kids, some people want to devote their life to worshipping God. I just want a good job. That’s what I want at this stage in my life. 

I feel like I don’t have time to spend with family or friends. I don’t have time to keep the house clean. I feel like shit all weekend, I go through weekends feeling like a sleep-deprived zombie. I’m not motivated to eat healthy and stay fit. I just feel like I’m half-assing everything in my life and I’m super paranoid about this graduate school thing not paying off in the long run.

Anyways I have a few questions:

* Is it difficult to get classes? 
* Does the school actively help you get internships? 
* What sort of reputation do SJSU Computer Engineers have (In terms of companies wanting to hire them)?
* What do you think of the Professors and curriculum?
* What do you find lacking or dislike about the computer engineering program?

I'm aware its a commuter school and that's alright with me. Frankly, because I'm a bit older (I'm 23) my goal is to get my degree and get a few internships under my belt as soon as possible so I can be a good candidate for hire by graduation.

I have taken classes in derivatives, portfolio management, modeling, and real estate finance that specialized in MBS. Please any type of advice would help. Thanks..

I'll be working with the marketing department during this time; when I was first interviewed I asked the interviewer what interns typically find themselves doing on a day to day basis, she pretty much told me that interns find their own niche within the company (some do research, some do presentations etc). Due to the short time period that I'll be there, I would like to make the most out of the experience and be as productive as I can in the most meaningful way possible. I plan to e-mail the HR tomorrow and ask what steps I can take to prepare myself for the three month period.

1bp231,0,2013-04-04,I [20M] don't think I'm in love with my girlfriend [19F] anymore.....,whycantIfeelit,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1bp231/i_20m_dont_think_im_in_love_with_my_girlfriend/,"Backstory: We met about 7 months ago in the city where she [19F] lives and close by to where I [20M] was living at the time. I lived about an hour from the city and taking a break from school for a semester in an internship. After meeting via mutual friends at a party, we chatted online for several weeks before meeting up again in the city for what would be our first date. We had sex that first night, my second time ever, and she became my first girlfriend (I never had any previous relationships, no time or interest and no success in my few awkward attempts, just a one night stand that never went anywhere).

For the next few months I would see her in the city every weekend after finishing my intern work for that week. We'd go out, and have tons of awesome sex afterwards. We're into all of the same shows, like the same music, and are compatible on pretty much every level. After two months like this, she says that she loves me after we return from one of our dates - we were both going to part ways for a month while she went home for her winter break and I prepared to go back to school, and we were both rather depressed about not seeing each other for so long. I was floored, but I told her I loved her back as well. Note, this is two months into the relationship itself, and three months after having first met. 

At the time, I really think I meant it. She's my first girlfriend, and emotionally I was experiencing a lot of different sensations those first few months. 

However, as the next four months went on, and I was back at school, I began to feel less and less intensely ""in-love."" Our current relationship is long-distance - we talk online almost every day, and still see each other most weekends, but we're a good five or six hour drive or bus ride away. I began getting a better feel for her personality, too, and there are things I'm seeing that I'm not liking - mood swings, too much self-pity and not enough self respect, etc. I'm also uncomfortable about several of the things she's said she's done in past relationships. And a million other little things as well. Habits I once saw as ""cute"" I'm beginning to find irritating. And sex is starting to become an issue as well - it's become more of a chore to work myself to climax in her. I'm also not going to lie, whereas in our first few months, I didn't pay attention to other girls, now that I'm back at school, I do find myself paying attention to other women a lot more than I previously did. 

So as of right now, I'm not sure if I'm in love with her, and I don't think I really am. But at the same time, I don't think I'm ready to let go - I do enjoy her company, and I care about her, and she's always willing for sex (even when I'm not). Even if I'm not in love with her, I don't want to end it, or I don't think I feel ready to end it.

Is it just my inexperience? Was I never in love in the first place and just inexperienced, or is it just the distance? She's been in two past relationships, and said she had fallen in love with her last ex, though admits she hadn't done it as quickly as she had with me, or as deeply, according to her. She admitted she had began to suspect she was in love after our first month together. I bring this up because with her experience, I'd think she'd know for sure, so it's likely that I think she's actually in love with me, or at least thinks she is. 

My ultimate question is if I can still make this work - can I be in a relationship with some one who loves me if I don't love them back? Should I try to make it work, or should I just cut my losses? Is it unfair? And should I tell her about the way I feel, or would she be crushed? 

**TL;DR I don't think I love my long-distance girlfriend of six and a half months anymore but she still loves me. Can I still make a relationship work or should I break it off?**"

I was on the premed train but now am planning on a career in Computer Science. I have been taking intro courses so far, and probably will end up with a minor.

So I have been offered two amazing opportunities considering my crap GPA, both CS, for this summer. The first is a summer internship with a local government. I will be using Microsoft Access, Excel and Visual Basic to analyze database information for their contracts department. The position is 12 weeks.

The second is an REU at Clemson University, for computational neuroscience, analyzing MRI scan data. I contacted the professor that I would be doing research with and know I am very lucky to have been accepted. This program is 8 weeks.

The stipends for both are around the same amount. Both are 40 hour work weeks. Both would definitely give very good recommendations/resume entries. On one hand, the first will give me real world job experience. For the second, I will get research experience which may help in applying for grad school. The first does not offer housing or food, while the REU does. 

I am still undecided about what I will do in the future with CS as I have not learned too much yet but hoping to get your opinions on which would be a better option. I am currently leaning towards the internship, just because I want some real world experience working in an office."

I'm a recent grad with an English degree and a TESOL certification-and I'm a native to the good ol' USA to boot.  On top of that, I even already have a bit (albeit only about 2 months from an internship in China) of teaching experience.  

My impression before beginning to apply to jobs was that I'd pretty much be the ideal candidate, as I was more or less led to believe that with my qualifications, I could have any job anywhere that I wanted.  What I've discovered, however, is that a majority of the jobs that I've been looking at that are posted on the various websites, or at least the majority that I'm really interested in, all seem to require at least 1-2 years of EXPERIENCE.  That's capped because it's such a damn naughty word to us recent grads of university in that it represents a real Catch-22.  How do I get that entry-level job that somehow requires experience if I don't already have the experience from an entry-level job? Hope that wasn't too circular, but you get the point..

So I guess what I'm asking is, how big of a deal would it be to stretch my experience a bit to fit the requirements of my employers?  I mean, do they even ever really follow through on the references you provide? It seems to me it would be a bit of a hassle for someone in, say, the Middle East to call someone in China about how long I worked there...
Have you guys had experience dealing with this issue?  
Just to add some perspective, I know for a fact that there are vast numbers of teachers out there who have gotten away with fabricating far more than what I'm thinking of doing---they've purchased fake degrees and fake TEFL/CELTA etc certificates.

Alright, so sorry for the long post, but what do you guys think?!
thanks in advance."

1bopg8,0,2013-04-04,Let's share stores about stalkers and the like...,[deleted],gaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1bopg8/lets_share_stores_about_stalkers_and_the_like/,"Alright bromos, anyone want to share stories of your weird stalkers, and how you dealt with them?  I have at least three, sometimes four guys that send me inappropriate text messages, emails, and simply say weird things to me in person.  I do not feed into it and I usually deflect the strange statement into a different topic.  



For context, I just graduated college, finished my internship, and state-mandated schooling. My future profession is generally negatively viewed in the media and on the public stage at all times.  I'm 23 years old, and I'd like to say an “average” kind of guy as far as demeanor and physic.  



*Stalker one:

I used to work with this guy.  He is much older than me; he also had a higher position than me in the company.  When he found out I was gay he was all over me, constantly asking about sexual partners and sexually-charged topics (i.e. size of my penis, roles in bed, etc).  One time on Facebook he asked me if I'd like to see his “red thong” he wears to be the pool.  I just got off face-time with him, as he twisted my arm into it even though I said I was very busy (lie).  The conversation started out innocent enough and then turned into, “so how big is your penis?”  I deflected again and then he asked, “oh, I was hoping you'd show me.”  I replied nicely enough, “no, I'm not doing that.”  I found an excuse to get off face-time then he sent me a text that said, “let's keep that between you and me.”  



*Stalker two:

This guy is always popping out of the blue.  He's definitely not my type and I've made that clear to him; however, he is a nice enough guy who, and for some reason, is highly regarded within the community so I have to watch what I say to him/about him.  We really only have thing in common which most gays don't:  our love of guns.  He's always asking about guns, inviting me to his parent's farm to shoot shit, and talking about gun issues and laws.  Then he'll text me asking me to go out on dates and hang out at bars and what not.  I always decline because I don't care to have a friendship/relationship with him – we have nothing in common and again, he's much older than me.  If he sees me out with friends, he'll approach me and sarcastically say, “thanks for inviting me.”  If he sees me flirting with someone or if I have a date/guy I brought along with me, he'll talk shit to me, talk shit about the guy I'm flirting with or brought, and stare at me the whole time.  



*Let me be clear about something:  I'm making it sound like I don't like older guys.  In reality, a lot of my close friends are 40+.  However, I wouldn't date them.  We all have preferences, and I think we should respect those preferences.  Don't spam me about how I'm a bigot or “one day you'll be my age.”  I know, I get it.*



*Stalker Three:

We went to college together and he's a year younger than me.  He is now in the same profession I wish to be in.  He has a girl fiance and marrying her very soon.  One day we were studying at my apartment and one thing led to another, and we ended up fucking (I had NO IDEA he was gay).  He's definitely a hot dude, and we've pretty much been friends with benefits for nearly three years.  However, he's far from being the type of guy I'd want to have a romantic relationship with – besides, he's pretty much married to a girl.  Within the last year, things got weird real quick.  He'd invite me to play pool and casually hang out.  I declined, reciting our deal that we'd be “discreet” because he's engaged and I was brutally honest, saying he's not the kind of guy I'd want to be in a relationship with.  Then he'd ask questions like, “if gay marriage were legal, would you think we could get married?”  “if I were out of the closet, would we date?”  Then he finally said, “you know, I think we should be boyfriends.”  That's when I drew the line.  I explained that it was obvious he had feelings for me and that I wasn't comfortable with that.  I politely said that I think it's best that we end our FWB thing, as we had a good run and he's getting married soon anyways.  Well, he wouldn't have it.  He has literally sent me 27 text messages since the beginning of February, to which I haven't replied to a single one.  In one text message, he berated me and said he thought it was best we never talk again.  The next message he said he was on his way to my apartment whether I agreed or not (I wasn't home, so I didn't care).  Now he's sending me naked pictures of himself and asking why I won't talk to him.  



Why are people so damn weird?  If I made it clear that I don't want to have intimate contact with you, why continue to be weird?  And not just weird, but sexually weird?  



**TL;DR**:  Share your stories of your stalkers.  


I don't think mine are extreme, but I seem to have an abundance of them.  I'm sure someone out there has a good story...

1bob8w,1,2013-04-04,"College CS student, $300 EFC. Should I get summer internships?",collegestudent51,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1bob8w/college_cs_student_300_efc_should_i_get_summer/,"I'm a college freshman in Computer Science. My mom makes about $25k a year, and I'm an only child.

Our EFC for next year is 300, which is pretty low. This year, it was 900, and that made it much easier for my mom to pay for this year (after I took out loans from the government and my college that don't get interest until after I graduate).

Since I'm a CS major, I should get a really good salary right out of college (if I finish), at least $70k per year. Summer internships would pay similarly for about $16k for the entire summer.

I'm concerned about what taking an internship would do to my financial aid situation. If I make $16k in a summer, then that would dramatically increase my income. The effect of this would also be delayed a full year since my EFC wouldn't be recalculated until after the school year that follows my summer internship.

A summer internship would make me a lot of money, but I'm worried that the money would be useless because my financial aid package might be more greatly reduced than the amount of money I made, making it *harder* to afford college. I'm also considering doing a coop during the fall or spring, but I imagine that would make my financial aid package even worse.

Is this a legitimate concern?

**EDIT**: I *definitely* intend on getting internships because the work experience is valuable. I just don't know how many or what kind. I don't want to get all that money, lose some of it to taxes and living expenses, and then end up with a tuition bill that I can't actually afford because my financial aid package goes away. I've heard that making income would heavily decrease my financial aid."

*""Ahh, laws. What's law? Control? Law filters chaos and what drips through? Serenity? Law- our highest ideal and our basest nature. Don't look too closely at the law. Do, and you'll find the rationalized interpretations, the legal casuistry, the presidents of convenience. You'll find the serenity, which is just another word for death.""*

 -From *Dune Messiah* 

I'm not a lawyer, not a politician and my bank account holds barely enough to cover my rent for the foreseeable future. I am but a man who looks at the word and world and wonders how it is we got here. Why have things deteriorated to the point that it is better to squalor in filth than to even contemplate the task of making this place better.

I'm a United States citizen. I once considered very seriously joining the Armed Forces. I once wanted to be a journalist, traveling the world and showing others the glories of this rock we call home. But, I never really got to do any of that. I was rejected from the Army because I was arrested as a minor for an offence I didn't commit. And although it turns out that I didn't assault or rob anyone, I had 1/2 of a gram of marijuana, which made me a criminal. 

I briefly worked in the journalism world, I got an internship in Shanghai. But me being 18 thought that writing for a yachting magazine wasn't the kind of writing I wanted to do. I was idealistic and catering to the rich and fortunate didn't sit right with me.

And now? Now, I am a drone in the construction industry. I don't hate my job most days; some days I even enjoy it. But it was never what I wanted. I'm up before the sun rises and by the time the sun sets I'm usually stuck in traffic. And I wonder, is this it? Is this the kind of life one aspires to? Mine is the 1st world problem, yet I cannot be content with the fact that I'm healthy, I can feed myself and for the moment no one wants me dead.

In 2008 I was a one of the millions who believed that electing Barack Obama would be the best thing we could ever do for our country. And now? I look back and laugh, how could I be so naive? Anyone who makes it that far only does so by the grace and favor of those who truly control the world. 

The quote at the top got me thinking, which while not a completely foreign thing to me...I wanted to vent, or share or maybe just put this up to demonstrate to myself that I did exist.

*There are all sorts of things we both know and don't know about the processes that keep our society running. We know children in Asia are being beaten to keep our sneakers and furniture cheap, we know our access to oil and other raw materials is being secured only by the cooperation of corrupt and vicious dictators, and we've also known for a while now that the anti-terror program they say we need to keep our airports and reservoirs safe involves mass campaigns of extralegal detention and assassination.*

Why am I not so angry that I do something about it? Why doesn't anyone else? Why are the only one who seem willing to fight so filled with hate?

We're so stuck in our ways...so tired from making the day's living that at the end of it, even if we make a conscious effort to see what wrongs there have been in the world, what can one do?

1bo2uo,12,2013-04-04,"Suggestions for Property Management Software, specifically for billing &amp; invoices for ~100 properties",NWAgh,RealEstate,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1bo2uo/suggestions_for_property_management_software/,"I just joined a Property Management company, and the way they handle their billing/invoices seems very out of date to me. We manage approximately 100 properties. The process we go through to pay the bills is as follows:

* 1) Receive bills at the office from Electric + Cable company for each individual apartment unit
* 2) The assistant (myself or our intern) has to write checks for these bills one by one
* 3) The office manager has to sign the 200+ checks for the cable and gas
* 4) The assistant/intern has to then make envelopes, with the corresponding check and bill receipt for each apartment unit, and send all 200+ envelopes back out to the cable/electric company.
* 5) We file away all 200 of these receipts until the last week of the month
* 6) When the last week of the month comes, we have to send invoices to the tenants so they can pay us for both rent and reimburse us for the electric/cable bill that we paid.  
* 7) To send out the monthly invoices, we have a merged document between excel and Word. You enter in the different charges into excel (cable, electric, cleaning lady charges, etc) and they are created into an invoice on Word. We collect all the electric/cable receipts and then enter them into word. 
* 8) Then (this is getting tedious, I know!) we print out these invoices, make a copy of the electric/cable bills, and pair the corressponding invoices to the bills and individually email/mail out the invoices to each tenant.
* 9) Finally, we file away the original copy of the electric/cable receipts along with copies of the invoices, into their respective filing cabinets. The office now has approximately 4 filing cabinets (5 shelves each) all PACKED to the brim with these receipts/invoices from the past 25 years.

This process seems way too long to me, and if there is any software that could help us even cut out ONE of these laborious steps, that would be greatly appreciated!! Much thanks in advance.

1bo2u9,130,2013-04-04,[MFA Style Interview] teckneaks,omgimacarrot,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1bo2u9/mfa_style_interview_teckneaks/,"For this MFA Style interview, we're doing /u/teckneaks , who is often seen playing on menswear with camo and nikes in /r/malefashion with his Thom Browne gear.  Here are some of his [fits](http://imgur.com/a/W2Dxv).

**Tell mfa about yourself (work and lifestyle-wise).**

&gt;I'm an advertising dude and writer living in NYC by way of California. I'm in my thirties ,which makes me sound old although I never feel old until someone tells me I am. Before advertising I had a whole other career in education but left because it wasn't what I thought it would be like.

&gt;After moving to NYC I worked a ton of little jobs and internships (writing, retail, I was a bonobos ninja even). even though I'm in my thirties I feel I've just begun my career.

&gt;Besides my day job I have a bunch of side projects like my [blog](http://postmoderngentleman.com) and some other creative pursuits.

**When did you discover fashion was important to you?**

&gt;Since the beginning. I've always felt like an outsider (it's a race thing) and clothing for me was a way to assimilate. Growing up, I was definitely not a cool kid and I wanted desperately to fit in. I recall once finally getting the courage to ask my classmates where they got their sweet flannel shorts. Ah, I'll never forget that trip to Miller's Outpost.

&gt;Later on in high school and college I used clothes for the opposite purpose -- to set myself apart. Since then I've fluctuated between conservative and more risque choices. Right now the pendulum happens to be at the latter. Always I've just been fascinated at how clothes can effect your mood, life chances, and outlook.

**How would you describe your style?**

&gt;I would describe it as eclectic. Or maybe ""jumbalaya."" There are certain types of things I love. OCBDs. Camo pants. Drapey t-shirts. Bucket hats. I'm a huge Thom Browne fan but I also love Nike Blazer lows. These items don't necessarily fit together instantly. The challenge for me then is to include all these disparate elements into something that's me.

**What are you most excited for S/S?**

&gt;Who is excited for spring summer? No one. Give me Fall/Fall any day. It's hard to be cool when you're literally trying to stay cool.
I have this vision for spring/summer: degenerate streetwear. Think ""I Heart NY"" t-shirts with the sleeves ripped off, 5-panel hats, and Rick shorts (I own none of these things). I've been upping my tattoo count so I am at least excited about having outfits that will actually show them.

**One piece of clothing you can't live without?**

&gt;At the moment my black watch cap and barbour international jacket. The jacket goes with everything. MFA hates black but in nyc it's practically all people wear. New Yorkers are like French beat poets but with a penchant for bagels. You can always pick out non-New Yorkers because of the ski clothing they wear during the winter.

**One piece of clothing you love, but are hesitant to try out?**

&gt;I want a givenchy skirt. Skirts are a piece that even adventurous dressers hesitate to wear. Women are always mixing hard and soft, masculine and feminine, and i think men should do the same. Although honestly even if I had one I don't think I could fit it into my style. Plus my girlfriend would be so pissed.

**What's in your inspiration folder?**

&gt;I'm really bad at keeping visual inspiration, which is bad because i'm supposedly a creative type. The few things I've kept are mainly japanese streetwear stuff (soloist, WTAPS, Beams). But I'll also keep images of straight up military gear. I could look at a Delta Force operator's kit all day long. That sounded wrong.

**What's tecknecks go-to drink?**

&gt;Bulleit neat. Or any ""whiskey and beer"" combo. I've never met a whiskey I didnt like.

**Worst mistake on your fashion ""journey""?**

&gt;Getting too caught up in hype. For example when I was on the ""quality suiting"" hype I went out and got a Hickey Freeman suit. Don't get me wrong it's nice and is well made but it's the suit Jack Donaghy would wear to meet Gordan Gecko. All shoulders.
&gt;I get really obsessive so for me I try to check myself here and there and just enjoy trends for what they are.

**If you were 20 again, what would you do differently?**
&gt; In life?  Style wise, nothing really. In some ways I think it sucks to be 20 right now because now you're faced with a huge barrage of information on how to dress, and a lot of it is tied very closely to ""being a man"" which is a load of horseshit. As a twenty year old I cared a lot about getting laid and then a little about school, which is about the right priorities for a twenty year old.

&gt;In life, well. I have a sociology degree. Believe it or not, if I could go back I would have chosen something even MORE useless. Rhetoric. English literature. If you're smart you can learn almost anything on the job, so use college as an excuse to learn interesting stuff. I would have also traveled more.

**Lastly, any advice for people trying to achieve their own style?**

&gt;Go and be interesting, however and whatever that means to you. Then go back and dress organically according to your interests and you'll have style. Don't be afraid to experiment. Don't be a dick and get all judgey. There's tons and tons of inspiration and beauty on the world, most of which can't be reblogged or followed on Instagram.

I have extensive experience in labs with several summer internships under my belt, and even a couple publications.

Needless to say, I'm starting to get really discouraged/frustrated. 

Does anyone have any other suggestions, or even better, know of any labs that are hiring? I have a wide range of interests/skills, but I'm most interested in neurogenetics or something studying the etiology of neuropsychiatric diseases. I'd be happy to send resumes or examples of previous work if you PM me.

Gpa about 3.1...average. The thing is I had no experience. During the summer I would take classes which excluded me from ding internships outside of the city. 

My school is in a college town so the few places I did adult for internships wouldn't take me because I want in the school of advertising (I was trying to intern at ad agencies because I was/still am interested in copy).

However for 5 years I was a staff writer and editor of a highly popular indie college paper.

Upon graduating I thought about going to grad school....I applied for two years but didn't go because it was for an MFA in poetry... which having time to write would have been great but the job outlook is shit.

But yeah....I apply everywhere and usually am met with a resounding silence. The handful of interviews I've had in these past years never panned out for one reason or another. 

I've tried calling and emailing papers and ad agencies in my city to set of they need interns but they say no, even when I say I will do it fire free. 

The job I'm workingat now will leaf no where. The experience in getting here is not valuable. ..but no one else sends to want to give me a shot. 

I'm smart, I'm creative, and very reliable. I'm at the point where if I get another interview in busy going to be blunt and tell them if they want to hire sometime who will be an asset and preform then look no further, otherwise enjoy the dipshit you end up with. 


I dont know. ...I'm pissed and frustrated. I'm on my break, I've been here for 2yrs and I'm seriously thinking of just walking out.

Smoking since I was junior in High School.  Longest period clean - 3 months.  I don't know if I am ready, but I don't know if I want to quit.  I know I need to though.  I go on and off days smoking and being sober.  I used to be clean for a couple of months, but then I feel back onto the green.  I have PTSD and depression.  Backstory below.  

Hey all.  I used to be here under the name local420, but because that was never linked to an email, when I forgot the password, I lost the account.  So I made a new one.  But I digress.   Onto the story.

About a year ago, I was here, I was cleaning up my act and shit was looking fantastic.  I was quitting both weed and cigs and I was able to breath.  I was doing well in school and social life. I mean I was even able to pick up a girlfriend.  I was fucking happy.  Then I slowly started slipping.  First a bowl here or there.  ""No big deal I got this under control"" so I thought.  Then school started back up again, and I started smoking more and more.  ""Whatever I am still getting good grades I don't have a problem again"" I kept thinking, as I looked at my 3.0gpa for the semester (Mind you for me that is incredible.  Not that I am a bad student, I'm really not, I have just had one hell of a fucked up college career.  PTSD, Depression, ya know the good ol' times)  But then shit started going south.  In late Sept, early Nov 2012, I started getting flashbacks and nightmares caused by my PTSD.  These were unlike anything I had ever experienced.  I wouldn't sleep.  Scared of my own bed.  During the days I would just be a goddamn zombie stuck in between the reality of my life and the memories of my past.  I was terrified  to sleep. So scared of my own goddamn bed.  The weed though, the weed was always there to help me out.  Sure I would smoke to blissful oblivion, but it stopped the shit, at least for a while.  I was smoking an insane amount, constantly broke.  I mean hell there was a span of time that I was going through roughly a fucking ounce a week.   A FUCKING OUNCE.  I mean god damn.  The dreams never stopped, nor did the flashbacks though.  If anything they only kept getting worse and worse.  Dec 2012 came around and I was a hollow shell.  I constantly had thoughts, little voices telling me, go ahead, it's ok, It will only hurt for a moment. Driving me insane.  One night I flipped, put a hole in a wall and cried for hours wishing for the goddamn building to just fall on my head.  I wanted out so bad.  I went to the school therapist the next day.  Begging them please, make it all stop.  Please stop the nightmares, the flashbacks.  They only offered me a strong script sedative.  I didn't want to be knocked out, I just wanted other thoughts then what was constantly filling my head.  Even now I cry.  The nightmares cannot be described.  The detail, the violence, the gore.  It would make the devil himself cringe.  I guess I should make a clear note as to the reasons for my PTSD and depression.  I was abused by an internet predator when I was young.  I am one of those stats you see on SVU or Good Morning America.  I paid my dues though, I helped put that fucker in jail.  Though I did what many cannot even consider, it haunts me to this day.  Though the damage was all caused by him, the blood feels like its on my hands.  I feel guilty, so incredibly guilty.  When this prick was first arrested, he walked.  No jail time, no fines, nothing.  They arrested him again a year later doing the same exact thing.  This time, he was found with multiple hard drives and computes filled with, yup, Child porn.  This time though, that fucker burned.  I took the stand with another victim back in late 2010.  He is now serving 20 years behind bars and will be under Big Brothers watch till he dies.  Whew....that was a lot of info, sorry.  So that's the cause of my PTSD and Depression.  This in turn of course fucked with my grades blah blah blah back to the story.  Jan 2013 things are starting to get a little better.  I broke up with my girlfriend, I had to.  I couldn't even have fucking sex without seeing his face.  Yeah, wanna talk about a mood killer?  But whatever, it happened.  It was for the best though.  I was meeting with my therapist (Doc) regularly.  Sometimes twice a week but usually just once.  It helped a lot. Put a lot of things in perspective.  Feb 2013.  I am still smoking a lot.  About a quarter a week.  Grades are starting to slip. I am showing up high more and more often for classes, meeetings, etc.  Failed multiple exams because I was too busy smoking to study.  But I still managed to land a nice internship.  Mar 2013 rolled around and shit is still bad.  Still smoking mad amounts but getting happier and more control of my PTSD.  The nightmares have finally come to a near stop and the flashbacks have been virtually eliminated.  Still i get them both from time to time, but not nearly as serious as it once was.  I started talking with my friend about helping me quit.  They are all very supportive.  That brings us to now.  April 2013.  I am trying to quit.  I am looking to quit.  But I don't know if I really WANT to quit.  I mean, I literally will hunt (and smoke) any weed I can find.  I legit went through my trash looking for stems to smoke.  I will buy it if I can't find any spending whatever money I have to get it.  And then there is the topic of 4/20.  I feel like i can't miss that day. It is the holy day for stoners.  I mean fuck man.  But I guess I will come to that when I get there.  I love weed.  It really is my passion.  I would (and have) sat for hours reading about everything weed.  My friends say I need perspective, but I don't know what I even should be looking for.  I know it's bad. I know I have a problem. Bah I don't know.  One of my big problems is that my roommate and close friend smokes weed like I do.  That really doesn't help but whatever.  Oh and my family is clueless as to my use, PTSD, and depression.  Sorry for the insane ramble.  I will probably update this initial text throughout the day describing my emotions/feelings like I did before.  It helps me the most, even if it does piss people off. Sorry people.  I will gladly reply to comments and all clearing up any questions, comments, concerns.  I appreciate whatever help I can get.  


UPDATE: 1:30pm
     I want to be clean today.  It really is hard.  I find myself staring at my phone finger hovering over the call key.  A simple call, a little wait, and bobs your uncle.  Fuck this isn't like before I'm not angry, not stressed.  Just craving.  just one final joint, one more frozen bong load.  Thats all I want.   But I guess I've already had enough 'last' joints.  Bugga.  

Yours Truly,

I'm finally buying my own car at age 20, and I have my eyes on several 2005 and 2007 Chevy Impalas (reliability is supposedly higher for these years). I was wondering if the Reddit community had any other good suggestions for a sedan that is safe and reliable (plan on having this car into early years of family life), but is still fun to drive now while I'm in college. 

Also, for the helpful car sales people of reddit, what do you think is the maximum sticker price that I could attack at a dealership and get down to a $9k out the door price? I understand that there are a few variables that would affect this, but some ballpark suggestions and advice would help me out. 

I will be getting back to Eastern Iowa (home) next week, from my current 3-month internship in CA. The plan is to spend the next 5 weeks or so buying a car, which will then be needed to haul my butt to an exciting 8 weeks of summer classes.

TL;DR: Need a $9k reliable car that I will enjoy, with only a month to spend on the buying process. Suggestions?

Edit: format and some more info on my situation."

On Monday, I was at the place of business for five and a half hours. They told me to ""sit at the intern desk and chill"" until they needed me (through notifications on AIM). Four and a half hours of my time there was spent watching TV shows on the computer with headphones; the other hour was spent verifying that 20 URLs worked, going to the post office, and eating lunch.  
  
Today will be my second day. At the end, if I'm not convinced I'm gonna get the training I want out of this internship, how do I bring it up? I think they're kind of used to having passive interns for pesky jobs instead of actually teaching skills. They say it's ""slow"" right now, but I think that's a terrible excuse. Thoughts?"

Things were fine here. It was a four month program. I was supposed to get my archival / reference credits completed and would be on my way. It was just an English elective. It was a segue into the media studies minor. It was a four month program. It was just an internship. Now the police are involved. 



Mary, the head librarian has been sick for days now. I’m just a student. I was an apprentice. I was learning. I would be gone in weeks. They couldn’t expect me to know all of the ins and outs. She won’t answer her phone and her house phone has been disconnected. Of the seven volunteers and employees, I am the only one here. I do not know what they want. Where the records are, what protocols to follow, if there are any privacy checks in place. I am just an intern. I am a student. It was a four month program. I was supposed to be gone. But now state police are threatening me with talks of jail time and the like. 



They keep talking about the “higher ups” getting involved. The feds. The fucking federal government investigating our little library. Something about the bay. I don’t even work here. I am just an intern. It was a four month program. Some people fold under pressure. I always have. I don’t know what happened. Mary, the head librarian, before she disappeared, she said that someone used my account to upload some “sensitive” files to the Internet when I was back at school, on campus. It wasn’t me. I wasn’t here. But someone, still, leaked delicate files. 



I don’t know what they contained. I don’t know what I am doing here. They want to talk to me. I refuse to leave my dorm. They can come and get me if they want. They’re so interested in me since someone uploaded files that they didn’t want out, since someone blew their cover. Whoever it was, fuck you. Fuck you for all of this trouble. All I have now are cops on my ass and a stupid little tagline on my registrar account from Deptford County Public Library labeled: the_vents. Thank you, you fuck. You ruined a college career and potentially a life to spearhead some little information liberation campaign that no one cares about. Thank you.




It was only an internship. It was a four month program. I was supposed to be gone.

Revised my Resume and Cover letter - I try to tailor both the Resume and Cover letter to each of the +1's listed in the job descriptions. I originally had my heart set on working with GIS, unfortunately now almost after a year of unemployment my GIS skillset seems outdated and useless, with no other means of advancing my skillset other than random tinkering with Arc10 in college libraries - I've been applying more to Lab  Tech positions. I've also applied for 6 unpaid internships related to GIS (I've already been turned down from 4 of them). I've also been turned down from 3 seasonal positions paying a total of 12k for a 6 month period. I receive on average 2 rejection emails a day, I haven't had an interview in two months.. 

Expected salary - depending on if i have to move, 0-30k (30k being the highest that I list on applications even if the base pay exceeds 30k). 

I meet all basic requirements of the positions I apply to and at least 50-75% of the preferred qualifications. I do not hold any certifications -OSHA HAZWOPER, Low voltage, Wastewater etc. I was thinking of taking 40hr OSHA HAZWOPER certification but why bother if I am never going to get hired anyway right? 

Any help would be useful (I know, Make that shit shorter)

Resume - http://i.imgur.com/Z1Hcf5B.png?1

If any commenters would like to include what sector of work you are in, I'd be interested in seeing what the breakdown was. 

This is the job description for the OP Cover letter and resume, It was one of the first lab tech positions I applied for - It's probably the most detailed/highest demanding - The other lab tech positions require a GED and 1 year of experience in a lab.

I KNOW I NEED TO GET WORK OK. I'M TRYING! that's a lot more than any of you motherfuckers have done in the last two years. I graduated high school, I busted ass and got MYSELF through college by staying up filling out FAFSA shit all day and finding grants. I got this internship, which YES I FUCKING KNOW DOESN'T PAY ME STOP REMINDING ME.

What do you do? Let's see...
you got fired 2 years ago, it was a shit deal and I felt so bad. And I still feel bad cuz you're my dad and I love you, but fucking christ you haven't even tried to find another in all this time. ""Oh i'm old. Im tired, my body's all fucked up"" Like yes I know but you wanna be homeless?
And then you've got the nerve to bitch at me for using up gas money to go to my job, when half the time you're out with the car god knows where all fucking day.

Brother. You dropped out of high school. Whatever. You went to job corps, I was proud. You graduated with a security degree... awesome. NOW DO SOMETHING WITH IT! ALL YOU DO IS GO GET DRUNK AT YOUR FRIENDS HOUSE AND BITCH WHENEVER ANYONE ASKS YOU TO CONTRIBUTE MONEY FROM YOUR JOB CORPS STASH. You bitch about taking out the trash. You bitch about everyone else. You bitch about how nobody will hire you, but in the same breath how you're too good for this job or that job.

I'm trying. I'm ready to fucking kill myself at this point i'm so stressed out. Mom is so sick and it's like you guys don't even care anymore. She's had to resort to selling her pain medication to help out, do none of you even get how FUCKED UP that is?
 All anyone wants to talk about is how we're probably going to lose the house and how I need to get a job and how I don't do anything around the house. But somehow miraculously there's always scratch ticket money, and coffee money.

 I'm so depressed I can't even sleep at night anymore."
1bnag1,3,2013-04-04,Summer Research or Internship? Planning on going industry after college.,BigBurrito,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/1bnag1/summer_research_or_internship_planning_on_going/,"I'm a SoCal 3rd year and I want to figure out whether I should do research at my Uni or go for an internship during the summer. So heres the deal, I've been applying to dozens of companies for summer internships. So far, I've gotten no response or a no from the company. I'm still applying nevertheless. As for my background, my GPA in the 3.0 range but I work in a chemistry stockroom and put myself out in joining some organizations, such as joining a fraternity for some group-work experiences, keeping up with aiche, and doing a side multidisciplinary project with the school. Since I'm not hearing anything good from my internship searches. I decided to try out research. 

I've talked to a certain professor I wanted to work relating to biotechnology, which something I wanted to do with in the industry field. This professor wants a 1 year minimum worth of research in the lab, assuming I help out in the summer while I can get hourly paid working at my current job. This way, I hope it will strengthen my resume for engineer jobs after I graduate.

BUT there's that WHAT IF I got an summer internship spot. But I highly doubt I'll get that opportunity seeing that I haven't done any engineering work related in terms of group projects or research.

I need advice. Should I ditch the internship search and research for the summer or forget the research and keep applying? 

My plan after college is to go work in an industry and perhaps get a masters later in the future when I can afford it.

Any advice would help!!"

She told me she needed space to work out what she wanted and whether or not our relationship worked for her.  

Up until a few days ago, my way of coping with everything has been to throw myself into work and exercise. I work about 6-7 days a week, juggling uni, an internship, a clerkship and a bar job to pay for my rent. It's worked up to a point, however my uni is currently on easter holidays and I have had a lot more free time as of late. 

I recently broke no contact to organise to send back her camera because her sister's wedding was coming up and she was going overseas with her cousin. She responded to my text, at first things seemed positive, she wanted to see me to talk things over but she ended things with ""take care"", which is pretty indicative that things were well and truly over. I didn't cope with this particularly well, and after a week of contemplation, decided it would be better for everyone if i just posted it to her. I messaged her and told her to wish her parents a happy easter and that I would arrange for the items to be posted. 

About two days ago, she finally responded. Before this time, I was feeling great, like for the first time in a long while, things were on my terms. I also got my hair done and started to feel attractive again. Then she messaged me, saying she understood my need for space and that she hoped I was well. It just pushed me over the brink and I've spent the past two days in varying states of distress. I guess I'm so upset because she seems perfectly fine with everything and that makes me feel like I meant nothing to her. I'm upset because I thought we had a chance to fix things. And I'm upset that I know what I want in life and she doesn't. I've had to stay at my parents for the past few days and I find it particularly difficult to get out of bed each day. I find it even harder to be alone for extended periods of time.

To get to the point of my story, aside from going back to NC, what else works? I've been doing so well up until this point as well, it's just really frustrating. I feel like I take two steps forward and one step back with everything."

I was accepted into two programs this coming fall around Urban Issues/Planning. It is my career goal to become a city planner and a graduate degree is necessary. One program is designated by CIP (canadian institute of planners) which you **need** to become a planner and I also received a small scholarship. I spoke with my advisor and he seems pretty good and flexible, but his research is a tad more boring. He is respected in the planning community in my city. This program also has an aura that I have been told where ""graduates seem to all get a job out of school."" This is just hear say but take it for what it is.

On the other hand I was accepted into a more general program that isn't designated by CIP, however many graduates enter the planning field nonetheless (longer+more tricky route). This program is a bit more current and offers more paid internships, international exchanges, and co-ops. My advisor is great as I have a previous relationship with her, and she offered me a research assistant position this summer (a job i very much need.) This program can also be taken part-time which offers flexibility.

I hope I didn't sound like I am just bragging. I know this is a good problem to have but I am having a heck of a time deciding. Any advice?

**tl;dr: I have two programs. One is more official towards planning, and the other requires a longer route but seems more exciting. Which to choose?**"

1) 9-11 terror attacks.

If this was really the case, who set these explosives? Surely some twelve years later one of the guys who laid these explosives would have surfaced. Where are the plans? Where are the emails? Even if the explosives were laid, why crash the planes into the buildings? Wouldn't it be simpler to just use explosives? I don't doubt the government (Cheney and his croneys) snatched the chance to get rich by starting a war in Iraq, but I just don't buy the fact that the government was behind the WTC attacks.

2) Sandy Hook. The consensus of many conspiracy theorists on here is that the Sandy Hook massacre was fabricated, presumably in an attempt to ""take away our guns"".

If I go to graduate school I'll either study Multiple Impairments or Orientation and Mobility. I haven't completed my internship yet so I don't have any documented experience right now, but will when I graduate. I know braille but no other language besides English.
No criminal convictions and I don't know if it would be a permanent relocation yet.

I've been doing research online but not having much luck because my field is so speicalized/small, so I was wondering if anyone here has more info on QTVI's in the U.K. I'm wondering what the demand (if any!) might be for someone with my skills."

I'm looking for opinions on finding a place to roost for 8 week during my internship in Charleston. I'm open to any options. 

My place of work is located very close to the Citadel, and I've heard that's a very bad part of town. I ate at that place called Moe's after my in-person interview and it was a fine burger. The onion rings were solid too. 

I feel that securing a lease/rent for such a short period of time will be a tough part. I've never lived on my own outside of school provided housing. So all the issues of renting/living somewhere will be a first for me. I've also never lived in a rough part of town but I imagine it's not too bad if I don't stay out too late and/or show that I'm ripe for a mugging/break-in. 

I would consider myself a pretty stand up fellow, I wonder if I could find a nice family to live with like some Int'l Students do?

I'm hoping I could live close to my place of work so I can walk or so I don't have to drive very far. 

The internship will get me around 3200 dollars to live off of while I'm there. "

My friend and I are looking for a two bedroom apartment in NYC. We're college students with summer internships near the Financial District, and we're open to pretty much any location except Queens.

Max budget is $2300. Pictures would be awesome! We can also meet any time (visiting the apartment is a must), as long as we plan in advance, since we currently live 3 hours away from NYC.

Thanks for reading!"
1bn4q7,0,2013-04-04,I need some serious advice and recommendations,[deleted],travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1bn4q7/i_need_some_serious_advice_and_recommendations/,"I'm 30 and I can't figure out what to do with my life.  Sometimes I think I would be happy if I could just start up my own boutique restaurant somewhere, or maybe I should make a documentary, or maybe I should start my own TV show, or maybe I should just be an investor by buying companies, turning them around, and selling them.  But I'm not sure.  
  
I recently returned from the Virgin Islands, but I wasn't there long.  It did give me a new outlook on life, seeing as I could probably be an entrepreneur down there and make a reasonable living without much sweat.  
  
Part of my problem is that I'm like that damn dog looking in an infinite mirror.  I have a steak in my mouth, but I see so many other steaks, and I don't know which one to get.  
  
I have ~ 900k liquid and 300k in tax advantaged accounts right now.  That's my nest egg, and I don't want to dig too hard into it.  
  
But I'm really struggling trying to figure out what I can do with my life.  
  
I think part of the problem is that I want to be really rich.  I enjoy life and I know that people live really happily without much money.  But I love having money.  And I seriously want at least 100 million dollars at the very minimum.  Some people may scoff at this, and fine, I get your point.  But it's just something I want.  So everything I start out doing seems pointless.  Because I just cannot visualize how in the fuck I am going to make that kind of money.  
  
So I think I need to travel and gain some perspective.  Maybe I will decide I don't need that kind of money.  Maybe I will decide that I do, but figure out a way to make it.  Maybe I will pull my head out of my ass.  Because believe me, I'm not against the idea that it isn't buried deep on some level.  
  
Any help is appreciated.  I am getting pissed off enough to just up and leave tomorrow, because I really don't give a fuck at this point.  
  I have been mulling over this shit for a year now.  And all this time sitting around and dreaming about shit has brought me nothing.  
  
I quit my job, I have no ties, no debt, no nothing.  Except for some money and not a fuck given.  
  
O and if you're curious how I made my money, go to school and take a 19 hour engineering course load for 4 years, intern successfully 3 of those summers with different companies, and make close to a 4.0 GPA while nailing interviews and showing enough leadership capability to lead men 30 years your senior and make presentations to rooms full of people convincing them that you are the future of the company so that they give you your entire salary as a bonus for 2 years straight and you just so happen to cash out all your stock options when the company hits within 5 percent of its record high before the stock market crash in 08.  And also work in an environment where there is no such thing as quitting time.  18 hour days are common, and I stayed up for 2.5 days in a row without sleep on multiple occasions.  So if your health and life for 8 years straight are worth being compromised for about a million bucks, be my guest.  I will never go back to that shit.  I either create something that people will pay me for, or I perish.  I will never work a job like that again."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[How did you interact with the other people there? Make any friends? How about *friends*?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97ridd?context=5)|I did have a few friends (maybe 5 or 10 at most), and I dated a few girls during that time as well :)
[Did you ever go out of the building?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97ridd?context=5)|I tried to get out as much as possible, but I probably only left a max of 3 or 5 hours per week.
[Whose/what computer did you use?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97ridd?context=5)|I had this really crappy Dell laptop that was five years old, but it pulled through!
[Did you still talk to/meet up with your outside friends?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97ridd?context=5)|I'm from Chicago, so I didn't really have any outside friends at the time (except for one guy that I knew from Chicago)
[Can you describe the person that found you out, and what was their reaction?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97ridd?context=5)|The person who found out was the building manager, and he was really pissed. I had gone to sleep at 5am because I had been working really late and then he busted open the door at 7am and started yelling at me. I don't remember much of what he said, but I do remember him saying ""this isn't a dorm"" and ""get out"". I was half asleep the entire time and trying to figure out what was going on lol. He did shake my hand and wish me good luck after 20/20 filmed a segment about me, so I think things ended well.
[Can I have your autograph?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97ridd?context=5)|Depends on what you want me to autograph...no body parts :)
[How did you have time to date multiple people of you only left the building for 3-5 hours a week?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97szjg?context=5)|Over the course of two months, I dated two girls and I would only spend and hour or two a week with them (outside of the AOL building) at most.
[Haha no I don't want my body autographed, a piece of scrunched up paper will do :\) ty for answering btw.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97s0og?context=5)|Haha of course :)
[Where/how/with what did you masturbate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97ql7y?context=5)|Professor Plum, with the candlestick, in the conservatory.
[What was your 'closest call' of being found out during your stay? Also, thanks for doing this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97qihy?context=5)|No problem! There were a few times when security was sweeping the entire floor and I would leave my laptop open on my lap to make it look like I fell asleep coding. When I heard someone coming near me, I would ""wake up"" and mutter how I had to keep on coding to hit ""my boss's deadline"" haha.
[Did any of the guards go like ""oh sorry for disturbing you""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97x522?context=5)|Yup - the guards were all really nice.
[Quick, pretend to be asleep!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c981ifr?context=5)|ZzzzZZZzZZzzzZ.
[Except that last one.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c986xw5?context=5)|He wasn't a security guard, he was the building manager (the boss of the security guards)
[Seems like for the building manager to come in and bust you, they were onto you. So anytime before then you think you might of slipped up? Or do you think it was more cumulative?  Or were you just damned unlucky that night with him coming through?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c987qgp?context=5)|I think it was cumulative (I posted in a few of the other comments about this in more detail if you're interested!)
[You lost at the boss level.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c98at8e?context=5)|It wasn't my fault dude, someone unplugged my controller.
[Did you get anyone from security fired over it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97qflt?context=5)|This was actually my biggest concern. To my knowledge, no one was fired from the story leaking. The higher ups at AOL thought the story was hilarious, which probably prevented the lower management from firing anybody.
[But you would though. Right? Yeah you would.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97vlx4?context=5)|Technically, I ""squat"" in my startup's office. Less security guards though.
[Can i squat there too? sharing is caring? :3.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97ytlb?context=5)|Sure! PM me :)
[How much do you squat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c9832y7?context=5)|A lot.
[My Instagram has 5000 followers so I'm basically an entrepreneur ""photographer"" too. Can I squat? ;D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c984azv?context=5)|Everyone can squat!

[DO YOU EVEN...  Shit, it says you do in the CNET article.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c98414r?context=5)|:)
[Did AOL have 1-ply or 2-ply?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97qpy9?context=5)|1-ply :(
[1-ply?! My god, you have got to be one of the most committed entrepreneurs I've ever read about. I don't have what it takes to make it in the world of start ups as I demand Charmin when I squat. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97t0hw?context=5)|[Don't underestimate chafing](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/003/758/Rape-Ewok-PREPARE-YOUR-ANUS.jpg)
[When did you start learning coding and how did you do it? What advice would you give to people who want to learn coding but get frustrated easily? Also, what inspired you to work on a startup for educators instead of chasing the money in software engineering?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97qhij?context=5)|For my 13th birthday, I asked my parents to buy me three programming books instead of an Xbox (much to their surprise). I spent all my free time after school teaching myself from those books.
 |Being frustrated is par for the course when learning to code. It really helped for me to focus on the end result instead of the specific bits I was having trouble understanding. For example, I was hell bent on creating a blog for myself as my first project. If I hadn't set that objective, it would have been much harder to push through and learn everything that was required.
 |For me, running this startup isn't about the money - it's about the impact. One of the key realizations I made when I was living out of AOL was that life isn't about what you have, it's about what you leave. I want to leave our next generation with easy access to high quality &amp; engaging learning resources, because it really shouldn't be so hard to learn about new things.
[How has AOL treated you since you got Internet famous? The news article I read made it sound like they were being suprisingly cool.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97r55j?context=5)|They've been awesome. They let 20/20 come and film me in their HQ reenacting living out of there (should be airing next month!). Apparently I'm still not allowed in the building though :(
[Someone better post the video when they release it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c9846z2?context=5)|The preview is available right now here: [Link to abcnews.go.com](http://abcnews.go.com/2020/video/simons-eric-office-live-squat-squatter-aol-live-tips-home-2020-17659266)
[Dude, awesome story.  *""Yeah, save money whenever possible, and use all the resources you can,"" he said. ***""And don't die. That's basically my motto.""****  ADD is the new YOLO?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97r22u?context=5)|Haha ADD, love it. A few startup founders have told me that they have ""And don't die"" written on the walls of their offices now :)
[What was the biggest lie you had to tell to a person?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97t24y?context=5)|""Haha no way man! I may work here a lot, but I don't live here...""
[Would you still like to get that coffee I promised you? Feel bad not taking up that offer...  If I would have known your situation I'd of invited you to our meals on the 2nd floor :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97vrt4?context=5)|YES! I still wanna come visit you on the 2nd floor :) you still have my number, right?
[Now kiss. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97zmu9?context=5)|Nonononononono we're just bros.
[Did what i think just happened really just happen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97zlk0?context=5)|Probably not.
[Cute :\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97zpiq?context=5)|STOP IT.
[What was the best thing you ate while living on AOL dining? Worst?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97qz92?context=5)|Best thing: a full Thanksgiving meal (turkey, gravy, mashed taters, etc). No joke. It was just sitting out for anyone to eat.
 |Worst thing: stale bread w/ cheerios on top for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The weekends were really, really bad when looking for food (they would throw out all of the food in the fridges on Fridays)
[When I used to be a janitor for an office building, fridge cleaning days were the best! As a broke college student, nothing was actually thrown away.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97vtc0?context=5)|LOL nice :)
[Your article said you went to boston market for thanks giving.  ___-](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97wxiu?context=5)|AOL had a company wide Thanksgiving meal the Friday before the actual holiday.
[Do you feel that standardized testing in schools will limit the potential creativity of lesson plans that teachers will share on your site?  Are you interested in using Claco to push for creative, hands-on learning over teaching to the test?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97shk6?context=5)|My goal for Claco has always been to help teachers do what they do best: teach. We fight for the teachers because they fight for the students. I would love nothing more than to see the government take this approach as well.
[Awesome, thanks so much for the reply!  I sent my dad an email recommending he check out your website.  Thanks for building what looks like an incredibly useful service for thoughtful teachers like my pops!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97sxhu?context=5)|Thanks for doing that!! Tell him to email me and let me know what he thinks :)
[As someone currently going to school for teaching, this makes me go yaaay inside.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c9834sg?context=5)|:)
[One of the articles states you slept on couches that weren't on security rounds - How did you go about discovering security routines and all that stuff? Where was safe and when it was safe? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97qsz4?context=5)|It was just trial and error. A lot of nights I would be woken up by security guards walking by, so I changed my sleeping location daily for a while. The best place I found to sleep was a room called ""Napquest"" - a room where AOL employees could take naps (sleeping is just an overnight nap, right?). They had a lavish couch and vibrating chair, and the windows were blacked out so no light could get in. Security guards almost never bothered me in there (but that's where I was sleeping the night they kicked me out)
[Why didn't you just sleep during the day in the nap room and stay up all night?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97tms9?context=5)|A lot of people want to use the nap room in the middle of the day, so you'll be woken up and discovered more quickly than doing it at night,
[Has your story of living there helped propel you in your career at all?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97qri9?context=5)|Definitely. Out here in Silicon Valley, almost everyone I run into knows my story and it's a great conversation starter. The most annoying thing is when I visit other people's offices and they say ""lets get the couches out of here, otherwise Eric might sleep on one of them""...or other related jokes that were funny the first 100 times.
[So in Silicon Valley, people recognize you as the AOL Squatter and come up to talk to you about it?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97r7s8?context=5)|People have approached me multiple times about it (this actually happened when I got my haircut last week lol)
[Have you ever used your pseudo-celebrity squatter status to pick up a girl (or guy\)? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97r7s8?context=5)|A few days after the story broke in the newspaper about me living in AOL, we threw a pretty big party at our house. One of my friends would wait for me to talk with girls and then come up with a newspaper and say ""ERIC! Dude, you didn't tell me you were on the front page of the newspaper today!""  and every girl would be like ""OMG!!1!1"". It was a very successful night :D.
[Talk about a good wingman. I hope you returned the favor somehow.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97uj1h?context=5)|I know right? I actually just hooked him up with some really awesome Swedish girls that hang out with us, so I think we're even now :P.
[Did they offer you a job? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97r3x7?context=5)|One of the guys insinuated that they would be happy to have me as an employee, but no formal offers.
[Did you follow this up, or just let it go? The ball is in your court to try to make that kind of thing a reality...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97tgv9?context=5)|I didn't want the job - I'm all in on my startup :)
[In a related question, has anyone else offered you a job/ squat space since you made the news?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97tgv9?context=5)|I've had a ton of people try and poach me *from my own company.* It's really annoying. I have at least 2 or 3 people a week try and do this.
[That's awesome man, it's good to be in demand.  Hope the appeal stays with you past your startup/ helps the startup.  Love to see the creativity, all the best in your endeavors.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97tpmz?context=5)|Thanks!! Best to you as well :)
[How is your proposed lesson plan system different or better than the resources already available? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97qgtr?context=5)|By vetting only the highest quality teachers, we can seed our system with the best educational materials. We're betting that great materials (that are publicly available) will lead to mass spread of our product (and it's working really well: [Link to twitter.com](https://twitter.com/TeamClaco/status/314567697000173568/photo/1).)
 |The big idea with Claco (our lesson plan system) isn't actually about lesson plans: it's about building an identity system for teachers. In the same way that Github has become the identity system for developers, we envision Claco will become the identity system for educators.
[What was the ""Decent chunk of money"" if you don't mind me asking?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97rbej?context=5)|I can't disclose the exact number, but I would have been able travel to Hawaii, get a place on the beach and browse reddit all day long for years.
[Your story kind of reminded me of the Apple contractors that had their project cancelled but kept sneaking in to work on it anyway. Had you heard that story and ever thought what you were doing was similar?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97reko?context=5)|I only read about the Apple story after I had squatted. I really appreciate the hustle those guys had - even cooler that their software ended up shipping at the end of the day!
[Would you rather have one inch long nipples or a one inch long dick?  Edit: Grammar lesson by /u/goshdarnyou.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97r7m2?context=5)|Nips bro.
[You can always snip the nips.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97wdz1?context=5)|Exactly.
[How were your interactions with the regular AOL staffers if you did interact with them?  Did you venture out ever?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97rdt5?context=5)|My interactions were great, I became good friends with a handful of their employees (I even dated one for a bit). When I ventured out, I was limited to walking distance - there was a park, restaurants, and a train station that I could hang out at.
 |Protip: taking girls on walks at the park yields the best bang-for-buck, great for when you're broke and have no money :D.
[Do you have an AOL account?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97qghr?context=5)|I did, back in the day when AIM was the hip thing to use.
[What is one of piece of advice would you tell yourself back then with the knowledge you know now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97r4ja?context=5)|Treat your body and mind well. Get out and take breaks. You are more important than your purpose.
[What is your favorite way to use those AOL trial discs they give out for free still? I prefer frisbee, myself. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97qpcr?context=5)|I used to put them in my CD player as a kid and see if they played music. Version 5.0 made a growling noise, no such luck on any of the others.
[What are your thoughts on Khan Academy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97t2gm?context=5)|Khan is great! He's a great teacher. I really respect all of the work that he and his team do. It will be interesting to see how their strategy works in the long term.
[One more question: If you had to describe Claco in 9 words or less, what would you say?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97s4hu?context=5)|Hand crafted by Chuck Norris.
[Since everyone thought you were just another employee, did you ever work with anybody? Steal their ideas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97r7ld?context=5)|Lol no, I was more of a loner. I made some great friends there though, and some helped me brainstorm strategies for marketing, engineering, and fundraising.
[Did your friends know what you were doing in there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97tc6u?context=5)|My closest friends did, but most people I talked with did not.
[How's the company going?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97qt91?context=5)|Good! I'm actually working on another product right now, but Claco is growing like crazy and we have tons of happy users :)
[What made you finally decide on your concept/idea and take the plunge?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97qt91?context=5)|I decided on Claco's concept/idea because of the biggest frustration I had in school. The materials my teachers were using to teach us (worksheets, textbooks) weren't engaging or relevant to me, and I knew that really awesome online resources would make my experience at school way better. Claco is a place where teachers can find &amp; share engaging, relevant resources that they can use in their classrooms. More of the backstory can be found on my bio here - [Link to www.claco.com](http://www.claco.com/about/team)
[What piece of advice would you recommend for someone technical  starting their own company?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97qt91?context=5)|Focus intensely on providing value to your users. This is the best way to create a successful &amp; awesome product/company. Do anything it takes to make your company succeed and don't be afraid of pushing the envelope. 
[Sorry to hijack this comment, but my wife is a charter school teacher in Arizona.  They use the core knowledge curriculum.  Do you think claco would be useful to her and her coworkers?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97xqwp?context=5)|If they collaboratively build curriculum, absolutely! Even if they're just looking for some good resources, Claco would be great :)
[Wait a minute, second floor as in Disney interactive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c9836wv?context=5)|Correct!
[How do you know what's on every floor? Do you like, live here, or something?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c987ejy?context=5)|Nah man, I just work a lot! Haha! Yeah, that would be hilarious if someone lived out of here, right? ...right?
[Did the AOL gym have a squat rack and barbell with weights and plates or did it just have a bunch of cardio machines?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97tq75?context=5)|It was a full featured gym - squat rack, barbell, weights plates and all different types of cardio machines.
[How did you squat without your gigantic balls getting in the way?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c986av0?context=5)|:P.
[What's your 1RM on squat deadlift and bench?? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97tu3r?context=5)|I don't do 1RM, but right now I'm doing 145 over 3 sets of 12, 10 and 8 reps. I haven't been lifting as much as I was a few years ago :(
[Do you even lift bro?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c9871mp?context=5)|Yes, bro, I do lift, bro.
[But... But bro...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c9867ug?context=5)|I know brah, I know...
[So you don't lift...?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c986u8c?context=5)|Nah brah.
[You do more than most people ever will dude. Also, if I were a computer science guy I'd ask if I could intern for you but I'm afraid I have nothing to offer. Wanna lift tho?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97uczw?context=5)|Haha thanks man :) Would love to lift!
[How many times has this story gotten you laid?  It almost worked with me... :p.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97swkx?context=5)|Maybe we can add one more to the list :P.
[So how many hours of sleep did you actually get each night?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97qxpe?context=5)|Not many - anywhere between 3 and 6 hours. And then I would get up and work for 12-14 hours. Repeat process.
 |Living out of AOL was one of the worst experiences I've even been through, but it really shaped my character and taught me how to focus.
[It must have been a nightmare to be on your guard at all times; how did you keep yourself motivated?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97qmik?context=5)|Pulling off my plan was what kept me motivated. I had to win.
[Why is a raven like a writing desk?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97qmik?context=5)|I have no idea...
[I basically have not heard anything from AOL in 8 years. I don't mean this in a bad way, but the picture of the pretty AOL campus has me wondering...  What do AOL employees do? What did the people sitting next to you work on? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97soi7?context=5)|AOL is actually working on some interesting stuff. They were overhauling AIM, Mail, and some other stuff while I was there. Their employees are nice and seem to work really hard during the day.
[Do you feel that your high school experience prepared you adequately for entrepreneurship? What do you think about high schools in general preparing people for ""off-the-beaten-path"" careers? (ps I went to your high school ;D\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97ralc?context=5)|My high school did not. It's hard to teach entrepreneurship in high school, much less in any school. I think it's important that our education system encourages students to find their perfect career - and sometimes that means not going to college. Sadly, this is very taboo right now, but visibility into non-college options are becoming more apparent.
[Great story.  You have serious balls!  I read your story and just thought to myself, ""Hey, why not?  It's free.""  On a more serious note, where do you see yourself 10 years from now?  What are your stretch goals professionally?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97qxge?context=5)|Gee, 10 years from now...I want to be doing what I'm doing today - improving the way we educate. I'm not sure what that will look like, but I'm sure it's what I'll be doing. It's important to me that I leave amazing things for the next generation.
[Can you please elaborate on the anxiety issues you are faced with now? I am recovering from starting my own business and barely slept for many months and have had horrible consequences that have not gone away and it's been months since trying to give up the dream and focus on myself.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97um99?context=5)|I posted this in another comment, but I'll say it again here: You are more important than your purpose. That was a really important fact that I had to accept before I could better myself. Focus on making yourself healthier, happier and more energized and the effects of that will permeate throughout everything that you do.
[Thanks so much for the advice and info. Do you think that it was the lack of sleep, or the obsessive manner in which you worked for months that lead to your disorder?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97vn1a?context=5)|Who knows; probably a mix of all the above. The more you focus on being happy &amp; healthy, the happier and healthier you will be :)
[What did you do when you weren't working? It almost sounds as if you were locked in like a prison. Did you get out much?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97rwt5?context=5)|Honestly, I didn't do many fun things. It was hell living there, but I learned so much from it that it was totally worth it.
[What's your favorite song?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97qzhu?context=5)|Right now? Or of all time?
 |Right now I'm digging ""Living on a Dream"" by Empire of the Sun.
 |All time: ""The Adventure"" by Angels and Airwaves.
[What about Ke$ha or Enya?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97s78p?context=5)|Yes please.
[What do you do for a living?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97qo6r?context=5)|It depends on how you define ""living"" lol. I run a startup, but I don't pull a salary because I would rather pay my employees more and keep more $$ in the company's bank account. The company does pay for my rent and food each month though.
[How did you not go stir crazy?  What did you do to let off steam, for fun?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97t44n?context=5)|It sucked living and working there - it was really tough sometimes. People, be careful with how far you push yourself. Don't learn it the hard way. I didn't take nearly enough breaks while I was working on my startup and I regret not taking an hour everyday to focus on myself.
[Where did you sleep?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97t44n?context=5)|I slept on couches and chairs throughout the building (but usually in rooms where I could close &amp; lock the door)
[Was all the food free there- do they just give their employees free food like google does?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97t44n?context=5)|They don't have nearly as many choices as Google does. It was limited to cup-o-noodles, cereal, cheese sticks, and whatever was left over from teams that ordered in food.
[Can you recommend a few steps to take, or steps you could have maneuvered around, when forming your company? Is your company aiming to have an IPO in the long term? Thanks for answering questions. Also, you still working out? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97sn8z?context=5)|When starting a company, the biggest lesson I learned was to choose the right people to start it with. This also applies to new hires. A great company is simply a reflection of a great team.
 |We would love to IPO in the long term, but we'll see :)
 |I am still working out. It's important to treat your body and mind well - if you don't use it, you lose it!
[Did you get paid throughout your stay?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97sp62?context=5)|No, I was living off of my own money (or lack thereof). I spent a grand total of $100 over six months.
[Awesome story man!  With standardized testing taking so much of teachers' time and energy, do you think your product is viable? After all, you don't have to sell the teachers on it, you have to sell the administrators and politicians on it. Teaching seems like a profession that leaves little room for creativity or flexibility these days. How do you (realistically\) plan on overcoming this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97r35m?context=5)|Teachers love our product, but the government's current initiatives aren't aligned with our end goal. We're actually working on another product right now because of this exact problem. Claco is growing quickly though (as are many other great edtech companies), so perhaps there is a chance that someday in the future admins &amp; politicians will listen to the masses and change their policies.
[Any secrets about AOL you are willing to share with us that won't get you into trouble?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97qt4r?context=5)|I wasn't an employee, so I don't have any secrets about AOL :(
[What's your stance on charter schools? Do you support public schools?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97t28i?context=5)|Generalizing here, but charter schools are great. I wish public schools weren't so limited by the government. I've talked with a handful of admins and teachers that would love to innovate within their school, but laws &amp; regulations are more or less prohibiting them from doing so.
[What's the coolest thing you witnessed during your stay at AOL? Weirdest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97viva?context=5)|Coolest: jamming out in the music room with two random people. It was awesome.
 |Weirdest: people not coming in to work before 10am - the West Coast work mentality is awesome.
[Were your parents aware of your situation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97y23n?context=5)|No, I told them I was staying on friends couches. They were already really worried about me, and had they known the truth, they would have been even more worried.
[How did you sneak food in on your birthday? Did you ever have friends round to party? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97swh9?context=5)|Thankfully I wasn't there over my birthday! Some of my friends that worked out of AOL would play board games on Thursday nights and (the people over 21) would drink beer :)
[What language is your backend written in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c9842qd?context=5)|Right now we're ruby on rails w/ mongodb for DB and elasticsearch. We also use redis.
[Did you make friends with any of the employees that worked at AOL during the time you were squatting there? If so did any of them know what you were doing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97rkl8?context=5)|I did make friends, and almost no one knew I was living there. I intentionally didn't bring it up much because it could have blown my cover.
[I currently work at that AOL palo alto office as a high student and that place is nice! Did you ever go to the gym there? What floor were you on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97soh9?context=5)|I frequented the gym quite a bit (as that's where I took showers in the morning). I was on floors 1 and 3, but halfway through my stay they revoked my 3rd floor access :(
[Did the dudes you originally started with try and wesel their way back in after the newfound sucess? like for intellectual property or something like that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c983py0?context=5)|Great question - none of them came back trying to leech off our success. That being said, we aren't successful enough yet for it to be worth it. They're good friends, so I'd be shocked if they tried. This is why it's very important to have good lawyers when running an early stage startup.
[You said you went out there with some friends to start-up.  I understand that it's the ""thing to do"" for internet start-ups, but why not just stick around Chicago and live with your parents or a friend and do the exact same work?  What compelled you to move out there to do exactly what you could have done there, or does the Silicon Valley really have that much to offer?  Just curious.  Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97wtwc?context=5)|I did live in Chicago for a while but we needed to raise venture capital and be surrounded by like minded folks to further our company. Your company is a direct reflection of the people you surround yourself with. Silicon Valley is full of brilliant, seasoned internet entrepreneurs and Chicago has far fewer.
[What were you expecting to be the eventual outcome? Did you plan on never getting caught and just living it out until you wanted to leave?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97tmdr?context=5)|It was honestly meant to be a temporary thing until I could find somebody who would let me sleep on their floor/couch. Since I didn't know many folks out here at the time, it took months to find a place for me to stay.
[Say AOL made you an offer you'd be crazy to refuse regarding employment, the startup, whatever. Would you take the offer knowing what the company would be like today?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97wmv3?context=5)|Sorry, what do you mean? An acquisition offer? I don't think I would have taken any acquisition offer, even if I knew it would yield me billions of dollars. The most important part for me was the experience, and no money could buy this experience.
[What are you wearing? ;D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97u0qk?context=5)|[Link to imgur.com](http://imgur.com/QF2VyQe)
[Were there any cameras you had to avoid at night?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c9817ts?context=5)|Not really - you have to have a security badge to get into the building, so they probably don't watch the inside cameras too intently.
[Did the facility have showers and/or a laundry machine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c9846qv?context=5)|No no no no no no no no no NO.
[What are your personal thoughts on educational youtube channels such as periodic videos, veritasium, minute physics, or crash course?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c982d4t?context=5)|Those are great! Anyone that is innovating in the creation/distribution of awesome educational content is cool in my book.
[What is the address to your start up office now? Its totally unrelated to anything in this ama just curious and definitely do not want to squat there. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1blhc0/i_am_the_aol_squatter_ama/c97xx1e?context=5)|I won't give out our exact address as it's residential, but we live very close to University Avenue in Palo Alto!

I've been told what types of projects I'll do including signage around the stadium and the city in general. It'd be crazy to get to see my work on TV or on a billboard in Tampa.

To be honest, I'm not a Bucs fan, but I am an NFL fan and any team that gave me a job would definitely earn it's way to my favorite team spot. Even if I didn't get a job there when I graduate though, I'm hoping it'll be a great piece for the resume.

I'm not sure what it would be, but this is my first experience working in this type of environment so any kind of advice from long-time Bucs fans or NFL employees would be very appreciated."

He has a 3.5 GPA and wants to get that kind of internship, anyone know of any companies that are willing to hear out MSE students for petroleum engineer internships or even jobs?

**679** subscribers for **1 year!**

Oh /r/Ooer, how you’ve confused me. 

Where else can you find these subreddits? This subreddit is the nightmare for /r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu readers. The font is Comic Sans, the subreddit is almost impossible to navigate, users can post anything they want, and all of it is tagged NSFW, what more can I say? I found this subreddit when I was surfing /r/WTF and searched “subreddit”. I regretfully clicked on the link that took me to /r/Ooer. Nightmares ensued, we’ll get to those later.

I have to give props to the moderators for making a largely confusing subreddit and slightly impressive CSS that is guaranteed to piss off everyone from /r/f7u12, seriously. It’s absolute chaos over at /r/Ooer. 

Just because I’m featuring this subreddit doesn’t mean I like it... Okay that’s a straight-up lie, I actually like this subreddit for what it is, a confusing shitpile that makes almost every redditor angry as fuck for torturing their precious eyeballs by looking at this subreddit, we need those tiny little things!

Now that all of that crap is out of the way and you made it through all of that tiny little text, just please, please, please, PLEASE don’t go to this subreddit. The first time I went to this subreddit my eyes were LITERALLY aching by the CSS. That’s what caused these nightmares, I had a dream late at night where I was surfing /r/Ooer (because I’m a fuckhead) and those BBC One things on the stylesheet came alive, turned into faces, jumped out of the computer monitor and ate me. My dreams are fucking insane thanks to this subreddit. 

&gt;##1. WHY DID YOU CREATE THIS MONSTROSITY?!??!?!?!?!?!
&gt;&gt; **/u/Ooer** I originally created it just so no one else would. It sat here to stagnate for a while before I had the idea of inviting a few friends to destroy it as best they could.

&gt;##2. Why is this sub so weird?
&gt;&gt; **Ooer** Apparently beer and a lose grasp of CSS knowledge is a bad combination, who would have thought?

&gt;&gt;**/u/Skuld** This sub isn't weird, it's just a little ahead of the curve.

&gt;##3. Did you want anyone to subscribe to /r/Ooer?
&gt;&gt; **Ooer** I would never want to inflict such a visual enslaught to any innocent bystanders. I guess people subscribed in the same manner as you can't help but stop to look at the aftermath of a particularly nasty road accident.

Hey guys, I am KangaDude873. A new intern over at /r/SRotD. I thought I might give this little end section a chance to introduce myself. I love finding new subreddits everyday, like I did with /r/Ooer, I have found interests in those smaller subreddits with under 1,000 subscribers and stuff, and I try my best to find a subreddit that I might deem worthy of the title of Subreddit of the Day. Well, that's it, nothing much to me really, I hope you get confused at this subreddit as well as enjoy it a little bit. Cheers!"

1bmyww,1,2013-04-03,Somebody who knows something about psychology/psychiatry please help me,Ankshis,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1bmyww/somebody_who_knows_something_about/,"I would really appreciate an opinion, a comment, or a suggestion from a fellow redditor on my situation before my next scheduled psych appointment which is in a little over a month from now.

I'll try to keep my story as concise as possible, for your sake (it will probably end up Long so I apologize). I have experienced what I believe to be an abnormal level of anxiety for my whole life. I have suffered a range of mild to possibly severe panic attacks since childhood, the worst of which I remember to be during my early middle school years. A few of these episodes, most of which occurred in the evening, left me crying in bed with my parents at night over fears of irrational ideas and nightmares. The reason I can not say these panic attacks could have been considered severe for certain is that I am now almost 21 and I have a very poor memory - an effect of the ADD that I have suffered from basically forever, and that I have been receiving treatment for since early this past fall semester. 

Long story short, my ADD medication greatly improves my memory and goes a long way towards alleviating my other symptoms, but I am left with a sporadic sense of anxiety that I need to control. There are days when I can't get one single negative thought out of my brain and there are others when I feel relatively fine. The most frequent occurrences are mood swings that are generally triggered by the memory of a recent negative event that leave me feeling physically ill and unwilling to do anything. These typically last a few hours. 

I have been smoking pot on and off since I was 16 both for recreational purposes and also to help me sleep at night.. I have had sleeping problems for as long as I can remember and pot worked wonders for it. More recently I've been using it as a way to relieve the stress that always seems to plague my mind. Now that I am seeking internships and jobs, smoking pot is no longer a viable method of coping with anxiety and ADD symptoms, so I've looked into other options.

 A caring friend has given me a few 1mg klonopin tablets (which she is prescribed to help her during her panic attacks), which I have divided up into .25mg quarters and have been taking once a day in the mornings along with my other meds. I know, it's bad to self medicate and everything, but I've done the research regarding inter-drug interactions and health risks and everything and I'm pretty positive the very low dose I'm taking is safe. 

Anyway, I've got to say that this little pill is life changing. I never realized how chronically distracted I am by the minuscule, unnecessary worries of life that are beyond my control. The last few days on this 1x .25 mg dose of klonopin have been the most relaxing days I've had in ages, even though I still have the stress of maintaining my schoolwork and relationships bearing down on me. 

I know that benzodiazepines can be physically addictive and dependence can be built quickly, so I am hesitant to try and maintain this crutch until I can see a new psychiatrist in about a month and see if my situation warrants a legitimate prescription. It's worth saying however, that I have several oral reports to give in front of my college classes in the coming weeks and without a benzo or other aid I fear that I will embarrass myself beyond belief, not to mention take a serious hit to my GPA. My performance anxiety has always been a bitch.

What do you guys think...
Should I get a few more klonopins to get me through my next appointment so I can talk to my doctor about anxiety?

Do you think my mental state is out of the ordinary and could benefit from medication like this?

How do I approach my doctor about receiving medication for anxiety?

I don't have a very impressionable mind so various meditative, hypnosis, and other self healing techniques have helped me very little in the past. 
I'm tired of typing so that's what you get. 

Tl/dr: anxiety, add, weed, medication, klonopin, haaalp mehh

1bmv3p,201,2013-04-03,Controlled delivery gone wrong,dat_controlled_deliv,SilkRoad,https://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1bmv3p/controlled_delivery_gone_wrong/,"Had my first ever controlled delivery last week, and basically talked my way out of it. Using a throwaway for obvious reasons.

I've been ordering acid and mj from SR for about 4 months now, though mainly mj. I started off with 7g to try it out, after that I ordered 14g two times, this was my 4th purchase of mj and i became overconfident and ordered a QP, since 4/20 is coming up and i got my friends to pitch in so we would not run out, and maybe even make a little profit on the side. I should mention all orders were done from the same vendor, he is one of the best vendors on the SR and I don't blame him for what happened, I just got too cocky and shouldn't have ordered such a large package.

Now, I live in a uni apartment, and get all my shit mailed to my uni address. This means I have to pick up all my packages from the apt. office, sign and show my student ID. When we get a package we get a little notification from the uni saying ""you have a package, please come pick it up"", etc. Risky and maybe stupid I know, but I did my research, keep our entire apartment clean of any and all evidence, ordered from the stealthiest vendors, and hoped for the best. All my purchases usually took 3-4 days to arrive, but this QP was taking longer and I started to get suspicious. 

What do you know, on the 8th day I get a knock on our apartment door, a mailman in USPS uniform waving a pretty big box in my face asking me to sign. All sorts of alarms go off in my head and I'm about to panic, so I just sort of take it from him and hold it in my hands, looking at it. I paused for maybe 15 seconds (I honestly don't know, time stood still at that point) just staring at the box in my hands like an idiot, but then it suddenly hit me that yes, this is a controlled delivery and if you don't get your shit together your life will be ruined (i have an internship with a big government contractor, parents know nothing, etc.). So I feign suspicion and ask him ""Who are you? Is this some sort of scam?"" and he just looks at me and seems kind of lost and mumbles something about signing for the package. I gained a little confidence so I started pressuring him, ""We get all of our packages delivered to the university mailroom. No one ever goes directly to the address, regular postman would know that. I don't know who [sender's name that vendor used] is. Who are you? What is in this package? You are acting very suspicious. I am going to call the police and show them this package"", etc. And just like that I take the package inside and close the door on him lol (I do realize I should have just given it back to him and closed the door, but I wasn't about to let a QP go so easily, and foolishly thought maybe they'd let it go since I never actually signed anything) He knocked on the door once after that but I really didn't give a shit, as I'm pumped on adrenaline, can hear my heart beating in my ears, and am generally scared shitless. My roommate was looking out the window through the blinds (he smokes with me and when he heard me talking at the door assumed the worst) and later told me the guy just stood at our door for like 3 minutes looking helpless, then just left. 

We inspected the package thoroughly and thought it MIGHT have been opened, but I honestly couldn't tell for sure, and we sure as hell weren't going to open it after what just happened. ~15 minutes later I get a knock on my door and what do you know, guy in a blue jacket and a university cop behind him. He tells me he is a federal postal inspection agent, yadda yadda, and starts trying to intimidate me, saying they know i had drugs shipped to me, and they will get a warrant to search the premises if I don't give them back the package, etc., real bully tone and clearly much more ""in charge"" than the USPS worker (or whoever that was). At that point we still hadn't opened the box or tampered with it in any way, so I just took it and said ""please take it officer, I don't know who this sender is and this package does not belong to me"", and told them to have a nice day. 

It's been a week and so far no one has knocked the door down, so I'm assuming it's all over. 

TL;DR I am dumb, but LE is also dumb, could've just waited for me to sign for a QP of weed at my uni office, instead they tried to do a sketchy controlled delivery to my doorstep and got nothing."

I also go to school in a rural area and I may not have time to visit New York or another retail-heavy metro before I need the tux. I need it in about two months, by the way (*for an internship, of all things...they expect us unpaid interns to attend black tie events!!*)

**I hope to get the fit about right the first time.** I can always send it back after the first event in two months, but it needs to look presentable after light tailoring.

**Then there's the matter of quality.** The tuxes are in the same price range, but the ""Dragon Inside"" once claims to be full-canvassed. That would be huge.

When it comes to these parameters, first-hand experience is the most helpful. **What have you experienced with ""Indiochino"" and ""Dragon Inside,"" and particularly with their tuxedos?**"
1bmt3l,0,2013-04-03,[Request] Logo for a construction company!,[deleted],freedesign,https://www.reddit.com/r/freedesign/comments/1bmt3l/request_logo_for_a_construction_company/,"Hello there!

I'm a fresh Civil Eng. and, luckily, I've been accepted for an internship in a small construction company here in Portugal. This company is owned by a couple who have been able do to *okay* so far relying on word of mouth. But, with the economic mess you might have heard about going on here, they are beginning to struggle and I thought maybe they should start thinking about improving their image.

I've been thinking about starting a website and a decent logo is mandatory. Unfortunately, I have almost no photoshop knowledge and even less creativity. 

[This](http://imgur.com/tB6TwhJ) is what they've been using in headers and receipts , which is not really a logo, just the name of the company.

I bet the name seems weird for you because it's portuguese. It is weird even for me, but i guess there's not much i can do about it.

It's spelled **Sociedade de Construções Manços &amp; Calains .Lda**. 

The words below the logo refer to the kind of works the company does and i guess they could be kept on some kind of banner for the website, but i would get rid of them on the logo.

For a logo, i guess it would be enough to display only **Manços &amp; Calains** or even **M &amp; C**.

[Here](http://imgur.com/hDJWgEi) are some logo samples i googled and liked. Specially the one on the top right and the one on bottom left.

We are focused on many different fields of civil works, from demolitions to making sewers. The only thing i can think of that they have in common is machinery like [this](http://imgur.com/TskTbZE) or [this](http://imgur.com/aEhEVqY).

I imagined something like the arm and bucket of that escavator next to the company name. Or maybe the outline of a shovel behind the letters M&amp;C.

Some logos i also like:

[1](http://speckycdn.sdm.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/constructionlogo_05.jpg)
It's simple and would avoid connecting the company logo to a specific line of work!

[2](http://www.inspiredm.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/40ConstructionLogos_35.jpg)
Just for the wireframe! Not so much the font or the background.

[3](http://speckycdn.sdm.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/constructionlogo_02.jpg)

One important thing is that the logo may easily be adjusted to different situations (like the header of a page or a banner on a website) without a lot of photoshop skill. For example, it would help having a solid background, no matter the color.

By the way, I also don't have a preference for color scheme. The yellow/orange/red seems to be the most usual in the industry, but I don't have a preference for any specific color.

I confess I have no knowledge in design so I encourage you to propose what you think would be appelative and progressive.

Thank you!

I'm a first year senior (staying for a second) at university and will graduate with three majors (math, fin, econ) and a minor (cs) which require me to to take at least 17 semester hours in what I would describe as relatively difficult classes; on top of that I work up to 15 hours a week between 8am - 3pm so essentially I have obligations from 8-5 every day.  This, of course, is without homework.

I'm also in the interviewing stages of internships that relate to banking which is an extremely, absurdly competitive industry. Since it's so competitive I have to work on building my resume so if I were to take anything out (major, minor, work) I wouldn't be nearly as competitive as my GPA is lacking (3.2, industry average is 3.5+) due to challenges my freshman year.

**Problem**

Everything I do piles on top of me at an increasing rate.  I have school work that I'm getting more and more behind on, I have work projects that are coming down the pipe line that I'm struggling with because I don't have enough down time to relax my mind, and worst I have this looming thought of if I'll be good enough to find a job when I graduate.  

Whenever things build up I break down.  I completely stop functioning.  My problem solving abilities go down the drain, my memory feels like it's trapped in a vault, and my motivation is no longer existent.  

I try just about everything I have time for.  Exercising, stepping outside, watching TV for 30 minutes, and really doing anything that get's my mind off everything.  It never works.  

I feel like I'm missing something that other people have.  I don't know if it's my mental health, my physical health, or my time management but I need to figure out something because this is simply not good enough.

I'm willing to take suggestions or field questions and any advice will go greatly appreciated."

I'm pretty good with people and people tend to trust me, however I have some bouts of social anxiety and don't want to do sales.

I have always had fun with words.  I can, on command (like extremely fast) say words backwards exactly as they would sound if played backwards on a tape recorder.  Beyond that, I'm incredible at putting words into other words.  I might be a great product namer. For example, If you gave me a Hair gel product, I could rattle off a ton of amusing brand names for it in about a minute. Here goes.... ""gel mate"" ""Gello kitty"" ""gel curve"" ""gelephone?"" ""Spank geller""  All of these words are based on other popular words/names/phrases.  Its a great trick to use when hanging around with friends.  Thats something i'm good at and have a ton of fun doing.

As we mentioned in the application, this position is all about having a ""get things done attitude"" and right now I really need your help getting something done. Specifically, we are making some big decisions in the coming weeks about Artsicle's next steps and need as much input as possible from artists all over the country. We've created a survey to be used as a baseline for interviewing artists.  I've included details below - shoot me a note when your interviews have come through. 

&gt;Details: Interview 6-12 artists located in the US (but outside of NYC). There are about 20 questions in the survey below, which you can ask in person or on the phone, or you can email the survey. We don't want to blast this (no social media please), but you can cast a wide net to friends, family, hometown, etc and the type of artist can vary as long as the work is visual (vs performance). 

It looks to me like the company is trying to use eager intern applicants to conduct free market research. I don't mind writing a few pages or completing a small task to show off my skills (start-ups routinely give a real-world performance test), but this is taking advantage and perhaps the worst business ethics I have ever seen."

Its here that I'm at a bit of a crossroads. I haven't been able to find an internship for the summer (I'm a junior, 3.1 gpa, one previous co-op, Mechanical/Biomedical). Unfortunately... nowhere I have applied has gotten back to me... and I've been applying like crazy since January. I can't help but be disheartened by this fact...
But just yesterday, a research opportunity presented itself to me. Housing is covered at my school over the summer, and it will be paid. 

But I am concerned, should I take this research opportunity or hold out for an internship? I'm trying to get into the medical device field but I don't want to do NOTHING this summer. 

I guess what I really want to know is, does research or internships look better on my resume? I am graduating next spring and will need a job.

Is research or an internship better?"

I clearly know nothing about this other person, a stranger. I almost just want to be around them some more.

Alternatively, I guess it's plausible that some women just enjoy looking at and checking out a guy without having any interest in being approached. Even if it's over-the-top ogling though?

That's my question. But here is the somewhat-relevant back story that made me want to ask this question, for those interested:

I was unloading some boxes from my truck at a worksite (I am an architecture intern and this was a Vet Med hospital we're building, fwiw) and I notice this really cute, sorta half Japanese girl throwing glances my way. I would have really liked to talk to her, but I wasn't sure what I'd talk about because I only know that I liked the way she looked; and that is a weird thing to say to some one. Nearly every girl I've ever been interested in has been a friend or a friend of a friend; and if I approached one of them, I would have something to say. Or even with flirty baristas, there is a clear segue to asking those girls out. The decision I made here was to just get over myself and do my job and leave without acknowledging her."

I will be transferring to a 4-year college hopefully within a year. I have been teaching myself programming since middle school. I've learned Java, C#, PHP, Go, among others throughout this time. I live with my parents. At 15 years old I sold a gaming-related site I made in PHP for $20,000+ to some company (split with friend who did design/graphics). Southern California.

Current Position (Numbers are as ranges for anonymity): ""Software"" Intern, however actually doing report automation (business intelligence) (This is my first job of any type). This position is more IT-related and is almost too easy for me. My pay is $20-22/hour. I have been at the company for 1 year and 6-10 months. I work 5 days a week. I have been told that there may be a potential position open for me soon, however it may be IT-related. I want to make software/websites instead of producing automated reports (which is essentially IT). In my opinion the company also has a talent drain ever since they declared a focus on Sales talent instead of Engineering at the latest quarterly meeting.

Current feelings: I do not enjoy the work that I do at my job as it incredibly under-utilizes my skills (which are Java/C#/Go, etc). The pay is also kind of low. I dread going to work everyday as the work does not use any of my skills, and is 80% office politics. I don't like going to work anymore.

Question: Should I quit and work on my own skills/projects while finishing College? I have notecards full of side projects ideas to work on (ideas/businesses, or just projects for my portfolio). (I have always wanted to do this.). Or, should I stay with this company for one of the full-time positions I can eventually get, even though it may be IT-related? (Perhaps would look good on a resume, and would be good additional pay, instead of just an internship). I feel that the only reason I would stay around for a promotion to full-time would be for additional money, or for my resume in the future. I don't necessarily need additional money to live right now, as I am just saving up and living at home. Or should I do something else?

Let me know what you think. Thanks"

   I am currently updating my resume and I'll detail the specifics of my situation/background below. I'm looking for pointers and advice to help somebody inexperienced sell themselves a little better and get to the interview stage where I feel very confident. I'm also widely considering moving to a... ""*more resourceful*"" geographic location as my hometown/local area are in a bit of a rut and aren't producing jobs in my field. 


You may find a draft of my resume below (please let me know if the link works!):

https://dl.dropbox.com/u/59554772/Resume%20-%20Sample.docx


   I have interviewed in my nearest major cities (roughly 2-3 hours away via car) and I would be happy to relocate to these areas at my own expense if something came through for me. Applying to these cities though I feel like I am on the outside and at a disadvantage for that as well as my lack of experience, on top of the fact these major cities feature far more competitive job markets.


   I am a recent graduate - I have been out for roughly one year, unfortunately not working in my desired field during this time. My background is in Business Administration/HR and I do have experience working as an HR assistant as well as working other ""business intern"" or ""team leader"" positions. I am seeking to realign myself in entry level HR or a Recruitment position. I feel I lack the tangible sales skills on my resume (which I would also be happy to gain right now) to get into recruiting and entry level HR in general is a bit tough to get into for me.


   I have volunteered a lot of my time working with not-for-profits and charitable organizations, sitting on boards of directors, and I feel I have a lot to offer but simply cannot make things work out in my hometown (very manufacturing/industry based, depressed area, high unemployment rates). I have reached out to my network to find that unfortunately nobody has the resources to bring me on right now but they are also helping me search. I have a scheduled appointment with a career counselor and I will be getting a resume critique there as well so I may come back with further updates soon!

   The closest ""resourceful"" areas (areas with plenty of opportunities) I have interviewed in and would gladly relocate to for the right offer are Toronto in the West and Ottawa in the East. Moving out of Ontario is also possible given the right opportunity.


Thank you all for any advice and constructive criticism. I need all of the help I can get at the moment :)"

I have a major decision to make in the next month and I have been driving myself a little crazy thinking about it. Here is my situation.


I work full time, M-F, 8-5pm for the state government in a secure job with rather nice health benefits. Since this job offers a State Tuition Waiver, I decided to go back to school to finish my BA in International Affairs with a minor in Asian Studies at FSU. I can only attend classes in the Summer and Fall. I cannot leave the office between Feb. - May because of the Legislative Session. 


I asked my boss how he would feel about me attending classes during the day, part time, making up the missed hours with a combination of Annual Leave and Comp time. I even offered to work late but that was shot down. I had three reasons to ask this. I cannot use the State Waiver for online/distance learning classes, I must take a language class for my degree and the one I want is only offered during the day, and there are no classes for my major offered during non-working hours during the Summer. Let’s just say some stuff hit the fan, my job was threatened, and I have pretty much given up all hope of the person in charge of approving the use of the waiver ever allowing me to use it.


My Plan B was to switch universities to American Military University and complete their BA in International Relations. I can take all my classes online so it would not interfere with my work. I would give up learning Japanese in a classroom setting, a chance for a study abroad, access to the FSU career center, and any benefits of getting to know my classmates and professors/networking, etc. BUT I would have my degree and keep my job.


My Plan C was to look at my budget, quit my job and look for part-time employment, get health insurance through FSU, and bust my butt to finish my degree while looking for scholarships, internships, volunteering, and tutoring Japanese.


Here is my goal: Get my degree, do the JET Programme for one or two years, apply to the Foreign Service, and if the FS doesn't work out, pursue work as a translator or with a company that has branch offices in Japan (Hyatt, or perhaps another hotel chain, etc.).


Ladies and Gentlemen, I am 35 years old and I have some student loan debt already. My current student loan payments are $280, though they will go into deferment while I attend classes. I have no credit card debt and about 5k in savings. As much as I would love to think I can get some scholarships, I am thinking that I will have to take more loans. How crazy am I to even think about giving up a full time, pretty secure job to go back to school? The job I am at now is not one I want to make a career with. I plan to leave this state as soon as possible.


Thank you for listening and I’d love some thoughts/advice/whatever!

I noticed there weren't many portfolios up on the [listings site](http://creativity.cias.rit.edu/), so I thought I would post up a message here to remind everyone. If you're not listed there currently but are looking for an internship, feel free to post here or shoot me a message.

Design wise, we're on the lookout for someone with good user experience and interactive skills. Whether you make killer wireframes or have a passion for creative web work, come talk to one of our designers.

Dev wise, I'll be there looking for someone with good front-end chops. We're a well rounded dev team, but having someone that likes to focus on front-end would be a big asset. Ideally it's someone that likes to explore new tools and tech, and is constantly testing out and integrating fun things into their projects.

We're not looking for ninja-guru-rockstars, we're looking for down to earth, fun, creative, skilled, and enthusiastic people that are excited at the idea of being a part of our family.

If you're curious about the kind of work we do or the clients we have, or have any other questions, I'd be happy to answer them. Even if you're not exactly what we're looking for right now, we always keep tabs on cool and talented people for when we have future opportunities. I'm always happy to give a dev portfolio / code review as well. Either way, at least [come say hi](http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10100431041845725&amp;l=f12a977f2a)!

PS. Are the garbage plates from Crossroads still any good? (I mean, as good as they can be.)"

I'm choosing between this program and a program at ISU called Medical Lab Science. I'm really interested in medicine, biology, and research/lab work. I also would love to learn about environmental health. I'm considering graduate school but haven't decided beyond not Medical School.

I'm looking to see what sort of internship opportunities as well as job opportunities there are within the program or that I would be exposed to by choosing UIUC. I am guaranteed an internship with the ISU program, but I believe that U of I probably has more to offer, I just may not know where to look. I know it can be hard sometimes for a biology major to find a job, so I want to make sure that whichever program I choose will give me the best advantage to finding and landing a promising career.

Thanks in advance to anyone who replies!"

This is a submission to the ""Interns Wanted"" program, where you have to come up with a product that helps people go cashless. I'm thinking that this device makes the card almost theft-proof, and can keep track of your purchases, so illegal personal purchases an be accounted for.

I have always been on top of interview attire as I interviewed for a lot of scholarships, grants, jobs, and internships in college. It always was appropriate to wear business formal to interviews I had.
Over the next week or so, however, I have three interviews to be personal gardeners for wealthy and/or elderly clients in my community. Each one has asked me to met them outside on their property to go over the details, look through the gardens and to kind of get a sense of how I envision the property looking post spring clean-up.
I would like to know what would be the most appropriate attire for a chilly spring morning tromping through a wet lawn for a private client. The best I can seem to muster is a nice pair of slacks, button up and structured blazer with rainboots haha. Is this appropriate? I am a woman, 22, if that helps."

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[What's your Distro of choice? Do you think Ubuntu will continue to be the leading Linux Distro for the foreseeable future? What other Game Devs/Publishers do you think will make the jump to Linux? Where do you see Linux gaming in the future? Will this dream last. What's your opinion on Canonicals MIR?](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1bnaoh/valves_gdc_talk_slides_porting_source_to_linux/c98ea4c?context=5)|I use Ubuntu, but that's primarily because it's what we started with. (I use 12.04 LTS).
 |I can't make forward looking statements about unreleased products--I'd get in trouble. But I can say that looking backwards, the momentum we have so far seems to be pretty great, and I'm hopeful that Linux really can capture some mindshare and provide people with a ""real"" viable alternative. To be clear, I think everyone here knows that Linux is already a real, viable alternative--but for various reasons it lacks mass-market appeal. And I'm hopeful we, the community, developers like Valve and IHVs (like NVIDIA) can help fix that.
 |My feeling on all of the alternatives to X11 is ""why?"" Why fragment further for a clean room implementation? Refactoring is almost always better than reinventing. 
[Is togl suppose to be Valve-only?  Is Valve expecting to share it with other game developers so that they have an easier time porting to GL?  Can you estimate how much time and money is needed to port a graphical intensive game like Crysis to OpenGL and Linux?](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1bnaoh/valves_gdc_talk_slides_porting_source_to_linux/c98f82z?context=5)|The complexity of the port is heavily dependent on the code in question. It took us a long time to get a port that was functionally equivalent down to almost the last pixel--and also to get the performance to be better than parity. But I don't think other developers would need to spend that much time, and something like togl could massively simplify that for all developers. For something like Crysis? Maybe a few months.
[Is nvidia looking for personnel to work on their Linux driver? I'm doing my Master's in CS right now and looking for summer internships, and am interested in this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1bnaoh/valves_gdc_talk_slides_porting_source_to_linux/c98f82z?context=5)|We're always looking for talented people, and the linux driver in particular is looking to pick up some folks. I think it may be too late for summer internships for this summer, but it wouldn't hurt to ask. Message me privately.
[Could you tell something about hlsl-&gt;glsl shader conversion? Alen Ladavac (Croteam's lead programmer\) said somewhere Direct3d (HLSL\) shaders are more optimized during compilation. Is offline compilation available only for HLSL? What does mean ""GLSL asm-like"" (page 71\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1bnaoh/valves_gdc_talk_slides_porting_source_to_linux/c98dfh1?context=5)|HLSL can be compiled offline using fxc, and then the resulting bytecode can just be fed to the runtime later. fxc does perform some optimizations.
 |This is somewhat unfortunate, actually. fxc chooses to ""optimize"" things based on a theoretical model of some hardware (that doesn't exist) rather than on the actual hardware that's in a user's machine. The actual optimizer in the driver then has to spend significant effort trying to reverse engineer what the shader was actually trying to do to properly optimize it for the hardware in a user's machine.
 |GLSL asm-like means to write a simple assembly-like program in GLSL to feed to the hardware. 
[So, I take it you're rewriting shaders in GLSL, not converting them with HLSL2GLSL or mojoshader or something?](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1bnaoh/valves_gdc_talk_slides_porting_source_to_linux/c98ek6i?context=5)|The Source Engine actually compiles shaders to HLSL bytecode with fxc, then disassembles that, spits out an assembly-like language that is compatible with GLSL then compiles and uses that.
 |Rich has said several times that if he had to do it over again, he'd use a third party tool instead of doing this code himself--and probably would prefer a different approach altogether.
[Why is EXT_swap_control_tear something you might want?](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1bnaoh/valves_gdc_talk_slides_porting_source_to_linux/c989ufp?context=5)|When presenting the frame to the viewer, the GPU can either present as fast as possible, or it can try to give you a solid image. The problem is that monitors cannot handle ""as fast as possible,"" they will give you images at 60 or 120 Hz (older monitors support other modes, but most monitors these days are either 60 or 120 Hz--or 59.9).
 |Because the GPU may have pictures to show you at rates that don't match the monitor's framerate, there are a couple of ways it can behave. In one way, it just swaps out where it's scanning data from while transferring data to the monitor. This creates a ""tear"" in the image which can be jarring to users.
 |Another mode is that it waits for VSync, which basically says ""always complete the full picture scan out, then swap the buffer before the next read begins.""
 |The problem with Vsync is that if a developer doesn't show up in time, they wind up having to wait for the entire scanout process before they can continue, which is some fraction of 16 ms. That means their framerate will be impacted very severely for just missing by even 0.001 ms. Yikes!
 |EXT_swap_control_tear allows an app developer to say instead ""Hey! If I show up in time for vsync (by some margin), then wait for vsync. But if I'm late, just tear and render right now.""
 |That allows a developer to try and calm down their processing to get back to 60 Hz, keeps tears up near the top of the screen (rather than being all over the place) and doesn't overly punish them for being 0.001 ms late to draw a frame. It's basically the best of both worlds.
[I don't really follow here. Alt Tab is the used shortcut on several window managers to change current window. What do they mean by breaking Alt-Tab, does Valve want it to be something on their games and break the window manager shortcut or is it something else and I'm completely lost here?](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1bnaoh/valves_gdc_talk_slides_porting_source_to_linux/c98d5ld?context=5)|Alt-tab should continue to work. But if we use the low-latency mouse-reading functionality, the keyboard also gets grabbed and that prevents alt-tab from working. 
[Did you try using Eclipse (with C/C++ support\) as a debugger?](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1bnaoh/valves_gdc_talk_slides_porting_source_to_linux/c98cyjm?context=5)|We used MSVS on PC and vim + cmake + g++ on linux. Other people used other editors, but none of us were using Eclipse.
[Will a video of the talk be available?](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1bnaoh/valves_gdc_talk_slides_porting_source_to_linux/c98cju4?context=5)|I believe at least the GTC version will wind up on the web. I'm not sure about the GDC version. They're effectively the same talk, so one should hopefully be as good as the other.
 |Edit: Videos from GTC will be available [here](http://www.gputechconf.com/page/home.html) in a couple of weeks. And the GDC video should be released as well (for free), also in a few weeks.
[On slide #46 it says.](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1bnaoh/valves_gdc_talk_slides_porting_source_to_linux/c989f9c?context=5)|There's three places in the API I think about handedness (that I was referring to when I wrote that slide). One is the coordinate system, as others are describing. The handedness refers to which rule describes +Z--the right-handed rule or the left-handed rule. Another is default polygon winding. For three vertices that you traverse in the order A, B, C, which way is considering towards the viewer and which is away? The right- and left- handed rules again provide handedness. If you imagine one vertex at the base of your fingers, one at the knuckle and one at the finger tip, and maintain that your thumb points toward you, then you see that the right-handed rule means counter-clockwise wound vertices face towards the viewer. Similarly, the left-handed rule would suggest that clockwise wound vertices face towards the viewer. Finally, the last handedness is whether you're using a column vector on the right or row vector on the left to represent the input position. Matrix operations effectively ""stick"" to the position, so the difference matters when you're multiplying multiple matrices together (it's easily fixed by picking one and transposing as necessary, of course). Again, GL (by default) uses a column vector on the right--D3D prefers to use a row vector on the left.
[*Handedness: D3D is left-handed everywhere, GL is right-handed everywhere.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1bnaoh/valves_gdc_talk_slides_porting_source_to_linux/c989f9c?context=5)| 
[EDIT: thank you for all your replies, and interesting to know that this is different between D3D and OpenGL.](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1bnaoh/valves_gdc_talk_slides_porting_source_to_linux/c989f9c?context=5)| 
[It's Dota 2 on Wine Intel/DRI, it is a bug on Intel Mesa driver and I'm trying to (help\) fix it. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1bnaoh/valves_gdc_talk_slides_porting_source_to_linux/c98d7i5?context=5)|I'm an nvidia guy, so it's unlikely I'll spend time tracking down a bug on emulation (we're working on native ports) on the MESA GL implementation on Intel hardware.
[Wine is not an Emulator, in fact Wine D3D-&gt;OpenGL is similar to your 'togl'  :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1bnaoh/valves_gdc_talk_slides_porting_source_to_linux/c98dhg8?context=5)|Clever name notwithstanding, WINE is emulation in exactly the same way that togl is emulation. It's just not hardware emulation (which was en vogue around the same time work on WINE began), which is where the name came from. By that I mean WINE is emulating (reimplementing on another platform) an exact, ABI-compatible version of a library from a different platform. This is exactly the same as togl, as you point out. togl uses GL to emulate D3D so that the application doesn't need to be aware that it's not actually running on D3D. The first thing I'd do if I were looking into that bug would be to figure out if GL is spewing any errors, particularly around shader creation time or later when attempting to render the characters. Then I'd ensure that the shaders were translated correctly (but they probably were since other things are rendering), and would ensure that the geometry is being faithfully represented. Hope that helps!
[I didn't ask you to fix it, just maybe to provide hints on what could cause such a bug, since it is a Source Engine game.](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1bnaoh/valves_gdc_talk_slides_porting_source_to_linux/c98dhg8?context=5)| 
[Thanks for this small AMA anyway :\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1bnaoh/valves_gdc_talk_slides_porting_source_to_linux/c98dhg8?context=5)| 
[Would you be allowed to give us vague estimates for the release of other source titles like dota 2, portal and cs:go?](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1bnaoh/valves_gdc_talk_slides_porting_source_to_linux/c98iafj?context=5)|Unfortunately no, but it was a nice thought.

[What happened with the piano when Wayne forgot how to spell ""Howard""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mhxp?context=5)|My biggest screw up on the show, and that's what people remember the most!
 |There's a button on my keyboard marked ""ACC"".  I never used it or even noticed it was there, but there are a million buttons on a keyboard that you never use.  Apparently it stands for ""accelerate"".  As I was playing I started laughing and must have accidentally bumped it, but since I didn't know it was there I had no idea what was happening.  I couldn't figure out what made it speed up like that, so I just had to turn it off.
 |The best part for me was watching Colin trying to keep up with the dancing as it sped up, and the totally baffled look on his face. 
[Has there been a time on the show when you could no longer play the piano because you were laughing too hard? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mn28?context=5)|It doesn't happen often.  When you're playing for improv like that, you have to be so focused; listening to the singer, thinking about where you're going next, etc.  that things don't sort of register as funny the same way they do when you're in the audience.
 |That being said, there was a  Three Headed Broadway Singer we did where it was going great, and Drew got all swept up in the moment, and sang a whole bunch of words ""Won't you take me on a...""  When he realized what he'd done, he looked so genuinely surprised.  I had a hard time keeping it together for that.
 |Just so you know, when I'm not playing, and just watching like an audience member, I laugh my head off.
[Do you have the hoedown song permanently stuck in your head?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mn50?context=5)|OMG, till the day I die!  And what they cut out of the shows was how long I often had to vamp between singers...they'd be thinking  and thinking, and I'd just be going round and round forever. Ahhh!
[What do you do during the games where no music is involved?  You don't talk on the show (except the time you messed up the piano and sped up the music way too much for Wayne Brady\).  Was this a requirement from the director(s\), or you are allowed to talk, but choose not to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mldh?context=5)|When they played non music games (the least interesting part of the show if you ask me) we would hang out on the side lines, freezing our butts off because they kept the studio really really cold. We would just watch like the audience members.
[What is your favorite type of games?  One with music and one without?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mldh?context=5)|Of course the music games are my favorite.  Even when I'm watching an improv show and not playing, I like the music improv the best. 
[Were you supportive of the show bringing on Linda Taylor and Cece Worrall in later seasons of the original run?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98meny?context=5)|Linda also played on my band's cd, we scored a short film together, we've done live shows together. She's the best.
[Also, which hoedown was your personal favorite?  Drunk mother, going bald, director, zoo…there were so many great ones! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98meny?context=5)|But Linda's the one. For one thing, she's a totally badass guitar player.  We became such a team, and worked so well together that when the new shows came up, I didn't want to do them if she wasn't going to be there too.
[Will she be joining you on the new Whose Line as well?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98o9jt?context=5)|Yes, yes, yes.  I love working with LT.
[How much pre-show taping rehearsal time did you normally have? Did you know which styles of music you were going to play in that episode? I've heard lots of accusations about the show not being completely *improvised*, and the music games are so tight and well-done they seem like likely culprits of pre-planning. Would you tape multiple takes for the edit or are we watching it raw as it happened?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98nxr1?context=5)|I've said in a different thread how our process worked.  Even if we played around with a style before the show, the guys never heard the suggestions ahead of time, and we never did multiple takes of one song.  However, the show is edited.  We would do 5 or 6 Greatest Hits and the producers would pick the best 3 for the show.  So we were really improvising, but you're only seeing the stuff that went well... Or sometimes the stuff that went horribly wrong, because that can be funny too.  But what you're not seeing is the stuff that's just mediocre. 
[Who else is coming back for the show?  EDIT: Woo first famous person I have gotten a reply from! Thanks for the reply and I can't wait to see it!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98o1l8?context=5)|Ryan, Colin and Wayne.  New host, Aisha Tyler. Some new fourth chair people.
[How much were the musical parts of the show practised beforehand? Did you or the players know what tunes you were expected to do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mjgm?context=5)|We would do a music workshop about 5 days before tape days.  The producers would throw a bunch of styles at us, maybe 60, and we'd fool around with them. Sometimes we'd need to do more research on a style (like when they brought up Slack Key Guitar for example). Sometimes the singers would have to do some work if they were going to do an impersonation, and we'd have to find a good key for them to do the vocal impersonation.
 |When the weekend of taping started, the producers would let Linda and I know what 25 or so styles might show up in the three tape days. But we never knew when they would show up, and of course the guys never knew what the subject would be till we were taping. And of course Ryan would often throw us a curve ball in Greatest Hits and throw whatever he wanted out there.

[What other live improv gigs have you done?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98nal4?context=5)|I was touring for a while with Drew Carey and the Improv Allstars.  Right now I don't have any group I play with regularly, but I sit in with different people when I get a chance.
 |My favorite is with a show called ""Opening Night: The Improvised Musical"" at the iOWest.  And yes, it's a full on musical, with  dialog, songs, choreography, all improvised off one suggestion.  They're brilliant!  www.improvisedmusical.com/
 |There's also an all girl group in Austin that does the same thing, ""Girls, Girls, Girls"".  Amazingly talented! [Link to www.gggimprov.com](http://www.gggimprov.com)
[I would love  to hear more about your band!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98obtl?context=5)|Go to our website, and give us a listen.  [Link to www.thesweetpotatoes.com](http://www.thesweetpotatoes.com)
 |We started because my husband, Rick, made a short film and cast Kelly to play his girlfriend.  While they were working, he realized that her and I like a lot of the same kinds of music (Emmylou Harris, Patty Griffin, Dixie Chicks, etc).  So he suggested we should try writing together.  I was like ""It's more complicated than that"", but it turns out he was right.  We love writing and singing together, and now Rick sings, plays bass and harmonica.  When we're on the road he jokes that it's not as fun as you'd think touring with your wife and your girlfriend. 
[I have a few questions: -What was your favorite game to be a part of? -What was your favorite game to watch? -Who is your favorite Whose Line member?  -Are you close to Wayne, since most of his shining moments were with you? -Do you know how we can get tickets for the new season?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mgth?context=5)|And, along with my husband, I'm teaching song improv which is tons of fun.  I alos made a cd called Improv Karaoke that helps people learn how to do it. It's got all these great improvisors on it, like Keegan Michael Key and Dan Castallenata to help teach Here's that link: www.improv-karaoke.com.
[Just cleaning up your question for ya.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mjps?context=5)|Alright, I won't have to answer anyone else after this ;)
[What was your favorite game to be a part of?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mjps?context=5)|Either Three Headed Broadway or Greatest Hits were my favorite.
[What was your favorite game to watch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mjps?context=5)|I always liked Film Noir, when Ryan and Colin played it.  It's so stylized and cool.
[Who is your favorite Whose Line member?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mjps?context=5)|The one who can always crack me up is Colin.  There's just something about him.  I also think Greg Proops is a genius.
[Are you close to Wayne, since most of his shining moments were with you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mjps?context=5)|Wayne and I aren't especially close, just cause since Whose Line we've both been doing really different things.  It will be great to work with him again.
[Do you know how we can get tickets for the new season? Thanks for doing this AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mjps?context=5)|I have no idea how to get tix, try the CW website.
[Greg Proops isn't JUST a genius, he is THE SMARTEST MAN IN THE WORLD.  (don't believe me? Check out ""The Smartest Man in the World"" Podcast w/ Greg Proops\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98npgo?context=5)|His podcast is great.  And yes, Greg deserves more love. 
[How did you prepare for the show? Did Drew ever ask for an artist or genre you didn't know and did you wing it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mohb?context=5)|Yes, one time Drew said Elvis, and for some reason I thought of Elvis Costello and Linda thought of Elvis Presley (which makes way more sense). We had a big crash and burn moment.  But I think it was edited out.
 |Not to disappoint anyone, but the show was edited. For example, when we played Greatest Hits, they'd usually use 3 songs, but we probably did 5 or 6, and they picked the best ones.  So when people ask ""Were they really improvising? They can't be that good all the time"", the answer is yes, they were improvising, but they weren't that good all the time.  Its just the nature of improv.  
[How did you get the Whose Line gig?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mo07?context=5)|I started out as a Musical Director at The Second City in Chicago, and also played with other improv groups like The Annoyance Theater, Improv Olympic, ComedySportz, Theater Sports, etc. One of the guys I toured with at Second City, Ron West, had been on the British show, and was hired as a producer on the American version. He got me the audition.  I auditioned along with Wayne Brady and Brad Sherwood, so it was easy. 
[Does it pay as well as other TV acting/writing jobs? (i.e. six figures per year\)? And do you still get royalties?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mo07?context=5)|No, I wish it did pay six figures!  It's a totally different scale because it's considered a game show.  I am still getting international royalties (they love us in Australia). But since the reruns aren't on ABC Family anymore I don't get American royalties anymore. All those YouTube reruns don't bring in any royalties at all!
[A game show? Didn't anyone tell them that the points *don't matter?*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98q3pc?context=5)|No kidding.
[Having been Musical Director at The Second City, do you know Tiny Fey or Amy Poehler or worked with them at all? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98phv9?context=5)|I am a little bit older than those two (just a tiny bit), so I had already gone by the time they started.  Some of the people who were there when I was were Richard Kind, Mike Myers, Dan Castellenata, Rose Abdoo, Ron West, and toward the tail end of my time, Steve Carrell and Stephen Colbert. I did one touring company show with Chris Farley.
[ the Irish Drinking song theme?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98nd1h?context=5)|We never did the Irish Drinking Song as much as the Hoedown, but it had the ability to get stuck in your head too.
[OOOHHH...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98nd1h?context=5)|When I would drive home after work, I'd have to play music, any music, loudly in the car to get one or the other out of my head. 
[Great followup question! Also, have you ever been hired to play blind folded at a random unknown location?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98ofe0?context=5)|No, but I did play where I couldn't hear.  I did a live benefit show once with Robin Williams.  He turned to me and said, ""Let's do a gospel number"", but when he turned back to the audience I couldn't hear him at all. It's hard to improvise with someone when you can't hear them.  So I was watching his back, seeing how he was breathing to get an idea of how he was phrasing. I must have done okay, cause when we were done, he turned back and said ""That was great""
[Blame the sound booth guys for not feeding you his signal through your monitor/foldback or earphones! Speaking of which, did you use floor monitors or in-ear monitors on Whose Line? Which do you like better?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98pnw4?context=5)|In the first episodes that we did with Clive Davis you'll notice I was wearing the world's ugliest headphones, but luckily that didn't last.  We used floor monitors, but the guys did have to be careful not to come to close because they had clip on mics on that feed back easily. 
[As far as improv goes, do you have any jazz background? Also if you could play any other instrument, what would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mn82?context=5)|I do have some jazz background, but like many of the styles we did on Whose Line, I can flirt with it, but I'm not a pro at it.
 |I do play a few other instruments: guitar, accordion, ukulele, melodica, percussion.  I'd love to play tenor saxophone. The two time's I've tried, I practically passed out from all the ari it takes.
[1\) What is your favorite memory from the show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98moh2?context=5)|My favorite memory was the Three Headed Broadway I mentioned above, where Drew sang a bunch of words at once.  There was also the time when Wayne accidentally made a girl he was singing to skirt go up and kind of flash the audience.  He was so embarrassed, and she was totally a great sport about it.
[2\) What can we expect from the rerelease of Whose Line is it Anyway? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98moh2?context=5)|On the new shows, we'll have a new host, Aisha Tyler.  They've also auditioned some new people for the ""fourth chair"" spot, and there will be some new guests as well. Linda and I have all sorts of new gear and ideas, so we're amped to go. 
[Was there any joke made on the show that offended you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mpaa?context=5)|Never on the show, only on the tour bus ;)
[If they've been filmed yet, Who was your favorite guest star? If not, who are you looking most forward to having on with you all? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98ml6k?context=5)|We haven't started taping the new ones yet, we start in a few weeks (and they'll start airing mid-July).
 |I don't know who all the guest stars will be, but I do know they've been talking to Keegan Michael Key, who I love and adore.  I'd love to have him do the show.
 |In the old shows, Sid Caesar was my favorite,  funny and smart and  a perfect gentleman.  I also love meeting Florence Henderson, who I grew up watching on The Brady Bunch. 
[Hi Ms. Laura Hall. Everyone give Laura Hall a round of applause; Ms. Laura Hall on the piano.  A little while back I was watching a documentary of all the iterations of Whose Line is it Anyway, and they mentioned in the UK tapings, the piano player was actually an improv artist who also played the piano. Because of his musical talents, he almost never got a chance to do anything besides play the piano.  My question for you is, did you find yourself in a similar situation? Where there any times where you wished you could have participated in other games where your musical talents (which I believe nearly all of Waynes points that, ""didn't matter"" could be attributed to your skills as an improvisational musician\) weren't required?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98nx5y?context=5)|People ask me that a lot.  I love doing the music improv so much, I don't ever wish I could do the acting part.  I admire it, and it certainly is more out front and visible, so people a lot of times assume I'd want to do it.  But I've been a musician all my life, it's what I love to do. I love the collaborative process of being in the world of improv, but I love it from my end of things. 
[A big Whose Line memory that stands out for me is the Richard Simmons episode. What was it like being so close to that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98oifr?context=5)|Like standing near a tornado.  
[Is Kelly Macleod related to Kevin MacLeod?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mkee?context=5)|No, Kelly is not related to Kevin Macleod. But she did used to play in a band called Private Life, that toured with and was produced by Eddie Van Halen.
[Do you have a ""go to"" key that you use more then others cause you know most actors on the show are comfortable in it?  And inversely do you have some keys you avoid?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98nu27?context=5)|Interesting question.  There are certainly some keys for some singers that are better.  But because they sing in lots of different styles they use their voices in lots of different ways, so different keys are good. hows that for a vague answer?
[When you first heard about the show, did you think it was going to even make it past one season, or did you think it was going to become as big as it did?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mxax?context=5)|Every season when we got picked up it was a surprise and a miracle to me. Not because I didn't think it was good, but just cause that's the nature of this business. 
[What was your favorite game from the show? (I liked ""Props"" personally...\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mxax?context=5)|Besides music games, Film Noir was my fav.  I liked Moving Bodies too. 
[How many points have you gotten?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98oi4t?context=5)|I have gotten some, but I've never added them up.  And one time Drew was throwing around $100 bills, and  I got one of those. 
[Is Colin Mochrie as funny in person as he is on the show?  Everything he does just seems to be so deliberate, and like he's been planning it for ages even though it's all improv.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98oiuc?context=5)|Colin is just straight up funny no matter how you slice it.
[Wow, thanks for doing this AMA!  Did you ever have difficulty improvising for so long? I do blues jams in the area and after a while I begin to run out of my bag of tricks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mo71?context=5)|I know what you mean.  But I think because we played in lots of different styles, each one had its own bag of tricks. 
[Are Ryan and Colin close in real life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98nwli?context=5)|Ryan and Colin have know each other for a long time, like maybe since high school. Yes, they're old pals, which is part of how they improvise so well together.
[Did you major in music in college? Where did you go if so? I'm a music education major, which is why I'm curious...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98nxl5?context=5)|I did get a general music degree from Mundelein College in Chicago (which is now part of Loyola)
 |I learned how to do music improv at The Second City in Chicago listening to the great Fred Kaz, who basically invented the genre. 
[I'm so glad I caught this AMA before it was too late. I'm a huge fan of Whose Line, I've seen every episode at least three times and am currently in the process of watching them all again in preparation for the comeback this summer. I couldn't be more excited.  How much did the producers interfere? Do you think they'll be as strict this time around, or less so since it's on The CW instead of ABC Family? Probably too early to tell.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98ojny?context=5)|And it was always the censors more than the producer who would limit what we could do.  I have a feeling the CW will be less strict.  It's also 9 years later, and there's a lot more on tv that couldn't be 9 years ago. 
[What's one or two great moments you can think of from the song portions that never made it to air? Wayne liked to push the boundaries a lot, especially when working with Chip (such as the... what was it, squirrel eating through the golf bag? Then several lines about balls.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98ojny?context=5)|Some of these I've answered, but I want to say, my favorite was when Chip and Wayne did the music together.  They both challenged and pushed each other in really good ways.
[How did you get into the world of Improv Musicianship?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98o0fh?context=5)|When I was in college in Chicago I got a job waitressing at The Second City.  I wasn't particularly interested in improv, I wanted to be in bands, write songs.  But I got hooked.  Fred Kaz played there, and he was a great mentor.
 |The summer before my senior year I got asked to take a demotion from being a waitress to go out with the touring company.  My school allowed it to be called an internship, and that first year of touring I would go back to the hotel after our shows and do my homework.  So the lesson is Stay in school, kids!
[Do you have a guilty musical pleasure?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98n5uu?context=5)|I'm a big fan of the show Nashville (which Chip Esten is on, but he goes by his big boy name of Charles).  That's sort of a guilty tv and musical pleasure.
[I'd like to ask you about this weird little kids' show you did called *Wheels on the Bus*.  What was the story behind THAT?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98ohvz?context=5)|It was my first chance to do any film/video scoring, and I jumped at the chance.  Plus I got to have Roger Daltrey come to my home studio to record his tracks. It was wild!
[Why would they do what?  Not play only music games? Keep the studio cold? Or, not give her a mic? Actually, now I'd like to know the answers to all of those.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98oc3d?context=5)|Why would they not play only music games?: I don't know, I think it would be a great show.
 |Why would they keep the studio cold?: Most taping keep the studio cool so the audience doesn't get sleepy. Tapings are long, and can get tedious while they're doing some of the technical stuff.  But they kept it REALLY cold on this set.  Linda and I wore winter coats and gloves when we were off camera. check out the picture of us in our arctic gear.

[Hi Laura, I grew up watching Whose Line and will always love it. On the show, did you get to work closely with Drew, Ryan, Colin, and Wayne? If so, are they as cool as they seem?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mpqa?context=5)|They are all great guys, and really fun to work with.
 |The only thing with hanging out with improvisors (as compared to hanging out with musicians) is that they never stop talking.  They're always riffing on something, trying to make each other laugh.  Some of the funniest stuff that happened was between games, when the cameras were off and they were just goofing around, waiting for the next thing to start.  
[Hi Laura, thanks for doing this!  Asking for my brother since he doesn't have an account, but he was wondering how you and Wayne worked together onstage (as if you guys had any hand signals or the like\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98oid5?context=5)|Wayne was very good at telegraphing physically where he wanted to go, although we never worked out specific hand signals. 
[I play a bit of guitar myself and I was wondering if you had any advice on learning different genres of music and improvising in them. Is it just about knowing the established conventions theory/composition wise (I IV V progressions and things like that\) or are there other things to know?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mu42?context=5)|It is largely about really listening to what makes a style sound like that style; rhythmically, harmonically, tonally, etc. and then copping it, but not worrying about being too authentic.  Playing for improv is more like doing sketches than full on paintings, you know?  At the same time, you have to think about playing things that will be not too hard for a singer to follow, and doing lots of leading as the accompanist. Sometimes you have to compromise for that.  For example, if the suggestion is Sondheim, his stuff is super complex harmonically, and would be really hard to improvise to, so you have to tone it down a bit.
[I seem to remember you using a Roland XP-80, what other equipment did you use and was there anything interesting or unusual about the setup?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98oif9?context=5)|I think Linda has the Roland.  I used a Korg i30 which is actually a rather cheapy keyboard that they don't make anymore.  But it was easy to move around in quickly, which is essential.  Also I use a Boss 440 drum machine, again for the same reason.
 |For the new shows Linda and I are upgrading all our gear, so we will  be sounding better than ever. 
[Don't know if it has been asked yet, and I can probably Google, but what is your musical background and how did you realize you had a talent in music and at what age?  BTW Looking forward to the new episodes, I never understood why it was taken off the air.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98oi9k?context=5)|I started playing piano when I was 9, with classical lessons.  Around 7th grade I was interested in all kinds of music, and my big sister was dating a guy in a band, so I started teaching my self to play by ear, etc.  I did get my degree in music, and I started touring before I finished college.  I've been really blessed.
[Any quick tips for song improv for piano?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98oibt?context=5)|I have a blog about this that's got several.  [Link to www.improv-karaoke.com](http://www.improv-karaoke.com/blog.aspx)

[Ryan hated them the most.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98monu?context=5)|Yes, Ryan hated them the most for sure!
 |I'll just say that I found the other games like Greatest Hits and Duets way more fun because you could be freer.  The hoe down is such a specific form, it's kind of like playing Mad Libs or something, you're filling in the form, rather than creating the whole thing more from scratch.  
[I, too, want to know if the musicians were allowed to talk. (Edit: After watching the ""Howard/Horward"" song, I see that they didn't really have speaking mics to talk into.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1bov4g/i_am_laura_hall_improv_musician_on_whose_line_is/c98mno6?context=5)|I suspect they might have had to pay us more if we talked!

I've been working with the daughter at a large counselling center for about a year, and we've become somewhat close. Plus I'm attracted to her and I'm pretty sure she's attracted to me. There's been some flirting and a number of intense one on one conversations. 

Recently I invited her to a party and got her facebook. Her pictures verified what I had guessed might be a possibility based on her last name (which I just learned, and is very uncommon). 

The party is actually a going away party because I'm moving far away. So I'll lose contact with my friend, and none of this will matter. But I feel awkward that I know all this stuff about her mom. I haven't told anyone about this yet because I feel like the whole confidentiality thing is such a mess, especially on the off-chance I still become long-lasting friends with this girl.

Does it make the most sense to just let go of this friendship so as to not have to deal with awkwardness/discomfort/ethical issues? 

Also, hypothetically, if I had incredibly strong romantic feelings for my friend (which I don't, not really) and she for me, would that matter or change your advice at all?

I've been a long-time lurker on /r/cigars. Rarely have I seen a subreddit full of people who are all so gracious and willing to help, so I figured I'd finally step out of my comfort zone and ask for some advice. 

I am a college student aged 21, and have always been interested in cigars and loved smoking them whenever I get a chance. However; being so young and relatively inexperienced with this craft, I normally walk into cigar shops and just take a shot in the dark on what's a good stick. 

I have a decently high-paying internship for the summer that will be starting in a little over a month, and with the extra income/financial flexibility, I thought that this might be the perfect time to pursue my goal of becoming a cigar connoisseur. 

Advice is the main thing I am looking for. There are so many brands at my local shop and I don't really know what is quality versus what is shit. Like I said earlier, I'm the type of guy who wants to become more involved in cigars, so my main question is as follows:

If you were to talk to your uneducated cigar-connoisseur-self years ago, what would you say? Brands, things to look for in a good cigar, things to avoid, trustworthy resources, untrustworthy resources....any and all feedback is much appreciated!

Thanks a lot everyone!"

But how do I do it, I originally planned to go to university abroad, but it's looking like places like Canada are out of the question because of money, but I've decided that's where I really want to live in the future. As of now I might be going to a English Uni which i don't want to at all but have no choice to. 

What are my options realistically? Could I up and spend a year doing an internship somewhere (like Canada...) on a year long visa, where I could earn money to fund a uni abroad. 

Are there any loans or funds available to international students? My grades are terrible so no scholarship due to me having no motivation in any part of my life, it's a wonder I passed with how I feel day to day. "

I know the job process takes time, but I'm at point where it's upsetting/frustrating. Yeah I can blame the crappy economy. I can blame my university for not warning me of this situation. Hell, I can even blame myself along with a million other things.

I just don't get it. What the f%ck is going on? As of today I've sent out a total of 145 applications. I've applied *everywhere*! (throughout my home state and even 17 different states across the country). I've cold called/emailed alumni, gone through my school's career center services, networked through LinkedIn, used online job boards like Monster, Indeed, etc....hell I've even gone through subreddits like /r/engineering, /r/getemployed, /r/resumes, and /r/jobs!

I've gotten 1 interview with company X, 2 rounds of interviews with company Y, and am waiting for for Z to set up an interview with me. Company X didn't extend me an offer and I haven't heard back from company Y for 3 weeks. I've had my resume and cover letter looked at by industry professionals, professors, and even some friends.

I feel like it comes down to me being perceived as ""good"" but companies always seem to find someone ""better"". And it's not like I'm applying to positions that I'm not qualified for. I can't even find an internship because a lot of companies are looking for student interns (aka people still in school).

I know that there are a lot of new graduates in similar situations but I don't find comfort in that. I've also seen a lot of my engineering friends being picked up over these last few months. 

This transition period has been a lot more difficult than I imagined. It's like I'm in a dark tunnel right now I can feel the tracks going forward but I can't even see a pinhole of light.

**TL;DR** It sucks to be a new grad right now."

For right around three years now I have been crushing hard on this girl and never had the courage to tell her how I feel. I have been promising myself for ages now that I was going to ask her out, but could never muster up enough courage to do so.

Since I have started nofap, I have become a better person. It didn't help me to ask her out, the confidence I had from nofap carried over from my life and gave me the opportunity to ask her.

        
 I felt so out of character doing it, and honestly it was kind of awkward. It was right after the last class of the day. I had been telling myself all day that I was going to do it. I started to doubt myself though, I had told myself that lie yesterday and the day before and so on. I came up with bullshit excuses to not talk to her, usually that it wasn't the right time or that she was talking to her friends so I would ask her later. I had been writing letters the week leading up to this day, reasoning that it would be much easier to give her a letter that explained how I felt. Pads of paper and trash bins later, I never finished one letter. 

The bell rings. Take my time getting up from my seat, talk with friends while walking to get my stuff from another teachers room. I know her locker is right outside that room, I know shes there everyday. I see her, she jokingly doesn't let me pass by her. My mind goes completely foggy, clouded by adrenaline. The past three years have been culminating to this point. Do it, Do it **DO IT** my chest starts to scream, only to be drowned out by the music of my confused mind. The excuses start to kick in. There is always another time, there are too many people around, its not the right moment, she's with her friend. I crack a smile and sputter something unintelligible. I let her pass me and then I turn to make my way to the parking lot. Then I hit the brakes. What the fuck am I doing man? No right moment just exists, motherfucker. **YOU MAKE THE RIGHT MOMENT**. This hit my head in less than a second. I turn around say ""Jane (Name withheld), Can I talk to you for a second?"" At this point I'm on fucking autopilot, It felt like I had no control over what I said. The only way I can describe it would be to say it was like being in third person in the sense that I was watching two other people, but still in first person in the sense that I was looking through my own eyes. I ask her ""Do you want to go out sometime""?

 Those six words took three whole years to utter, and I said it with such little strength. She said sure. Cue me saying ""That was a lot less awkward then I thought"" (still cringing at that one), and then we parted ways. The rest of the day was so surreal, I couldn't determine if I had actually just did what I thought I did, but I experienced bouts of extreme happiness, catching myself cracking my face from smiling so hard. 

This was on 4/3/13. This Friday were going to see a movie.

 



I cant thank you guys enough. Through this community and my subsequent abstinence from fapping, I HAVE become a better person. I have made new friends, lost over 70 lbs, started to work out, gotten a fucking internship at my local state attorney's office, learned python and java, learned how to play the piano, and my buddy and I started a fucking 3D printing company. I just turned 17 in February, and I cant fucking believe how much I have changed in just a year. I have become the person I envied, and there's no derailing this train anytime soon. 

Many of you may not read this post, and that's alright.

This has been a super stressful week, and I haven't been handling it the best.  I'm so glad that it is behind me.
I'm a college student. Sometimes I feel like Asher Roth: ""I hate college but love all the parties"" But sometimes I don't even care about the parties, sometimes I'm just like DAMN this is hard. Thats what I get for going to a top 25 public university (rolls eyes).

So, my boyfriend is out of town this weekend.  We are next door neighbors, so we spend probably too much time together. (Ahh, young love.) But he is gone from Wed. midday to sunday midday and somehow 4 days seems like a lot.  To combat my loneliness, I'm going to be extra crafty/productive/on top of my game during the day.  And catch up with some of my buddies at night.  

I sound SO OLD right there.  Like, really?! I'm only a junior in college.  I'm new to the reddit community, but I have been a loooong time imgur lurker and everyone there seems to have such self-pity being single.  Its almost pathetic.  I have always been too damn independent for my own good.  In high school, when my friends had their first serious boyfriends, I was refusing to take boys seriously.  They all had problems.  Any guy that got too close got shut down.  At 16 my ""boyfriend"" (can we even really call it that?) told me he loved me......after 2 months.  People are so devoted to being in a relationship and getting experience and so much of it is for show.  So, he's the only person I even ever kind-of dated in highschool.  And I dumped him a week after he dropped the ""L"" bomb. (perfectly natural reaction in my opinion) 

I got to college and at that point I was just too crazy to date anyone.  I was too busy occasionally getting mind-fucked by this one dude one on hand, and drinking to excess with my friends.  There was no time for the responsibility of a relationship.  

Sophomore year I was still the crazy party girl I always was, but I started to feel like something was just a little ---- missing.  My best friend and roommate had always been single and free with me and she started dating this guy who went to another school.  It was just a little weird.  I always had lots of fun, but i felt sad sometimes about not having someone.  Its not something I dwelled (dwelt?) on though.  I got plenty of attention from my friends, and have a great family.

This summer I lived by myself in my apartment, in my college town, while all my friends liked at home for one last summer.  I worked a 9-5 internship, and just came to my empty apartment everyday and got a little hazy while I cooked dinner.  This solitary lifestyle was a totally new thing for me.  I did a lot of self-improvement like reflection and really built my confidence.  A couple things shook me this summer, but depending on myself for once made me so much stronger.  

I guess it was pretty obvious when we came back to school because suddenly I found myself wrapped up with 3 boys.  I don't mean like, oh I was having sex with three dudes at the same time, because I wasn't.  But, they were all interested and me, and the feeling was mutual.  They were from three different parts of my life and I didn't know what I wanted.  None of them had made a move to exclusivity, so I was just living the good life.  I was concerned because I knew that my days of playing the game were going to blow up in my face.

Then, I met the neighbor boys while I was sitting on the stairs one afternoon.  We chatted for a minute and then I went inside, to prepare for my birthday festivities. (This was at the very beginning of the semester, actually the night before the first day of class) There's a knock on the door and the guys invite us to pregame.  On a whim, I go and have a good time over there.  Another friend gives me a ride out, and I meet up with some other friends at the bar.  A little later I see one of the neighbors at the bar. The cute one. The (hopefully) single one.  The tall one. *swooooons*

I believe that these events: my disinterest in boys, my skepticism about the general young relationship, my resistance to commitment; is ultimately what led me to be  at a place where I can be truly truly fully happy in this relationship. 

Maybe I'm a fool. Maybe I'm blinded by my first love.  Maybe I'm just really enchanted with him.  Maybe one day I will end up hurt because of this. But even if thats the case, even if it doesn't last til the very end, I am grateful for this experience.  The way I feel when I'm around with him and all the wonderful emotions we've experienced together are so precious, no matter the outcome.  I'm living in the moment and I'm happy."

Today I arrived early as usual and sat at my desk reading emails, etc waiting for my supervisor to arrive and start off the day's work. Few minutes later a lady from another department and rudely asked for my supervisor. I told her he wasn't here yet and asked what she was here for and if I could help. She looked me over and I could see what was going through her mind ""just an intern as if he knows or has the authority to help"" so she predictably said no dismissively and went to sit at my supervisor's cubicle to wait for him.

Thinking nothing of it I went back to my desk. Someone passed by and said good morning to her. Thing is the passerby called her ""Lisa"" and then I remembered that I had processed an office laptop to be issued to a Lisa due to be picked up today, the paperwork was done and dusted and just required her signature and she could take it and leave as long as any member of IT, me included, signed for it. 


So I decided if she wants to wait for my boss, then wait she shall. So she waited for him to arrive twiddling her thumbs, me redditing for the next two hours 26 minutes (yes I counted). So he arrived and guess what? He directed her to me to give her the laptop and sign the papers, all of 60 seconds it took. If looks could kill...

1btfbb,13,2013-04-06,Am I A Terrible Person?,[deleted],askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1btfbb/am_i_a_terrible_person/,"Wall of text confession time.

My bf and I have been together for over 4 years and we've had our share of ups and downs. I've expressed to him many times over the years my intention to marry him. But ever since, I would say, last October, it's been not so pleasant. We got into a big fight because in my attempt to be more open and honest with him about problems in our relationship, he took it as me attacking him which led him to not talk to me for a week. When he finally started talking to me again, he said that he didn't speak to me because he wanted me to feel as shitty as I made him feel. Which, to me, is incredibly immature. 

In spite of this set back I was still looking to move this relationship forward. I even started looking at rings. But I guess when you heavily contemplate spending the rest of your life with someone, all those negatives in a relationship really start to shine bright and make you question. All those little things like we don't watch the same tv shows, or movies...or listen to the same music. To the big things like how our ideas of sexual intimacy are sometimes conflicting (to say the least). The fact that his initial reaction when I try to touch him, is to push my hand away. Our sex life has been terrible the past few months. I'm away on business a lot and when I come home, he's usually not in the mood. It's like the stars have to align for him to want it. Which of course gives me lots of confidence

He was the first man I was ever with. He is genuinely an incredible person. He's hard not to love. I'm pretty sure some of my friends love him more than me. And the one thing I am certain of, is that no matter what, I always want him to be happy. But I don't think he makes me as happy as I make him. I've noticed that I come home from business trips and I get upset more quickly. I'm not as excited to talk to him over the phone when he calls. I used to question our relationship but as soon as I saw him, all of those feelings went away. But now those feelings are coming back and a lot more frequently. To the point where I think about it every time I'm away for work and it causes me all kinds of stress. And now I have those feelings when I'm home with him. 

We've been together for so long and have invested so much in each other, (we don't share bank accounts or anything but there have been large joint purchases) I don't want to throw it all away. He's not even a year out of college. He's not making enough money to support living on his own. If we break up, he either has to move in with his best friend's family, or move back in with his mother and homophobic stepfather (who still somehow don't know about us).

Just over a month ago, I got an offer from work to move from Boston to NYC. That started another fight between us. He's started up with a good job that he is doing really well at and we don't want to tear him from that and make him start over with me in another city. He made it very clear that it was either the promotion or him. So I initially turned it down. But the other day they made it very clear that the offer is still open and they want me to take it. When I left college my dream was to live in NYC. After working in the city a lot, it's not as great as I had it in my head, but it's still something I'd be open to try. I feel like it's the perfect opportunity for a fresh start.

Do you know that episode of How I Met Your Mother at the end of season 1 where Lily is applying for the art fellowship in San Francisco, and her car gets a flat tire? Ted comes to help her out and he realizes her plan which would mean that she's leaving her fiance. As she's trying to explain to Ted her intentions, she says that even though she loves Marshall, all her life she has played it safe. From her education, to her job, to her relationships. She's lived her life mistake free. That's kind of how I feel now. I feel like after college every decision I've made has been the safe one. I picked an internship with a company I had no interest staying but took it because it was convenient. I took a job afterward that pays well, and it's rewarding, but it takes such a toll on me, and once my debt is payed off I can't see myself staying there much longer. My bf was there and supported me every step of the way and he and I have put up with a lot together. But choosing to stay with my bf to me now feels like I'm playing it safe again. And I would feel like I've already settled down at 25. The only reason I stay is because breaking up with him, I think, would devastate him and like I said before, the one thing I never want to do, is cause him any pain. But am I really going to stay with him just so I never have to hurt him, even though I feel like it's hurting me?

We met online while we were both in the closet and because he was the first man I was ever with, I've never gone out and actually dated in the gay community. Maybe I want to spend some time to see if I can find THE ONE. Someone that likes the same movies I do. Listens to the same music I do. Likes going out and trying new things. I'm sick of going to the movies alone. "
1btc47,1,2013-04-06,Intermittent no-start on 1996 Town Car (Excessive detail ahead),Gangringo,MechanicAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1btc47/intermittent_nostart_on_1996_town_car_excessive/,"I bought a 1996 Town Car a few years ago.  I know, not exactly the most practical vehicle with gas prices as they are but I'm 6'3"" and got used to the room and comfort when I worked as a chauffeur for a while.

Other than a couple electrical gremlins (horn and cruise control don't work and the turn signal clicker will go off randomly) for the first couple years it was a complete tank, no problems whatsoever outside of regular oil changes.  This last winter it started having serious problems with stalling and warming up when it was cold (California cold anyway) which were fixed with a new thermostat.  Around this time I got a check engine light for a misfire on cylinder 7.  I noticed some damage to the spark plug wires so I replaced them, plus the spark plugs and the coil packs for good measure.  When I did this, I did a compression test and found the 7 cylinder and one other (I forget which) had low, but not dangerously low compression.

This brings me to my current problem.  All of a sudden, even though the worst of the cold is over, the car stopped being able to start in cold/damp weather.  I couldn't narrow it down to either cold or damp because this time of year they go hand in hand.  The starter turns 100% but I get no ignition.  After the day warmed up, the car would start on the first crank, purr like a kitten, and never sputter or stall.  This was even the case if I started it, then it got cold/damp while it was running.  I didn't really have any chance to troubleshoot the problem because if it didn't start in the morning I had to high-tail it to school another way and I had to leave town for a week in the middle of all this.

Fast forward to yesterday.  The car started in the morning, even though it was pretty cold and damp and I drove it to my internship.  When I left it was about 3:00 in the afternoon on a beautiful spring day.  When I tried to start the car I got the same problem, the starter cranked strong and fast, but the engine just wouldn't start.  I had thought ahead and bought some starting fluid to see if that helped, it didn't.  I opened up the air intake after the filter, and the car started right away.  I checked the filter and it was dirty, but not excessively so, but I replaced it anyway.

Now here's my problem.  It seems to me like correlation should not imply causation here.  If it was a restricted airflow then it seems like it should have more problems than just starting, and the temperature/humidity shouldn't be a factor (not that they were the last time I had the problem).

I also ran a full diagnostic on torque and this is what it gave me:

That looks to me like one or more of the exhaust gas sensors are out but I can't find any information on what sensors those codes refer to.

I really don't want to call this fixed if it isn't but I really don't have the time to diagnose it when it does fail, and I really don't want to be stranded anywhere."

2. Is there a limit to the number of people that can declare a CS major in the EECS department? Do most people who apply for a CS major get accepted?

3. As a student in EECS, is it hard to get into classes for other majors, for example a computational class in the bioengineering dpt?

4. Are the advisors generally available to answer questions about majors and classes, or are they overwhelmed by the number of students?

5. Does the career center help with internships, or do the students generally just contact companies on their own? Which is more common?

Lack of local work and I lack a place to live.

  I know a crap ton about multimedia (Photoshop, Video Editing, Film, Theater, Creative Writing, Animation, Flash, AS3 programming, Webdesign, &amp; Music Engineering) I've started to get into indie gaming as a potential source of income because it's the one thing that allows me to put all my skills to use, but it's a slow start.

 There's very little in the way of public services in the small town of Southern Utah, where I live. I'm wondering if anyone has a better idea where I could find local work, or exchange my talents for a safe place to stay. No crim history, no smoke, clean.

 Here's a couple of links of things I've done with my local community Theater. [This scene was for a Star-Trek inspired play](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vWvLxFwyW4). It was displayed on the Starship monitor. The gaps are for the actors on stage to give their lines. 

[This was from one of our favorite plays called ""Hairless""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fjef0HunRNA) Inspired by the play ""Hair"" I'd love to put this entire play online, but we would be breaking far too many copyrights. I'm the guy with the dreadlocks passing out sugar cubes that sends our cast into the past to relive their hippy days.

 I'd be happy to work on low budget community projects. As a school aide. Or intern at a studio. If you have the opportunity, It don't matter where in the world it is, I'll find a way to get there. I'm looking to start a new life for myself and bring my skills to someplace that could use them. I've got a place to stay for a couple weeks. I'm willing to pack up and leave on short notice."

Good work I enjoy, the chance to move around the country, and all the other perks that come with it. But just as much, I wanna find a like minded person to share it with. Maybe even another engineer. Someone confident, passionate, deep. Someone to play videogames with who gets my off the wall poetry and who deeply cares about a cause or art of their own.

I realize in the grand scheme, I'm thinking kinda selfishly; I can't really expect someone as confident, ambitious, and deep as I'd like to be with to just drop their career and go off with me, and meeting someone who's also career compatible isn't likely to happen until later in life -- right now, my entire peer group is worried about finishing school and scraping together jobs.

Honestly, realistically, I know my expectations are kind of absurd. 


Should I expect to settle later in my life? 

How do you do that without telling yourself that you're settling and without being an inherently shitty person for not appreciating the magnificent human being you're with?

In great detail she described it was a very expensive vibrator one that you ride and she didn't want to destroy it.  I was a bit taken aback but asked her if she could ask where she bought it from.  She said she ordered it from online.  I asked her if the catalog or company had a 1-800 number she could call to ask either from the company that sold it or the company that made the product.  She stated she wasn't sure.  I also suggested that she call a place like Doctor John's or a sex shop that deals primarily which sex products.  I told her all I can offer is probably use water based products.  She thanked me and said she would give Doctor John's a call.  Oddly enough one of the pharmacists I worked with probably 4 years previously had received a similar call from a middle aged woman asking a question on a ""basic vibrator"".

There are two colleges that I am very interested in but I am not sure which one would be better for my future after college. Here is some information about both.

College A: Large public college. Less expensive so I will graduate with less debt. For this college, I would major in Computer Systems Engineering and if I keep my grades up I can get a Bachelors and Masters in 5 years. There is about a 50% chance that I can get a co-op or internship during this time.

College B: Very small private college. Very expensive and I would graduate with a lot of debt. In this college I would be doing a dual degree program so I would go here for three years and get a Bachelors in Computer Science then be automatically transferred to a very prestigious university and complete a bachelors in Computer Engineering in another two years. In this time, I would have a 80% chance of doing and internship of co-op.

I shouldn't be like this. My family makes enough money to live comfortably and help put me through college, and I have a caring girlfriend. I can't help but feel like I'm a failure though. Growing up, life was supposed to be easy, I was supposed to know what to do. Now, I don't. My grades aren't as good as they should be and I feel overwhelmed. I know I need a job or an internship, but I can't find it in me to go out and look for them. I know I should change, but I can't. I don't know why I can't adjust. I'm a failure and a waste of resources

I can't kill myself. I'm a coward. I wouldn't know how to start. But I find myself welcoming death. Sometimes I fantasize about getting t-boned by a drunk driver, or an earthquake swallowing me, or a random act of violence just ending me. Ease my guilt and pain, without anyone knowing how fucked up I am inside. Wait, no. I don't deserve to say I have guilt and pain. I was given a golden opportunity in life and somehow I always feel fucked it up.

I can't talk to my parents about these thoughts. I can't stand their judgment, since I'm certain they already see me as a failure. Every time I talk to them I leave the conversation feeling like shit, anyway. Can't even begin to imagine how bad it would be if I told them I have suicidal thoughts. I can't talk to my girlfriend, because that will just hurt her and distract her from her own successful life. I don't want her to worry about me. I can't talk to my friends because they're succeeding at life while I feel like I'm drowning in it. Everyone in my life deserves better than what I can give them. 

What's the point to life, anyway. I'm an atheist. When I die, I'm either bound to go to nothingness, or the eternal pit of hell. Why bother prolonging my time here when I can just go ahead and see whats waiting for me.

The worst part is, I don't know what I'm trying to accomplish by posting here. I'm expecting advice like ""talk to someone"" or ""see a doctor"", but I can't see the positives. If I see a doctor, what happens? Either there's something wrong with me, or there's nothing medically wrong and my mind is just rogue for no reason. Who can I talk to without ruining the fragile social structure that I have in place?

God, I'm sorry for rambling on so much. If anyone reads this, thank you for making it so far. This is the first time I've ever written any of this down or verbalized it in any way. I just. . . don't know what to do."

I've been lurking here for a while and it's nice to just read posts from people who are going through the same kinds of things. I've been talking to my family and boyfriend about it, but it's not quite the same (partially because the bf does his reading on the internet and he's convinced that cutting out carbs is going to cure me and... no).

I was diagnosed in 2009 after a hospitalization and didn't want to admit I was sick (and my GI doctor was a jerk and didn't listen to me about anything). I stopped taking meds for almost three years, and although I still had symptoms (mostly just awful abdominal pain) it was easy enough to ignore because I've had some form of stomach pain for my entire life.

I started trying to take responsibility for it this past summer and started with a new GI I like a lot. Started back on Pentasa/Entocort. But since I started trying to be a responsible adult, everything's gone downhill. I was hospitalized in October with a partial obstruction and started on Imuran after that. Hospitalized again in January for the same reason. My GI gave me more time for the Imuran to kick in and put me on prednisone, but that also didn't work. And I was hospitalized this week with a microperforation so Imuran's not working. And now it's time for Remicade and probably surgery once I get things into remission, because I've got strictures and scarring and all of that fun stuff.

I'm also dealing with depression and anxiety issues (the job market in my field is just... bad...) and all of this at once is just really overwhelming, you know? Everything just seems really fucking overwhelming. I'm trying to keep up with the job hunt, work an unpaid internship, and now I have to make a billion followup appointments. I'm worried that if I ever do find paying work it's going to be an issue having to take the time for Remicade infusions. And I'm very lucky in that my parents are paying to keep me on their insurance but I feel guilty every time something like this happens. I just feel like a money sink. It's just so MUCH, for everything, and it's for the rest of your life.

What do you guys do when things seem overwhelming and like it's just too much to handle?

1bszi8,2,2013-04-06,College freshman with loans: What to do with money from summer internships?,chickennoodlegoop,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1bszi8/college_freshman_with_loans_what_to_do_with_money/,"Hey there guys,

I tried searching but haven't been able to find something that's quite my situation, so I decided to just make a new post.

**Here's the background story:**

I'm a college freshman at a prestigious university studying computer science and engineering, possibly double majoring in business as well. I'd had my heart set on going to this university since middle school, so when I got in, even though it wasn't exactly within my parents means to fully pay for my college education, they decided that they'd do whatever they could to help me pay for it.

Essentially, my parents are contributing $30k a year and I'm taking an unsubsidized Stafford loan for $5.5k per year since it has a lower interest rate than private loans. The rest (approximately another $20k a year to be conservative about it), is coming from loans that my parents are taking out under their name so that we can get lower interest rates. It's within their means to pay those off, but since I have a little sister and I don't want to screw her college options over, I will be doing my best to pay those loans off myself.


**Now here's where I need your advice:**

Partly because of prior experience and partly because of pure luck, I'm going to be interning at a rather successful startup in the Bay Area this summer. After living expenses, transportation, and food are taken into account, I'll be making a cool $15k over the summer and I'm just confused about what to do with it, or money from future internships in general.

My gut instinct is to put it all towards the loans with the highest interest rates, but I know that I don't know too much about personal finance. I reasoned that it's possible that something counterintuitive like putting it in a retirement fund or investing it somewhere might work out to be more beneficial, so I just wanted to get some advice. Based on what I've seen and experienced and been told at my university, once I graduate, the combination of my degree, work experience, and skillset should have me making $100k+ a year in the Bay Area if that provides some further information regarding how likely it is that I'll be able to pay off those loans in the future if not now.

Thanks in advance and sorry for this really long post!

**TL;DR: College freshman confused about whether he should use summer internship money to pay off loans immediately or invest/save it.**"

**TL;DR at bottom**

I recently bought LM:DM and registered it, and registered a different users XL so I could give them a free Starfox 3D. Now, around a week and a half later, my mom surprised me with a Pikachu XL (Something I presume she's been holding on to, otherwise she is very lucky. I spoke of it to her, but in the way that one might be inclined to talk about something they like to someone who doesn't care about it. I never actually expected her to pick up a word I was saying, but she got it for me, for being accepted to a summer internship I was really anticipating. Anyways, back on track...), so I have an XL, but no code. If anyone was feeling generous and had an extra LM:DM or MD:GTI code, that would be so awesome. I could buy MD:GTI, but if I were to buy a new game, I'd rather just buy Fire Emblem.

**TL;DR: Used my LM code to help another user out, then got an XL, now looking for generous donor so I can cash in on that sweet StarFox.**

**NOT DEALING THE HAND THAT'S DEALT**

*A Whole New World*

Nothing is as it seems in Irrational's BioShock Infinite. The mystification that Ken Levine crafts throughout this amazing video game is stunning and sends the player on a journey through the very fabric of space and time. What if you walked instead of drove to the store today? What if cars had never been invented? What if the South had won the American Civil War? What would life be today if certain aspects were slightly changed or had never even occurred at all? These questions and more are explored in BioShock Infinite's complex and masterfully crafted journey. 

From the opening moments to the hours after the credits roll, your jaw will be dropped. It's very rare that a first person shooter will make you want to search every room for any little audio diary or story detail. The first 30 minutes or so of my initial playthrough entailed mostly of just slowly walking around Columbia and taking in the sights; a sequence that easily could have been done in five minutes if I had skipped past all of the interesting details. BioShock Infinite is an exhibit of masterful storytelling, creative gameplay, and incredible art design. I would be stunned if a better game gets released this generation.

Whereas Rapture was an underwater metropolis in 1960, Infinite takes place in 1912 on Columbia, a surreal floating city in the sky. While both settings share their similarities, there are many important differences. BioShock took place after the fall of Rapture. In Infinite, Columbia is a thriving and fully functional utopia. It's difficult to say which backdrop is ""better"" since they are both so different and unique in their own ways. The best way that I can put it is that I met Columbia with the same fear and wonder as when I met Rapture.
 
Early on in the game, you hear an a cappella group singing ""God Only Knows"" by the Beach Boys. This song was released in 1966. Later on, you hear the tune of Cyndi Lauper's ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun"", released in 1983. Both of course completely out of their element. I knew that they wouldn't do something like this for no reason. Thankfully, small out-of-place touches like those get answered masterfully throughout the narrative, but not directly. Rarely will someone tell you a detail and then how it relates to another. The details are presented to you in the form of a puzzle. You alone are left with putting the puzzle together and each realization is more fascinating than the last.

While BioShock was more or less limited to a theme of objectivism and a strive for perfection, Infinite deals with much more. That's not saying that the themes in BioShock were shallow; they were far from it. Infinite just goes further. Racism, religion, and politics are the three centerpiece themes of the story. The most amazing part of this is how the themes are presented. Instead of a cutscene where the villain tells you his plan and then you go stop him, these details are shown through posters, background dialogue between bystanders or a PA announcement as you go through a building. All information is retained but presented in an immensely refreshing and unique way. 

*""Bring us the girl and wipe away the debt.""*

You play as Booker DeWitt, an ex-detective with nothing to lose. He's sent on a mission to find a girl, Elizabeth, and bring her to New York in order to pay off an old debt. A major theme in Infinite is the relationship between Booker and Elizabeth. The evolution of the characters is so drastic and expertly paced throughout the narrative that the two are much different people by the time you see the credits. The relationship that evolves between the two characters is some of the best character development I have yet to see in a video game.

Elizabeth isn't someone you have to escort. She isn't someone who will frustrate you every time she dies and you have to restart a checkpoint - because she won't die. Ever. It ends up being quite the opposite, actually, as she spends most of her time during gameplay keeping *you* from dying. She will find you health kits, search for ammo when you're running low, and sometimes even toss some money at you. As I described before, one of BioShock Infinite's most fascinating story elements deals with alternate realities. Elizabeth has a unique ability to call in supplies, objects to use as cover, and even powerful robotic allies to aid in combat, all through tears in space-time. In the story, her powers dive much deeper than simply being used as combat aids.
 
*Gameplay*

Combat is centered around gun play and using your genetically modified super powers to kill enemies. While the basic mechanics remain more or less unchanged from the original BioShock, Infinite adds a noticeable level of polish and luster to the gameplay. Instead of plasmids, your abilities are called vigors. Instead of eve hypos, you find salts that replenish your vigor powers. While they are functionally the same, I found myself using the vigors far less than I used plasmids in the original BioShock. In addition, instead of having a wheel of weapons, you are limited to carrying two weapons at a time. This adds to the difficulty and utilizes Elizabeth's ammo hunting mechanic well. 

The primary antagonist is Zachary Comstock, founder of Columbia. I found him to be as memorable as Andrew Ryan, if not more. His place in the story is extremely compelling and the revelations that you experience throughout the story are astounding. On the contrast, I found that the basic enemies you face during combat are far less interesting than the splicers in Rapture. The enemies you face in Infinite are just vanilla soldiers that you mow through from combat sequence to combat sequence. Each splicer in BioShock felt like they had their own story to tell and were scattered unpredictably throughout Rapture. In Infinite, you more or less move from one action sequence to the next facing the same enemies. You are, however, given many more tools and abilities to fight the enemies with which manages to keep things from getting too stale.

Because Infinite takes place in a huge sky metropolis composed of hundreds upon hundreds of different air ships, the inclusion of skylines is both logical and immensely fun. Early on, you find a sky hook which you use as both your primary melee attack and as a fast means of moving about areas. Using skylines to zoom around enemies and then attack them from the air is extremely satisfying and Irrational manages to capture the euphoria of the action perfectly. The way that these skylines are implemented is phenomenal and unlike anything I have ever seen done in a video game before. 
 
*Conclusion*

A sequel is a tough thing to create. Often times, the first game in a series is just an experiment; an excuse to tread water with the creator's vision. Some games like Portal, Uncharted, and Half-Life are so well received that a sequel needs to be created. A lot of the time those sequels end up bombing because they stray too far from the creator's original vision (BioShock 2, anyone?). BioShock was an experiment. It was Ken Levine treading water. With BioShock Infinite, he had the opportunity to turn that experiment into an incredible universe. And he did just that. I can easily say that, now that I have played through the game twice and the dust has settled, that BioShock Infinite is one of the best games that I have ever played. 

BioShock Infinite is not a perfect game; no game is and there never will be one. But it's as close as we're going to get this generation. Any gripes I have with this game are trivial and are not limited to this game but most if not all games of this generation. There's only one animation for Booker hitting a button. I played the Xbox 360 version of this game so textures will often popup and some specific details in environments aren't always completely defined. Little things like that, however, are like a drop of water on steel. No effect on the experience. It is difficult to put into words just how ambitious BioShock Infinite is without spoiling it. It's like trying to explain Disney Land without saying what any of the rides are. The visuals, the complex themes, the character relationships, the gameplay, and the overlapping story all tie together masterfully in a way that cannot be easily compared to other games.
 
This game is a moment. It easily sets the pace for how games should tell their stories. BioShock Infinite isn't just BioShock 3 and for good reason. Sure, some things are similar. A lighthouse, an enigmatic villain, a hero, a girl and a guardian, but there is enough that is unique to this game that  it creates an identity of its own. Constants and variables. This is an experience that every gamer should play. You will not be disappointed.

I’m just trying to paint the situation as clearly as I can.

I have two **potential** summer internship opportunities that I’ll refer to as internships A and B respectively.    

I recently interviewed for internship A and I can say that I really enjoyed my time visiting.  The people I would be working with are very nice and laid back, there are a lot of opportunities for me to get involved in interesting projects, and I think I would learn more than I could have imagined.  Plus, they’re very flexible in terms of work scheduling, which is a plus in my situation.  

When I finished the interview for internship A, I walked out feeling like it couldn’t have gone much better.  It really was one of the best interviews I’ve had in a while.  So, while I can’t say for certain of course, I think there is a serious possibility of being offered the position sometime next week.  (At one point, the interviewer stated that applicants would be hearing decisions next week, but throughout the rest of the interview, she kept saying, “I’ll call you next week.”  I know that nothing is certain in terms of offers until the offer is officially made, but I would say that is a reasonably good sign!  And I think we had a very good rapport; the conversation flowed pretty well and she seemed to like my responses.)  

The problem is that I’ve just been invited to interview for internship B late next week.  Internship B is recognized as being more competitive and the type of internship itself is very well respected.  But the fact is, both internships could potentially offer similar opportunities to learn and to be involved in a lot of fascinating activities.  (Although I kind of think A might provide a bit more hands-on experience in some areas due to the up-and-coming nature of some aspects of the job, but I can’t say for certain that B would not provide as much if not *even more* involvement--B does operate on a larger scale.  But either way, interviewing with B would help me get a feel for what I would be working on on a daily basis.)  

I’m led to believe that B is more highly acclaimed and thus more eye-catching on a resume to future recruiters and employers.  It might give me more of an edge, so to speak.  Though I'm sure the potential to meet people and network exists for both internships, I’m curious about the possible doors B might open down the line.  I can’t speak to the overall vibe of the work environment and the people there because, again, I haven’t interviewed there yet.  But the recruiter remembered me from a career fair and emailed me, reminding me to fill out an online application so as to ensure I got an interview.  This leads me to think that maybe I have a shot at this position.    

**tldr;**  Reddit, I have to ask you this:  in the event that internship A calls me back and extends an offer early next week before I get to interview for internship B later in the week, is it acceptable for me to delay accepting A's offer until I’ve had the chance to interview with internship B?  If so, how would I go about asking that?  How long of a delay is acceptable to ask for?  Would this offend A, even if I later came back and accepted their offer?  

And if I do receive an offer from A next week and I still manage to interview with B, I’ve heard career advice stating that already having an offer would expedite B’s decision.  Is this true?  That's not something I would mention in the interview itself though, would I?  I’m inclined to think that would apply to following up after the interview.    

Anyway, thanks for reading.  Advice, comments, questions welcome!  :)

Didn't interview for jobs until recently due to health, what do I say?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1bs7zg/graduated_a_little_while_ago_with_a_bs_in_cs/,"I graduated with a BS in Computer Science from a decent university. I did not have a gpa over 3.0 (unless you consider my in-major upperdivision gpa). (I am above 2.5 though, if that means anything). I also changed my major fairly late into college, so I don't have any internship/work experience. 

Unfortunately, due to some health reasons, I didn't apply to jobs since I've graduated (late 2012). The health reason, which I'd rather not state, was not cancer, and did not require me to be in a hospital. However, due to its nature, I became very depressed, and didn't apply to jobs after graduating. After dealing with said health condition, I am much better now, and it no longer affects me. However, I realize that it is now an uphill battle applying for jobs since 1. I'm not as recent a graduate as I was in 2012, 2. I don't have any work/internship experience, 3. My overall gpa and major gpa are both below 3.0, 4. I don't have much/any experience with programming languages and technologies such as: web development, scripting, databases, app development (for tablets/phones/web).

I realize after searching for jobs online that I pretty much only learned what university taught me, and a lot of it is useless. I know sometimes people on this subreddit like to criticize and make fun of people who do this, but after changing majors so late into college, I honestly had no time for internships or any projects outside of school. I was taking a ridiculous amount of units each semester, and having never programmed before college, taking solely CS classes was a major learning curve for me.

I've started to practice interview questions to at least prepare me for those. But they mostly have to do with data structures, and trivia questions on the only languages I know (core java/c/c++). I've only very recently started to get into web development to build up my resume (ruby, html/css). But I'm in the very beginning stages, and I'm also having trouble trying to come up with a decently large-sized project that I can work on that is presentable to employers on my resume.

I'm feeling really down right now, and I suppose I would just appreciate some honest advice about what to do about my job search. 1. Particularly, if you can give some advice on ideas to develop fairly-large web apps/projects you think would look really good on a resume (more than just a plain html/css website). 2. What to say to employers if they ask why I am applying to jobs ~6 months after I graduated? Can I mention that I was sick? Would that make me look bad, or is that not allowed? I'd rather not mention it at all, since they may consider me a liability (or a whiny brat) 3. Which sites are particularly useful for -advanced- web app development? (depth is more important to me, than coverage)

Thank you for reading my long post, and I appreciate any advice/information you have to offer me."

The problem however is that I get out of school at 2:15 and they would like me in the office by 2:30 and get out around 6:00. They want me every week day and weekends. Then for the summer they want me full time at pay below minimum wage as I'd be an intern.

My Dad wants me to jump at the opportunity as this is a rare chance for experience as a High Schooler. My mother however has taken the side of ""I have my whole life to work"" which I understand as well. 

What would your High School selves have done in this situation?"

My first Reddit post so not entirely sure how this whole site works. Basically I know that my high school was bad at teaching students how to make resumes. Our business teachers taught us things that were completely different from what our internship coordinators taught us. I have kept the format that I derived from both models. I am curious as to whether it is good or not. I've obviously censored out or removed personal information. [Link To Resume Below]

I had a job that was pretty much promised to me after I graduated high school but my college schedule caused the establishment to hire someone else. I went for a semester, got fed up with the poor quality of the education I was receiving, and withdrew from college. I had received straight A's, Dean's List, invitation to Phi Theta Kappa, and was on track to graduate early. All of this within one semester and the work I did in high school. Fast forward a few months and I can't seem to even get an interview with anyone. Since I focused so hard on grades and coursework in high school I never had time for a job like other students so I have almost no work history. I've been applying to mainly entry level jobs. It is depressing that I am not even getting rejection letters/emails.  I'm not sure if it is because I have no work history or because my resume is terrible. Any help is appreciated.

I'm not far enough along in my degree to qualify for a paid internship.

Every time I get an automated rejection letter or just get flat-out ignored it feels like a slap in the face and an employer saying 'you're not good enough for me'.

It's gotten bad enough that as a 'discouraged worker', I don't even show up on unemployment statistics anymore.

1brqt9,9,2013-04-05,[22M] [23F] Engagement advise needed.,1c3b3rg,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1brqt9/22m_23f_engagement_advise_needed/,"Hello! I'm the [22M] and have been in this relationship for 3 years (in May) with [22f]. We have been living together for 2 years and everything has been great. We are both about to graduate from college and recently we have been discussing getting married. 

The only problem is I don't exactly have the means to buy an engagement ring right now and she is getting very upset. She came out and told me at the beginning of this semester she wants to be engaged by the time she graduates to give her a ""safety net"" to move back with me to my home town. This came as quite a bit of a surprise since we've discussed marriage but never put a timeline on it. I'm currently unemployed and a full-time student. She is also a student but has a part time job on campus. 

I have asked her father for his blessing and he approved. I also began to set aside most of the bits of money I do come across for the aforementioned ring. 

The problem is: no matter how I cut it I can't afford even the cheapest of engagement rings at the moment. The college town I live in has very few jobs. I used to be a 
pizza-delivery driver and had a $12/hr internship at a computer company but since the end of that internship I have been unable to find gainful employment. My savings have slowly dwindled over the past year and I already have a bunch of loans. 

Any time a subject is brought up that is anywhere near relationships/marriage/finances she will get angry and depressed for the rest of the day. For example today I finally told her that I did have a separate savings account that I have been putting money into for an engagement ring. I thought this would make her happy; instead, she immediately asked if she thought I'd have enough to propose by graduation. I didn't even have to say anything before she started acting depressed. I told her probably not and she hasn't spoken to me for hours. 

In previous discussions we've had about this she always cites the fact that I do occasionally buy, and nearly always, have weed and alcohol. I don't smoke or drink that much, but I like to have it around. I spend less than $100/month on weed and booze combined (a lot better than I can say about a lot of our friend group.) She used to smoke with me all the way through our relationship (of almost 3 years) and very rarely put money down on it. She quit smoking about a week ago so she would be able to pass a drug test by the time she graduates. I haven't quit (I keep artificial urine stocked) but she suddenly wants me to because she did. Any time I try to discuss this with her she gets mad and says something to the effect of ""Maybe if you quit smoking so you can buy me an engagement ring... How do you think it makes me feel that you put weed before me, etc."" 

Even if I did stop smoking weed I don't think I'd be able to get the funds up by then. My question to you fine people is what can I do? Should I change and quit smoking and go pawn my guitars/sell my car or something? Do you think she's being unreasonable or am I the selfish prick she acts like I am? 

I do love her and intend to marry her. As soon as I get home and get a grown-up job and have a salary I will be able to buy her a ring without issue. I mean we are still very young. What is the rush? The average age for marriage is 28 for males in the US! Is this something anyone has seen before? 

tl;dr My girlfriend wants to be engaged by the end of the semester and I have no money.

Edit/Update: I finally got her to talk to me about it a little more. She says she gets mad because it is more about me not fulfilling promises I've made. I've been telling her I'll exercise and lose some weight to help with my snoring problem (doctors advise) and I haven't lost much at all. I also do say to myself ""I'm not going to buy any more weed etc,"" a lot and then later I end up buying some. She says the problem is I say that I'm going to marry her but she thinks it's another empty promise. And promising to work out, save up for a ring doesn't help because she doesn't believe my promises any more. Just thought I'd add to put it in perspective maybe not make her sound as evil as I think I made her sound.

We had to pretend that we worked in the company's payroll department and  had to write a letter explaining the situation. This is what I turned in:

Naive Young Intern,

The reason that your paycheck was less than you had anticipated is due to the fact that the government decided that they need your money more than you do. 

The government decided that they need you to help pay for federal income taxes, state income taxes, social security taxes, and medicare taxes. 

And those are only the taxes that you see! The company also pays additional taxes for every hour that you work.

Do you have a say in the matter? Absolutely not! If you do anything to try to pay less in taxes you will be jailed for committing fraud! Imagine that, locked up in a cage because you tried to keep what you earned!

I know that it is unfair to have to pay these taxes, especially in light of all of the other consumption and excise taxes that you will pay through out the year, along with all different types of government fees. (By some estimates you have to work until the middle of April to break even on taxes for the year.) And these regressive taxes deny you the ability to accumulate capital, but you *will* go to jail if you do not comply. 

I personally do not feel like going to jail either in an effort to help someone else skirt the current tax code, so I will continue to remove these taxes from your paycheck. 

Thanks for your understanding in the matter.

1bvs77,1,2013-04-07,I'm so confused about all this.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1bvs77/im_so_confused_about_all_this/,"I'm a 20 year old male in college and after being depressed most of last semester and having an anxiety/depressive breakdown around finals that left me feeling completely helpless, I told my parents that I'd been considering seeing a counselor. When school started again in the spring I had anxiety almost constantly, and after seeing a male counselor for a few weeks and being told that I should go on SSRi's I talked to my mom about how I didn't think he was that great and decided to find another counselor. 

The second female counselor felt really good to go to a few times even though I barely said anything. Being told by her that I should seek medicine for clinical depression just made me really sad and kind of angry with her. I told her about how I struggle a lot with thinking about whatever I'm doing not being the right thing and she said I have an irrational belief of not being good enough. Being told by her that I should seek medicine for clinical depression just made me really sad and kind of angry with her. After being given a set of irrational beliefs and instructed that i could rewrite them into more rational beliefs, I put it off until the day before the counseling session then got extremely worried about what I wrote down not being right. I went in and basically said that I had gotten really defensive about the writing. She said that it was fine, but I've always considered seeing another counselor after. I've had trouble talking with her a little bit, I guess mainly from me just zoning off when she asks something and then realizing I zoned off and then not remembering what she asked. 

It's hard for me to try to think for myself I guess now. I always get the sense from counseling that I didn't get to say the right thing and that no real insight has been made, but I don't know what my problem is. She's suggested I go on depression medication and I have an appointment with a psychiatrist, but I really don't know what will happen. 

I think I've fallen into this helpless feeling where I really just want attention, but don't know what to change in my life to feel better about myself enough without it. I live in an apartment with a random person, and I spend most of my time in my room. I'm on academic probation for the second time and am at risk of losing my scholarship if I can't improve my GPA. It's time to pick classes and I don't know where my degree is going, I don't have an internship, and currently have no summer plans. I just took easier core classes to try to figure myself out this semester, but they ended up just giving me a lot of work I wasn't interested in. I regret not taking classes that could have given me an interest in other possible degrees/fields. I worry about just sitting here on campus all summer and doing nothing, or going back home and just sitting in my parents house. I could try to find work in a research lab over the summer but I worry about having to talk to a professor, and thinking that they'll realize that I don't know how to do a whole lot, and feel guilty about looking for a resume booster.

 I worry a lot about my performance in a new leadership position in my fraternity. They're the only real friends I have, but most of the time I'm a passive participant in anything we do. I don't have any friends that I do things regularly with, but I know that there's people that I could do stuff with, I don't know what I could do or talk about with them when for most of the semester I've just been staring off in my room wondering whats wrong with me that I'm not happy, and then snapping back and trying to get things done in a rush.

 I think I realize a lot of my problems stem from feeling helpless, and worrying about perfection, but I feel like it's been so ingrained I don't know how else to think. Reading a guide to rational thinking I guess has made me feel better, if only to just read again for awhile and focus on something other than depressing thoughts. My problems seem so small, but I don't know, I feel so small against them.

 I have a psychiatrist appointment on Thursday after the Midterm I need to get a good grade on. I don't know whether I should seek anxiety or depression medication, and worry about all the stuff I've read that has said it could make things worse. I think I should've just started exercising and stuck with it, but can't ever seem to stick to any sort of plan anymore. I've considered dropping out, if only to avoid the eventual meltdown that I think will come at the end of the semester.

I've read all the advice and know that I need to just start exercising, eat healthy, stay on top of my school work, think positively. But for what, so I can just get through this semester and then try to get through summer and then try to get through another semester in the fall. why. I'm just angry and want something to change, I know these emotions are childish in comparison to what I'm dealing with, seeing all the things on /r/offmychest. But I'm really tired of things feeling shitty.

I have to go our Chapter soon, and re-reading this I think that even less of what I'm going through. I don't know what to feel.

Maybe I'll just drive away this summer. Try to find somewhere or something I'm happy with.

Feels good to write this out. Thanks for anything."

I've been using http://pcpartpicker.com/ to help select my parts. http://www.tigerdirect.ca/ or http://www.directcanada.ca/ are my favorite distributors.

I've been poking around a bit but have finally realized I'm lost in selecting good parts. I'm not exactly a hardware guy. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Also, I realize some prices will be going up in the near future and as I don't plan to actually order my build until mid-August, which is when I return from an internship in Calgary, some of the builds you have so graciously suggested for me might be a little inconsistent with the optimal $/value package at that time. No matter, I'd at least like to see what people would come up with at this present moment so that I can I get a good feel for what my computer will look like, but if you have any suggestions for minding the gap (i.e. purchase RAM now, waiting for a better GPU, etc.), then please feel free to let me know now.

Primary concern is just getting an image of what my comp will look like and how expensive it will be based on the specifications I have outlined here. I have a good $1500-2000 ceiling to spend including taxes and shipping/handling costs."

I'm wondering if I'll be in any situation to relocate to the UK after graduation to work/intern/whatever there is available for me.  I've been interested in doing this since high school and feel that now is the time to really do the research and start making arrangements if it's possible.  Here's my info:

* 21 now, will be 22 upon graduation.  Also a girl, if that matters.
* BS Industrial Engineering in May 2014
* I've held a Manufacturing Engineering internship and have an understanding of Six Sigma/Lean Manufacturing principles.  Also incredibly interested in Quality/Process Improvement in healthcare systems.
* I speak English.
* No arrests or criminal convictions.
* Temporary or permanent works for me, just really want to get out there and experience everything.
* I have no relative/recent ancestral relations to the UK.

Give it to me straight - I plan on traveling regardless, circumstances will put me in the financial position to travel when I'm 25, I just really want to get out earlier."

Its only been a few months now, we've been receiving really good reviews and we're finding our place is attracting a lot of entrepreneurs and high-tech gurus from all over the world - so far from several places in EU, Hong Kong, Australia, Japan - there's really no limit to locale, it's pretty much anyone in the high-tech industry looking for partners, investors, customer, some are taking care of current customers, others are just looking around to see if they want to relocate to the Bay Area.  Other guests are software developers, some just recently finish a comp sci doctorate and are looking for a job or starting an internship.

As for me, I'm currently working as an engineer in a research group at Amazon.  And while I'm not running a business now, I plan on doing so within the next couple years as I save up.  I can't wait to get back into running my own company again soon, but at the same time, I'm working on such an incredible project at Amazon that I don't want to leave just yet until I see it through and get this product under my belt - it's a very interesting challenge and is an incredible experience to have.  

So while I'm not running a business and I'm not trying to sell anything directly as of yet, I'm looking for more ideas to develop and sustain the relationships with these guests in the meantime, which could possibly blossom into something really cool in the future. I want to develop good business repor with them, help them with there endeavors, and I want to develop real lasting, ongoing relationships with them that could hopefully be leveraged some day. So I'm looking for any suggestions on how to most effectively do that.  Please share your ideas!

Not sure if it's a social issue or a confidence issue.",[deleted],socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1bvb82/maybe_this_isnt_the_right_subreddit_but_i_cant/,"Alright, so some context. I'm doing an internship right now, and I started two months ago. I realize that's pretty recent, but bear with me here. I'm pretty relaxed at work, I'm not sitting there all nervous. I work in the IT department of a recruitment agency and I help out with the helpdesk and that kind of stuff. The work is fine, nothing I'd want to do on a long term basis, but I am actually learning a lot, so that's good.

However, when I'm at work it's like I can't... think straight or something. I'll ask someone something I could've easily checked myself for example, or I'll be on the phone with someone and I'll ask them something that with a tiny bit of thought I would've known was pretty stupid to ask. Or someone will just ask me a pretty obvious question I should easily know the answer to, and I can't think of an answer untill they tell me it and I'll think shit, why didn't I think of that myself, I already know that. And I'm never like that outside of work. 

I constantly think that whatever I'm doing isn't good enough, which makes me nervous. I honestly have no clue why I'm like that at work, and it's really annoying. Outside of work I'm really comfortable with myself, my confidence is pretty good but as soon as I arrive at work something changes, and I'm almost never confident about my decisions. 

I realize that sounds like a confidence issue and that this might be the wrong subreddit for this, but because it's something that only happens at work I think it might also be a social thing, because outside of work I never worry about other people thinking I'm stupid because I asked something I could have easily found out myself for example. It's stopping me from asking for help when I need it, which also isn't good. 

I really could use some outside perspective. I realize I'm completely new at the job with no prior experience, but that's not what I'm worried about. It's that I constantly feel that whatever I'm doing isn't good enough, and I can't seem to think straight, even in moments when I don't feel like I'm under any pressure. Maybe being in a serious workplace around people who are much better at what they do than I am (which is normal) is what's causing this, because at my previous job at a supermarket where I worked for years I never had this.

Sorry for the giant wall of text. "

I'm curious about the best track to take for an industry career.
Is it better to do a masters with a 9-month internship that gives me experience in the field, or to do the PhD route? (applied, probably AMO) I've talked with a few professors about this, and have read some posts within the subreddit, but I'm not sure how much actually having experience in my feild of interest will help with job placement. 


Ideally, I'd like a mentally stimulating job that has some freedom and flexibility. I enjoy hands-on work (e.g. machining and fabrication) much more than something like programming. 

I should probably note that time (I'm still young) and money aren't really an issue here. The average salary made from the internship tends to pay-off the masters. 

Some background-
The specific masters program: http://internship.uoregon.edu/, I think I'd either to the semi-conductor/PV or the optoelectronics track. I have not looked into specific PhD programs yet.

I'm 22, he's 26, we've been together for almost 2 years. We're both in school. He lives at home with his parents, I've been living in a dorm. I've been finishing up a bachelor's and working part-time, so after graduation, I'm going to go home and work as an EMT while I take a few more classes at a community college so I can apply to PA school.

I already talked to him about my concerns. I said I wish he'd put himself out there more and get serious with his programming or else he won't be able to find internships. That he needs to find things to do in order to build references instead of staying home all the time. I said I worried about his future even if it's not with me. Said I loved him and want to be together eventually. He agreed with all these things but I don't think he really understood.

Unfortunately I wasn't as direct, like saying it's unhealthy to stay up until 5 and sleep in until 2 every day or that instead of gaming or browsing reddit all the time he should be finding work to put on a resume. He had a temp job last fall and talks as if he intends on collecting unemployment for awhile instead of getting a new job.

**Am I just being pushy?** I know we haven't been together a long time, but I reason that if I've already been with someone for more than a year, eventually I want to live him. But it can't happen unless we're both employed, if he doesn't actively work towards that goal, I just can't see us working out in the future. Please talk some sense into me, TwoX, I've been worrying so much I can't sleep or think and I don't even know what it is I want anymore."

I'm in college right now and trying to figure out my summer plans. The thing is I don't want to stay with my parents this summer because last summer they were absolutely horrible to me,yelling at me all the time over stupid things, trying to control everything I do, and constantly belittling me, especially my mother. She is a very strict, traditional Chinese mother and I don't want to deal with that (or her) again.  

I would like to stay with my boyfriend in his apartment. But then that would require me telling my parents we're dating and since he isn't Chinese, that would lead to constant threatening, manipulating me to break up with him, blackmailing...I could go on. 

The reason I am so docile right now is because my parents are paying my school tuition (most is covered by scholarships and loans but the rest, they pay). I go to a somewhat prestigious, private school and would like to graduate from there. I have two more years left of school. 

I know I can't really do anything to upset my parents because they could withdraw my education funding at any moment. I hate that they have me on this leash but until I graduate, I see no other alternative. 

Hopefully for now, I can appease them with good grades. I also do have an internship lined up for the summer but the organization doesn't have an official office and most of the work I'll be doing for them is via computer (aka staying at home). 

What does everyone think? Should I suck it up and deal with my parents for the summer? Should I tell them the truth about my boyfriend? Or should I lie and tell them I'll be staying in another apartment with a female roommate (when I'll be actually staying with boyfriend)? 

Please, I value your input. Also, stories are welcome too. 

TL;DR: Don't want to stay with overcontrolling parents for the summer, want to stay with non-Asian boyfriend but that could lead to angry parents not paying for school tuition (and possibly jeopardizing future). Stay with parents and suck it up or lie and stay with boyfriend?

Update: Thank you all so much for responding! Your advice helped me alot and I will be considering the options everyone gave. Also my mother recently sent me an email saying she'll ""support everything I choose to do"" (within reason of course) so that ought to count for something! Here's what the email said: Can you call me, I want to know is just I am your Mom, I am care of you. I do support you do anything.

Update 2: Just found out today my entire tuition is covered by scholarships and loans. Since I'm not required to live on campus next year I can pull my own weight, find off campus housing and pay for my own rent. Which means my parents have NO leverage over me! Yes! Still trying to think of an alibi for the summer and they're still going to have to fill out my fafsa for senior year though...

My name is Jon and my brother, best friend, and myself have created a company called protoexchange (www.protoexchange.com). We are a ""decentralized manufacturing"" company that allows people with 3D printers to print objects within their area. This decentralized network has many advantages (especially when compared to centralized 3D printing facilities) for all of its users.


This spring/summer, we will be up at Colgate participating in Colgate's ENY Fund (http://goo.gl/0sD9Y). We are looking or an intern who is familiar with front-end development (Angular JS framework). 


We're excited to be back up at Colgate (my brother went there) and are looking forward to working with smart individuals. It should be a great learning experience and we'll be sure to have a lot of fun along the way :)

1buv8x,5,2013-04-07,Things are going surprisingly well.,BipolarCos,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1buv8x/things_are_going_surprisingly_well/,"Okay so the last few posts I've made have been pretty damn depressing.  I don't know if my meds are working like they're supposed to or if I've stopped giving fucks...but holy hell am I doing better.

Lately: The guy who told me he HATED cheaters and that his ex wasn't really his type...was sleeping with her before and during our relationship.  I got angry, naturally, and I talked to him one time after I found out just to try to get some information from him..which I didn't.  When he tried to turn part of it around on me, I stood up for myself and didn't let him.  I haven't talked to him since and I haven't looked back.

I told my ex (different ex) that I still have feelings for him while in a drug-induced state (sleeping meds) after he told me he was seeing someone.  Haven't heard from him since.  While this sucks so bad, I'm actually okay with this ending because I feel like I can move on because...at least I told him. That's out of me.

All of a sudden I'm totally blanking on other stuff that's been going on lately.

I am stressed, mostly over school, my internship, and one guy in particular that I'm unsure how to handle the situation with.  I learned that I seriously need to learn coping strategies and hopefully I will start trying to work on that soon.

My next step is to start going to the gym next week to take classes.  I am TERRIFIED and the anxiety is so bad that words cannot describe...but I feel like I need to face this and do it because it's something I need to do for my physical health, it will be fun, and I will be socializing with people.  It's that first step, especially doing it alone, that's so scary.

So:
TL;DR: I am reacting better to situations that I ever imagined I could and things are actually going good."

1butsu,4,2013-04-07,I just want somebody to love me,Atear,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1butsu/i_just_want_somebody_to_love_me/,"Hi. I'm 22 years old (my birthday was last march), and I go to college right and am majoring in History, with a specialization in Japanese history. I have depression. I've known this for a long time but was never diagnosed until last February when I finally went to see a counselor. I'm on Wellbutrin now and this is the first time I've ever taken anything like this.

I'm not sure where to start so I'll just say this first, I'm fat. I weigh 324 lbs and am 5 ft 10 in. 

Before I get to my whole life story spiele, let me talk about the title of this post. When I'm with the two friends I hang out with the most, one of which I have a huge crush on, we like to talk, obviously. Well every now and then one of them will say, oh so-and-so is so cute, or smart, or funny, usually talking about one of our other friends. I don't join them in this because it's girl stuff that I'm not in to. Anyway, this got me thinking, ""Do they or anyone else for that matter talk about me like this when I'm not there? Is there anyone who says, ""oh Atear is so cute"", or ""Atear is so funny!"". And my final stance was that no, who in their right mind would ever say a thing like that about you. you're a fat piece of shit who has attachment issues, gets depressed easily, noclear future, poor as hell, and what's more, you are a balding (It's thinning at the top/forhead area of my head) virgin at the age of 22. So here's my story...

I tried to kill myself when I was in the fourth or fifth grade by taking my shoelace and tying it around my neck to the monkey bars, and then jumping off. I was so fat the string broke. To this day I don't like things like that hanging around my neck. Since then there will be good days and there will be bad days. Today is a bad day as was yesterday. 

This is a throw away, as I just want to get my story out there. I was born March 6, 1991. My mom was 26 when she had me. I don't remember how old my dad was. The next year my little sister was born. and then four years after that, my little brother was also born. I want to be able to say my life was all sunshine and rainbows but that would be a lie. My dad is a severe alcoholic and drug user. Or at least he was when my mom, my siblings, and I left him for the last time. Anyway, when my dad was in a good mood, I loved him. We would lay on the couch, watch tv, and I would pull at his arm hair watching the points of skin where the hair was attached rise up. But that was during my early childhood, when we are still at that cute stage. I remember many times when my dad would lose it with my mom and beat her. I hated him for that. I sometimes find myself wishing now that I had been myself I am now back then, so I could have understood their fights and help my mom from being hit. 

My dad was a big man. he was a black belt in karate, and had a beer gut. When he would get angry at me for something I did he would hit me. hard. he never really hit my sister, and my brother was still his little baby boy at the time. I usually always sided with my mom in their fights. Probably the reason I would get hit. 

My mom left my dad with us a few times. the first time it was because he got into a big fist fight with some guy in my grandfathers home. We left and went to stay in a shelter. During this time my mom started dating some guy. All I remember is that he looked like William H. Macy only a squarer jaw and that he had three daughters. I was in my room once and playing a prank with a lego box by the door. He saw me doing it and beat me. Nothing too serious I guess but alot harder than an 8 year old deserved. My mom left him soon after she found out about this. 

My dad found out where we were living and decided to come over to us. That was one of the scariest moments of my life. I was in the living  room, alone, standing there, while my brother, sister, and mom were in the back bedroom playing on paint on the old computer we had just gotten, you know, what we all used to do before fast internet. Anyway, I looked out the big back window, and my dad was standing there with his black biker jacket on and his head shaved. I was so scared when I saw him staring at me. He tried to act cool, asked me to go and get my mom. So i went and told her, dad's here mommy. She was terrified. they talked or whatever and got back together, I mean my dad living with us again. things were ok for a while, sort of. Then it got bad again and we were forced to return to that same old women's shelter. my mom found another man she thought might make a good boyfriend so we moved in with him and his son Dustin. That's all I really remember about Dustin is his name besides when we would sometimes go up the road from the house to the old gas station where they still sold old coke bottles that you had to take the metal cap off of. Anyway, this guy beat me as well, to, as he put it, get me to stop saying mommy. That a 9 year old was too old to say that. We left and ended up with my dad again. This time we were homeless. We had to live in a rundown garage of the family who lived next to my grandfather because he didn't want us dirtying up his place. After that, we decided to live in a motel. This was when I decided I wanted to become an architect. I enjoyed doodling little house blueprints and thought it would be a fun job. However things don't work out the way we want. i may have had alot of ups and downs in my life, but this was when I discovered pokemon. I remember it like it was yesterday. I was alone in the room (the one room motel that I would call home for 1 year) when I turned on the tv. I turned it to cartoon network when episode one of pokemon appeared. I was hooked. That's of no relevance, just wanted to share that part.

We moved then to one place where I got my full blooded Alaskan Husky named Vageta from DBZ. I loved that dog. Anyway fast forward two years and I'm 12. My mom has had enough, as if she hadn't before, and finally gets a plan together for us to move back to her home town in Missouri. She works it out with her family there, so that we would have a place to stay until she could find work and get our own place. She told me this meaning she trusted me, also because I think she wanted to tell me it will be ok. Oh wait, I forgot, this was the last house where my dad pawned off my expensive RC Racer I had gotten for my birthday, my birthday money I had hidden from him yet he found and took after I told him no, and also when he pawned off my Gamboy color and all of the pokemon games I had collected so far, even my first game, Pokemon gold. 

So my mom told him we were going back to her home town to see my great grandma before she died as she is very old, 82 at the time. When she told my dad, I didnt know what was going to happen. He at first said ok, but that he wanted to keep one of us kids at the house. My mom argued that all three of us deserved to see our great grandmother one last time. I was so relieved when he agreed. As we were leaving, I said goodbye with tears in my eyes to our new pit bull puppy Sassy, and then now fully crying to my beautiful alaskan husky Vageta. He was only two. The last time I saw my dad in person was when we were leaving the drive way and I looked at the house one last time, and saw him watching us through the kitchen window. 

Anyway, we made it to Missouri, and my mom called my dad saying we had left for good and that we were staying in northern Illinois and didn't actually go to Missouri. We went to school where my mom had graduated from, and we stayed in the trailer she had lived close to as a kid. my mom was actually happier than I had seen her when she was with my dad. I however was somewhat miserable. I didn't know how to make new friends so i acted out, I got in trouble every week without fail. From pushing people, to burping the ABC's (of which I am a pro), to hocking a lugie(?) into a trash can, and also to saying ""fuck you"" in pig latin to someone. That was the 6th grade. After that I made some good friends who lasted all the way through highschool. this was the first time I had ever stayed at one school for longer than two years. I still suffered from my bad depression during this time. My grades were also not what I now wish they would have been. And now I changed my future job from architect to graphic designer. I even planned on going to college where my mom had graduated from. But I stupidly decided to go to a technical school for Computer Programming simply because I liked computers. Well that ran the two years and because I didn't pass two classes I didn't get the associates degree. But rather than take the two classes, one of which was an internship, I decided to go to an actual college for History or English (glad I chose History -_-). So here I am now.

Now:

I have four great friends which is good after the fights with my previous friends a year ago exactly. However I really like one of my friends. She's smart, funny, caring (though she may not act like it much), cute as a rainbow covered sparkle bunny, and who also loves pokemon (I was so surprised that there was someone else in the world who knew all of the pokemon things i knew.), and she loves Japan, of which I had only decided this school year to specialize in. However last february, after silently liking her and keeping it to myself, so began the Sunday of February 17, 2013. A date which I will ever hold a place of contempt in my heart. My best friend, who is the brother of the girl that I like (it's ok, he knows I like her now and is okay with it) was going through some hard stuff early in the day, and so me and my two friends, the girl i like and our other friend who is also a girl are hanging out before we went to dinner at the cafeteria. the girl I like went to use the bathroom before we left so I had a chance to ask our other friend something that had been on my mind. I had noticed the girl I like acting strangely when our mutual friend from china was around. So i asked her straight up, does she like him? at first there was silence, then she said, yes. I was okay with it at first. truly i was. no depression for a while actually before this trigger happened. we went to dinner, and while I was in line to get food, It hit my like a train. All of a sudden I was seething with rage. absolute, unadulterated rage. I suffer from exotropic vision or whatever it's called where both of my eyes don't naturally focus into one image by themselvs, I have to knowingly focus on a point to see one image. I'm saying this because since middle school, i had gotten into the habit of spacing out and just letting my vision problem take over, so that I am only concentrating on what i'm thinking about. Well this took over during dinner, in a big way. I was aware of a huge angry sinister scowl across my face, the same face my dad gave to my mom. And my thoughts were only, I should kill something. I don't care what, but it should cease to exist. I ignored everyone who tried to talk to me, which made me feel worse because they then acted like I couldn't hear them at all and were talking about me in the third person. I decided to just leave without thinking when one friend said he had to go. I went back to my room and beat the shit out of my mattress. I then got onto my computer and wrote out every one of the thoughts I was having. Mostly self-deprecating things. Shortly after this i went and got help from the college counseling office. It was wiered spilling my guts out to a stranger. But i grew to like it. Since then I'm overall happier. Mostly because of the situation with the girl I like. I ended up having our mutual friend let it slip to her that I like her, and then I told the chinese guy she likes that I had a big crush on her, in order to ensure that he wouldn't form any extra thoughts about her. I know this wasn't right, but knowing he doesn't like her is very calming to my nerves especially since I've been diagnosed Extreme Depression with a big anxiety disorder. My mom said She thinks I also have adhd, but I don't know. 

So what prompted me to write this? I don't know. I woke up a few hours ago, and thought about how last night my two friends, the girl and the girl I like, watched a movie in my dorm room, then left afterwards laughing with each other and didn't even say goodbye. stupid thought probably but whatever. 

This isn't a pitty post, I just wanted to talk about what's wrong with me. While writing this I cried at remembering things that I had forgotten, and I have let my depression levels come down some. So this was a good thing, downvote, upvote, do whatever. I'm just happy someone might read this, and understand a little of what I'm going through."

2. Salary is only ever mentioned as ""negotiable""

The reason I don't want to join the gym because I am in a middle of no where town for an internship, and it costs almost $60/month for the gym, and its a very run down gym, and the equipment is limited. 


As for the equipment I understand you need dumbbells, a resistance band, and a chin-up bar. I have a resistance band and dumbbells, I wouldn't mind getting a chin up but I really have no where to put it, I don't want to put it in my door way of the residence building I live in, I'd feel uncomfortable with that. Does Tony give alternatives to the chin-up bar exercises with the resistance band and how effective are they? 

Thanks in advance for the help, look forward to keeping you guys up to date on my progress!

BONUS: How intense would you guys say P90X is to Insanity, for those who have done both? I might look in to a hybrid of it, I am a product of Insanity, I've done 3.5 rounds of it actually.."
1bunhj,221,2013-04-07,Dear Braveryjerk: YOUR SUBREDDIT IS A SCAM! This entire place has been run by the Ron Paul campaign this whole time. See inside for the truth,btwstopbraveryjerk,Braveryjerk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Braveryjerk/comments/1bunhj/dear_braveryjerk_your_subreddit_is_a_scam_this/,"*Note: I originally posted the below post in /r/conspiracy but was told it was a good idea to x-post it here.  Please read and know the truth about your moderators*

Hi everyone, I'm new to this subreddit but I thought it would be the best place to post what I've uncovered.  Recently I've had a lot of suspicion surrounding the Circlejerk group of subreddits.  In particular, I was appalled how circlejerk moderators could get away with posting [blatant sponsored advertising](http://i.imgur.com/Mtdelap.png) on their subreddit.  This was called out by someone on /r/SubredditDrama but the thread was [summarily deleted](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1bnpeu/over_in_rcirclejerk_the_mods_are_pulling_a_scam/).  It's been my suspicion that the circlejerk mods have a lot of influence on this website, and the above confirmed this.

**The Bravery Delusion**

I'm here to talk about a whole different scheme of theirs, however.  This one is so hilarious, so unbelievably insane that it's hard to stay with but please bear with me.  First of all, a quick visit to /r/Braveryjerk gives off a strange vibe.  It's apparently full of random internet memes and Ron Paul's face is for some reason plastered everywhere.  The place seems to be very loosely organized and I was able to gain moderatorship for a few hours.  In that time, I found the shocking secret:  *Braveryjerk is and has been sponsored by the Ron Paul campaign*, and I have proof!

It was hard to find any good nuggets because the modmail is mostly just jibberish and exhausted memes, but after an exhaustive search I was able to find a few good quotes.  [Here](http://imgur.com/a/qMv4x) is a recent modmail thread where the users are talking about Ron Paul/Gary Johnson and the next election campaign.  I dug a little deeper and found [THE FIRST MODMAIL THREAD in the subreddit's history](http://imgur.com/BouIOur).  A little more digging discovered that /u/Boobies_Are_Awesome and /u/GodOfAtheism were, back in February 2012, interns working for the Ron Paul campaign. We can see that the subreddit's creation was a direct order from the Ron Paul campaign itself. Both of these moderators are also high-ranking members of /r/circlejerk.  Skeptics like myself of course remember the time when circlejerk [changed its CSS to the Ron Paul website's theme](http://i.imgur.com/aiZc3.png). Of course everyone passed it off as a joke but it turns out these clever fucks were subtly promoting Ron Paul's campaign the whole time!  It's genious if you think about it, and [it certainly worked](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/search?q=ron+paul&amp;sort=top). Now if you all remember back in February, 2012 the Ron Paul campaign was sputtering and it needed a boost, so the HQ told the interns to consolidate their efforts and make a brand new [subreddit](/r/braveryjerk).  Apparently circlejerk's subtle hints were enough so they created a subreddit where to jam Ron Paul down your throat.  The guy is literally everywhere.  He's in the CSS background.  A bunch of their fake [""advice animals""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Braveryjerk/comments/xza63/advice_animals/) have his face substituted in place of popular meme images.  They also have attempted to discredit many of Ron Paul's competitors such as [Mitt Romney](http://www.reddit.com/r/Braveryjerk/search?q=romney&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=top&amp;t=all) and [Rick Santorum](http://www.reddit.com/r/Braveryjerk/search?q=santorum&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=top&amp;t=all).  And obviously the sheep eat it up, thinking it's all a joke when the subliminal advertising is going in their heads.  It's truly genious!  

Now I know this doesn't seem like a big deal because /r/Braveryjerk only has 7000 subscribers or so, but it only represents one level of this advertising campaign.  I unfortunately haven't been able to be modded in any of the other Circle* reddits, but if you go through them you can see the same Ron Paul propaganda emanating through.  Circlejerk mods have also been modded to places such as /r/TheoryOfReddit, /r/Facepalm, and even /r/IAmA.  I'm going to try to uncover as much information as I can about the CJ mods as I can in order to topple their little delusional scheme.  In the meantime, PLEASE keep a lookout on Braveryjerk spammers trying to shill for whoever has paid for them.  The worst offenders are /u/TheSox3, /u/spoderman_tim, /u/AerateMark, /u/ArchangelleNDTyson, /u/ParakeetNipple, and /u/NyoZa."

**Contest #1 (&lt;$10 prize, 1 Winner of my choice):**

**Find a make-up look that is interesting and colorful, but normal enough that I can wear it to work/school, then link me an item on Amazon that could be used to re-create that look.** Back story: I decided that since this semester is almost over, I should probably start looking for a side job on top of my internship.  I decided that my victim is going to be Sephora, which for those of you who don't know, is a make up company/store/what-have-you. With that job, comes great responsibility. More specifically, looking *FABULOUS* every day I work. So I need make-up ideas so I my look won't get stale and boring! 

I'm looking for a colorful, but not overly dramatic look.  Sephora has a certain dress code when it comes to their make-up, and a [neutral/basic look](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Z6OiOxlusM0/UUjYMY-EHqI/AAAAAAAAAbg/3wZHgTD-NwA/s1600/ELLE-s-19th-Annual-Women-In-Hollywood-Celebration-15-10-2012-emma-watson-32496113-2132-30001.jpg) is a big NO-NO, (though Emma Watson is extremely *GORGEOUS* with it on!) I'm looking for something like [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/3WJi8fg.jpg) or [THIS](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-q1Nu_RyZD6s/UUmZ5BIGnSI/AAAAAAAAAbw/vjnng8LKfrc/s1600/emma-watson-gold-black-smoky-eye-makeup.jpg).  Pretty much anything colorful and has 2+ colors to the eyes. But LET'S NOT GET [CRAZY](http://www.artofcosmetics.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Colorful-Eye-Makeup-Ideas1.jpg). 

*DON'T FORGET TO LINK ME AN ITEM ON AMAZON OR ELSE I CAN'T COUNT YOUR ENTRY!* (I need that item to be in the entry or else it won't comply with the subreddit's contest rules :/ )


**Contest #2 (&lt;$5 prize, 1 Winner via Random):**

**Find me a make up vanity table on Amazon.** Price doesn't matter since I'm really just looking for ideas so I can save them for when my make-up starts to overflow from the drawers I currently have them in. I'm really into vintage looking vanities like [THIS](http://www.amazon.com/Coaster-Queen-Style-Vanity-Painted/dp/B000BW730W/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365328528&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=vanity+table).

~~**Contest #3 (mp3 prizes, ~3+ winners via Random):**~~

~~**Link me a make-up item on Amazon that is cute/you think I'd like.** This one is pretty straight-forward, and there is no price limit :P If anything, [HERE](http://amzn.com/w/6AV61BN80CPG) is my current make-up wish list, and [HERE](http://imgur.com/a/2Ez9f) is my latest make-up haul, so you can get a general idea of what I like.

**Why?**: I'm short, skinny and have a baby face, combine that with my current wardrobe and people are always assuming I'm 14/15, 16 if I'm lucky. With summer coming up I'm in desperate need for a make over. I have an internship in HR so I need to start looking more professional. Also, I'll be graduating by the end of the year so I need to start looking more like an adult and less like a middle schooler addicted to her converse. 

**You now**: [Here I've made this convenient little album!](http://imgur.com/a/NkftB)

I don't typically wear dresses, but recently I've started to wear them more when the occasion calls for it. I still absolutely stay away from skirts, and things with too much frills or with jewels or bows are definitely not for me. 

**Budget**: Think poor college student whose just returned from 3 months abroad. So *really* not a lot of money haha

**Location**: Arizona

The funny thing is I actually really like dressing for winter. I love all the jackets and boots and scarves and what not but when it comes to summer I'm just at a complete loss. Summers in Arizona get brutal, I'm talking 100+ degrees, so I go immediately to the shorts and short sleeve t shirts and flip flops. The problem is I end up looking waaaaay younger as a result ( Just last weekend I literally had a guy at Costco tell me  I needed my parent's permission  before  I could take a sample  
-__-). So I guess not only do I need an office look but I also need to learn how to dress like an adult for the summer. In addition, everything in the stores right now seems to be oversized which doesn't really work with my bust size and just ends up making me look more boyish. "
1buesw,5,2013-04-07,Remember your accomplishments.,_zaprowsdower_,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/1buesw/remember_your_accomplishments/,"Just a small, perhaps self-serving, post that I want to share.  

I've been feeling extremely down lately.  A string of papers have been returned to me with less-than-stellar grades and borderline hurtful comments. (actually just really hurtful comments).  But yesterday I heard back from a potential internship opportunity asking me to submit my resume. I woke up in the middle of the night tonight and felt compelled to work on my resume.  Upon tweaking it and incorporating things from other resume drafts, I realized how much I have accomplished so far in my life.  Seeing accomplishments in an itemized way may seem trivializing, but really, I saw it tonight as all the hard work and learning experiences I have had.  It was interestingly motivating.  

What I am getting at is that no matter how hard it seems now, no matter how many people put you down, don't forget that every path is on a different course, and you are a more learned person than you were yesterday.  Don't forget the good things you've accomplished."

My searches have led me to believe that the TCU area, downtown/7th street area, and hemphill/rosedale areas area the most fun.  Is this correct?  it would be great if i were in a walkable area.

that being said, does anyone know of any extended stay hotels in the area or have a lead on a furnished summer sublet?

There are *a lot* of career paths out there:


**Web developer:**

* Visual designer / UI designer
* Front-end developer / JavaScript developer / UX developer. To be honest I don't know the difference between UI and UX.
* Backend developer / Python|PHP|Java|Rails|Perl|Node|ASP.NET|what have you developer
* Sysadmin  / DevOps
* Jack-of-all-trades full stack web developer


**Mobile developer:**

* iOS developer
* Android developer


**Game developer:**

* Engine programmer / graphics programmer / physics programmer / network programmer
* Game designer / scripter
* Sound designer / composer
* Artist / 3D artist / 3D modeler
* Writer
* Jack-of-all-trades indie game developer


**Specialized positions within larger companies:**

* SDET / QA
* Project manager / product manager


**Miscellaneous domains**

* Data scientist / ""statistician with software development skills""
* Computer security professional / information security professional
* Scientific programmer
* Quant / financial software developer
* Embedded systems / robotics / home automation (Arduino / Raspberry Pi being popular with hobbyists)
* Operating systems / compiler developer
* Hardware industry / CAD? / low-level drivers


So here's my career choice dilemma:

I want to work on indie game projects in my free time. But I'm a junior without an internship lined up for this summer, so I'm feeling a lot of pressure to develop other, more profitable skills in order to build my resume for general software development jobs.

At the moment, I'm developing my web skills so I can hopefully work as a web developer somewhere. Web development holds some interesting usability problems, but I feel like it's the kind of job that people work on beyond a 9-to-5 work day. Even as a student, I'm spending all my free time working on (or at least thinking about) web projects to build my resume, when what I really want is to invest that free time in making games.

**TL;DR** In college, coursework and career worries bleed into free time. When I graduate, I don't want any obligations beyond a 9-to-5 workday. Is web development the right career choice for me? Is there another industry that actually has these magical 9-to-5 jobs?"

I was like ... omg I think something will happen tonight, I got to his place we drink, then suddenly I kissed him... he push me a little and told me what the hell i was doing.

I'm American, he's dual South African/British. I currently live in America, he currently lives in the UK. (For some more backstory...we met in Nepal, we both thought it would be a casual holiday fling, ended up travelling Nepal/India together and really digging each other, he went back to South Africa for a visit, I went back to America after a year away, then he came and visited me and we traipsed about the States for a bit. Now he's back in the UK and I'm back in my hometown.). We have no idea when we'll be able to live together in the same city, or even on the same continent. 

My question is, how do y'all deal with it? How do you deal with the uncertainty of the future? I'm the kind of person who likes to figure out what's wrong and plan for it and then do it right away, but I can't do that in this situation and it's driving me up a wall.

I have to develop my skills in the States for at least another year before I'd be qualified to look for a job in Europe, much less the UK. I've been looking for internships but it's not the easiest thing in the world. I'm not eager to take out student loans studying abroad either, and not sure I want to go back to school. 

I pretty much bankrupted myself travelling Asia for a year, and it kills me that I only met him at the end of my trip...now I'll have to count pennies to be able to visit, but I'm not sure exactly when that will happen. 

I guess what I'm saying is, if I at least had a date to look forward to, it would make it easier. I can't help but be jealous of my friends who are in relationships which, even if they're long distance or otherwise complicated, at least they have the same nationality/easier immigration laws/visas. 

What do you do to cope, other than plan and skype/email/chat when you can and research future travelling plans? Is there any light at the end of the tunnel? :( Thanks for listening and for any advice/encouragement..."
1bu92e,4,2013-04-07,I have no idea what to do,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1bu92e/i_have_no_idea_what_to_do/,"Throw away, of course. Multiple proxies are being used just in case I can be tracked. I really don't want the police to show up at me door to haul me away to a hospital. &gt;:[

For my entire life I've never had a good relationship with anyone. I was abused my entire life by my parents in various ways (sometimes physical, usually verbal, a couple times sexual). I've never had more than one or two friends at any given time, and they usually ended up doing something to treat me like shit, such as leaving me stranded 10 hours away from the nearest town (it's a good thing smart-phones have GPS, or I'd still be lost). I was bullied for all of elementary school by other students, and even by a teacher in grade 6 who seemed to want to be friends with the cool students. During high-school I was pretty much invisible. Once I gathered enough courage to ask a girl out, only for her to tell the whole grade she thought I was going to rape her. I have been told multiple times throughout my life that I look like a rapist/stalker/creeper/gay/pedophile/etc... I really don't know how to fix this. People just don't seem to like me.

College sucked. My entire 3 years there to earn a shitty diploma consisted of school work, work, and occasionally sleep, 7 days a week. I spent thousands of extra dollars also doing night school to learn Japanese for an internship to Japan - only to be told at the last minute that it was cancelled. I spent 3 years of my shitty life working as hard as I could only to be bent over and fucked in the ass without lube. Now I have a shitty diploma and several years experience washing dishing so I can make 30k/year, and cap myself at 60k for the rest of my life. Woo-hoo. Also, I hated every fucking second of my job, working with lazy cooks, and self-centered waitresses - neither of which should be allowed to breed. All so I could afford to waste my life in a shitty community college.

The only girl I have ever been with I met in college. The only reason she was with me (and only for a brief period of time) was because she used sex to garner attention from men (she told me this a year or so later after admitting to having a problem). I was 17 and getting laid though, what did I care? Oddly enough, she was also a sexual abuse victim at a younger age. I think it's funny how broken people tend to find each other.

Now I'm in my second year of university and nothing has changed. I have no friends, no prospects for any, and no hope for the future. I've tried joining clubs, only to be ignored by the members. For example, I would go to a club during club week, and asked for a schedule. I would send multiple emails to the clubs I wanted to join only to be ignored and brushed away. During my first year, I tried to kill myself twice using huge amounts of sleeping pills, alcohol, and bottles of Pepto Bismuth. The first time I tried to do this, I swallowed ~5g of diphenhydramine hydrochloride (generic sleeping pills), a bottle of vodka, and of course some weed to top it off (I love weed, my only real friend). This was after my roommates were having a new years party where literally everyone was a boyfriend/girlfriend pair, and I was alone. Sadly I threw up the pills after about 5 hours of sleep. The second time I tried to do this, I thought I'd be a smart-ass and drink a couple bottles of Pepto-Bismuth (an anti-emetic to prevent vomiting) to go along with 10g of sleeping pills, a bottle of vodka, and of course a few hits from the bong. Sadly, I threw everything up. I want to note that the during day of this attempt, I was more happy than I had ever been in my entire life. I felt almost euphoric knowing I was going to die later on. I even bought a can of Pringles to celebrate the occasion. This was the only time in my life I ever felt truly happy, and I really want that feeling again. The feeling of happiness I felt was better than any high I've ever had. And I've done almost every drug other than crack, meth, and heroin.

Of course through out all of this I've been under the trusty care of a doctor, and more recently a psychiatrist who I see for 30 minutes every two weeks. I don't really understand the point of speaking to a psychiatrist other than to receive anti-depressants. I don't see how anything can be accomplished for 30 minutes every two weeks. And none of our sessions thus far have done anything to help me. Truthfully, I'd rather not waste this doctor's time as where I live there is roughly 1 psychiatrist for every 35k people. There are more important and/or sick people that need this help. Wasting public resources isn't a terribly ethical thing to do.

Now I'm at the point in my life where I keep in my room a set of tools that should be able to accomplish what pills couldn't do in the past. I have a bottle of ammonia, a bottle of bleach, a garbage bag, and a string. The method is simple: write ""Poison: Do Not Open"" on a piece of paper near me, put both bottles in the bag standing upright, remove the lids, then I put my head in the bag, and finally I tie the bag around my neck and spill the bottles. The chloramine concentration should easily exceed 2000ppm which should ensure death. The only thing I don't know is if it will be quick or slow, painful or painless. Every night I flirt with the idea of death by putting my head in the bag, tying it up, and tilting the bottles at such an angle that the liquid almost comes out. And every night I get closer and closer. After writing this I'll do my nightly ritual of putting my head in the bag, go to sleep, and hope tomorrow I have the courage to actually go through with it.

I want to be clear that the problems I am experiencing are my fault and no-one else's. I have tried to fix them, but failed."
1bu8km,6,2013-04-07,"Undiagnosed, what could it be.",lifesucksiknow,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1bu8km/undiagnosed_what_could_it_be/,"I'll try to be as clear as possible. Here are some facts about me:

- 26 year old male
- Cigarette smoker
- Weed gets me into extreme paranoid/delusional episodes
- Alcohol makes me feel better but due to the physical harm it causes me, I'm not an alcoholic (binge drink almost 1 day a week)

This has been getting worse over the years.

Every day I get random negative thoughts/flashbacks about events which happened to me in the past. Just about anything that makes me feel angry and guilty for nothing.

Another problem is that I'm always thinking about what people think of me. To the point where I can't even stare at someone in the face without having the urge to smirk or just unleash a sad/angry face. It's almost like torture to be in social situations. I sometimes think people are plotting against me or talking behind my back. To me it seems like a possibility because I talk to much from the nervousness I go though. Smoking cigarettes makes it worse but quitting makes me sluggish, lifeless and my attention span becomes almost non-existent. I always open my eyes too much when I speak, it's kind of scary because I didn't realize it until someone told me and I actually looked at it in the mirror.

Someone I barely knew spoke to me and said that I exerted some symptoms of schizophrenia without getting into any details. I know this is proof of nothing but I thought about schizophrenic-symptoms for years before I've been told that.

I know that you guys are not doctors (for the most part) and diagnosis online is not the way to go but I'd like some feedback, please. I actually did visit a psychiatrist but for reason she had an intern with her which made the whole process intimidating. I left undiagnosed because they thought that nothing was wrong with me. I can obviously function in life as a healthy person with a mask but it's those periods during the day that are so destructive. I know there are ways to make it work but I'd like to keep it away from doctors/hospitals for now. 

With a little bit of research I understand that higher levels of dopamine could possibly be the cause. The nicotine from the cigarettes temporarily raise the levels of dopamine which make my negative symptoms worse but if I quit, the levels go too low and give me ADHD-like symptoms. When I eat sugar and drink caffeine, similar effects happen but are too intense to be controlled, at this point my speech becomes slurred and my vision becomes tunnel-like and I feel like I'm feeling mildly psychotic. Dry mouth and rapid heart beat is also prevalent.

Now for the PTSD-like and psychosis-like symptoms, I can see some correlation to dopamine levels as well. Marijuana does have some hallucinogenic properties but also increases the dopamine levels in the brain. I get crazy when I smoke weed. I almost want to hide in the corner from the delusions.

Without sounding arrogant, I think I'm of average or slightly above average intelligence. I know my psychosis-like symptoms make me go through false ideas but I think it has given me an edge to do tasks which require a certain type of logic.


Sorry if the text above seems to be disorganized, I'm really tired and my brain is really about to explode.

I've done a few days worth of work without pay just to establish my technical abilities, but before we really dive into the meat of the application development I want to ensure that I'll receive compensation for my work, but I'm not sure what I should be asking for.  My only experience with getting paid for programming is internships at large companies, so I'm going to have to negotiate for something reasonable given the situation.

The way I see it is, I can ask for a deposit at beginning and then a lump sum at completion, but I currently intend to keep working on this after primary development is complete.  Or I can ask for hourly pay, but since I'll likely be working from home there's no easy way to insure my hours are being properly tracked.  Lastly I can ask for a percentage of the profits (i.e a stake in the company) once the application is complete, but I'm not sure what a reasonable amount is to ask for since I'm currently the only developer and in the event the product doesn't take off, I could be left with nothing.

So I ask, how do you usually handle getting paid for your work and how much do you usually get?  For estimation purposes, I imagine the project would take me 1-2 months to complete.  Any advice is appreciated."

That pretty much sums up how it is. We've been together for 6 years, but for the past 4, it's been bickering and fighting. He moved to another state just last summer for an internship and we took a break over the course of the continuing fall. We got back together January of 2012 and when he moved to another state this past 2012 summer, I had hoped to go with him. He wasn't ready for it, so he said to wait until he'd gotten settled in. I waited until December when he was ready for me, and we had actually looked at engagement rings. He and my dad negotiated for the ring (my dad bought it as my boyfriend wasn't exactly swimming in money at the time) and I hadn't seen it yet since picking it out. I moved down with him in January and since then, things have been rockier and rockier. This afternoon, we got into an argument and it blew up into ""I want you out"". He helped me pack my stuff, cried with me and then helped me understand that this was what we needed now. He needed to grow up a bit and figure out what would make him happy, and I need to find happiness myself. 8 hours later, and a few calls and lots of texts from him, we're on a ""serious break"" and in May, we'll see where we are and can re-evaluate everything. I'm holding out hope we'll get back together towards the end of the year when we have some time apart.

Right now though, I feel so tired, drained and alone. Just 12 hours ago, I was in his arms and hugging him. Now.. I have a pillow. Not quite the same.

I just needed to get it off my chest. An 8 hour drive with four pull overs to sob my eyes out doesn't exactly lend to good therapy."

Recently I've had a lot of suspicion surrounding the Circlejerk group of subreddits.  In particular, I was appalled how circlejerk moderators could get away with posting [blatant sponsored advertising](http://i.imgur.com/Mtdelap.png) on their subreddit.  This was called out by someone on /r/SubredditDrama but the thread was [summarily deleted](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1bnpeu/over_in_rcirclejerk_the_mods_are_pulling_a_scam/).  It's been my suspicion that the circlejerk mods have a lot of influence on this website, and the above confirmed this.

**The Bravery Delusion**

I'm here to talk about a whole different scheme of theirs, however.  This one is so hilarious, so unbelievably insane that it's hard to stay with but please bear with me.  First of all, a quick visit to /r/Braveryjerk gives off a strange vibe.  It's apparently full of random internet memes and Ron Paul's face is for some reason plastered everywhere.  The place seems to be very loosely organized and I was able to gain moderatorship for a few hours.  In that time, I found the shocking secret:  *Braveryjerk is and has been sponsored by the Ron Paul campaign*, and I have proof!

It was hard to find any good nuggets because the modmail is mostly just jibberish and exhausted memes, but after an exchaustive search I was able to find a few good quotes.  [Here](http://imgur.com/a/qMv4x) is a recent modmail thread where the users are talking about Ron Pauk/Gary Johnson and the next election campaign.  I dug a little deeper and found [THE FIRST MODMAIL THREAD in the subreddit's history](http://imgur.com/BouIOur).  A little more digging discovered that /u/Boobies_Are_Awesome and /u/GodOfAtheism were, back in February 2012, interns working for the Ron Paul campaign. We can see that the subreddit's creation was a direct order from the Ron Paul campaign itself. Both of these moderators are also high-ranking members of /r/circlejerk.  Skeptics like myself of course remember the time when circlejerk [changed its CSS to the Ron Paul website's theme](http://i.imgur.com/aiZc3.png). Of course everyone passed it off as a joke but it turns out these clever fucks were subtly promoting Ron Paul's campaign the whole time!  It's genious if you think about it, and [it certainly worked](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/search?q=ron+paul&amp;sort=top). Now if you all remember back in February, 2012 the Ron Paul campaign was sputtering and it needed a boost, so the HQ told the interns to consolidate their efforts and make a brand new [subreddit](/r/braveryjerk).  Apparently circlejerk's subtle hints were enough so they created a subreddit where to jam Ron Paul down your throat.  The guy is literally everywhere.  He's in the CSS background.  A bunch of their fake [""advice animals""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Braveryjerk/comments/xza63/advice_animals/) have his face substituted in place of popular meme images.  They also have attempted to discredit many of Ron Paul's competitors such as [Mitt Romney](http://www.reddit.com/r/Braveryjerk/search?q=romney&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=top&amp;t=all) and [Rick Santorum](http://www.reddit.com/r/Braveryjerk/search?q=santorum&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=top&amp;t=all).

1btpdc,17,2013-04-06,My brother's best friend dominated me doing sex and I loved it,DsConfession,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1btpdc/my_brothers_best_friend_dominated_me_doing_sex/,"I'm a high school senior girl. I've been dated my ex for the past 2 years. We started having sex about 6 months into the relationship (age of consent being 16 where I live), and it's always been pretty...boring for me. My older brother goes to a small liberal arts school in the middle of nowhere, and I'm going there this fall as well. I visited him this past weekend after I got my acceptance letter.

My brother is a sophmore on the crew team. His friends on the are pretty great, and I've always had a crush on his best friend, Reid.

This weekend, I got really drunk and stoned with them. My brother was off doing something else (i.e. hooking up with his girlfriend), and I was with Reid as my ""supervisor."" Sharing a bong turned into making out, turned into sex. 

It was the best sex I've ever had. Reid held me down, dominated me. It was incredible. I'd never really thought I would like that, but I did.

I haven't told anyone. This is my brother's *best* friend. They have the biggest bromance I've ever seen. I feel like this will destroy it. Reid and I have been texting all week and we skyped earlier this week.

There's no question about me going to this school next year. It is my dream school, and I can play my sport there. I really want a relationship with Reid, but I just don't know what to do about my brother...

-------
**UPDATE**
It's been a wild weekend. Shortly after I posted this, my brother's friend, Emma, called me. Emma is pretty much one of my only female friends and we're pretty close. She knew that I hooked up with a guy that weekend, because I didn't sleep in her room like I was supposed to. She covered for me.

Reid and Emma are pretty close. They were dating for a while, but realized that their personalities are too much alike and they should stick to being friends. Reid obviously spilled his guts to Emma, because she's his secret keeper.

Emma asked about it. I was wary, because I didn't know if I was getting played by Reid. She reassured me that he honestly likes me and has for a while. So I spilled my guts. Told her that I was scared of what my brother/family would say about Reid, as he's almost 2 years older. 

She then told me that my brother knew. He knew that Reid had a crush on me and we had hooked up. He was happy that something finally happened. But, because my brother is kind of an asshole, he was holding it over Reid's head a bit, freaking him out. My brother spent pretty much the entire week talking about how he hated my ex and no boy would ever be good enough for his little sister, ect. ect.

I skyped my brother Sunday night. He asked me how I liked the school, his girlfriend, how my week was, blah blah blah. I cut to the chase and told him to stop fucking with Reid's head. He laughed, told me congratulations, and that he would be the first to beat him up if he hurt me. Then he called Reid into his room, apologized, and let us talk for a bit.

I guess I didn't have anything to worry about. Reid has an internship in my city this summer so I'm super excited for that. Thanks for all the support. This one has a happy ending :)"

1byald,2,2013-04-08,"I [23F] always have boyfriends who tell me they want complete honesty in a relationship, but when I am honest, it alienates them and they lose trust.",throwaway1777x,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1byald/i_23f_always_have_boyfriends_who_tell_me_they/,"Background:  I am 23 years old and female, out of college for a year and currently in a relationship with my boyfriend, who is 20, of two and a half years.  It's a very good relationship, but I often find myself hiding little things because of my experiences with honesty in my past relationships.


So let me start at Boyfriend #1.  I was 18, he was 19.  He and I always were always open about sharing even the smallest details of our days because we were in a ldr and it was really the only way to stay close.  Fast forward eight months into the relationship.  I was at a party at school and a drunk classmate tried to make out with me.  This freaked me out not only because I didn't want or ask for it, but also because at this point, Bf1 was the only person I had ever kissed, so any amount of physical contact was extremely intimidating.  Well, in the interest of honesty I told Bf1 about the guy when we had our weekly phone conversation.  And the first thing he asked was ""Did you cheat on me?"" I said, ""No, I just told you he forced himself on me.""  And he interrogated me about whether or not I was making it up.  I understand a person can overreact initially to something like this, so I tried to reassure him and talk through it.


But over the next few months he got really super clingy and kept bringing it up every time I even made a new guy friend (I was in engineering, so couldn't really avoid guys).  Suddendly every guy was a threat and I was not trustworthy.  But he still wanted the relationship so he tried to monitor me from a distance.  Eventually for other reasons in addition to this complete lack of faith in me, I broke it off after a year and a few months.  To make this point clear, I never cheated even once on him and never even thought about it.  And I don't believe I ever did or said anything (besides I guess that night) to make him assume otherwise.


So Boyfriend #2 comes along soon after that (I am 19 now and Bf2 is 21).  We hit it off and we're both easy going and committed and it's all great.  We went to the same university so no long distance.  About six months in, I leave school to work and study out of state for a short time and while away, I had an unfortunate encounter with a coworker.  We were out at a bar with the whole office just hanging out.  I had one drink and a high tolerance so I was still aware of my surroundings.  But one of my coworkers (who had been drinking, but I don't know how drunk he really was) followed me to the bathroom later in the evening (one of those single-person ones) and forced himself on me.  I tried to get away but he was really strong and covered my mouth so I couldn't call for help.  Afterwards I wasn't sure what to do or what to say to anyone, if anything at all.  I asked my best friend for advice, and she tried to help me through it, but advised me not to tell Bf2.  I thought surely she was mistaken and that my bf was supposed to be the one person I could and *should* be honest with.


So I called him anyway and at first he freaked out like a good bf should, but he never really tried to comfort me.  Everything he said sounded like words to comfort him, but nothing that was supposed to make me feel better.  And then he asked me to tell someone at work and I said I didn't think I wanted to (I was just a lowly intern and I was new to working and I was just scared in general, so maybe you can understand why I didn't want to talk about it and confront the guy).  When I said I wasn't sure about talking, he said ""Oh, I see what this is.  You are cheating on me and just wanted to get away with it.  That's a pretty elaborate lie.""  I hung up on him and didn't speak to him for two weeks after that.


We continued dating and he never decided to trust me again.  If a guy tried to hit on me, it was my fault.  If I wanted to drink with my friends, I got a lecture because I was clearly 'being selfish' and 'trying to get away from' him.  We didn't have much of a sex life because he was too big and sex was painful, but we did everything else so there wasn't any real neglect in that department.  But he suddenly decided he was entitled to sex and that I was just pretending to be in pain because I was too busy fucking his friends (I barely knew them).  He forced sex on more than one occasion and eventually I dumped him because I couldn't take it anymore.


By this point I'm 20 and I find a new guy (18).  We're still dating to this day and we have an incredibly happy, loving, and open relationship.  Except in some cases, which is the reason I'm posting this in the first place.  I want more than anything to tell him about all the little things, the good and the bad - the compliment I got from a photographer, the douchebag who grabbed my ass at the gym, all of those things.  But based on past experience, I've started feeling like honesty isn't always the best policy and it freaks me out.  I still believe I should be able to tell my boyfriend anything, but I'm worried even a small amount of insecurity on his part would tear apart an otherwise great relationship.  I've seen my guy friends have similar problems with their gfs, too.


So reddit, I guess I'm just looking for your thoughts on the question of complete honesty in relationships.  Because I want to believe that there are people who don't get bothered by stuff like this.  I try not to, but even with how much I hate myself for thinking bad thoughts, I still have them too.  I just try my hardest to ignore those nagging questions unless there's too much proof of something to ignore, because I would hate to do to someone else what Bfs 1 and 2 did to me.  And I want to trust that my boyfriend would be ok with stuff like this and be able to talk about it without immediately losing faith in me or us, but it's hard not to take my friend's advice about keeping my mouth shut when so far people keep proving her right.


**TL;DR: Got assaulted and bf accused me of cheating.  It ruined our relationship.  Similar instance ruined a prior relationship, too.  Now I find it hard to be open and honest with my current bf because of it.**"

I am a junior at university, and I have plans for graduate school directly after graduation. I have been doing research for the past two years, have a manuscript to be submitted soon, and will be doing an honor's thesis my senior year.

I am having somewhat of a crisis now. In past summers, I had a research fellowship and a lab tech position, both at my university. This summer I applied to three different REUs, was rejected by two and the third disbanded after it lost NSF funding.

I was relying on these three opportunities to occupy my summer. However, as of now, I have no plans. I was thinking of getting a regular job bartending or something of that sort. But the idea of taking a summer away from research is a bit unnerving; people's constant suggestion for me to find an internship outside of my university is not making it any better.

What do you guys think? Is it kosher to take a summer off from bio research, especially so late in my undergrad career? What would you suggest my next step be?

I'm a 22 year old male software engineer returning to SF for my second summer in a row for an internship.

I'll work 32hrs/wk in Potrero Hill.

I lived in the Mission District last summer and really enjoyed it. I'm open to other neighborhoods. I'm not really trying to live deep into the sunset/richmond because it takes forever to get home without a car. Also not a big fan of TL and hunters point.

I'm pretty easy going and can mold to most living situations. I won't be bringing much with me other than my backpack and a suitcase. I'd even consider living on a couch or in a sleeping bag in a laundry room. But that doesn't mean I don't have a budget. For a good room with a bed and such I'm willing to pay up to $1300/mo. 

I can be quiet, or I can be social. Whatever you want in a roommate. I doubt I'd spend too much time at home unless you were super cool. I enjoy exploring the city in my free time.

1bxwyb,0,2013-04-08,"I've been programming for awhile now, but am I employable?",immranderson,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1bxwyb/ive_been_programming_for_awhile_now_but_am_i/,"Hi! I've hit a bit of a crossroads in my career and have been looking for guidance from anyone that's willing to offer.



   Awhile back, I took a intro to computer science course and eventually went on to make my entire way through this [textbook.](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Programming-Java-Interdisciplinary-Approach/dp/0321498054)



   At the time of when I was taking this class, I was also working a temp job as an administrative assistant doing miscellaneous tasks, such as sorting documents and doing data entry tasks. The data entry involved analyzing forecasting data in an excel spreadsheet format, and then uploading the excel spreadsheet in a pre-defined template. I went on to code up a program using JExcel to compare the new data with the old data and update the information accordingly... 



   After the end of that temporary employment, I went on to get hired on at a different company as a sales representative, and couldn't get enough of using my coding skills to automate various tasks. For Instance, everyday we would have to log in to a website, download 100's of Purchase Orders in PDF format, rename them, file them away, and update a master excel spreadsheet using information pulled from the PO's. After this, we'd distribute the information internally to whoever needed it via e-mail. I went on to automate that entire process using the PDFBox and Apache POI libraries and wrapped it all up in a simple GUI interface so that all my co-workers would be able to use it as well.



   Aside from that, we had thousands of quotes and parts lists stored in tens of thousands of excel spreadsheets scattered throughout our shared drive. Everything was managed by employees going into the excel spreadsheets and modifying the data.



   Every single time we wanted to create a new quote, we'd have to go and visit several spreadsheets each with their own standard pricing tiers and paste a lot of that information into our own format.



   ASIDE from that, we'd have to re-copy and paste a lot of that data into our customer's format to submit to them. So I went and created a GUI that could pull the data from our internal quotes and display it in a far more readable manner. I also then made it so that employees could build quotes through this GUI format and then regenerate the quotes in the customer format if so desired. So! My best explanation of what I had done so far was build an easy to use front-end to build/view quotes+part structures using all the pre-existing excel spreadsheets that we had as a back end. This way employees who were slower to adapting to change could keep building and modifying the data through excel, while other employees could use the new front-end I had built to manipulate the quotes.



   My plan was that I'd create a choice for the employees, with a clear hope that the option that I had created would be preferred. Overall feedback was pretty positive from my co-workers, so I was pretty happy about that. Eventually I had hoped that the department would make a full switch over to using the front-end that I had created so I could focus on organizing all the data from the spreadsheets into a database.



   So, I was going insane from how our data was organized, using thousands of Excel spreadsheets as a back-end... So I started picking up MySQL and JDBC and started tinkering with how I could manage to migrate the data from all the excel spreadsheets over into a database. I had built a rough prototype, but then my Significant Other got her dream job in the San Francisco Bay Area, so we ended up relocating and I wasn't able to finish my project...



   I'm still jobless at the moment, but I'd seriously love to work in some sort of software development field. The thing is, I don't even know if the things I had done would still be considered in the ""beginner"" side of things or if it's even note-worthy.



   My entire career, I've been the only one in my departments that could code, so I haven't had any feedback on where I'm at, skill-level wise. I also have gone through a few online courses in Python development, and took a few university courses programming in C and Assembly. Unfortunately, I still don't have my bachelor's degree, but I do at least have an associates in Mathematics to float on. I'd love to finish off a bachelor's degree in computer science but I just don't have the finances to back me up, so I've been spending much of my time taking algorithm classes on coursera and studying up on data structures. I'm also currently working my way through the django tutorial [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/intro/) and the ruby on rails tutorial [here.](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book)



   So I'm curious, what else do I need to do to be employable in a software development field? All these entry level job postings that I'm stumbling upon are overwhelming me with their requirements, and unless I'm mistaken, I can't really do an internship since I'm not currently enrolled in any university courses. Any advice or help would be deeply deeply appreciated!"

I'm a graduate student in the process of interviewing for internships as part of my program. I have two interviews set up this week at different organizations that work with domestic abuse victims in the area. 

I'm really nervous as to the types of questions they may ask during the interview. I'm used to and prepared for the ""tell me about yourself"", ""what are your strengths?"" And ""what are your weaknesses?"" Types of typical interview questions, but am worried they may throw me for a loop somehow.

I'm graduating in around a month and I am extremely anxious. In college, while my GPA was alright and I was very involved in on-campus activities and student organizations, I never managed to land an internship and now I am having trouble finding a job.

My major was ITI (basically IT + Communications) with a minor in English. I'm looking for jobs in the area of IT management or support, or jobs that are more creative (like advertising) since I am a good writer (not try to brag, but when I try, writing is my strong point).

My big problem now is that I just don't know where to find jobs. I don't really have any hook-ups (no family or friends that can really give me a job) and I don't really have a big network of people for me to talk to about this. I have tried to use my school's career site but I have found it to be very inconclusive and haven't even gotten a call from it.

Really, all I do now is browse job board sites (Monster, CareerBuilder, Indeed, etc) and apply for anything, but all I get mostly are Sales jobs or high level software programming jobs. 

Where can I look for jobs? I am getting super nervous because I feel like there is something everyone else is doing that I'm not. All my friends are getting jobs and interviews and I feel like a huge loser."

1bxblu,2,2013-04-08,Are you obligated to an internship you already started?,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1bxblu/are_you_obligated_to_an_internship_you_already/,"Hey folks, 

I was offered an internship with a smaller company, that I accepted (fearing I would recieve no other offers). I began working for said internship and am now being offered an interview for another summer internship at a much larger company. If I go through with the interview and get an offer, will I even be able to accept it?

EDIT W/ ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: The larger company will most likely pay more, but the job will only be for the summer. The smaller company I currently work for pays less, but is more likely to turn into a part time job for the remainder of my schooling. I feel like going with the bigger company will give me short term happiness. 

TL;DR: Once you begin work for a summer internship are you obligated to stay all summer, even if offered a better position elsewhere? I would hate to burn bridges."

Can't see the point of going on.,hobbitcraft,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1bxb6e/mature_university_student_feeling_incredibly_down/,"I lost my job back in 2010 at 26 years of age. I drove a forklift in a warehouse. The factory closed down around the same time I inherited about $40,000. I had no qualifications so I saw it as an opportunity to go to university to make a better life for myself.

I'm now 29 years old and coming to the end of my third year in university, after this summer I have one more year to go before I graduate in 2014. 

I recently interviewed for a summer internship where 40 positions were available. I was told by HR they interviewed 45 people and I still couldn't get the fucking job. I would take a guess and say most of the 45 people interviewed were 20-22 years of age with little work experience.

Since leaving high school over ten years ago I've had 10-15 interviews for entry level office jobs and I've never once got a job or a second interview. Last year alone, I had 4 interviews and didn't ever get a response. Any job I've ever worked was manual work through a family member or friend.

This last rejection hit me the hardest as I had almost a 90% chance of landing an internship and for once getting a break and I still couldn't get it. Even though my grades are good I'm starting to question whats the point. I obviously come across terrible in interviews so when I finally graduate at 30 I'll have no professional experience just low end manual work so I'll probably struggle to get a job then too.

On top of this I'm single, money is tight and I live hours away from my few friends and family. All I really seem to do now is study and go to the gym.

Can anyone offer me some advice?"

You feel sick. You fight off the need to vomit, and instead decide to look around for any clues the NIU might have missed. 

0037: There’s sixty cents on the ground nearby. All the objects that floated around the Prince were gathered up as evidence.

***

I think I’m stuck in a loop.

Damn. 
Ok, tell me where you went.

***

When asked by a reporter – an intern, really – whom he would later punch in the face on two separate occasions, Thomas was able to pinpoint a specific moment when the idea came to him. The truth, however, was that it was with him, albeit without words or shape, in many moments of his life leading up to that night. In bars and car parks, in beer and in boredom.

It was in him as he stood on a small stage in his friend Emily’s backyard, surrounded by friends and channelling JFK. 

“And so,” he yelled as he held out the microphone to the crowd, inviting them to join in. “My fellow Americans!” Even the people who thought his choice was too much of a cliché joined in. It was a cliché because they knew the words. “Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can for your country!”

Nobody was really sure which came first: the portmanteau of oratory and karaoke, or the idea to base a party around such a combination. In either case, Emily had raised her head from the desk during the final class of the year, shouted the word like it was bingo, and then put her head back down. Thus Oratoraoke had come into being – loudly and in need of further explanation. 

“My fellow citizens of the world!” Finally feeling included in the proceedings, suburban Australia applauded for their impersonation-in-chief. It was at this moment when Thomas caught the eye of a girl in the crowd. Not quite Jackie O, but with the same cool admiration for the man with the microphone. This is when he wanted it all to be true. “Ask not what America will do for you, but what we together can do for the freedom of mankind.” 

When he finished, Thomas stepped down from the stage and accepted a shot of something from Cameron, as applause washed over him like a chaser. Someone in a Nixon mask extended his hand to congratulate him, before pulling away at the last moment – ever the sore loser, even at parties. For a few minutes he was all executive power and Boston Irish charisma, and then it was all over so suddenly: Washington to Dallas in a heartbeat. The attention of the crowd was soon focused on a fellow classmate named Hannah, dressed like a hooker and delivering Aragorn’s speech from in front of the Black Gate. The delivery was spot-on, except she replaced ‘men’ with ‘women’ whenever the word came up.

“I bid you stand, Women of the West!” she screamed. Riotous applause, and someone shouted “For Frodo!” but Thomas stood at the back, trying to appreciate the brilliance of the commentary. Instead he had spent the whole time trying to figure out a way to explain to Cameron, now quite drunk after earlier doing his best Billy Bob Thornton from Friday Night Lights, what he was feeling. He didn’t quite get there.

The idea was in him, almost on him at this point, later that night when the conversation at the party inevitably turned to what everyone would be doing next year. Cameron told everyone about a job he had lined up with a marketing firm. Cedric and Li were going to study law. Emily had gotten a journalism internship through her father, who owned the newspaper. May, no longer looking at Thomas like the First Lady, and who was the only one whose response Thomas actually wanted to hear, muttered something barely audible. When it was Thomas’ turn, he thought he sounded like someone who had gotten stoned before a pitch meeting.

“Well, I’ve been working on this location-based hypertext noir adventure… thing,” he told the circle of people. Having never explained it to anyone, except Cameron who was helping him with the app design, he wasn’t really sure what to say. “Like, you start at a location, where you find a number hidden somewhere. Then you take out your phone, put the number into the app, and it tells you part of the story. Then it might tell you to go somewhere else, where you’ll look for another number. Or you might get a choice between going one place, or another. And it records which numbers you’ve already put in, so, say 0033 will read differently if you’ve already entered 0032, than it will if you haven’t.”

There was a moment of silence before anyone said anything. Eventually Cameron spoke up. “It’s still in the beta-testing phase.”

“And are you planning to make money off this?” Emily asked. 
“Subscription fees? Charging people for the app?”

“No, I just… thought it might be fun. Make the place I live more exciting for people.”

More silence. Then, “I think it sounds great,” said May. “I’ll even help you test it, if you want. But,” she paused to consider what she was about to say, “are people going to, like, get it? I mean, the place you live isn’t exactly known for its… culture. It might work in Melbourne, or across the university campus, but the outer suburbs of Perth? Are you going to explain over fifty years of game, film and narrative theory before they start?” 

He didn’t know how to respond to this. His attitude had always simply been ‘if you build it, they will come,’ until now. 

“Just, don’t be disappointed if it doesn’t work out.” 

For the second time that night, he wished he had something real to tell her. He wanted to tell her that the idea was taking the suburbs by storm, or that some developers from Silicon Valley were interested in it. He would have even settled for being able to say he’d also gotten a job interview somewhere, but there was nothing. This was the closest he had come, before the night when his ambition and frustration became an actual string of words, to telling someone that he was also possibly interested in getting involved in local government, but it felt too much like a 5 year-old saying he wants to be a fireman when he grows up. 

“I know,” he said, smiling. “I won’t.” 

It was November, the summer of 2012, of Monsters and Men and Macklemore. Cameron was closely following the rise and fall and rise and fall of Mitt Romney, while Thomas worked on his simulacrum – his sub-suburb. He had taken down all of his posters – Jay-Z, Christina Hendricks, Batman – and covered the walls in maps and sticky notes. He wrote sub-plots within sub-plots within alleyways, obscure characters that could only be encountered with a very specific series of numbers, and toyed with the idea of adding an inventory system. 
“Now we’re getting beyond my skill level,” Cameron told him. “If you want fancy shit like that you’re going to have to hire a pro.” In the three weeks since finishing his degree (the day before Oratoraoke) and starting his job, Cameron spent most of his time at Thomas’ house. There he could get high and watch the American 24-hour news networks – activities not available to him at his own parents’ house. Despite also living with his parents, Thomas was not exactly subject to any real parenting the way Cameron was. Where Cameron’s actions at home were still very much controlled by restrictions and negotiations, the Moss household was governed by the far more subtle means of awkwardness and communicative action. If caught smoking weed, his mother would merely ask how often he did it, and why, and the awkwardness involved would be enough to ensure would not get caught again. 

Paul Ryan, the uneducated man’s educated man, was on screen talking about numbers that were too complicated to be talked about, when Thomas broached the subject of how much spare time Cameron would have once he started his new job. 

“I don’t really know,” he said in reply. “I don’t even really know what they expect of me, so we’ll have to wait and see. But I guess that isn’t even really the truth. The answer is, probably not. But maybe you could learn to do the app stuff yourself. It isn’t really that hard.”

“Yeah, I guess I should.” He had very little interest in learning web design, despite the fact that that was the one skill anybody hired a Communications major for. He liked to reassure himself with the example of Steve Jobs not knowing anything about coding, but the similarities fell apart pretty quickly. 

They would normally spend most of the day in front of the TV, alternating between CNN, FOX and the Cartoon Network, Thomas half paying attention to Cameron’s three quarters. The hypertext adventure, now given the name of Suburbs Beyond Suburbs (with all apologies to the Arcade Fire), was now almost completely written and mapped out, but not yet online. As a result, Thomas had inadvertently, perhaps almost by osmosis, become more aware of what was happening in his real community. So much so that he noticed an ad for a vacancy at the local council. Looking up from his laptop, interrupting an important speech on TV, he said to Cameron, “Cultural Development Officer.”

“Huh?” he responded.

“There’s a job opening with the local council. Cultural Development Officer.”

“And what does that mean?”

“No idea. But it sounds like me, doesn’t it?”

“Mmm. Sure.”

He spent the next day misremembering the past well enough to put together what he thought was a decent resume and cover letter. Going to bad movies and good bars made him “culturally engaged” and his Bachelor of Arts made him “ready for the challenges of public service.” He even cited Suburbs Beyond Suburbs as an example of taking initiative to improve the reputation of the town, believing that such a fresh, experimental idea would make him the clear choice for the job. He finally clicked ‘submit application’ at 3am on a Friday morning. Immediately after doing so, he realized that being that guy who is up at this hour, looking desperately for a job, was not a good look. He hoped the applications weren’t time coded, but knew they probably were. 
The rejection came through, via e-mail, two weeks later on a Friday morning. It sat in his inbox for three hours before waking at midday and opening his computer. No interview, no follow-up, no feedback, just “we are sorry to inform you blah blah blah.”

If he hadn’t been so frustrated at that moment, the images on the TV wouldn’t have had such an effect on him. For the rest of the day, while Cameron was finishing his first week at work, he thought a lot about Mitt Romney. He seemed now, after his defeat, like the least powerful man in the world: almost on par with Thomas despite his millions of dollars. But at the beginning he seemed sure of himself, in an inept sort of way. Like he only needed his own support to become President, but he didn’t always have it 100%. This was the moment he described to the reporter. Surely most public figures could trace a line in their lives from wanting to give a convincing JFK performance, to wanting to impress a single person in a large crowd, to wanting to make the place they live a better place, right through to realizing that the best jobs are the ones no one has to offer you. He left most of that off the record, simply stating that “there was this guy who ran for office and almost won, despite the fact that no one really liked him. He did it because he could. Like the campaign would boost his self-esteem, and his self-esteem would boost the campaign. I don’t know.” The reporter didn’t tape the interview, and the quote became something else later. 

When Cameron showed up after work they soon conceded defeat to an empty fridge and decided to go to the only bar in town. Thomas now had an actual idea to propose, but he made smaller talk for the first beers. 

“So, Corporate Cam. Taking the business world by storm?”

Cameron laughed. “Yeah, something like that. It’s kind of strange though, this business world.”

“Like how?”

“I don’t know. They talk about social media like they can sell you shit while being your friend. The internet’s just going to be one big business lunch when they’re done. They’ve got me working on this campaign – heavily supervised of course – for a housing development out in the hills. So they talk like they’re already your neighbour, welcoming you with muffins and letting you know that if you ever need anything they’re just next door.” He took a long sip of beer. “I guess I need to stop saying ‘they’. I’m the one driving the welcome wagon now. Or at least in the passenger seat, waving stupidly.”

“But you’re going to stick with it?”

“Yeah. If I do the knucklehead Facebook stalker stuff for a while then maybe I can get out and do something better.”

“Like politics?”

“Yeah, maybe. And anyway, there’s this really nice girl at work that-“

“What if we ran for mayor?”

“-I think might be into… wait. What?”

“I think we should run for Mayor.” 

It took a few moments of scrutiny, and half of his pint, to make out whether Thomas was serious. He finished the beer, looked his best friend in the eye, and asked, “We?”

“Well, me. But you’ll be campaign manager.”

“Why can’t I run?”

“Because I said it first.”

I'm a Computer Science Major about to graduate in the Fall of 2013, and I am looking for summer internships. I did apply for a bunch of local internships but I haven't heard back from any of them. I do have some research experience, but I was really hoping that I could get some industry experience this summer, so that I could make an informed decision on whether or not to go to grad school. 


I do have one offer from a company I interned at before, and that would involve me creating an app for an SAP-based system. 


I also have an offer from my advisor, where I would work on developing a web-based music recommender system for his research, but if I take that offer I forego any chance of industry experience over the summer.


Is my resume ok? Also, I am working on several projects at the moment - should I put them on my resume at the cost of removing experience? Which option from the above sounds like the best in my situation? Is it too late to keep looking for summer internships?


Thanks so much - I've seen a lot of valuable advice up here and I was really hoping for some good input.

1bwx43,30,2013-04-08,"The first ""I switched my major from engineering to physics and don't know if my perspective is in the right place"" thread.",WhyAmINotStudying,PhysicsStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhysicsStudents/comments/1bwx43/the_first_i_switched_my_major_from_engineering_to/,"About 10 days ago, my physics professor cast a voodoo spell on me by asking everyone in the class what their majors were. Although I wasn't the last person to ask in the room, he skipped over me, then saved me for last, at which point I said, ""Physics. No, just kidding, I'm still an engineering major."" By the next morning, I texted him telling him that I had switched to physics.

I looked at the courses that are required, the subjects that are covered, and the types of skills that I would gain over the period of being a physics major and came to realize that it is far more appealing to me than an engineering major. Additionally, I have over 170 credits available to my degree, but am only a sophomore in engineering at best. This is due to a previous degree in music. I came to realize that with the assigned coursework required and the work load, I can get a physics degree by taking 15 fewer credits (5 classes) than an engineering degree would require at this point. That means I can graduate sooner *and* with a lighter workload.

I recognize that this doesn't mean the work is easier. If anything, it opens me up to a far more abstract realm. I've seen [this infographic](http://i.imgur.com/oO6GvUa.gif), and I can see that the physics major opens a lot of options for a career to me, although the number of options available to me where I would actually be working in physics  are incredibly limited. I am not actually so distressed by this prospect, and the reason why warrants its own paragraph.

 - From my perspective, the idea of working at and being a physicist means that I get to analyze and study the known science of physics and, with any luck, I may come across something that is either untested or unobserved. The likelihood of this is relatively small, but it's significantly larger if I go through life as a physicist than if I don't. The process of learning enough to be a physicist means that when I'm at that point, I'll have a very particular set of skills that are highly marketable in multiple industries. These skills will enable me to acquire enough money to make a living, and with luck, may even enable me to continue my education in physics through the master's and doctoral level.

What this effectively means is that, on my path of becoming a physicist, I can and should take advantage of the value of my skills to improve my financial position. Ideally, the type of work I acquire will help me hone my physics chops, but if not, I would do well to keep my eye on the longer term goal.

By contrast, when I was an engineering major, my perspective was such that I should get an internship ASAP, get through my classes ASAP, and continue pushing down an incredibly well-marked path. Physics has taken the markers away from the path and opened up a universe of opportunity for intellectual and personal growth.

As far as what I'm actually interested in WRT the field of physics, I'm still quite a novice. I am intrigued by the concepts of quantum mechanics, gravitation, magnetism, and, well, damn near anything that can be thrown into a physics text book. The advantage to being a physics major is that I will have an opportunity to study more and refine what sort of specialization I'm interested in.

Hopefully this thread is at least a little worthwhile to the new subreddit."

Now my major answers to this question are very selfish. I want a full time permanent position with benefits. I addition, I am doing my part time Masters so they might offer tuition assistance. My current job has very lousy benefits, no vacation, etc. However, I do want to get into the defense sector again and I interviewed at this company three years ago for an internship, but didn't get it.

Is saying that I want stability and get away from temporary employment a bad thing to say for this answer ? Should I ask about tuition assistance ?  I am of course going to add my enthusiasm working for this company since I know a lot about it.

1bwqx4,1,2013-04-08,What to write on resume (CV) with no job experience?,[deleted],Resume,https://www.reddit.com/r/Resume/comments/1bwqx4/what_to_write_on_resume_cv_with_no_job_experience/,"So here's a little background:

* During high school I did work 2 summers in a farm, but nothing complicated and without any legal papers (owner was a friend of family and I was more of a ""extra hands"" guy). **Should I mention that?**

* Next I got bachelors degree, but due to my own laziness and due to rather intense lecture schedule I didn't get job all 3 years of studies. **Should I mention topic of my bachelor's thesis? Should I add summer practice field trips?** I got degree in environmental sciences that why we had this instead of internships.

* And now I'm here, didn't land job immediately after graduating and moved back to my small hometown and been working at parents small company ever since.

[And here is preview](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5WXT8PNEM2kNDcycVByckdfamc/edit?usp=sharing) of my resume. Sorry if there are some grammar and spelling mistakes I translated and edited it quickly for uploading.

So any suggestions? I've been sending variations of this CV (this is final form so far) and I get lucky if I get call about them finding better candidate for the job.

Also I took out my identity number from my resume (not just reddit example) because I didn't feel comfortable sending it to random companies. 

And I'm thinking about taking out my place of residue address because I'm applying for jobs roughly 200km from my hometown (where job market is non existing) and some companies would be discouraged from asking me to interview if I have to move. Would it be ok or address is a must?

I was working in marketing for 10 months as an intern and they fired me for ""not telling them I was leaving for my week-long vacation"" that I actually cleared with them a month beforehand. 

They also cited that I ""left early without notice"" a few weeks before, when I was sick with bronchitis, the flu, and pinkeye, and had to rush home before I couldn't see anything and would have been a danger on the roads.

I was working through a temp agency, and I live in a hire-at-will state, so no unemployment for me. I have a meeting tomorrow with the temp agency to try and find me something else, but I'm doubtful.

In the last few days, I've applied at Best Buy, Target, 2 local restaurants, Gap, Old Navy, Starbucks, and 2 local computer repair companies. My problem is, I am only available after 2 on weekdays (12:30 wednesdays) and all day weekends, because I am currently a senior in high school. I have a feeling this is a big problem for a lot of employers.

I am independent, and have many bills to pay each month, so it's not like I can just relax and hang out for the next few months. I need steady employment ASAP. I am open to working any shitty job I need to for the money.

I am very experienced with computers and consumer electronics, I am great with customer service, and I am a very creative individual who is good at sales. Where should I work/apply, Reddit?"

I really dreaded getting a full time job in Finance, and didn't get along with other people in my major. I did around 25 interviews, and didn't get offered a second interview once. I had always liked computers, but never really considered it a career. But after reading about the job market and the type of work you can do in software development, I started learning programming on the side and considered switching majors.

The guys over at /r/learnprogramming were very helpful, and this subreddit was a good source of motivation. Now, I'm finally getting decent with Java and C, I've made a few simple websites, and I'm in the process of developing an app for Android. I changed my major officially to Computer Science BS last semester, and I have an internship this coming summer as a Software Engineer at a Fortune 500 company.

And finally, with the exception of class projects and small practice exercises I've done, I'm happy to say that I've shipped my first piece of software. It's a Chrome extension called Simple Blocker:
http://simpleblocker.com/

As the name suggests, it is a simple website blocker that lets you block any number of sites to help you concentrate. You can turn on ""Enhanced Blocking"" mode if you like, which will make the app harder to remove, and password protect it. It also has a sleep timer, so you can force yourself to study for an hour or so, then reward yourself with a break. And of course, it's free. 

I thought that it would be well received in this subreddit, since a lot of people have academic or professional goals which require hours of work grinding away on a computer. Hopefully, this app can help some people concentrate and achieve their goals :)

**TL;DR: Was a miserable Finance major a year ago, now I am doing what I love with computers, and have a great internship lined up this summer as a Software Dev. [I also made an app for you guys](http://simpleblocker.com/).**

Thanks, and feedback about the app is much appreciated!"

I have a bachelor's degree in engineering, but it's useless to me. I'll tell you why.


**I can't get a job.**

- I had a low GPA, and I didn't know how valuable experience/internships were so I never got one. This disqualifies me from 90% of recent graduate jobs I see.

- It's been about a year, and I'm starting to hit the ""you must have graduated &lt;8mo or &lt;12mo ago requirement, again preventing me from getting a job.

- Pretty much all other open jobs require years of experience.


I always wanted/planned to go to grad school, so I figured I'd do that if I couldn't find a job.


Well, my low GPA pretty much disqualifies me from most schools. Then I thought about getting a second bachelors in something else. Whelp, turns out most universities don't let you do that.

Now I'm stuck. My current plan is to take community college classes and keep a high GPA to hopefully help me out (either to get into grad school or a second bachelors). 

Anyway... just wanted to let yall know my story so you don't end up like me. Do well, and make sure you get an internship or something over the summer. ***It's the single most important thing you can do.*** My school didn't require it (they should have) and now I'm $60k in debt and accruing more interest than I am able to pay off because I make minimum wage/$1000 a month making fast food."

I started dating this girl during my senior year of high school when she was a junior. The summer before I left for college we really hit it off. We spent almost every day together and things went amazingly. When summer ended, I had to go to my first year of college, but we decided that we would try to make it work long distance. Everything went fine. We talked every night, I came home to see her every 2 or 3 weeks and things were working out fine. Summer came quickly and we soon celebrated our 1 year anniversary. I know that we're young, and probably stupid, but that summer we got really attached. We spent every day and night together besides going to work. We did things apart at times, but we were always together at night to sleep in the same bed. I really fell for this girl. She's the first person I've really been in love with, and I thought it could last forever. Neither of us were perfect, but together we were. I accepted her faults and she accepted mine and we started to talk about our future together. She started to say things about how she wants to marry me when the time is right, and how I'm her soul mate. And instead of running away and getting scared, I embraced it. I loved it. I was thrilled at the prospect of getting to spend the rest of my life with my best friend. Everything was better than I could have ever wanted...I didn't want to go to sleep at nights because no dream could possibly be better than what I was living. And then summer ended...and she went off to college. This is were things get confusing.

She went off to a different school and although it sucked, I never thought we would break up. We did long distance last year, why won't it work this time? The answer to that is because now SHE was in college. She went to school a week before me, and I have to admit I was really clingy that week. I had nothing to do, all my friends had already left for school, and she was off meeting tons on new people. She stopped answering my texts as frequently, and that just made me more clingy, and it was a viscous cycle. I guess being in college, with all these new 'cool' people was a lot to handle and couple that with a clingy long distance boyfriend...something had to give. And our relationship was what took the hit. We broke up. She said that she still loved me, but she didn't want to be held back by a boyfriend in school. She said it wasn't about other guys, but that's what it seemed like to me. So we broke up, and I was devastated, but it gave me some perspective on how much I was asking of her, and it gave me time to calm down. After only about a week, she said that she made I mistake. I took her back, and i made a point to be less in her face. I realized that we had separate lives at school, and as long as we could trust each other there was no reason for us to be talking non stop all the time...we had to experience college on our own. So we were back together, I saw her at school a few times and then winter break came.  We seemed to be right back to where we were in the summer. Spending every night together, talking about our futures and getting married again. Everything was perfect and then before you know it, we're going back to school again. I was worried that we would have a repeat of the beginning of last semester and that was really on my mind, but we pushed forward and everything seemed to be good for a few weeks.  And then, guess what happened? The same FUCKING thing. She wanted to break up again, same story as last time. She still really loves me, and all that stuff, but she feels like being in a relationship would be holding her back. This all came at a time when she was planning for a study abroad session, and internship in Washington D.C for next semester on top of pledging a sorority so, I think this was a decision that came out of stress. I believe that she still loves me, but she had 1 too many things on her plate...and since I was the only thing that wasn't in front of her at the time, I was what got kicked to the curb. After a year and a half I'm not saying I'm not bitter about it, idk how she can go from saying that I'm her soul mate to wanting to break up in a matter of 2 weeks, but she's screwed up in the head. I've come to know that and I love her despite it. I take her for the good and bad. And that's why it's so frustrating. When we're home together, there is no bad, there are NO issues...and then we just break up seemingly out of the blue as soon as we're a few hundred miles apart....sorry I'm rambling, anyway, back to the situation. After we broke up this time, we stayed nc for 2 months, and then I saw her last weekend. 

Last weekend I went to her house to see her. We were going to talk about where we were with the breakup. After a few months, it got easier, but it was still surreal thinking that we weren't together. So we talked, and she just got really into her sorority after we broke up. They keep her up til 6am every night, and besides that and studying there wasn't really any time to think about me. But that all changed when I went to see her. We basically both admitted that we still had the feelings for each other, but she was still adamant that a relationship in college would hold her back, but we decided to make a compromise. We both want to be together when we're home so that's what we're going to do. We never had any issues when we were home, and I don't see that changing. As far as school goes. We won't technically be together. We'll be friends, and check in occasionally, and we'll still be there for each other if the other person needs to vent, or talk or misses the other person etc. But we won't be in communications as much as we used to be when we were dating. And this was the hardest part for me to agree to, but we won't be exclusive at school. I've gotten to the point where I'm okay with this, especially since I've taken advantage of it a few times already, but she can be with other people at school, the only rule there was that it would only be physical...basically making sure I'm not being replaced and vice versa. 

So my issue is basically that I just really miss her right now. If we were dating, I'd only have to go another week or 2 without seeing her, and because of this arrangement, it'll probably be 5. I feel like since we aren't dating, since she wants her space at school, there are somethings I can't ask her. I can't text her every day, I can't hear her voice every day, and I can't ask if I can come down to see her, I feel like that would be a little weird. I want to be with her as much as I can, and once the summer comes, everything will be fine, but getting to that point is going to be tough. It'll take some getting used to, I just hope I can do it. I see a future with this girl. Whether I'm insane, or just holding onto somebody that she used to be I don't know, but I still want to be with her for the rest of my life. That's why I'm trying to hard to  make this work. I'm putting so much into this, for little output from her. But I've accepted that. I love her for her best and worst qualities. At home, I get nothing but the best, and at school, right now...I'm getting some of the worst. "
1bw80c,0,2013-04-07,Advice to save money?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1bw80c/advice_to_save_money/,"I've read through a lot of /r/frugal on some tips to save money, but I felt many tips didn't apply to me since they were mostly about saving money on food. I'll give you a synopsis of my finances.


I'm very fortunate to come from a pretty well-off family. Not insanely rich, but we can always afford what we need and what we want, but my parents are fairly frugal, which I don't think I really picked up on. I received about $4k after graduating high school, and put $2k in savings. I mow lawns in the summer to earn some money (maybe $100 per week). I went off to a good college, and will graduate with little debt (maybe about $10k in federal loans). I've always lived on campus and have a meal plan so I don't really need to worry about housing or food. I had an internship last summer and I earned about $4k, which I put $2k in my savings. I also received $2k as a gift, so as of fall 2012 I was at $4k in savings and $1500 in checking. Fast forward to now, and I'm at $2.9k in savings and $300 in checking. I should have SO much more money than I do. I'll try to think of how I spend my money so you guys could help me out:



-Going to Red Wing games (maybe 2 or 3 a year)

-Video games (about $300 a year, and I just bought a $250 headset)

-Going out to eat (my girlfriend of 4 years is fairly poor so I usually pay whenever we eat)

-Gas (car only gets about 13mpg but I don't drive too much)



I know I should have a lot more money than I do, but I really don't know the best way for me to go about saving money or being more frugal. I don't spend crazy amounts of money on dumb stuff. I'm also a college athlete so other than the $20 a week I make as a TA I can't get a part-time job. I've also always wondered how much money I should save, and for how long. Sorry for all the confusion, I just think that me writing all of this out will help explain. Thanks for any and all help!

TL;DR I should have ~$6k but I only have about $3.5k. Need help saving money or being more frugal.

**EDIT:** Thanks for all the help guys. I've realized that the biggest thing I need is to set a budget that I can live on, and really keep track of where every cent goes. Sorry if I sounded pretentious or anything, but I was really stressing out about this. I'm going to use PearBudget, which can be found [here](http://financialsoft.about.com/od/morefinancialsoftware/gr/PearBudget.htm).

I have a pretty good fallback plan (McGill, Canadian citizen but US resident) but I want to know the chances of me getting into a top tier school. By top tier I mean schools higher than the Duke, JHU, and Cornell tier of schools.   

My GPA right now is only a 3.70/4.56 due to a bad sophomore year. If everything pans out I should have around a 3.80 by application time. Class rank unknown as our school won't disclose it unless you need it for scholarships. My SAT is a 2400 (first try), no SAT 2s yet but I plan on taking Math 2 and Chemistry. (Not to sound arrogant but I expect to get 800s in both)  

I've taken 2 AP exams so far (Comp sci and Chinese(self study),  both 5s). This year I'm planning on taking Chemistry, Calc BC, English Language, US History, Macro economics, and Micro economics. (Again, I don't want to sound arrogant but our school prepares us for the exams very well and the vast majority of students get 5s so I expect to get 5s in all, I might get a 4 in macro/micro).

My high school is a very competitive public high school in NJ. We were ranked something like 11th in the nation for STEM fields and were pretty much the only non-magnet school in the top 50. Our average SAT was around 1900. There are a lot of very smart kids (5 kids so far have a 2400 and a lot have 2300+) and the teachers do expect a lot more out of the students than normal.    

For extra curricular activities I've been on varsity swimming for 4 years and will be captain next year. I did some assorted clubs my first two years but I didn't really like them so I've shifted to more out of school things. I'm currently an editor for an English language column in a local Chinese newspaper. Last summer I worked as a lifeguard and this summer I have a research internship at Rutgers University in biochemistry under a professor there. Throughout freshman and sophomore years I volunteered at the Chinese school doing mostly clerical work. I might also be able to volunteer at the American Cancer Society doing patient screening. I also represented NJ at the National Geographic Bee in 8th grade but I'm not sure that still has any bearing.

(Cues ""Hi Amanda!"")

I know, it sounds fun, right? Well... not really. Not very much at all. I'm on the last ""quarter"" of my sophomore year in college.. and currently, everything sucks.

I lived my whole life dedicating myself to work, promising that once I get to college, everything will be okay and I can introduce myself in a whole new light. I could make new friends with people I closely relate myself to. Except, right now, I'm very much alone. My only friends out there is my boyfriend, who lives 2,000 miles away from home, my parents, and a group of friends who are in a group that I lead for my HCI class.

All my old friends from high school, including my best friend, have slowly parted with me because my college is two hours away from home. The friends I made here the first couple weeks are now continuously flirting with me and I don't want to talk to them, turned into complete assholes and talked behind my back or are about to leave the major in the next few weeks.

Along with that, all my creativity that I've lived off of and constantly dwelled in is fading away. I have no motivation to play any instruments, I'm too hard on myself to sing anymore, and all the time I want to spend writing, drawing, singing, dancing, acting is spent behind a monitor. It sucks even more that I'm not really that good in what I'm doing in the first place. I'm supposed to do a required internship this summer and I can't even get into that because I can't do math to save the life of me, all the jobs are either full-time, above my standards, too far for me to make the move, or are already filled. 

My programming skills are ""meh"", but they're not anything compared to the other peers in my classes. I can do a lot of art for games and stuff, and that's why most groups want me in their groups, but when I go for Game Art/Technical Artist/Animator/Storyboard jobs, they won't accept me either, because I'm not an art major.

There is nothing to do in this town and it doesn't help that I don't even have the time to get my driver's license. Nobody ever really wants to take me out and go places or whatnot, and when I'm home for some weekends, I'm just boxed up in my room because there's nothing to do back home either. The only thing I can do in between my homework is watch youtube videos, make care packages for my boyfriend, talk to my boyfriend and his parents, and talk to my parents.

This is a major I've wanted since I was a little girl, but now, it's killing me inside. I've never felt so alone in my life and I just wish I already got my job and I'm away from this shithole so I can live with my boyfriend and actually do something amazing with my life.

**TL;DR: I'm in the game design major and it's made me alone, a reject and everything sucks.**"

I've always had an annoying amount of potential (annoying because I can never seem to put it together).  It'll seem like I can do alright, but I always end up screwing up somehow.  The last two years of my life have gotten progressively shittier.  My fiance left me and is now with a former best friend (probably better off for her, even though he's kind of a dick he's at least got his shit together) and ever since I have not been able to do more than barely get by.  I had gone back to grad school to be an elementary teacher and was just able to pull myself through.  My first year teaching has been a disaster.  I can't do the things I need to do to be successful.  I've had a tough class in a tough school, but there's so much more I could have done.  And now I find out that my school doesn't want me back - they can't fire me b/c they lack the paperwork (crazy admin turnover all year, not for bad reasons just kinda happened to be happening) but basically told me my name is mud in the county I work in.  Every little mistake I make right now just has me feeling ashamed and miserable.

I've always been absent-minded, forgetting things here and there and occasionally they have been things that have bitten me in the ass.  I'm starting to realize that I am 28 and incapable of handling a real, adult job.  I'm starting to think I am not fixable.

I am socially awkward - I can't maintain friendships for more than a few years (with one or two exceptions), and even then I never feel comfortable opening up to people - I hate being a burden on others.  Which is probably why I'm not dead yet.  I get that killing myself is hard on those who remain, and I haven't yet hit the point where my current misery outweighs their future misery.

There are things I enjoy, but nothing I am truly good at or able to turn into a career (my first degree was in music, a former passion of mine.  I was too inept in the music industry to do more than complete my internship and never actually got a job).

Increasingly, I find myself just wanting to sit in bed and do nothing because of how miserable I am.  I have been writing suicide notes in my mind (nothing physically written yet) and been contemplating ways to die that would be relatively painless and lack mess (again, some kind of empathy for those who have to clean up my shit when I die).

I guess what I'm saying is, I'm scared, lonely, and trust no one in my life right now enough to tell them I'm becoming suicidal.  Only about 3 people (none my ""close"" friends) know how bad my job situation is.  I have no idea how this has a happy ending, and even though I'm trying to see a light at the end of the tunnel, I just....I'm starting to think there isn't one...."

In the past year, however, I began volunteering for a children's hospital nutrition program working with pediatric dietitians, and at the same time my upper level coursework has reminded me how interesting my major is and how much I really do want to become a dietitian.

I shouldn't be unhappy. I'm a year away from graduating college, I just got an internship at Disney World, and I have a decent life -- I have a husband who loves me, I have a sweet puppy who gives me puppy kisses, and I'm in decent health.

However, I have depression. I was diagnosed with it two years ago, and it's been a struggle to get doctors who don't mind prescribing Prozac without making some stupid comment. The doctors on campus don't want to give me a refill until I submit to bloodwork that I can't afford. Insurance would cover it, but I'd have to pay now and be billed later, and I honestly cannot afford that right now. When I went to ask for a refill, my doctor said ""Well, you seem like you're doing okay without the Prozac. Do you really still need it?""

Yes. Yes, I still need it. It's been three years since I cut myself but without Prozac I keep thinking about it more and more. Prozac actually works for me and makes me feel human, and when I'm on it I'm not such a total asshole. I know I'm irritable and difficult without it, and that makes me feel like shit. 

So the doctor gave me a 30-day prescription. That was three months ago. I've been off of Prozac for two months and I feel like I'm slipping back to where I was before I started medication. Back to self-harm and suicidal ideation, back to never feeling good enough, back to failure.

I've found it impossible to get out of bed in the morning. I haven't gone to class in a month. I'm hoping that if I can manage to get an appointment with a psychiatrist on campus that he or she can help me take an Incomplete in my classes instead of an F.

1. Was accepting the Co-op invitiation a good choice. I know that it means I dont get summers but I feel it would be a great experence that would look attractive on a CV.

2. How exactly does the Co-op work? Does the Co-op program find interships for me or do I have to find internships? Also, what can I expect to be doing for these internships and what kind of weekly schedule am I signing myself up for?

3. Are tutorials mandatory? I'm currently a CEGEP student and all tutorials are optional. I usually only going prior to a test for some extra help, but they arent a weekly scheduled time for each class, like it seems to be here. So I'm tempted to believe they are somewhat mandatory. 

4. Is it normal that I was unable to get a day off in my first semester? Will this also be the case for every semester?

I guess my question is: what's the catch? It seems too good to be true. Am I missing something here? Or is the apartment market just that good down there right now?

Edit: also, is there any other good places that I should be looking for in the Atlanta area? I lived in Tucker with my aunt and uncle last year so I feel like I was lucky to live in a good neighborhood. I don't really know where to avoid.

If possible, I'd like to max out my account every year. So at least 3-5k every year. 

Which IRA should I take? Traditional, or ROTH? I don't think my future job would have an option for a 401k account, but if it does, I'll try and contribute to both.

1c0iwh,86,2013-04-09,Here is a list of things I have tried before I knew I had ADHD,guy14,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1c0iwh/here_is_a_list_of_things_i_have_tried_before_i/,"Hello! This is a list of things I have tried to better my life with little to no success, before realizing it was ADHD. They are in the order that I have tried them, this has been an over-a-year-long process.

==

1. **Excersize**. - I was out of shape. So, I figured if I lost the weight, I would become smarter and have more vigor. After three weeks of P90X, I started feeling a bit more active and energetic, but that went away. Soon, the workouts became boring and I had to trudge through them just to stay active the whole hour.

2. **Eating super healthy foods**. I like doing keto, as carb-full foods put me to sleep and send me further down into a fog. I ate a salad full of greens and vegetables one day and realized just how energetic I was that day and thought it was my diet that was the problem. So I started eating tons of vegetables and tried to get all the nutrients I needed from supplements and any kind of source I could get my hands on..

3. **/r/nofap** - What a load of bull. Literally no effect.

4. **Chicken livers**. - Sometimes anemia will put people into a fog. I thought I had low iron in my blood, so I took to eating livers and iron-rich foods. Again, I felt better, but that wore off after a day or two.

5. **Ketosis** itself. - Still thinking it was my diet, I went into full ketosis one day and felt great for the next few days, I thought I was cured, because the feelgood period lasted quite a while (5 days). Then, it wore off again.

6. **Self-diagnosis** - ""Man, something is wrong! Why do I feel good on some days, but feel like crap most days? Let's google this shit! ... okay, *depression symptoms*... oh my god, I have depression! I didn't feel sad... well maybe I do... but I don't feel suicidal."" Later on, ""hmm, I go through 'periods' of good and bad, like a wave. Let's... *bipolar symptoms*. Oh my god, I have bipolarism! This explains everything!""

6. **Counceling** - At my college, they offer counseling for free, it's basically a therapist without the PHD and drugs. I saw this girl about 4 times and had trouble even explaining everything to me, I felt very uncomfortable and I felt like she had no clue what she was doing. She was an intern.

7. **B12** - I can really see the relationship between having energy and being happy/able to focus. B12 vitamins had no noticeable effect.

8. **Meditation** - This actually helped with my negative self-thought, depressed symptoms. But I do not have more energy.

9. **[Breathing exersizer](http://www.amazon.com/Ultrabreathe-ASI7492-Compact-Breathing-Exerciser/dp/B0000E2PBX/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365539345&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=breath+exerciser).** - Around the time I started using one a few times a day, I noticed feeling better, but I have lost the damn thing. I will get one again and see if anything improves. Breathing heavily for a minute or so seems to have a calming effect.

10. **Coffee** - this is the only thing that has any kind of effect, but it's very finicky, some days it doesn't want to work for me.

11. **Finally finding out** - ""Ugh, I don't even know what to do at this point, I guess I'll go to reddit, yeah /r/all. Oh, what's this? A /r/bestof post of somebody explaining what ADHD feels like? Sure I'll bite, I like getting other people's perspectives. Whoa, I feel like that, whoa, that too... whoa, and that. I thought this was a fake disorder?"" Then I found this subreddit and some of the videos explaining in detail what ADHD is. Holy crap! This is crazy.

12. **Doctors** - 

Me: Hi, I'd like to get tested for ADHD.
Doctor: You don't have ADHD, you'd be bouncing around the walls.
Me.... *cry* sorry I'll go now...

Then I found a different doctor who actually knows what she's talking about, and did not belittle me or feeling the way I do.

**EDIT**: You guys are pretty cool. Of all the subreddits that have ever subbed reddit. This one has subreddited the most."

1c0hii,3,2013-04-09,Internship question,VanBurenOG,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/1c0hii/internship_question/,"I have 2 possible internships available as a 1L coming off of my first year. 

Option 1: Intern at local DA's office.

Option 2: Intern out of state for the GC of a very large, well known corporation.

I have no interest in criminal law, and option 2 seems like a good opportunity. That being said, since option 2 is out of state, it will cost a little money to do (unpaid, obviously)

My question is ultimately, how important is landing an ""impressive"" internship after 1 year of law school in terms of a resume?


I ask this knowing people put a lot of stock in unimportant things that won't help their careers, myself probably included.

1c0h6m,4,2013-04-09,Internship Interview Process,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1c0h6m/internship_interview_process/,"In my recent technical phone interviews, I noticed that interviewers abruptly ended the interview while I'm answering questions. Sometimes, I get the impression that the interviewer is getting impatient with my struggle to solve the problem and concluded that I'm not a good fit for the company. Will I have a strong chance of landing an internship? Also, who judges whether you will land an internship? I heard that the interviewer just submits a feedback and the recruiter chooses the candidate based on the feedback report. Is this true?"

I'm technically a junior in college, but having switched my major last semester I've still got quite a few cs classes left to complete.  As it stands right now I'm having a hard time finding an internship that I'm qualified for in CS.  I'm taking classes this summer to catch me up to speed on the math side of things.

I wanted to know if taking a job at my universities help desk would look bad on a resume compared to an internship.  Obviously something is better than nothing, but is internship better than help desk?"
1c0gqk,80,2013-04-09,Always delete your history before you give ANYTHING to a technician,Eljack0558,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1c0gqk/always_delete_your_history_before_you_give/,"So I work at a University as a 1st level support technician. It's a fairly easy job password resets and that, sometimes it can get hairy. This isn't one of those times but I thought I'd share.

So we had  big event on today where a bunch of important people required Wi-Fi and if they needed help everything had to be dropped so we could go save the day.

A call arrived where someone needed help connecting to the Wi-Fi, I thought sure I'll go down I want to see what's going on and I was in a good mood.

So I arrive at where they're hosting the event and I am pointed to a guy who needs help. He looks young 25-30 possibly an intern he's all suited and booted. He wants to connect to twitter so he can post some PR stuff. He's clean shaven and looks vey smart.

He wants me to connect his macbook to the Wi-Fi, sure that's easy I'll do that now. I see he's already connected to the Wi-Fi so it's likely he's unable to reach the login portal which is a common problem. I go ahead and test Chrome and type something random into the address bar at the top to test to see if he can reach any webpage. I just type something random like 'jasiossdk'

When I do that a webpage suggestion pops up.

It's to a porn site. This normally doesn't bother me it's just porn, however this wasn't just any porn this site was called jailbaitgirls.com

The guy was right next to me when the suggestion popped up and I felt him twitch when that popped up. I quickly got rid of it and connected him to the Wi-Fi and went about my day. Unsure if I should have reported him or not.

TL;DR guy likes jailbait doesn't delete history

1c0dt0,1,2013-04-09,Computer Engineer: Game Programmer?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1c0dt0/computer_engineer_game_programmer/,"Hello! I posted this question to /r/gamedev and a user directed me here, so let's give this a shot.

I'm a Computer Engineering major at a well-known Engineering school and I am going to graduate in December. A few months ago I had a bit of a dramatic realization: I will probably be miserable with a career in Engineering. I'd known this in the back of my mind for a while at this point because I'd done a couple internships which I could feel slowly draining my soul over the course of three semesters. More recently however, I've come to embrace that Game Development is what would really make me happy and I'm willing to sacrifice the job security that Computer Engineering offers to pursue it.

Since this realization I have spent months teaching myself how to use Unity3D and program in C# in what little free time my schoolwork allows. I've applied to countless game programming internships but haven't heard back from any of them in months. It's pretty disheartening, but I don't have any solid game development programming yet so I can't say I'm surprised. To help gain such experience, I joined my college's Video Game Development club and have gotten my name on a few games that will be finished within a month. I've really enjoyed working on teams and the fact that the work I've done never really *felt* like work has confirmed for me that game programming is definitely my passion and not just a hobby like I'd previously assumed. I'm considering leading a project in the Fall, because that sounds amazingly fun.

Anyway, before this post gets much longer allow me to get to the point. My GPA is high enough for me to qualify for the BS/MS joint degree program for Electrical and Computer Engineering, meaning I could get my Masters in Computer Engineering in one additional year. I have been told that I can get a Minor in CS along with my Masters and that the CS department offers some graduate game programming classes that I could take (even some that teach Unity3D). This is all great, but I can't help but think that perhaps a Masters in Computer Science would be more appropriate. I worry that a Masters in ECE will not serve me well in finding Game Development jobs in the future. Tuition is expensive, though, so that is something I should definitely keep in mind.

Then again, maybe all that matters is that I make lots of games and expand my portfolio. I just don't know.

Can anyone provide any advice as to what I should do? It's the biggest decision facing me right now and my academic advisors have really been unable to help me with my specific situation. I can't really blame them as it is a bit out of the ordinary. I'd love to hear what someone with experience in the gaming industry has to say!

Thanks, everybody!

**TL;DR:** I'm a Computer Engineering undergrad who realized recently that he wants to program games for a living. I am graduating in December and have to decide between pursuing a 1-year ECE Masters with a minor in CS or a 2-year CS Masters. Which path should I choose and what actions should I take in order to improve my chances of being hired in the game industry?"
1c0dbb,0,2013-04-09,Aspiring Booking Agent,philw7,LetsTalkMusic,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1c0dbb/aspiring_booking_agent/,"I am a 21 year old college student who is graduating this spring. My dream is to work in the music industry and up until this point I didn't know in which sector. I finally realized that I want to become a music agent. I do not plan on going to law school knowing that its a common myth that you have to go to become a booking agent. I have a decent resume that includes working for a huge promotion company, giving me knowledge of offers, contracts, and just booking in general. Also I have worked at a top venue in production so I know about riders, tech, and just touring in general. My question is what is the next step? How do I got about becoming an agent? Should I try and intern this summer at an agency?"
1c0cw3,0,2013-04-09,"Can someone explain what's ""HD"" about ""AoE II: HD""? The latest hyped debacle?",top5a,aoe2,https://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1c0cw3/can_someone_explain_whats_hd_about_aoe_ii_hd_the/,"That feeling.  I know there's a good chance that you know what I'm talking about if you were insatiably excited when a refreshed AoE II was announced.  And, perhaps, when you even pre-ordered the game.  Fast forward a few months.  Do you feel fulfilled?

Now, AoE II: HD (from now on referred to as AOEHD) has been released, and...  you may be asking yourself.. what are the pros and cons between AOEHD and the original?  Can you justifiably rationalize that ~$20 purchase?  What's different between firing up your old copy of AoE II (with the Conquerors, or Forgotten Empires, etc.), and playing with some friends over Hamachi or Tunngle (along with the now famous 1.0e patch)?

Well, when I made my pre-order, two things came to mind.

1.)  Steam multiplayer matchmaking.  No more sitting in lobbies and IRC threads waiting for a scrim (let alone finding a somewhat balanced group).  Friends list on Steam, and the prospects of auto-matchmaking groups/singles, which, in my opinion, has similarly been a saving grace for CS:GO.  Some sort of modified ""ELO"" or ladder system.

2.)  Workshop.  No more downloading, extracting, and replacing game files.  Not that this is difficult, per se, but, remember when you had to attempt to get your friends to download the same map, from the same site, only to find out that they had the incorrect version of the file?  Or, maybe they didn't have the correct patch?  Steam naturally fixes these issues through constant updates, along with the ability to download and install/uninstall mods with a single click.

Notice that there is no point 3 for compatibility in this list.  Why not?  Because, afaict through my own experience, as well as those of friends who play the game, AoE II, with the 1.0e patch, works quite well in Windows 7.  This famous patch, which has been out for years and years, also added improved TCP/IP support, which works as well.

So, what is AOEHD like for me (and, judging by other threads on here, as well as a significant portion of AOEHD players in the official Steam forums)?

Abysmal **framerates**.  Less than 10fps after only several minutes of play.  How an RTS game from the 90s -- that's right, the 90s -- is so infinitely choppy on a modern machine is beyond me.  OK, I'm a programmer, and I admit that I realize there are apparently some architectural changes with regard to how the sprites and textures are being processed.  But, if I'm able to blow SC2, in all its 3D glory, out of the water, there's no excuse as to why AOEHD should be choppy.  One might argue that, well, it's supposed to be nostalgic, and that animations of the sprites were kept at the same pacing with the same frames.  Sure, no problem.  But, why does that mean, when I scroll across the screen, even this simple operation of moving the viewable window /completely/ chugs.  Or, that when more than a handful of sprites are present on the screen, the game is rendered almost unplayable.  But, alas, here's the real issue.... these problems, at least for me and those to whom I have spoken, /do not exist in the original AoE II/ !  So, in effect, AOEHD is far **worse**, in this regard, to the pre-existing product it is supposed to supplant!

**Networking**.  TCP/IP has already been included in the old AoE II, at least with the expansions and/or 1.0e patch.  I am easily able to play online with friends, with very low pings.  If I am in the middle of a game, and something happens with the network, a turtle or rabbit will appear next to the player name, indicating network issues.  If things get really messed up, everyone knows that familiar ""Waiting for Player"" message which occurs (same thing in any other modern RTS game...), whilst the game states synchronize.  Sometimes you have to wait for a second or two... big deal.  Play continues.  What happens now?  I've attempted three 1v1 matches online.  Approximately five minutes into each of these games, the game will dump me to the title screen, complaining of an Out of Sync error.  There was no Waiting for Player.  The game just saves the current state, and exits.  If the state is able to be saved, why doesn't the game just ""wait"" until resync?  Instead, I'm forced to attempt to remake a lobby and hope that the random other person will join.... yea, this never works (probably because both of us are doing this..).  There's no easy way to reconnect... but, if the gamestate can be saved into a resumable state, /why does it exit in the first place/?  This makes absolutely **no logical sense whatsoever** to me.

A side note about the networking... depending on the type of game I select from the quick match menu, the entire AOEHD application will crash out.  If I select Random Map, it's usually ok.  But any other mode, complete crash.  Who coded this?  I can't even imagine how terrible the exception handling is such that, by selecting an option prior to attempting to search a lobby, a complete application crash will be consistently reached.  Was there literally zero testing of this game?  But, I digress.

Now, let's assume that the framerate, networking, and crashing bugs didn't exist.  What are we left with?  Surely, there must be a little extra assumed in ""HD"" releases of games?  I don't expect much -- after all, I realize the nostalgic factor for which the devs (or single intern dev, I should say, because I'd hate to believe more than a single intern worked on this release, judging by its almost comically shoddy quality [I'd laugh more if they didn't have $20 from me]) may be striving.  But... come on.  Really?  The color of the fire is different.  The steak icon for food was replaced by.. some goldish thing I can't quite discern on my 1920x1200 monitor.  There are giant yellow maize blobs on the farms.  How about the opening menu?  Maybe some cool effects?  Or, at least, a, should a say, ""HD"" version of the old menu?  Nope.  Simply a grossly enlarged and blurry version of the original.  No ""crispening.""  Just enlarged, blurry, /exactly/ the same.  I'm not expecting something like realMYST, but perhaps the option to enable, for example, a non-blurry game menu would be nice.

So, I ask you, the community, what is ""HD"" about this game?  What, even, is this game?  AOEHD can't even replicate working functionality from its alleged predecessor, let alone brings nothing new to the table except for a /few/ color swatch changes.

Lastly, what are the meta-implications of this type of a release?  ""release to the community and let them fix it?""  This is somewhat plausible, given the somewhat commendable cycle of patches to games released on Steam (yes I know Steam is just the distributor, but, you know what I mean).  But, not to this extent.  It appears as though almost zero testing, let alone beta testing, was performed.  On a game that **lost significant functionality**.

Thoughts?  I don't want this to seem just like a rant -- I'd rather it can be a discussion of what we, as a diverse group of gamers, expect from our ""HD"" re-releases.  And what went so terribly wrong with AOEHD.  Or, even if you disagree with me completely :P

A little background about the curent situation:
We have a pc I put together way back around christmas 2011 in the companies old office (the company being about 6 people other than me). This pc was to serve as a combined fileserver for backups (via time-machine for the most part as the office loves OSX over Windows), workstation for certain windows only software, and, if possible, create a VPN since employees often go to meetings in other cities.

The specs of the pc are irrelevant as I intend to relegate it to just a workstation now. I had it do all that by running a FreeNas VM for the time-machine backups, several HDDs in RAID (1) storing the backups, and a gigabit line linking it into the network, which was comprised of a cisco linksys router. Creating a VPN or FTP server was impossible as far as I could tell because the office building our office was leased from did not itself allow these services and blocked anything like it :( .

Now, over a year later, we are moving to a much larger office and are expected to grow to, within reason, to about 25 employees for the duration of our stay there. And I need to set up a whole new network. 

Sorry for the wall of text, I appreciate any help that can be given, and I will study any materials that can be provided. Now onto what I think the new setup should have.

Rack of at least 25U

Router.
Firewall.
VPN for outside connections so that office user files can be accessed.
Fileserver for backups and storage.
(I space these like this because they can be combined, I am inexperienced with rack-mounted equipment so I am asking for recommendations of any kind.)

Backup capabilities with time machine and windows.

A business internet line from Verizon is looking to be the most likely, if that affects anything, such as modems.

Sorry if I am way out of my league, but I have experience with all three major operating systems (more so OSX and Windows, but some on Linux as well), and manage my school's website (taking over this job right now actually). I also have experience with C++ and Java. 

Thanks for any and all assistance that can be provided, components, sites, vendors, tutorials, anything.

So, finally, Reddit, I beg of thee, hear my plee and assist.
sincerely, 
      -port274

edit 1: grammer mistakes.

edit 2: Outside consultant is not really possible, its just not high enough on the priority list to bother. To give you an idea we were using building wifi for a while, and my system was only really there for centralized backups. (small edit: Its main reason for being implemented was for backups)

Budget wise the cap is not really set in stone, under $5,000 would be a good starting point. To give an outline of the office, everyone either uses a iMac, Macbook(Pro), both, and the odd windows laptop and of course the workstation/server I put together before. Up to 20-25 people would be working in this office, not counting conference room users, who would have a direct ethernet line available to a router/switch that would be connected to the fileserver, where, if possible, Timemachine would back up their respective machines. Each employee is, more the most part, independent and often the laptops leave the office (security risks I know, but its not something I can affect), so an additional security measure here would be a good idea if I were to say so myself, perhaps another firewall? Beyond that a VPN solution would be nice to allow for the employee's security as well as to provide them access to their files incase they forget a presentation on their iMac when they took their laptops to the meeting. I can also provide a rough layout of the office taken from a top down drawing if that helps. 

anything other information that can be helpful please ask in the comments.

Thank you for any help you can provide

I am an intern working on the revision of the Prudential Center website's user experience (prucenter.com), and am having what I imagine is a novice issue, but I am stumped.  


The revised site (in progress) can be found at dev1.prucenter.com. I am using the CSS4K2 plugin to create a special CSS file for this subdomain (http://dev1.prucenter.com/premium-seating/suites/single-event-suites), and thus far have changed the default font and background.


However, as you can see using the Chrome inspector, all h3 text is super dark and unreadable. To fix this, my boss would like the center content column to have a white background, so you can still see the patterned background behind it.  I am unsure of where to find the corresponding code, and whether or not it is in the main site's CSS or the overrride (or both :x )

I also had more stress. I told myself when I started smoking that I would never become dependent on it, for any reason. I had a wake up call halfway through the year when I started dealing to my stoner friends in order to cover the amount of money I was spending on pot.  I was, and still ashamed that I was doing this, and quit selling shortly before I came back for my second semester. I still had a problem where I was smoking too much and was using it to relieve all my school-related anxiety.  I would carve out the most random, and worst times to smoke so that I could cope with all my school, work, and stress.

Fast forward to spring break: I smoked on spring break with a lot of my old friends from back home, and had a great time. However, the last night I was there, none of my friends were getting back to me, I was feeling down and anxious about school yet again, and stayed up real late so that I could smoke on my back porch like I used to. (I have to tip-toe around my parents)

It was during this smoke sesh that I had little epiphany, I was dependent. I was doing what I had told myself and all my concerned (and apparently right) friends all along. I was using weed to cope and escape. I was not smoking to have a good time, nor was I even having fun with it anymore. I was bored, dependent, and done.

I downloaded a little app onto my Droid phone the next morning, and started keeping track of the days. I've been clean since then, and things are really looking up. I even got an internship at an Air Force base as a research intern for this summer, and it is somewhat difficult for freshmen to get internships (at least as engineering students).

If you're trying to quit, take a minute and just be honest with yourself. Sometimes its so hard to be true to yourself, and hold yourself to your own promises, but when you're trying to quit, that's the only way to do things. Good luck!

tldr:I quit because I realized I was dependent on it, which is something I promised myself I would never be. If you're honest with yourself, you can do it, I promise:)

Then at age 17 when I started traveling my entire prospective change. I have travel large portions of the US (38 states) been to most North America countries with the exception of a few Central American counties and two Caribbean (Cuba and Haiti). While I like these places I still value my 
American life over the ones I visited. 

Then I turned 20 and was accepted in an internship exchange program that allowed me to stay in Belgium for six months and tour the rest of western European in my free time. While over there because I stayed with an exchange family that spoke little English I was force to learn their language and culture. I was blown away. Not only did I become fond to their culture but I started to resent my own in favor of theirs. And as I traveled to other western European countries and experience more their culture, my resentment grew larger and larger. It was a feeling similar to when you first earned your licenses or started college; it was like I liberated from an invisible cage. When my six months was up I dreaded coming back to the states. The only thing I look forwarded to seeing was my family and friends as they were the only things I miss. 

Here I was in a country that I can drink before 21 and outside, people viewed me only as an American not my race (I’m mix), all my healthcare needs were met without paying a dime (I can only speak about Belgium but their medical staff interaction with me was by far the best service I ever receive), viewed news program that actually reported on news and not entertainment, lose weight while consuming more food (the food tasted better and was more healthy), didn’t need a car because of the public transportation, etc. I think you get the Idea I could go in and on. I understand they pay more in taxes but the services receive is worth it so I would gladly pay them. Since then I’ve made it a point to travel to 
Europe every year. 

Every time I go I get more and more depress to leave. I’ve been actively pursuing citizenship in Belgium and the UK and might get approve for a work Visa for one but it’s been long hard drawn-out process. Because I had to take care of myself in the mean time I have built up quite a life here in the states. I have a good paying job (engineer) with lots of room for advancement, invested money wisely and have a pretty decent portfolio, and a few business connections. The thing is though; if I’m approve for the work visa for either countries I would probably leave everything at a drop of a dime, go aboard until I eligible for citizenship, and then permanently move over there.  It may be hard to convince me the US is better but can anybody give arguments about why I should stay in the US and not go to Europe.         "

I'm 23 and graduated with a BS in Materials Science and Engineering roughly 2 years ago.  Since then, I worked at a titanium mill, first as an Metallurgy intern (9 months) and then full-time as a Process Metallurgist (13 months).

As a Process Metallurgist, I helped develop the process routes for two new product lines and have them qualified by customers.  I also started and ran a couple projects that saved roughly $300k and will save another $400k over the next year.

About a week and a half ago, I was laid off.  I thought I'd be upset, but I just haven't been.  It's occurred to me that I didn't really like that job all that much, and that's why I haven't been too broken up about losing it.

While the work was cool and interesting at times, it seemed like there was a lot of resistance to anything new and different.  Really, in anything I tried to do to possibly make things better, I encountered a lot of inertia.  Granted, this may have been just the company I worked for, but before I got the full-time position, I interviewed at a few steel mills and they seemed to only want to ""fill in their ranks"" and do the same thing they've more or less always been doing.

In my last job, I really enjoyed the process development and manufacturing engineering aspects, so I think I'd like to do something like that but within the energy industry since it seems to be undergoing a lot of innovation right now.  I don't really want to work in the oil, gas, etc. industry for various reasons.

I don't think I'd enjoy going back to school to get my Master's, so I'd like to avoid that, if I could...

Does anyone have any advice on how I can move into the (non-fossil fuel) energy industry with a focus on process and manufacturing engineering? "

Specifically I want to work with my hands a bit and travel a lot. I'm looking for some advice on what my next step should be. Should I look into another degree? (But then I would have more loans to pile on.) Is there anything within these fields that maybe could utilize my current degree? Thank you, in advance,  for all your help redditors.

TL;DR- Soon to be graduate in need of advice for the next step to take after basically wasting four years of college on a degree I'm no longer interested in. Would like to travel and work with my hands without having this enormous pile of loans hanging over my head for the rest of my life."

Hit me with your best.",[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1bzy1k/reddit_its_already_been_a_tough_year_i_lost_three/,"Reddit, back in the fall, I moved out to what I thought was my dream city for a dream internship. After several years being stuck in a small town because of limited money or means, I jumped at the opportunity as soon as I could. The internship allowed me to talk ato nd work with so many of my heroes, listen to their ideas, and generally afforded me opportunities I wouldn't have received any other way. The experience alone was worth the move.

Since then, I haven't been doing so well. When I first moved here, it was a fresh off an unwanted break-up, and a college friend who had been working in the city for a few years single-handedly talked me through it and made this place feel like home. In early winter, he hanged himself in his bedroom. Since then, I've lost two more close friends to petty arguments and bad situations, and have only been able to find scarce freelance gigs. I've landed a few interviews, and come excruciatingly close to landing a few, but every time, there's always someone a *little* better-suited for the job. Now I feel like I'm stuck again.

What I'm trying to say is: I could use some cheering up. I know things will work out eventually, and I know a positive attitude makes things easier. So, internet, I request your humorous wisdom: give me a joke, send me a funny .gif, hit me with your best! A little goes a long way here. "

I grew up in a loving family that was there for me and supported me 100% financially through college. I went to the school I loved and met the love of my life there. Problem is, I hate my major. I studied petroleum engineering because my parents picked it and did a good job of convincing me that it held a successful future for me. It has so far provided me with good summer internships that paid well and a current job that looks amazing on paper (salary, 401k, health, vision, and dental). Problem is that I have absolutely no passion for the oil industry. I am now much more progressive-minded than when I left for college and I just do not fit in anywhere in this industry. My job isn't all that bad, but when things are slow I start thinking and I'm not where I want to be and I can't even decide where I want to be or where I'm going. The only certainty I have is that I love my fiancee and want to spend the rest of my life with her. Things are going so well for her at her job and it kills me that I cannot be content with mine. I don't know why I'm writing this.. I guess I'm hoping someone out there will say something that helps, but chances are you are thinking the same thing as me: ""get the fuck over it. You have it made. Just keep your nose to the grindstone and enjoy your comfortable lifestyle.""

I just can't. Work is painful (for no known reason). Commuting in this city is painful. Working on a career I don't give a fuck about is killing me. Going back to school doesn't seem possible in my mind and any career in corporate America makes me want to lay down in a hole and die. All these negative thoughts are only perpetuating the problem. I love my fiancee but I feel so inadequate. I can't quit another job.. I can't put her through that again."

I'm interested in holistic farming which tries to pattern itself on natural systems.  I've been learning about permaculture ideas and have been exposed to some biodynamic ideas.  A while ago it occurred to me that Daoism has a rich tradition of studying natural patterns and it only makes sense to base farming practices on these foundations.  What better way to cultivate good food than to embrace nurturing qi?

With that in mind, I found this book ""The Complete Illustrated Guide to Feng Shui for Gardeners."" Its a great read, but I'm having some trouble applying it to a farm system.  My latest challenge is that I intern at a urban farm.  We just ordered some 2000 trees which will be arriving in a few weeks with the idea of planting food forests around the property.  Does anyone have any advice about how to use feng shui principles to design these forests?

I'm about a year removed from graduating with my bachelor's in Finance, got a 3.2. I'm working currently in a financial position, but not anything actuarial. I've wanted to head into actuarial science for some time now, but I haven't had any luck finding a position. I've passed P/1 and FM/2, working on MFE and taking that in July. I don't have a TON of Access/VBA/SAS type experience - I'm working on it but some of it is hard to do without a corporate setting. I'm pretty comfortable with Excel and the rest of MS Office.

I've applied for pretty much every entry level position in the Minneapolis area in the past year or two, gotten a few phone and in person interviews, but nothing seems to be leading anywhere. It may be that since I didn't have an actuarial internship, I don't have some of the related experience. The downside of that is that I'm out of school now and most internships are looking for current undergrads. Any other tips aside from working on MFE and trying to get a bit better with programming experience? I find myself stuck in the catch-22 of no experience and needing experience to find any position.

I go to a top 5 school, have an excellent publication record in high impact journals, a nationally-recognized fellowship, and internships at top tech companies.  I figured few people would be able to match my resume, so I decided to not use my network to start and just see what is out there by applying online/going to career fairs.

What I found was shocking.  I had many phone interviews, and by far the most difficult ones were with mid-tier tech companies (companies well-known in the industry but maybe not to the public as a whole).  I was often quizzed during the very first contact.  Despite being very qualified for several of the positions in that I had previous work experience as well as related research, I had no on-site interviews from this group.  I also had phone interviews with a few top companies that were outside my network.  The phone screens tended to be less technical and more resume-focused, but I still only had one on-site interview, which went terribly.

Finally, after a few months, I was feeling really worthless with how the job search was going, so I began to ask old labmates and my old bosses at a particular top company what kinds of jobs were available.  I passed my resume onto them, and within a week, I had a hiring manager e-mail me for an *on-site* interview.  Not even a phone screen.  When I get on-site, my interviews consisted of either of very chummy people explaining how the weather was so great, or alumni from my school asking how so-and-so is.  There were very few technical questions.  It was as if an invisible hand was guiding me to this position, although I was no more qualified for it than previous countless jobs I had applied for at other companies.  The real kicker was that the salary they offered was about 20% higher than what I could have hoped for at another company.

I am still shocked at how much my network helped me land a job.  I honestly thought my qualifications would speak for themselves.  The whole process has made me sad.

Edit: There's a little bit of a misconception about what kinds of jobs EE PhD graduates get.  Although a PhD is required for many research positions, they are often preferred for senior design or development positions.  For example, my job title is a flavor of Senior Engineer, and the company required a PhD.  Whether or not one is actually required to perform the job is, of course, debatable."

3:36 A.M. Watching The Hunger Games and listening to Daft Punk radio on Pandora, an oddly calming prescription for my preflight jitters. Three years ago when I signed up for a peace &amp; conflict minor, I never would have thought I'd be going to Israel. Who knows where I'll end up in the next three years. As I sit here, I can't help but be reminded of a reply I submitted to a reddit post on /r/travel about getting nervous before trips.

 

I always get that feeling before going on trips. I've come to love it. It's the feeling of insecurity that I've grown to love so much about travelling. It's only scary if you focus on the fear, think about the awesomeness, the interesting friends you'll make, the new cultures you'll experience, the new foods you'll try, the lessons you'll learn and my personal favorite, the different perspectives you'll pick up. That feeling you have? It's the feeling I miss the most when I'm not traveling. It's the feeling of a new challenge.

 

The past few days seem like blur. I guess time does that to you when you try to fit everything you should have been doing in the past two weeks into the last three days before your flight. I am pretty happy with my decision to place ""see friends that are around the area"" at the top of my list of things to do. One noteworthy meet up was with [Insert friends name]. We sat with our drinks as we casually discussed the concept of freewill, and our thoughts on organizing systems of minimum wage. The discussion briefly distracted me from my trip and brought a sense of normalcy that I readily welcomed. I definitely don't feel normal now.

 

Just yesterday, I was deciding which shorts to pack. What do you pack for a six month trip abroad? Some ear plugs, shoe powder to prevent smelly boat shoes, a french press? Definitely my watch. I have to be on time. It's not like that wonderful vacation to Costa Rica I was lucky enough to go on two winters ago. It's all about Pura Vida down there, a lifestyle of taking your time and enjoying the pure life. I can't imagine doing business there though, everything seemed to lack the sense of urgency I've become accustomed to growing up in the north east. I can't imagine that's what it'll be like in Israel. So, watch... check.

 

I have to admit, life feels pretty surreal right now, that could however, be a result of my lack of sleep. However, unlike my previous bouts of sleeplessness, staying up this time is intentional. Since I have a hard enough time sleeping as it is, I've decided to stay up all night before my flight as a preventative measure for being unable to sleep on the plane. Let me tell you, the alternative isn't much fun. Imagine arriving in a new country, completely sleep deprived, and being bombarded by signs pointing you in all directions written in a language foreign to what your brain is used to. Yes, I know, there are probably English translations right under them, but it's pretty hard to focus on anything at this point. The only clear thought you can really get out is, ""I want a bed."" The airport floors begin to look pretty comfortable with each dragging step, and trust me they're not...cold with a side order of dirty and sprinkled with a touch of back pain. Sure, going through airport security and trying to find my terminal at JFK will be a miserable experience but at least I'm familiar with it. I'll gladly be a zombie for a day, hell, it's the closest I'll be to The Walking Dead till the new season comes out.

 

At this point, all I can think about are my concerns for this internship at [Insert organization name]. My greatest fear is that they won't really have any use for me as an intern. Sticking me with a bunch of grunt work for six months would be a nightmare. Having been a psychology lab assistant, I already know what it's like. I like to think I'm a creative guy but trust me when I tell you, there's no way you can make data entry fun. Hats off to you if you can figure that one out. I'd even go as far as to find you and shake your hand because I'm sure you'd indirectly influence scores of scientific breakthroughs. At the very least, I can just be that annoying intern who is constantly asking questions. It'll probably get old for them pretty fast but if I'm just getting busy work, I'll stick it to them with a never ending list of questions so I can come out of this experience with more knowledge on the inner-workings of a non-profit organization.

 

Ideally, I aim to gain some practical hands on experience before going back for a graduate degree (one I hope will be generously funded by whatever organization I choose to align myself with in the future...ha...ha, I'll keep hoping). An old high school friend recently got accepted to Georgetown University, something I aspire to. I think she's in Turkey right now, which makes me wish I could have a much longer layover in Istanbul so I can meet up and have her show me around...random, I probably need coffee. Anyway, making contacts and learning new training techniques and exchanging ideas with other mediation trainers would also be pretty nice. I'm sure this will look great on the resume. There's also this historically rich culture I plan on diving into and experiencing while I'm there. Most importantly, and with a little luck, I'll get better at chess. I'll make [Insert teacher name(a teacher that likes chess)] proud.

 

So...

Camera... Check.

HIPP manual... Check.

Open mind... Check.

 

I think I've misplaced my nerves of steel.

These are people who've been through at least 3 core CS courses by the time they interview, which include procedural programming, object oriented programming, and a data structures class that goes over Linked Lists, Heaps, Binary Trees, various sorting algorithms, and a cursory introduction to complexity analysis. Most of them have had experience with another company usually doing some simple IT or QA stuff with the occasional dive into code with debugging.


I thought I'd choose easy questions to weed out the terrible people, but across the board I get mediocre answers from all of them.

Here's some of the stuff I ask:

* Explain what polymorphism is
* Explain Recursion.  What's the base case?
* What's a linked list?  Why would I use it instead of an array?
* What's bubble sort?  
* Then for fun I give them a little program with different pointers and references and ask them to write the results of various cout statements.


There are a bunch of other topics I have on my list to cover, but they all do so badly with these basics that I don't even bother.

In November I started interning for a company in Germany. The company is Korean, but has a location in Germany. I basically immediately got odd vibes from it because a lot of the staff that was there didn't have work permits, didn't speak English or German, and basically just stuck to themselves. My work contract is through a subsidiary of the company, which is run by my boss and based in Germany. My boss was a nice Korean man who lived in Germany for over 20 years and is pretty well known in the industry. As per German law I make an intern salary of 400 euro per month.

I was overwhelmed with starting at a new company, being given so many tasks, learning new things, and was preparing to go back to the US for the first time in over a year and a half to see my family for Christmas and had forgotten to check my bank accounts. When I got back to work in January my boss told me that he was sorry the pay took so long to get there, but he'd get it all there. I said it was no problem, and promptly forgot about it. (My parents help me out by paying for my rent so I can use the measly money I get for groceries and health insurance and other bills.)

In January one of my 2 coworkers left for Korea so it was just me, my boss, and a girl I really liked. My boss then tells me that he wants me to work on a different project with him, which is not a big deal. But then things start going down hill.

I like to think I have a very good work ethic; I come in 20-30 minutes early every day and don't just leave at 6 (I work 10-6), but after I finished what I have been working on for the day. But apparently this wasn't enough. I would be getting ready to go at 6:30 and my boss, who I share an office with, would suddenly have something to talk to me about for 45 minutes. This is fine, but I just don't make enough money to work over 9 hours a day.

Then my coworker that I liked told the company she was leaving. They were ABSOLUTELY horrid to her. She is from Korea, was told she was going on a short business trip to Spain, then was told to go to Germany for a meeting, and was basically told she was not leaving to go back to Korea. She had a few days worth of clothes, nowhere to live, and no time to prepare. They refused to let her take vacation time to go and get her stuff or visit her family in the next 8 months. After she tried to quit they basically guilted her and forced her into staying and promptly sent her to an office in California.

In the meantime my boss was having me work on things that I repeatedly told him I did not know how to do it, but he just ignored that and would berate me for not having it finished at a quick rate (I was hired to do writing, but he had me doing web design - which I never led him to believe I could do).

Then one day he tells me that we have to switch offices because the main company wasn't happy having us working in our main office. I think this is no big deal, the new office is in a better location for me. Then I find out it's just the livingroom of the apartment the company rents for him. I'm a 22 year old woman, he's a middle-aged man. We'd be working alone there. I think you can understand why I am not super comfortable with this idea.

Starting around January/February he begins to make a lot of business trips. When he's on his business trips I am told not to go into the office because I would be the only person there. I think it's a bit odd, but don't question it. Hey, free time off! Am I right? So this happens quite regularly. He's away for a week and a half, I work for a week and a half, and so on.

I took off a week in early March to spend it with my bf who came to visit for my birthday, but then my boss was away again. I've basically not really worked in March because I had requested time off and then my boss was gone, and then the long Easter holiday (Germany celebrates the Friday and Monday before and after Easter as well).

Then my rent payment was declined by my bank and I got a text alert. I think, ""Well, that's odd.."" and check it out. I had not received a payment from my job since February, and I only received 2 in total; one in January, and one in February. I was not payed for November, December, or March.

My work contract ends at the end of this month, and I had been told several times by my boss that he wanted to keep me on in a full time position in community management. I was super excited about this, but when I saw that I hadn't been getting paid I realized that this was an empty promise.

I sent my boss a text regarding the payment and asked what was going on. This was done over Whatsapp, he saw the message the day I sent it, but didn't respond to it ever. This was about 6 days ago. This morning I received a text asking me to come into his apartment tomorrow morning at 10. Nothing else. No response about my pay, my pay was never deposited.

I have no idea what to do. My parents and my bf think I should send him an e-mail explaining that I am not coming in until my pay is taken care of and that I am not comfortable coming to that location to meet with him, but that I will go into the main office if he wants to talk. I don't disagree with them, I just don't know what to do. I know I'm being taken advantage of here. But I've got no balls. I know I need to stand up for myself, and get my pay, and that I should really just quit. My contract ends in a few weeks anyway, and after that I am leaving Germany to live with my bf in the Netherlands.

So I just need some advice. Am I definitely being screwed over? Is it inappropriate for me to tell him I am not coming into work until I get my pay? And is it inappropriate that I tell him I'm not comfortable coming into his apartment?

Thanks!

TL;DR: My boss is screwing me over. Owes me over 1000 euro in back pay, ignored my messages about my pay, and asked me to come into his apartment tomorrow morning. I feel uncomfortable with it, and do not want to even go in until I get paid. What should I do? 

**Edit**: I just spoke with my boss. He told me to come into the office. The company was forced to close because of legal issues with the main company. My boss lost his job, he tried to get me to continue to work for him for free. I basically told him absolutely never. I'm out a lot of money, and now unemployed. AWESOME. There's a small chance I can get some of the money, but I highly doubt it."
1bz9pe,3,2013-04-09,"I am looking for some help understanding my possibilities, if any, for supplementing my current unemployment ""income."" Specifically in regards to obtaining an fskatt. Please hjälp.",riversharkmkII,sweden,https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/1bz9pe/i_am_looking_for_some_help_understanding_my/,"This is bound to be a contentious post, but please try to understand the reasons I am doing this before flaming me.

I have lived in Sweden for nearly 5 years, have worked, gone to school, and paid taxes. I have been unemployed/aktivitetstöd since June and have survived until now through that and my savings while looking for a job and doing an internship. I am on the lowest tier of unemployment which means I pull in around 4000/month from that. It is not enough to survive off of with student loans in the states, rent, and food. 

Recently I was offered a job with an online company, but with the caveat that the hours arent guaranteed. It could be 20 hours per week, but it is more likely to be an average of 0-5 hours per week. No guarantees whatsoever. This job requires an F-skatt. I have a company on hold but am unable to obtain an F-skatt while still qualifying for unemployment. This means I am in the position to either have a guaranteed 4000kr/month or a possible range from 0-7000kr/month (erring on the lower side of it).

I have contacted Alfakassan and arbetsförmedlingen to see if there are any possible ways for me to pull in ANY additional income while on unemployment and was told this is not possible. 

I am hoping, that those of you with experience with any of these aspects, could tell me if there are ANY possibilities that were not addressed by these two organizations. I really would prefer not to do anything illegal, but I also would really like to be able to survive while I continue looking for a job which requires more than unemployment can provide. 

In anticipation of comments regarding me, as an immigrant, trying to take advantage of the Swedish Welfare system, I would say that I am just trying to explore ALL of my options. I am a Swedish citizen, I am extremely active in my job search, I look for internships to spend my time wisely, I have paid my fair share of taxes, and I would very much like to continue doing so but that requires a job which requires me to survive while looking for one, which requires more than 4000kr/month. 

All of that being said, I am truly appreciative of any input you can give.

What I really want to do is go into web development, but it seems I need a degree in CS or experience to do so. So, the way I see it, I have two options available to me: get a masters in CS (it would take about as long as a bachelors, and it would cost about the same), or developer bootcamp. 

I'm leaning towards a developer bootcamp because 1) I already have some experience coding, and 2) it would teach me what I don't know and would provide some job placement. However, I recently read an article on someone bashing them, and realized what they said was rather accurate (that it was pushing out programmers with no real knowledge). However, the ones I'm wanting to try take only the best people, and have something along the lines of a 90+% hire rate. Though, one thing I'm worried about is that a good deal of their job placement puts people in startups, and a large company would probably be better for me because of my health problems (they could better accommodate my health quirks).

The college route is all well and good, but what will the job situation be when I get out? That will be three years, and it took me forever to get my bachelors due to my health issues, so it's possible it'd take longer. Plus, I have to pay out of pocket for the undergrad prerequisites, which I'm fine with but it's not ideal. 

There is a third option, and there's learning a language on my own (I already know PHP and some Python and Ruby, though I'm still getting used to Ruby on Rails specifically). I'm good at that, but then I still run into the fact that I have zero experience. I could get a recruiter to help me, but I don't even know where to start, or whether or not they could help me.

Before you ask, no, I didn't do an internship, though I did freelance a little while in college. This is because, up until recently, I had some rather severe health issues. (The issues may not be entirely resolved, but I'm bashing my head in with boredom, so I'm going to try the route of paying for a really good chair, getting on even stronger painkillers, and using a heating pad while at work.) Also, yes, my school does provide some job preparation, but it's not entirely helpful.

Finally, there's staying on disability, which pays decently, but I have to live with my parents. Plus, there's the boredom, even with some freelance on the side and some MOOC courses. "

Class and work presentations are something I look forward to rather than dread like many of my peers.

* I've seen some job listings asking for CompTIA or Microsoft Certification for trainers - is some sort of certification a must-have to even get started in the field?

I'm a senior in high school who is planning on going to go to a college that costs a total of $46,000.

But here's the problem..

My parents are divorced and they both are classified as ""disabled"" by the government. They claim government assistance to cover all of their financial needs and do not have jobs. My stepfather is a Navy vet and receives money for his time there. Together, my stepfather and mother ""earn"" $15,000 a year, while my dad earns something less than that. My parents have not gone through college, and I would like to be the first in my family to do so. Unfortunately, they can't contribute to the cost of college.

I have been accepted to this college (and a few others, but my mind is pretty set) and so far have taken the steps to get financial aid. My financial award amounts to $27,000, using a combination of grants and loans. that leaves roughly $19,000 a year for me to cover (this college is a five year school). Now, I have done some research into loans and the different types and providers, but I'm not sure I will qualify for these loans (no credit/parents have bad credit) or if they will even cover the costs of college. The things is, even if I get these loans, that's around $100,000 in loans once I'm all done.

I am going to school for engineering and I'm fairly certain that these loans can be managed as long as I get a quality job after college, but that's a gamble. Right now, my income is limited and I have nothing saved for school. I recently had an (unpaid) internship with a company that just hired me today, so I'm going to start earning some money (to the tune of $500 a month) and hopefully I can manage to save the majority of this before college starts.

So my questions are, what should I do? How am I going to afford this? (loans? if so from where?) And what advice do you have for someone in my position?"

First, some background: I went to a top ~30 or so school for mechanical engineering and did very well academically as an undergrad there, and am currently going to the same school in grad school. I'm pursuing my MS, and will graduate in a about a year, hopefully. Additionally, I have two (soon to be three) summers of internship experience. 

The first summer internship I worked for a big Pharmaceutical Company doing Process Improvement/Lean Six Sigma stuff, and the second summer was for a large engineering company where I did mechanical design work.

In both cases, what I actually did at the company was pretty easy in comparison to basically everything that I did in school. That being said, I was only an intern, so I imagine I didn't get the most difficult of tasks. But more relevently: the corporate culture in both of those places seemed almost overwhelmingly stifling. 

In both summers, the people that I worked with were all nice and for the most part seemed competent, but they just seemed like they didn't really enjoy what they were doing. Just the amount of bureaucracy present in these well-established companies seemed to just suck the fun out of everything.

Then I hear from one of my friends (who is a computer science major) about her work experience at a larger tech company, and their workplace seems so much more relaxed. She was telling me about how she and her coworkers can work however long they want and come in whenever they want so long as they got their work done. Their dress is very casual, and all of that as well. 

This sounds much more appealing to me than what I experienced either of the past two summers. Are there any companies that hire mechanical engineers that have this sort of atmosphere?

Summer is approaching and my product-design startup is based in a college town. We're short on cash, but do want to bring students in on the design process. We have many talented students which can offer valuable and complete additions to our current product venture. The product is only on paper right now, so throughout the summer we'll be solidifying the CAD model, and beginning prototyping and programming of everything that is necessary.

We don't have enough funding to hire multiple students, even at minimum wage, for all of summer. We're seeking the unpaid internship route, and this is what my post is about. Are we allowed to hire unpaid interns as essentially full- or part-time employees, responsible for portions of the project, and with free reign over their element of the design? If not, what options to we have to hire them under?

I've bounced around the idea of ""post-payment,"" where I assign each of their roles a value, and give them a relative portion of the profits for the project which they worked on.

Plus my employer most likely isn't used to hiring foreigners, as the position was more advertised for local students, so I don't want to lose my potential job (my only offer) because it was too much of a hassle to get me there.

Any help would be appreciated."

1byk0t,2,2013-04-08,Looking for advice in starting up a local marketing firm.,[deleted],Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1byk0t/looking_for_advice_in_starting_up_a_local/,"I'm looking at starting a small, local marketing firm in my area, and was hoping you could give me some feedback/share your experience/share some advice.

The services I would offer would be:

* Building websites (through Wordpress mainly and BlueHost if they needed hosting). This would include creating shopping carts if they needed that type of site
* Graphic design (all types of pieces -- have a very talented graphic design partner)
* Improving SEO (or setting them up with the tools that they need to be successful with the new site)
* Setting up their e-mail campaigns -- (customer sign up integrates with website)
* Creating e-newsletters (design and code)
* Video production/editing (have another friend that is pretty talented when it comes to this stuff)
* Training them on Google Analytics and Google Webmaster Tools
* Setting up their CRM system
* Setting up their social media accounts/developing a plan
* Setting them up to function better as a team through the use of various collaboration and communication apps
* Possible copy writing (not sure about this at this moment though)
* Helping with ad placement around the community
* General marketing advice/re-branding

I would then be available for 'consulting' after this initial set-up stage. At this point I am thinking about providing my clients a set time for free every month based on whatever they had me do, and then charge for any time over that. So for example if they wanted additional SEO help, I would give them an hour every month for free -- or if they wanted some changes made to their website I would provide 3 hours every month for free. However, any graphic design changes would cost money at an hourly rate or set price if we could negotiate one.

In the beginning I would have to ask for money up front, but as it hopefully grew I would provide terms for customers (30 day billing, etc. -- because they'll most likely be small businesses too). I have found a lot of great apps and SaaS sites to help my own business function properly. And at this point it seems like the biggest cost to start would be registering my business (not sure what I should register it as), and obviously my time (which I know it would be extremely time intensive). If I needed more help there is a large university in town, and I thought I could get some interns to help with the workload (Good idea? Bad idea?). I currently work with a decent sized printing company (Fortune 5000 company) that I would have do the printing for my clients, and they do a good job. And from a legal standpoint I have a friend that would work with us that is becoming a lawyer this Summer and would help out from that standpoint. (We're all a couple years removed from college.) 

I live in a fairly large community (within 30 minutes of another large town -- easy to travel to) and after doing some research there appears to only be 3 to 4 major players that at this time I would consider main competitors. Their specialty mostly lies in the web design/development field, but they also provide some basic graphic design/SEO improvements/Google Analytics training.

In the beginning I would meet with potential clients face-to-face after reviewing their web presence myself through basic Google searches. It seems that a lot health providers/doctor offices don't have the strongest web presence in my area, and I'm making the assumption that they would possibly have some money for an upgrade. So this might be my target market to start. Also I plan on doing local Google Ads, and getting as involved as possible within the community. Both from a personal (joining groups, volunteering, etc.) and a company standpoint (sponsorships -- especially with the university, booths at events, partnering with local clients, etc.). One thing I should add is that I don't plan on overextending the business and adding clients rapidly. I want to grow in to having a larger client base (if I'm lucky).

So like I said I was hoping for some feedback/advice/suggestions/or anything else you can think of that might help. 

* Do you think I'm looking to provide too much, and should specialize in an area? Or is it okay? (I think I can handle it if I'm smart with how large my customer base is) 
* Also, what importance level would you place on having a bookkeeper? 
* Is bookkeeping something that's needed, or can that be easily learned?
* Is the age of my team going to hurt our chances at getting clients, or do people tend to overlook that if they see you can provide quality?
* Should I charge an introductory rate to gain clients in the beginning?

I've got tons of questions, but I'll leave it at that. Answer all, some, or none. I appreciate it that you made it this far. Thanks r/entrepreneur!

1byhom,10,2013-04-08,Feeling Stuck in Monogamy,[deleted],nonmonogamy,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1byhom/feeling_stuck_in_monogamy/,"I have been in a monogamous relationship for over a year with my boyfriend. We have our issues, but our relationship is strong and we are happy and very much in love with each other. The decision to be monogamous was made by both of us together, though it was not discussed in detail. It never occurred to me that I would want anything different until I got to a very introspective point in my life recently, a part of which was realizing that I have always naturally had feelings for multiple people at once. This has never been a real issue for me in relationships, as I believe that small crushes are natural and help to keep relationships healthy and exciting. Essentially, I am discovering that I have some poly leanings and am working on how exactly I feel about all of this.

In the last few days, though, I have gotten into a pretty difficult situation. I have had feelings for a guy friend for a while now, but they weren't affecting my life or my relationship. The other day, however, this friend and I were hanging out, which we do on a regular basis, on a night when my boyfriend happened to be out of town. We ended up at his house so I could borrow some books (I'm just starting to read some Terry Pratchett!) and we just hung out in his room for a while. He brought out his guitar and was playing and singing, which was lovely. After a while, though, there was a very perceptible change in mood. He finished playing a song and we just kind of sat there until one of us was brave enough to acknowledge the obvious tension. It was made clear that we both have feelings for each other, we talked a little bit, and then I left before anything could happen that I might have regretted.

My friend and I have hung out and talked a lot more since then, and it's clear that I'm very confused but also not ready or willing to break up with my current boyfriend as our relationship is wonderful and brings me a lot of happiness. My friend has also made it clear that he has poly leanings and does not know what he wants at the moment either. Making things even more complicated is that my boyfriend is graduating from the university we all go to and has no idea what he will be doing once that happens. He may go across the country for a graduate program, move four hours away for a summer internship (and then maybe come back once that is done), or even just stay here and do the graduate program our school offers. I am not interested in a long distance relationship at all but I would like to continue to be with him if he stays here, so the fact that this is up in the air is making the situation very stressful for me.

I know for a fact that my boyfriend would never agree to a poly or open relationship. He has never been jealous exactly, but he does joke quite often about wanting to punch any guy who shows interest in me. I have not talked to him about this at all yet, but I cannot help but want to bring it up with him because I have such strong feelings (especially now that I know they are reciprocated) for my friend. I do not see my feelings for either person going away any time soon, and it is nearly torturous for me and my friend to keep hanging out together now that we know we feel this way about each other. My feelings for my friend have not affected my feelings for my boyfriend, and I really feel as if loving them both would come naturally to me. Note: I would never cheat on my boyfriend no matter how tempted I am. I never want to cause anyone that kind of pain.

I really don't know what I want from this community other than some kind words or advice. I just feel very stuck and I needed somewhere to talk about my situation. "

1bygi6,0,2013-04-08,"I’m a 19-year-old college student who has never left the United States, and I’m about to go to China for 9 months. Help!",[deleted],China,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1bygi6/im_a_19yearold_college_student_who_has_never_left/,"**TLDR: Going to Beijing in May, staying there for 9 months and have no idea WTF I’m doing.** 


I’m a college student, leaving in May to spend 9 months in China. First I have a week-long tour of Jiangsu province that is part of an award I won through my school. Then I have one free day to get to Beijing and find a place to stay before I start an internship for 3 months. After the internship, I will have about a week before I begin a semester at Peking University. I will be doing all of this by myself, and I have never left the United States before. So I’m really confused and looking for advice. 


I should probably add that I know a decent amount of Chinese, I’m taking Advanced Chinese right now and can communicate pretty easily about simple topics. 

Specific items:

* **Visa:** I’ll probably make a visa-specific post in /r/chinesevisa if needed, but my situation is pretty complicated. It seems like I’ll need a tourist visa, a work visa, AND a student visa. But it seems like you aren’t able to get more than one type of Chinese visa at once? I talked to a few travel agents and one of them recommended telling my company to request me to arrive in China a week before my internship starts, so I’ll be able to get into China for the tour and stay for the internship. I contacted the company and they are working on it. But could this potentially get me in trouble? Also, how would I change my work visa to a student visa when it is time for me to start school?


* **Money:** My internship pays a receipt based stipend (they called it Vaipo?) of 1000RMB a month. Is this enough to cover living expenses for the duration of my internship? I’m doubtful because I heard that apartments in Beijing are really expensive right now. Luckily, my flight to China will be free because of the award I won, I’ll just need to pay for a flight or train ride from Nanjing to Beijing. Aside from that, I have about $800USD saved up. Worst case scenario, I could take out a loan (I already have some student loans so a bit more wouldn’t be a huge deal). I also heard about making money by teaching English on the side? How does this work? Is it feasible to do this while also working a full-time internship?

Once the semester at Beida begins, my financial aid will cover mostly everything, and I’ll be living for free in a friend’s spare apartment that is too far from my internship to live in during the summer, but it is right next to Beida. So money is really only a concern for the summer.


* **Housing:** I’m trying to find a place to stay in/near the Chaoyang district for 3 months during the summer. I asked my company for help with this and they sent me  http://www.thebeijinger.com/classifieds which isn’t too helpful. Any advice about this process will be greatly appreciated. I’m only going to have 1 day in Beijing before my internship starts, so I probably need to figure out housing beforehand. Worst-case scenario, I can stay at a hostel or a friend’s apartment with his parents (he’ll be in America) for a few days to figure out where I’m living. Since my stipend is only 1000RMB a month, I’m looking for the cheapest apartment possible that is still safe, liveable, and a convenient distance to my internship. 


* **Banking:** My study abroad advisor said that I may need to open up a bank account in China, since my debit card likely won’t work over there, and I don’t want to have to pay ATM fees. How does this work? Should I do it?


* **Cell phone:** Using a Verizon phone right now, so I don’t think it will work in China. My study abroad adviser recommended buying a Chinese phone to use while I’m there. What’s the best way to go about this?


* **Stuff to bring:** What should I make sure to bring with me? For the week-long tour, I’m just going to have a suitcase and a backpack, so I can’t bring a lot with me. I can, however, mail things to a friend in Beijing and pick them up when I get there. I know I should bring a big supply of  personal hygiene products because the American brands are hard to find in China. What about medication? I have several prescriptions that aren’t serious, just skin care and birth control medication. Should I mail a 9-months’ worth supply to myself, or should I be able to get those things from a Chinese pharmacy? Is Chinese mail trustworthy for mailing valuable items?


Sorry about the huge wall of text. I am slightly terrified about these next 10 months. Please share with me any advice you have to offer. 


Also, if you are a female redditor living in/near chaoyang district of Beijing and are looking for someone to share an apartment with, PM me. Or if you know a female living in/near chaoyang district that is looking for someone to share an apartment with, please PM me their contact info. Thanks!

&gt;grisbarba: 
&gt;Something that I see a lot of here in Washington, DC and in NYC, the use of unpaid interns who are doing the work of paid employees without any of the benefits. Although there are definite uses for internships it has been perverted by corporations and government institutions. There are many students who cannot take unpaid internships because they cannot afford to live in expensive cities like Washington, DC and NYC. If their parents can't afford to help them out then these internships turn into a way for those with money and connections to once again get advantages/opportunities over people who don't have the money.
&gt;Furthermore, unpaid interns are often subject to abuse by their employers. Longer work hours, no extra benefits for overtime, sexual harassment, discrimination, etc. They have no recourse when this happens to them because most of them are afraid to speak out. I have worked at institutions where this has happened, and employees that did speak out were quieted and/or discriminated against. This problem is probably going to only get worse with tighter budgets.

We had been considering a similar project, and also think it's a great idea, so I'm pleased to announce: ProPublica is officially looking into internships in the U.S.

Furthermore I have been actively pursuing a degree in computer information systems. My hard work has paid off and I have been given one of ONLY TWO spots on an exchange program at Soka University in Japan. This trip starts my endeavor to live in Japan because while I am there for a year I will be actively looking for a job and an apartment.

However, as everyone knows, Japan is quite expensive, so I am reaching out to the masses for some assistance. I have already used up all my financial aid (HOPE Scholarship) by taking classes above and beyond to help my career. I refuse to let money stop me from attaining my dreams of being fluent in Japanese as well as living and working there.

Since I finally got my license, I have been applying to jobs everywhere but no bites yet. I knew it wouldn't be easy to find a job just because I'm licensed, but I wasn't expecting this. I literally have no experience other than from rotations, and my resume is pretty weak.

Can anyone offer some advice or maybe point me in the direction of companies that are willing to fully train their pharmacists? Thanks for any and all help :)"

Haven't heard back, so I don't know for sure, but my plans were predicated on being able to lease out my apt for the summer to move to the city for the internship, and now I learn that's impossible, that my apartment complex won't allow me to do it through some stupid part of the contract.

so now I'm going to be stuck in town for the summer with nothing to do but to find a min. wage job in order to pay off the fucking monthly rent I've been screwed into keeping.

1c341o,3,2013-04-10,"Been living in the US for 6 yrs, overstayed my OPT while working for a company that only made empty promises, now I think my only option is to either get married or leave and be banned for 10 years. Any thoughts?",plsgivemeausername,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1c341o/been_living_in_the_us_for_6_yrs_overstayed_my_opt/,"I'll try to sum up my situation is as few words as possible.

I moved to the US from Italy about 6 years ago to attend an acting academy in Los Angeles. After graduating I was granted a year of OPT (Optional Practical Training) and shortly after that I started an internship for a fairly well known film producer. 

A few months into the internship, I had a talk with my boss, who told me she really wanted to help me stay in the country. She mentioned she may be able to give me a small role or some other on-set job, so I could apply for an O-1 visa. 

Fast forward to about a year after that, I was promoted from intern to ""executive assistant"", which really means I agreed to working full time in exchange for a paycheck. It's worth noting at this point that, while this person USED TO be a fairly big player in the industry, she was now an independent producer, with not as much money or power as she used to have. 


This meant that even though I went from an unpaid internship to a paid position, the pay was still embarrassingly low, well under minimum wage. On top of that, our paychecks (mine and most of my coworkers') were often late and sometimes entirely forgotten. To this day, I'm still owed something like 7 paychecks, which again, wouldn't really amount to much. The work conditions were generally ridiculous, and even though I hated working there I decided to endure it in hopes that she would eventually be able to help me out. But I digress.

A total of two and a half years went by. I eventually started to realize that this job was beginning to negatively affect every part of my life. It also became obvious that this person wasn't going to follow through with her promises. I decided that I couldn't take it anymore and finally quit.

The problem is I've ""overstayed"" my OPT (I didn't realize this until after it happened). As far as I know, this means that I have no way to legally stay in the country other than marry a US citizen. Also, if I were to leave the US I wouldn't be able to apply for another visa before 10 years have passed.

I am heartbroken. I moved here right after high school when I had just turned 18 and this quickly became my life. I can barely even speak Italian without sounding like a foreigner anymore. Leaving would mean losing my friends, my professional connections, and most importantly, the place that I've come to see as home.

I'm afraid there's no other way around this, but I'm really hoping someone will prove me wrong.
I'm looking for advice, suggestions, opinions, anything really. If there's anything I haven't mentioned feel free to ask me.



**tl;dr Been in the US for 6 years. The company that promised to help me stay in the country never followed through, and because I overstayed my OPT I think my only choice is to marry a US citizen or leave, though I won't be allowed back to the US for 10 years. Do I have any other options?**"

My GPA at the time of graduation will be about 3.39.  I'm interested in pursuing a masters in quant finance.  Since I screwed around so much in college, I thought I would take a year off from school, focus on my GRE, and get some work experience.  I thought maybe I'd get a job as a prop trader just to learn the grind.  

The problem is my GPA is shitty and I don't have any experience.  To be honest, I'm pretty frustrated and have no idea what the hell to do.  At this point, the future seems pretty bleak and it would really help to hear from some people with experience in the industry.  Can you help steer me in the right direction?

Advice?,jsantiii,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/1c2xir/same_story_youve_all_heard_before_recent_college/,"My girlfirend (22f) has recently graduated with a BA in Marketing from a college with a pretty well-known program.  We want to live together in New Jersey (ideally, central, but willing to go more north), so she's primarily looking for jobs in that area.

She's avoiding applying for jobs in NYC because of the commute - the idea of it gives her anxiety, and she doesn't want to spend 1-2+ hours of her day in transit. 

She's been applying off-and-on for several months but hasn't gotten anything promising.  Most of the places that call her back for an interview turn out to be scams, after googling them. (I talked to her today about googling them before she applies, so she hopefully won't waste much more time on these bullshit companies.) 

Anyway, she's feeling pretty down. It seems like the only companies/firms that want her are scams, and the ones that aren't scams are asking for people with more experience. She's had several internships, both during summers and while at school, but from what I can gather, this isn't enough.

Lastly, she's babysitting now every day in the afternoon, so going to local networking events is a little difficult. (It's also getting hard to motivate her to go when she's losing hope that she'll find a job at all.) 

Anyone have advice for her or words of encouragement? 

**tl;dr:** My girlfriend was a Marketing major, graduated in December, can only find jobs that require too much experience or are scams.

**Edit:** I'm about to graduate in a month, potentially have a job in the Princeton area come September that I am getting through an internship that I've worked for the past two summers/holiday breaks. Anyway, September is when we're looking to move in together.  We both have hectic summers with a lot of traveling, so she's looking to start around August.

Do you wish to use your OOP powers for good? Are you a pretty cool guy/girl who doesn't afraid of anything?

If you answered 'Yes' to all of the above, then you seem like the kind of programming intern we're looking for. We've posted on Reddit a few times in the past, and it's always turned out great. 

**The Basics**

We need someone who is willing to work a set schedule of 10 to 20 hours a week in Winter Park. We understand that people have other obligations, so we are able to work around school schedules. 

The initial position is for 90 days for $10/hr. If those 90 days go well, there is definitely room for the intern to come on full-time (we have had this happen a few times already, myself included). 

The majority of the work will be done in Python. If you've never used Python before, we won't count that against you at all. We are looking to hire as soon as possible.

**Experience**

Since this *is* an internship, we are willing to spend a good portion of the time teaching and working with the intern. That said, we do require a decent grasp of object oriented concepts. You need to know what classes are, how inheritance works, etc. That is really the only technical requirement for the position. Any knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or SQL would be a plus, but is not required. Linux experience would also be a plus.

**The Project**

We work for a non-profit that helps people with disabilities locally. The Applicant will join a team developing, maintaining, and supporting the online software suite that all the employees of the company use. The software is used by several branches of the organization in the southeastern United States. Because the software is developed in-house, the team is able to interact with its users on a daily basis, and provide real solutions to real problems. We pride ourselves on being able to adapt the software to the developing needs of these branches in the day-to-day.

**Applying** 

Send resumes and questions to mcalvo@cilorlando.org. Please make sure your resume is no longer than one page. Do not try to contact via Reddit PM.

**EDIT**: Submissions are closed. Thanks to everyone who applied. We'll be in contact."

1c2p10,0,2013-04-10,GF [21F] fell asleep while we were hanging out yesterday evening. I [21M] would rather have left to study over laying in bed while she sleeps. Am I mean?,RelationshipsAdvice,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1c2p10/gf_21f_fell_asleep_while_we_were_hanging_out/,"&gt;Background

Been together for approx ~7 months, ~4 months officially.

We are both very busy people, she works a two jobs (1 full time and 1 part time on the weekends) and enjoys going out with friends at night (3~4 days of the week). I go to university (full time), work part time (internship) and do research. I also enjoy going out *occasionally* but it's typically (1~2 days of the week). I spend most of my nights in my research lab working on my research or studying for classes (typically until midnight). We usually leave two days of the week to get together and be intimate.

&gt;Situation

Last night was one of our scheduled nights together. I came over and we shared dinner at her place (she cooked while I brought food from home). Then I head to the bedroom and start reading while she takes a quick shower. Everything is going fine up until after she's done showering. She gets into bed while I put away the books. Cuddling happens, I carress her body but she does not show much feedback to me so I don't continue. Eventually she falls asleep while I just lay there wide awake. So I pulled my textbook out again and started reading again in bed (uncomfortably but it's better than nothing). An hour later, she wakes up and so I try to initiate things again but again there is no feedback and wants to sleep more. I decide that it would probably be better if I just left so that she could sleep peacefully and so I could study at home.

I later tell her that I would rather not spend time with her in the early of the week (because I have studies to catch up on early) if she is just going to sleep. If she was awake and we were doing something (anything, does not have to be sexual) then I would have been fine but I do not want to sit around when I could be studying if she sleeps. I try to explain it to her that I would like to spend my time being productive and that the night was not an efficient use of my time. She is now upset and (from her POV) thinks of it as me saying that she is wasting my time since we were not intimate. I find that a harsh way to put things but I am not sure what to say, it was an inefficient use of my time. I would rather be studying than watching her sleep. We don't have to have to be intimate, but I don't want to lay there uncomfortably. She says I could have woken her up and we could have been intimate but I think that would have been rude. 

&gt;TL;DR

We both are busy people and need to plan nights to be together. On a scheduled night we have a nice night until she falls asleep. I'd rather have left to study while she sleeps but she says that would have been mean of me. I am not sure what to say to her."

1c2h7x,1,2013-04-10,Transfer Choice Advice,DuncanCooper,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1c2h7x/transfer_choice_advice/,"So here's my extremely short story about myself.

I sucked at school in high school, didn't get into any of the schools I wanted to go to for college, ended up at a local CC, sucked there too, dropped out for two years, came back last semester, kicked its ass, kicking its ass again this semester.

These two most recent semesters apparently have shown colleges I'm ready to get my degree, because all the places I applied to let me in.

Here's where my question comes in. I have it narrowed down to two schools. University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Saint Louis University. Where do I go?

My major is Economics. SLU has admitted me into their Econ program. U of I admitted me into my second choice, History, probably because I don't have all the math transfer requirements they want.

I know the U of I has a better overall reputation and is a higher ranked school, but how difficult is it going to be for me to transfer over to Economics from History? Also, is SLU, being in a larger city, going to offer me more opportunities such as internships and possible job prospects after graduation?

Any thing else I should be thinking about? Thanks."

What kind of jobs can I get?,rsouxlja7,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1c2gc9/i_graduate_in_one_year_with_a_bs_in_accounting/,"I am going to be 25 years old in the summer and this will be the second degree I've earned. The first one was an AS in a trade, which left me unable to get a job in any other field once I started working and found out I hated that job.

So I went back to school, a 4 year college this time, and will be completing my accounting degree in one year. I have a GPA of something like 3.95 from my university. When I picked accounting, I felt like it was a very versatile degree, and I could work anywhere and do a lot of different things with my education.

So what I want to know is, if I don't go the public accounting route or if I decide to just get a job that has nothing to do with accounting, what kind of work could I do? I do not wish to work a job that requires me to work more than 50-60 hours per week, nor do I yearn to live a lavish lifestyle or make a lot of money. I am a waiter and an accounting intern now, my fiancee is a teacher, and we make more than enough money with my serving job and her teaching job to pay our mortgage and bills while saving money. 

So money is nice but it's not all I care about. I just want a low stress office job that I can leave at 5 PM and not think again about it until 8 AM the next day. Anyone have any advice?"

I have received an internship for the summer, but I am currently registered for summer classes. These classes (save 1) are pre-reqs for fall classes. The only sections available for these same classes in the fall are 8AM TR. Accepting this internship will extend my stay as it is 8-5 errday. I am not opposed to working everyday, however, because I really don't want to be in school for a total of 8 semesters straight, plus work experience is good. 

There is another potential opportunity, however, that would be a 20hr/week internship for a bit less pay, but with my current summer schedule it allows me to work monday and friday and a bit on wednesday, thus fulfilling my classes necessary AND work experience. Unfortunately, the guy who would be interviewing me went out of town 2 weeks ago and I have heard nothing since. I sent them a message stating that I hate to pressure them, but I need some sort of ""yes, here's your interview time"" or ""no, sorry, we can't do it"" since I am already being pressured into accepting the other offer. 

I honestly want to work for the less-communicative company more because the work is far more interesting and applicable to the real world while the other is data entry, but I don't want to bank on an acceptance and have them say ""jk sorry bro"" while I am stuck with 0 money and work experience for the summer.


tl;dr: read the post you slackass, it's not that long.

UPDATE: The company I am waiting on responded and pretty much said to go on without them. :\ I honestly want that one more but there's no guarantee I would be offered a position... Oh well."

I'm starting to look for a new job, but I don't even know what fields I should be looking at. I need suggestions.

I spend almost every day behind a desk on a computer. I absolutely do not want to be doing it for the rest of my life.  The work is boring, repetitive, and not rewarding at all.

I need suggestions on different mechanical careers that I should be looking at. I've had a thought for a while that something like being a field engineer for an energy company like Schlumberger or Exxon would be fun. I think I like the idea of being in the wilderness, or at sea, on some kind of adventure (if you'll humor me). I'd at least like to do something that involves more physical activity and less sitting behind a computer. I also want to have more of an impact than just providing minimal air conditioning to some retail space for a landlord.
At the same time, I want to eventually make a lot of money. I know I'll have to eventually go back to school to really make a lot of money, but I want to start down a new career path that is more suited to that than HVAC design consulting.

**TL;DR** I'm an HVAC design consulting engineer, and I want to change to some other, less desk oriented, more adventurous mechanical field. I don't know what though, I'm looking for suggestions.
So, please, any career field suggestions would be appreciated.


**EDIT** Thanks everyone for the responses.  If anyone is still reading this thread, I could use suggestions on fields other than oil.  It seems that oil field engineering is up my alley, but I'd like to consider other industries in the interest of thoroughness, only, I don't know any.  Wind turbines?  Transportation?  Underwater something or other?  Thanks again for all your input."

Since we're working on a 2.0 edition (fresh website on the same url) we're trying to improve a lot of things, also we'd like users to register on our website and by doing that we're hoping to build up a close 'community'

So this is the deal: 
I'm working at the company as intern and I have been asked to do research on the differences between registered and non-registered users.
Like: registered users can comment on articles and use a gardening design tool while non-registered users can only watch comments and do a short trial of the design tool.

Do you guys know any similar websites that I can compare the company's site to? It's not nessasary to be a gardening website, just a consumer website where people don't back down too fast when asked to register.

Since I'm not native English I hope I've given you enough information to help me, thanks in advance!

1c1lk5,2,2013-04-10,How can I use my Life Science degree to go into Computer Science?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1c1lk5/how_can_i_use_my_life_science_degree_to_go_into/,"Hi.  I'm a 22 year old that graduated from a public university in May 2012 with a B.S. Life Science degree, which is essentially a Biology degree except I had more leeway in terms of which upper level science classes I took.  I still took high level biology, chemistry, biochemistry, and physiology courses.  My plan was to take a year off (because I graduated in 3 years due to AP credits) and then enter dental school.  

Well, this upcoming fall is when I'd be beginning dental school, but I didn't get accepted into any of my 4 dental schools that I could afford to apply to (so sad that it costed over $700 just to apply to 4 dental schools).  Nevertheless, I'm still very much interested in attending dental school and I'm preparing to re-apply this upcoming June.  

The reason I'm writing this is that I've been trying to come up with a backup plan in case dental school just doesn't work out for me.  I know that I can use my Life Science degree to get a job in research, teaching, etc.  For the past year since I graduated university, I have private tutored, have done a research internship at a dental center, and am currently applying for a clinical research assistant position at a local hospital.  However, I've realized that it is not only quite difficult getting a stable job with my degree that will be able to support my future family, but these are also jobs that I can't imagine myself doing long-term.  Therefore, I've begun to think about the possibility of a career change, hopefully without wasting my Life Science degree.  I don't know how that would work, though, so I'm asking you guys!

One field that's always appealed to me, aside from dentistry, is computer science.  In high school, I took several computer science courses in C++ and Java, including AP Comp Sci, and really excelled in them.  As a very quick learner, I picked up the mindset of a computer programmer and found myself breezing through my classes without a hiccup.  I found programming to be quite fun as I was constantly challenging myself to think of new ways of writing code to achieve the goals set before me.  Unfortunately, I know all too well that even AP Comp Sci *is* a breeze compared to what I'd need to do in the real world or even undergrad.  Nonetheless, if I had chosen not to pursue dentistry back in undergrad, my next choice would have been to pursue a career in computer science.

Let's say we fast-forward to this time next year.  I have been rejected once again from all of the dental schools to which I applied.  What should I do?  Is it ill-advised to pursue a career in computer science at this point?  If not, how do I even begin my endeavor into the computer science industry?  Do I have to go back to undergrad and spend another 3-4 years to get a B.S. Comp Sci degree and waste my Life Science degree?  Or can I use my Life Science degree to go into some compsci masters program using my life science degree?  Is there some industry out there that is in demand of biology-compsci people?"
1c1l3s,193,2013-04-10,Screenwriting 101,Filmmaker_mike,Screenwriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1c1l3s/screenwriting_101/,"I'm hoping this post will cover the essentials of screenwriting, from idea generation to selling your script. I cannot add to this post because I have reached the max character count.

**1. IDEA GENERATION**

While sometimes writers have those ah-ha! moments where we are flooded with a mostly thought out concept, sometimes we need to activate our brains. There are several techniques for this, but they all revolve around the same basic theory: start with one aspect of the story and build from there.

For example, every protagonist has a goal or want. Come up with that goal first. Then, you can build upon that. Why would it be interesting to see this character have that particular goal? What kind of problems would a character face in trying to achieve this goal? Remember, Harold &amp; Kumar Go To White Castle was a successful comedy spawning two sequels, and it's entire premise is ""two stoners want a cheeseburger."" So no idea is off limits here.

**2. HOW DO I TURN THE IDEA INTO A SCRIPT?**

Every writer swears by their own technique. Some writers will start with coming up with an initial logline. The benefits are having something to guide you while writing, as well as being able to use the logline with others when they ask what you're writing about. That way, you can gauge their response to the idea as well as politely answer them and not provide something like ""uhh, it's kind of complicated...""

But something almost all writers will do is have something of an outline. What does an outline look like? That's going to vary widely. Some writers prefer to keep their outlines bare bones and will only map out key points (typically plot points). Other writers will get detailed and break it down by scene. An outline may have notes such as ""Hero captured by Villain in their lair,"" where others might write out things such as what the scene/sequence/act tension is, what the character goals are for the scene/sequence/act, and so on.

There is no right or wrong way to outline. It's whatever will help you write.

**3. STRUCTURE**

Many writers will base their outlines on specific structures or formulas. Structure is what gives the story a feeling of cohesiveness, that feeling that the writer knows what he or she is doing. There are many theories on structure. Below are two popular structures.

* Plot point/3-Act-based Structure

There are variations within this, but I'm combining them here for simplicity. Essentially, structures of this type suggest that screenplays should be written in three acts (a beginning, middle, and end). Acts 1 and 3 should each be roughly 25% of the script, and Act 2 should be roughly 50% of the script.

Some structures and formulas of this type will have a few plot points, while others may be filled with them. Some basic plot points will include the inciting incident, act breaks, midpoint, climax, and resolution. Plot points are essentially mile markers that help the writer keep the story interesting and with purpose.

* Sequence Structure

Sequence structure is based off of three acts as well. Plot points can be used with this still, but the idea behind this technique is break the script down into small chunks that are easy to handle (plot points are often the end of the sequence).

The common version of this holds that there should be eight sequences in the script. Sequences are roughly 12-15 pages in length. If you do the math, you'll notice that eight 12-page sequences is 90 pages, and eight 15-page sequences is 120 pages. Each sequence should have it's own tension, a question that the audience worries about, in addition to the story's main tension (which is usually ""will the protagonist succeed?""). The purpose for this is to constantly have something for the audience to be concerned about, thus getting them to invest in the movie. And since your tension changes every 12-15 pages, your script is less likely to become boring.

Here's what sequence structure ends up looking like:

Act|Sequence|Notes
:---|:---|:---
Act One | Sequence One | Often ends with inciting incident
 | Sequence Two | Ends in Act Break 1
Act Two | Sequence Three |
 | Sequence Four | Ends in Midpoint
 | Sequence Five | 
 | Sequence Six | Ends in Act Break 2
Act Three | Sequence Seven | Often ends with a false resolution or twist
 | Sequence Eight | Ends in resolution

2. [The Eight Sequences](http://thescriptlab.com/screenwriting/structure/the-sequence/45-the-eight-sequences), by The Script Lab

* Television Structure

Television is a different beast when it comes to structure, largely because of commercials. Acts don't really mean the same thing that they do in feature writing. A 30-minute show may consist of a teaser, two acts (commercial break separating them), and a tag, for instance. But this would not apply to every show.

The best way to learn structure for television is to read television scripts. If you're writing a pilot spec, read scripts of shows similar to yours. If you're writing a spec of a current show, read scripts from that show. Break them down and truly analyze them.

**4. HOW DO I ACTUALLY WRITE THE SCRIPT?**

There are numerous tools out there for writing scripts, available on PC, Mac, Android, and iOS. Here is a list of some:

* [Final Draft](http://www.finaldraft.com) (Windows / Mac / iOS) - The desktop versions of this software are considered the industry standard, and the company claims its mobile version lives up to the name as well.
* [Celtx](http://www.celtx.com) (Windows / Mac / Linux / iOS / Android) - The basic version of this software is free. The desktop version also provides many pre-production tools so you can actually film your script as well.
* [Movie Magic Screenwriter](http://www.screenplay.com) (Windows / Mac) - Another full featured program. But the company has many other tools available to assist in the writing process
* [Scrivener](http://literatureandlatte.com/) (Windows / Mac) - Although not intended specifically for screenplays, the program offers a lot. It can be used to outline and create character notes, write the script itself, or used as a rough draft tool and then exported into Final Draft for final publishing. There's also a bunch of tools for writing beyond screenplays as well, including novels, poetry, theses, textbooks, ebooks, etc.

**5. I WROTE THE SCRIPT. NOW WHAT?**

Assuming you have received feedback and rewrote your script, you're now off to sell it, or yourself as a writer for future work, or both. There are two main avenues for this that I'll touch on.

* Competitions / Fellowships

These will not sell your script directly, however you may make contacts at these events. Winning a competition can result in prizes and bragging rights. Fellowships are almost like jobs because you are essentially being paid to write.

Top Competitions and Fellowships:

1. [Nicholl Fellowship](http://www.oscars.org/awards/nicholl/) - Winners are paid $35,000 and must complete a new feature screenplay over the next year.
2. [Austin Film Festival](http://www.austinfilmfestival.com/) - Considered by many to be the top film festival for screenwriters.
3. Production Company Fellowships - Many big name companies offer fellowship competitions. You're often competing for what amounts to a paid internship where you learn from within the company. Some companies include [Disney/ABC](http://www.abctalentdevelopment.com/), [Nickelodeon](http://www.nickwriting.com/home/), and [Warner Brothers](http://writersworkshop.warnerbros.com/).
4. [Withoutabox](http://www.withoutabox.com) - Not a competition itself, but is a place where you can submit to numerous competitions and not have to be constantly filling out forms. Most of the competitions listed will be smaller and not necessarily ones that will truly advance your career. But you never know.

* Pitching / Queries

Here you are directly selling yourself and script. You can pitch to an agent, a manager, or a production company. A query is essentially a pitch in letter format. With both, you are trying to get the person or company interested in reading what you wrote.

Pitches come in two basic forms: the elevator pitch and the formal pitch. The elevator pitch is where you only have maybe 30-seconds to pitch your idea. The name comes from the idea of meeting a producer or development exec on the elevator and pitching them within that amount of time. This is where your logline comes in real handy. The formal pitch can last 5-minutes, 15-minutes, or longer depending on the circumstance. With both types of pitches, you are giving the best aspect(s) of your script - the parts that make the person you're pitching to practically beg you to read it.

There are also pitching festivals, such as [The Great American Pitchfest](https://pitchfest.com/), where for a fee you will able to network and pitch your script.

A query is a one-page letter that is sent out to these same people. At minimum it'll contain your contact information and a logline. Many writers choose to expand on that and include things such as a one-paragraph synopsis, or maybe even a sentence or two about major characters. If your script has won a competition, you may wish to include that information as well (especially if it's a big competition).

2. [Pitches](http://johnaugust.com/qanda/pitches), by John August

**6. WHAT ABOUT AGENTS AND MANAGERS?**

The rule goes that you cannot sell a script without an agent. This isn't entirely true. You are free to query your work without one, and you can sell your work without one. This works well for smaller production companies, because they are in need of good scripts as much as your are in need of a payday.

But if you want to sell to a major production company, an agent will increase your odds of selling, so they can be quite handy to have.

* Agent

An agent is a representative of talent. They get people hired. Depending on the company, you may be represented by an individual or a team. Some top-end agencies are: [William Morris](http://www.wmeentertainment.com) (WME), [Creative Artists](http://www.caa.com) (CAA), [ICM](http://www.icmtalent.com/), and [United Talent](http://www.unitedtalent.com/) (UTA). Agents are paid when you get paid. The average pay for agents is 10% (this can vary depending on local laws). If they say you owe them money upfront to hire them, they are a scam.

* Manager

A manager focuses more on your career as a whole rather than getting specific work. Your manager should have excellent contacts and work with you. A manager will have fewer clients and work more directly with you. Managers are paid much like agents, but don't be surprised when they are asking more for 15% or 20% until you become established.

**7. HOW DO I GET A JOB AS A TV WRITER?**

You should have some original work, but you're also going to want some scripts based on current shows as well. Think of these as fanfic specs, where you are writing a wholly original episode of a series. You should have these resemble actual scripts of the show as much as possible in terms of structure, dialogue, story arcs, etc. Do not write ""big"" episodes where an aspect of your episode would continue into future episodes, such as introducing a new character or killing a character off. Your spec should be stand-alone, and be based off of a ""typical"" episode, not a sweeps. You should also write for a show that's in at least its second season.

A major point that needs to be noted here is DO NOT write for the show you want to write for. Write for a similar one instead. If you want to write for New Girl, write a spec for Raising Hope. The reason is that the people behind the show you want to write for cannot legally read your script. If they did and ended up doing something from it (intentionally or not), you can now sue them.

**7a. I HAVE THE PERFECT SCRIPT FOR HBO/SHOWTIME/FX/AMC**

I'm writing this as a separate section because it seems to be talked about a lot on here. The network isn't who you want to talk to. You want to talk to production companies. Essentially how it works is the network will purchase rights to air the show from the production company. So you need to talk to the people who actually make the shows.

I should note that some networks have their own production companies, such as ABC owning ABC Studios, but they are separate companies.

Example: Scrubs was produced by a company called Doozer. NBC had the airing rights. When NBC cancelled Scrubs, Doozer was able to take the show over to ABC. ABC, however, had Scrubs co-produced with ABC Studios (then called Touchstone Television) as part of the arrangement.

**8. SHOULD I GO TO FILM SCHOOL?**

There's no easy answer to this one. Film schools provide a lot of knowledge, but most of it can be learned from other sources. The number one reason to go to a film school is to make contacts. But this is useful only going to an LA or NY-based school. There are other excellent film schools out there, however. Just remember that you will likely be incurring a lot of debt for a degree that won't automatically qualify you for a job. However, the best filmmakers, including writers, often went to college (not always film school) and have a bachelors or masters degree.

**9. MISCELLANEOUS RESOURCES**

* [IMSDb](http://www.imsdb.com) - A website with numerous scripts of produced work.
* [The Black List](http://blcklst.com/) - Originally a list of the most talked about unproduced screenplays, the site also offers other services to writers. These scripts are good to read because it will show you what the powers-that-be are interested in.
* [Done Deal Pro](http://www.donedealpro.com) - Keeps updated information on what's being sold and such, information that can be hard to gather elsewhere (even from a site like [Deadline](http://www.deadline.com)). This is good info because it'll let you know what companies are buying. There is also a very useful forum on there."

1c1gcm,1,2013-04-09,Long Distance SO is coming to see me after almost 1.5 years... And my parents aren't thrilled. Help.,[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1c1gcm/long_distance_so_is_coming_to_see_me_after_almost/,"SO is on the same sub, so details are limited: we met online 5 years ago, met in person 2 years ago (and have been exclusive since) are in college, and are LD.

Started last summer. He had an out of state internship and met a lot of new people, was working often, and just started acting very distant and barely talking to me as a result. I was confused, hurt and I really didn't know what to do other than to ask him if anything had changed, if he met someone else, or if he personally was okay. I *calmly* asked him several times (via several different communication methods) what was going on, and every time he would give me one-word answers, or act totally callous about it. I felt completely abandoned and lost, so I ended up asking if he wanted to break-up. He said no, and assured me everything was alright, that he was busy and he still loved me.

The same issue came to a head about 2 weeks later, (when I had started my internship). I asked him what he wanted, if he wanted to be with me, and the same questions as before regarding changing feelings/meeting people. He could not answer a single question. I had had enough and decided to break up. I was crushed. (I said we could be friends, but didn't expect much.) Called my best friend, then my parents (they are who I talk to because they've been married for a long time and can see through the bullshit in a lot of situations that my friends can't). I told them what happened, cried it out (for the umpteenth time) and they gave me advice: stay friends with him, take time being single, etc. They are very protective of me and liked my SO, in fact he was their favorite out of anyone I've brought home.

A week and a half goes by with no contact from him. I was okay with that, I could focus on my job at the time and start to get over it (at this point it had been a year and a half relationship). Then he texted me, and called me, said he missed me, the whole nine. Finally, he asked if we could ""talk"" - I said fine. We talked, and told me everything I needed to hear two weeks prior. He told me he knew what he wanted, but thought it would affect my happiness, so didn't tell me until I asked again. He said he wanted me, and had made a huge mistake. That he loved me and wanted to be with me. I was uncertain whether I could trust him at that point, so I said we could keep in touch.

At first we set boundaries (no sexting/webcam/flirting) because we were *not* in a relationship anymore. About a month of this, I realized I definitely still loved him, and he said he felt the same way. I was fed up with ""playing by the rules"" and we just did what we wanted to do as far as expressing our feelings.

Fast-forward to now. I feel like our relationship is stronger, and we have had serious talks (cohabitation!) about our future together after college. I trust him, he is all the more conscious to my mild paranoia about things (which has calmed significantly) and we take more time to do things together, even with the distance. I am still very in love with him, so please **no shitty comments**.

The issue is that after the problems we had over the summer and numerous scheduling conflicts, we haven't actually seen each other in 15 months. He's coming to visit me this summer (I live at home when I'm not at school). I'm very excited and happy to see him, but my parents... I've brought this to their attention, but they have both shown lackluster responses to my suggestions about ""maybe going to dinner"" with my SO and me. I desperately want them to reconcile or at least be civil without it being awkward. I feel like if I try to get them to reconcile it will be forced and I just want my parents to be happy for me and my SO to be comfortable around them.

I know my parents just love me and want me to be happy and not get hurt, but how can I improve this situation? Asked my friends, discussed it with my parents and SO (separately)... Reddit, I turn to you.

**TL;DR**: My SO and I had problems last summer which delayed us seeing each other for 15 months. Now he's coming to see me again and because I was upset over our issues, my parents don't approve. How do I go about this? Thanks in advance."

Just turned 20, studying in college bi(lean towards gay) and with ADHD and I feel completely and utterly alone at the moment.

This year started off kind of great, living with my best friend and his girlfriend (stupid mistake but I guess I have to experience it to learn from it.) It was good except things started to go south (no pun intended) with my ADHD habits coming out especially with houseworks (note that the best friend also has ADHD but undiagnosed.) And s*** just got worse and worse. We haven't talked for 2-3 weeks now with him trying to kick me out (legally he can't but haven't explained that to him yet knowing he wouldn't be able to understand it with his naive and somewhat ehem, stupid, mind.)

And I don't have anyone I can talk to, college counseling is next to useless, not a great family relationship (haven't came out and they are against homosexuality) and with exams piling up, I can't ask my friends to always be there for me (which is what I need to not breakdown every fifteen minutes or so.)

Besides, on the outside, I seem to not have any worry in the world, a top in the class student, a president of a big club, summer internship opportunity (I'm honestly not being narcissistic, I'm just trying to put things to context because I do hate talking about shit in my life and pretty much always end up talking about the positive part and helping other people with their problems.) But nobody knows that I'm breaking down inside. Nobody came to my birthday this year (bad combination of timing and emergencies and some delayed flights) and so I spent my birthday drinking by myself in a bar. Pathetic right?

What should I do?


Update (April 18th 2013) - The roommate has texted me some extreme things with very strong insults. (Apparently I committed a ""federal"" offense by somehow misplacing his mails which either I didn't do or did it unintentionally.

I know that GW has a pretty good international relations school, but i've heard some things about the school that turn me off (dorms suck, administrators suck, preppy spoiled people suck, lack of community sucks). Then again i am really interested in the internship opportunities. How easy are they to get and are they available fairly quickly for underclassmen? Also what are some things that you really like about GW?

1c1czg,7,2013-04-09,I'm a 16 year old high school student who wrote a paper on why the Magic's rebuilding plan is the future blueprint for NBA teams. Thought I'd share it here.,jags14,OrlandoMagic,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrlandoMagic/comments/1c1czg/im_a_16_year_old_high_school_student_who_wrote_a/,"On August 9th, 2012 I sat glued to my phone roughly 4,000 miles from home in the wild frontier state of Alaska. My favorite basketball team, the Orlando Magic, was about to execute the most important transaction in franchise history. The player I had spent my entire childhood worshipping, Dwight Howard, had publicly requested a trade almost a year before and had led the entire sports world, for that year, on what is now referred to as the Dwight-mare. He requested and unrequested a trade multiple times, threw teammates under the bus, and effectively had the Magic’s General Manager and Head Coach fired. I refreshed the ESPN app on my phone and my eyes saw the fateful line that revealed Dwight Howard had been traded to the Los Angeles Lakers in a four-team deal. The man behind all of this was the mysterious, enigmatic 30-year-old General Manager the Magic had hired just weeks before, Rob Hennigan. The rest of the NBA didn’t know at the time but Hennigan had just shown the NBA how to effectively rebuild a team. The Orlando Magic’s rebuilding plan, directly influenced by Oklahoma City and San Antonio, is the future blueprint for how to rebuild an NBA team.
	The story doesn’t actually begin in Orlando, but deep in the heart of Texas in the river city of San Antonio in the fall of 2004. A young broadcast journalism graduate and basketball player from Emerson College in Massachusetts had just scored the internship of a lifetime with the San Antonio Spurs (ESPN). He performed odd jobs including taking recently acquired players house hunting in the San Antonio area. Hennigan was a quick study, and in 2005 was promoted to be the team’s basketball operations assistant helping lead them to back-to-back championships in 2004/2005 and 2006/2007 (Wikipedia). In the 2007 campaign, Hennigan was promoted to be the director of basketball operations for the Spurs and the following year, left to become the Oklahoma City Thunder’s Director of College/International Scouting (Wikipedia). During his two years as the Director, he was responsible for drafting Russell Westbrook, James Harden, and Serge Ibaka, who developed into the core for their 2012 team that lost in the NBA Finals to the Miami Heat. Due to his success, he was promoted for his final two years in Oklahoma City to assistant General Manager under the acclaimed Sam Presti (Wikipedia). On June 20th 2012, the Orlando Magic concluded that Rob Hennigan was the General Manager that would return them to greatness (Orlandomagic.com).
Hennigan learned the necessity of landing talented draft picks in his years in San Antonio and Oklahoma City, and planned on taking this approach in Orlando. The Magic’s old General Manager, Otis Smith, drafted players he hadn’t actually scouted and consistently wasted draft picks on players who are not in the league anymore. In 2005, Smith made one of the most monumental mistakes in draft history by drafting Fran Vasquez with the 11th pick overall. Vasquez, a Spanish post player, to this day has never played a single game for the Magic due to his desire to continue playing professionally in Spain. 
Hennigan, after intense scouting, was tasked with adding two promising young players with the 19th and 49th overall picks (ESPN). When the 19th pick arrived, Hennigan had a few different directions he could have chosen to go. Perry Jones III and Jared Sullinger two big conference players who had been free falling down the draft board were available but Hennigan stuck to his scouting. He selected Andrew Nicholson, a 4 year physics major and basketball star from tiny St. Bonaventure College in Western New York as his first pick in Orlando. Nicholson was fresh off a near upset of Florida State in the NCAA Tournament and scouts raved about his mature post up game and wisdom beyond years. Most reviews of the draft overlooked Nicholson, but he currently averages 8.1 points and 3.4 rebounds per game and was named to the 2013 BBVA Rising Stars Game for the top rookies and sophomore players in the NBA (ESPN). Ranked by scoring, Nicholson ranks ninth among rookies and ESPN has gone as far as comparing him to Utah Jazz All Star Al Jefferson (ESPN).
With the 49th pick, Hennigan pulled the trigger on the 23-year-old Power Forward from Norfolk State University, Kyle O’Quinn. O’Quinn became known for a performance that helped 15 seeded Norfolk State knock off 2 seeded Missouri in the NCAA Tournament in one of the biggest upsets ever. O’Quinn initially had to fight for playing time, but carved a firm position in the Magic’s rotation, currently averaging 7 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 1.6 assists per game in his last ten games and 4 points and 3.3 rebounds for the season (ESPN). Now, nearly done with their first NBA campaign, Hennigan’s two hand picked rookies have solidified his reputation of efficiently rebuilding through the draft.
On July 9th Hennigan made his first trade, which ended up working out terrifically for Orlando. Hennigan sent away fan favorite and reigning NBA Most Improved Player, Ryan Anderson, to New Orleans for Gustavo Ayon, a promising Mexican center. Ryan Anderson was a free agent and was close to a deal to sign with New Orleans so Hennigan wisely acquired Ayon and a trade exception instead of letting Anderson walk without anything in return. A Trade Exception or the NBA’s version of store credit is an extremely valuable commodity to have as a rebuilding franchise. This trade served as a precursor for the Magic’s midseason trade to acquire Tobias Harris, Doron Lamb, and Beno Udrih for JJ Redick, Gustavo Ayon, and Ishmael Smith. Tobias Harris, a sophomore player buried in Milwaukee’s rotation, caught Hennigan’s eye as an intriguing asset when the Magic decided it would be superfluous to resign Redick at the price he would command. Since acquiring Harris, his averages have rose from 4.9 points, 2.5 assists, 0.5 assists, and 0.3 blocks a game to 16.3 points, 8 rebounds, 1.5 assists, and 1.4 blocks a game (ESPN). Redick is unlikely to even resign with Milwaukee so Hennigan is being applauded for acquiring a potential all-star talent without giving up major assets in return. Trade success and hitting on your draft picks are two sure fire ways to rebuild your team effectively and efficiently as Hennigan has demonstrated so far. 
After Hennigan’s success in the draft and his first trade, it was time to add a head coach to lead the franchise. Hennigan decided upon former NBA player and San Antonio Spurs Assistant Coach, Jacque Vaughn, on July 28th, 2012 (ESPN). Vaughn played college ball at the University of Kansas where he was the all time assists leader and played 12 seasons in the NBA with Utah, Atlanta, Orlando, New Jersey, and San Antonio (Wikipedia). After retiring in 2009, Vaughn joined San Antonio’s coaching staff where he eventually became legendary coach Greg Popovich’s top assistant. Vaughn also played for the famous Utah Jazz coach Jerry Sloan in his time in Utah as a player. Hennigan cited his main reasons for hiring Vaughn were his experience with elite head coaches and his commitment to talent development and character. Vaughn has done a tremendous job developing the young players that Hennigan acquired through the draft and in trades. Nikola Vucevic, a second year player acquired in the Dwight Howard deal, has averaged 12.5 points and 11.5 rebounds under Vaughn’s watch and Maurice Harkless, also a part of the Dwight Howard deal, has shown tremendous potential as a versatile rookie swingman averaging 7.6 points per game and 4.4 rebounds a game with Vaughn at the helm. (ESPN) Vaughn has earned major respect from coaches around the league and has an extremely bright coaching future.
On August 9th, 2012 the time had finally had come to trade Dwight Howard. The Magic ended up receiving Aaron Affalo, Al Harrington, Moe Harkless, Nikola Vucevic, Josh McRoberts, Christian Eyenga, and five protected picks (3 firsts and 2 seconds) from the three other teams involved (ESPN). Aaron Affalo has turned out to be an integral veteran scoring force. He is currently averaging 16.5 points, 3.7 rebounds, and 3.4 assists per game (ESPN). Harrington struggled with injuries most of the year but has a tradable contract to be used in future acquisitions. McRoberts and Eyenga are both no longer with the team and were included to make the salaries work out. The media including Jacob Lee of Bleacher Report who called Hennigan “the most inept GM in the association” initially slammed the young General Manager. Hennigan and the Magic got the last laugh however with Dwight Howard and the Lakers clawing to make the playoffs in the West, and Philadelphia decimated by Andrew Bynum’s eighty year old like knees keeping him from putting on a 76er uniform this year. The Magic and Nuggets made out like bandits with Orlando acquiring Vucevic, who has emerged as a franchise center, Affalo, and Harkless who looks to be the swingman of the future. The Nuggets, after acquiring Andre Iguodala, have propelled themselves to the 3rd overall seed in the Western Conference and seem poised for a deep playoff run (ESPN). Hennigan had once again proved his blueprint was a winning one and he was a phenom that warranted attention. 
As of right now, the Magic sit at 19-54, which is good enough for second worst in the NBA (ESPN). You might be wondering about how the Orlando Magic’s rebuilding plan is the future blueprint if their record is that bad. What wins and losses can’t measure is establishing an identity as a team and young player development. Coach Vaughn has established a strong identity of character and leadership in the locker room and the players have responded. Magic players constantly are in the community serving meals, reading books to kids, and building playgrounds. The team has become a family, and unlike the years before there is absolutely no drama or turmoil in the locker room. The Magic have five players all under the age of 23, who play significant time on the court and have made an immediate impact. Hennigan learned this approach of tearing the team down, acquiring young talent and draft picks, and gaining cap flexibility during his years helping rebuild Oklahoma City and San Antonio. In fact, the Magic are right on pace with their role models, Oklahoma City, who finished 2008-2009 with a 23-59 record overall (ESPN). The Thunder now one of the top three teams in the entire NBA due to their diligent, wise rebuilding tactics. The main reason the Magic are rebuilding right now is due to the rudimentary mistakes made by their old GM, who didn’t build through the draft, created salary cap hell, and ultimately drove the team into the ground. Hennigan’s approach to running a team is all about sustained success through the tactics mentioned above. Doubt him now but know you’ll look silly when Hennigan returns the Magic to glory.

1c1atl,0,2013-04-09,What just happened to me? Can anything be done?,hurting_guy,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1c1atl/what_just_happened_to_me_can_anything_be_done/,"Throwaway...

It started when they left because of the ""affair."" My awesome team, the three amigos, was down to just one. Me...
It was the most difficult loss the church faced. Two beloved youth workers gone in an instant. It was an extreme loss for me. It's amazing how close you get with people when you spend everyday with them. Doing everything together and becoming more like family than co-workers. They were my best friends. For the first time I could say with a mature understanding of the word that I had found friends that I truly loved. I loved them.

I almost quit right then and there, but the ministry needed me. We were right in the middle of our busiest season. Missions trips, camps and other events where looming ahead and someone needed to lead them. Since I was the only one left in the youth ministry department, It was going to have to be me. I didn't do it alone, though. The summer intern came on full time to help, but she was a wreck, she loved those two just as much, if not more, than I did. There were multiple times where she wanted to leave. That hurt a lot. But we were the ones the ministry needed. So we stepped up and lead it through its most difficult time ever. 

Summer Camp was where it started to get real bad. Me and the director, who is on staff at the church, butted heads all summer. He didn't like that I disagreed with him or handled things differently. It got to a point where he got so mad that in front of all our teens, he puffed his chest, jabbed his finger into my chest and tried to intimidate me. That was not cool, you don't put your hands on anyone. Especially if you are being aggressive and he was. That happened at the beginning of senior high summer. 

We got into more and more fights, mostly about the band, their conduct and their dress. I thought it was silly, so I disagreed with him, but I enforced it in the end. I went as far as sitting band members for a night or two. 

This had its ramifications, though. Most of my free time was trying to console the band. They were angry, hurt and upset. One day, after a not so encouraging speech from the director, a huge argument erupted. The band had hit their lowest point. It was a very emotional time, so who could blame them? I did all I could to try and pick up the pieces but I think that summer took its tole on all of us. 

People slowly started pulling away. I already knew the director didn't respect me. The intern was saying she didn't want to be there. The head band member was slowly pulling away, students were telling me how they did not like being at youth group anymore, the worship pastor and I had our differences and it just seemed like slowly but surely I was being left all alone to face the pressures of this job. I was nervous to talk to the head pastor at the time. 

It was the darkest time in my life, for sure. I was emotionally a mess, struggling with depression and questioning my position. I had taken on much more responsibility, but I had received no compensation financially. This was going to be an ""opportunity"" to see if I was the man for the job. So I stayed at the same rate, doing much more work and having much more responsibility. After a year, they would evaluate and consider officially giving me the job, but that was not guaranteed.  This took its tole on me physically as I ate away my feelings. I gained about 50 pounds. My marriage was also a wreck during this time. My wife an I had multiple conversations where we were both in tears feeling as if we were one sentence away from ending our marriage.

I finally told the pastor that I'm not the guy they wanted but that I would stay on to support someone. 

I felt relieved to get that off my chest, but 5 months later as I write this I'm still in the same position. 

I realized later that youth ministry was not for me and that my gifts and passions would be better suited for the media director position that had just opened up. I talked with the pastor and the worship pastor and they supported my decision. 

This also felt good. But I was still working as the head youth guy, where I felt I didn't belong and where I felt I was drained more and more each day.

I kept pushing for as long as I could. I wanted them to find a youth pastor to fill my role, but I got to the point where I was running on fumes. Since the summer, I had been pushing, giving and trying to do all I could for the ministry, but I was burnt out. 

I went into the Pastors office. I sat down and told him that, ""I knew he needed me to keep pushing but that I wasn't sure how much longer I could go on."" We told people that things wouldn't change until someone new came on, but it was getting to a breaking point in all areas of my life. I'm guessing he sensed my burn out and offered a proposition. I would start transitioning into the Media role while the associate pastor became interim youth pastor. That sounded good to me, so I complied. The Pastor talked with the associate pastor and with the worship pastor (who would be my new boss) and everyone seemed to be fine with it. Or so I thought....

I was called into the worship pastors office and sat down a few weeks later. The Pastor came in and they both explained to me that because of the decision made, people felt hurt and betrayed by me. They said they felt I wasn't being a team player and that my character was called into question. They said there were consequences to my actions and that I had 3 options. I could resign right away with 1 moth severance  I could work for 3 months and then resign or I could take the Media job and be on a probation period for 1 year where I would need to own up to what I had done and reach clearly defined benchmarks every 3 months. (And from what I understand, this third ""probation"" option wasn't even on the table for a while. Which means there was a period of time where the only options for me were to leave. EVENTUALLY, they came up with the third option, but the fact that it was last and only thought about later speaks volumes. It means they were ready to let me go for going to the Pastor, telling him how I feel and then accepting an offer he proposed which was also accepted by the worship pastor and the director. I didn't fight for it, nor would I have fought against it if the Pastor had told me to stay on longer. I simply agreed. Apparently, this is enough to almost get you immediately fired.)

At that point I had some cognitive dissonance. What do they mean what I had done? Wasn't this something they offered and supported? They didn't ask me to keep pushing through, they didn't ask me to stay on for a little bit longer and I didn't ask to switch my role immediately. I finally had the guts to talk to my Pastor about how I was feeling and he offered a solution. I simply agreed to that solution. Sure it was going to be a little crazy, but we went through this before and I would still be around to help in whatever capacity they needed. I wasn't just dropping everything and leaving the youth ministry to fend for it's own. For the two weeks after my initial discussion with the Pastor, I was in full support mode for the youth ministry. I would continue to support for as long as they needed.

They kept telling me that the reality was people were upset. But the other reality was that no one who was on my side before, went to bat for me when people got upset. The people who I thought supported this move, let everyone get mad at me, they didn't come to my defense. 

They stuck with the story that it was a character flaw on my part, that I was not a team player and that now my entire job was in jeopardy. 

I didn't know what to say, I was shocked, hurt, and appalled. I felt betrayed, confused and angry. It seemed like everything was going to work out and this bomb gets dropped on me from nowhere. 

One minute my boss and future boss are saying that everything is going to work out and they next they are telling me that my job is in jeopardy and that I only have 3 options 2 of which are to resign. 

I understand that I came to talk to the Pastor during a busy time and that he may have offered something he didn't mean to, but to allow such extreme consequences fall on me seems unreasonable. It seems extreme. It seems wrong. 

For nearly a year I had given of my self to this church, ministry and congregation as they where going through a deep loss. I did it because they needed it. I was not given a raise, my salary remained the same, but I kept pushing. 

And in the blink of an eye. From a simple sit down with the Pastor and an agreement to something he proposed, my character is flawed, trust is broken with multiple people, and I barely have a job. 

It doesn't seem fair

I don't believe I deserved this.

I have never felt more disrespected in my life.

TL;DR - Burnt out at old Job. Talked to boss. Offered new Job. Weeks later, job in jeopardy because people got mad. Either I take a probation period and prove myself or leave."
1c1amq,1,2013-04-09,Haven't been happy in a while and just need to vent and rant.,PresidentQwark,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1c1amq/havent_been_happy_in_a_while_and_just_need_to/,"First off I don't know if I actually have depression but I didn't know where else to type this so whatever.  (probably wall o text incoming)

I'm a 21 y/o male currently enrolled in college pursuing and degree in History.  The only reason I'm even in college was because it was either apply or work in a door factory with my dad until I figured something out.  College with my friends sounded better.

I hadn't planned on going to college because I didn't take High school seriously.  No AP classes, slept all the time.  Finished with like a 2.5gpa and 22ACT.  Went to college and did horrible my first two years.  1.1gpa my first semester and a 1.8gpa two semesters later. It's currently at a 2.5 with about 1 year left after this semester finishes.

I feel I'm behind academically compared to everyone.  Failed college algebra twice.  Can't write a paper worth shit...etc.  I would drop out if not for paying entirely in loans so I might as well at least get that degree to make my parents happy.  Grades are too low to change to a major that's worth while and are too bad to get internships.

I don't care to talk to my parents ever as we have nothing in common and they just irritate me.  I respect them though and do whatever they wish (if I can at least).  Hate my only brother.  He's 23 but acts like a 14 year old girl.  Never plan on speaking to him again.

I have a few good friends but like to be by myself most of the time.  Never go out to parties.  Haven't really made any new friends at college besides one new roommate.  Still have yet to ever have a conversation with a girl that lasted over 2 minutes (not even exaggerating).  I've never had a girlfriend or even a girl I'd consider ""just a friend"".  Never been kissed/held hands, felt anything other than the ""wow that girl is cute/hot"" thoughts after seeing them around campus.

The reason I don't try to get relationships is because there is nothing about me that another girl would find relationship material.  I'd rather watch tv/game by myself without anyone else talking then have a stimulating conversation.  My body is pretty average but my face is well below average.  My voice is nasally and almost mono tone and I mumble a lot apparently. When in a group of people even if I know them I almost never say anything.  My diet is horrible and I've completely stopped working out because I don't care about my looks anymore.  I'd rather the girl in question move on to someone better than waste her time with me. 

All my hobbies I just do to pass time now because I don't really have fun anymore.  Unless I get really high.  No car and no money so new hobbies are out of the question.  Plus nothing looks interesting to me.  

Most people say I'm the ""nicest"" but I really only act nice because I hate confrontation.  Most of the girls and people my roommates bring over I just want to scream at and tell them to fuck off because they get so fucking annoying when drunk.

I have never attempted and never will attempt suicide but if I didn't exist I'd feel so much better.  So much time, money and energy was wasted on this piss poor excuse for an adult I've become."

I got accepted for biological sciences, and my goal is to get a job within the medical field when I grow up.  I do not want to become a doctor, and have been thinking about pharmacy or orthodontics, but am open to anything else that seems fascinating to me.  I heard that many of the students at UCI are planning on going into med school, so I am wondering if other goals besides getting into med school(such as pharmacy or dentistry school) are still excellent at UCI.  Will their be a lot of opportunities for internships around the area?

Studies will be my number one priority, but I also want to enjoy my time there.  I hear that UCI is a commuter school and that it gets pretty empty during weekends, but about how bad is it?  Is it like half the school population leaves?  If so, thats kinda lame, lol.  Also, how often are there parties?  I'm not that huge on parties but I like the option of being able to go and just getting kinda messed up every now and then, hahaha.  

The other option that I am thinking of is UCSB, by the way.

Any information, thoughts, suggestions, etc would be awesome (:"

What are some GIS skills that I can work on that I can use later on to take full advantage of this opportunity?

1. How hard is it to find a job? I'm not looking for anything amazing, just a part-time job. Maybe at a grocery store or something.
2. Is it a nice place to bike around the campus area? Bike friendly? Are there any places to get away from the streets and cars and stuff and just be in nature? (Don't have a car and would preferably like to bike there if possible.)
3. How are the houses? I want to live off-campus. Are the landlords generally okay? Are the houses in good condition? Can you find a room in a house that's pretty close to the school for $550 or lower?
4. I'm pretty introverted and have social anxiety but one of the reasons I'm going to university is to try to improve those aspects of my character. What activities in Ottawa should I absolutely do in first year to meet people and make friends?
5. To english majors: How is the English program? Do you recommend it? Do you do internships during the study period? What kind? Have internships led to any job offers for you or people you know?
6. To english graduates: how is life afterward graduation? What are you doing now?
7. I've started a university a bit late after doing other things for a few years and I will be 24 in September. Any tips for an older student?

So I am going to be in Hungary (Budapest) for an internship for all of June.

The internship itself is at Nagyvarad ter and I was looking to stay in downtown Pest and take the metro out. I came here (r/Budapest was pretty dead) looking for some advice on housing for my month there. So far, my ideas have been to take a long term stay at a hostel, look into renting a dorm room at a University (if this is possible, I know mine does it) or subletting/staying with people. 

What I am looking for would be a very central location and an opportunity to meet people, costs are kinda secondary.
I am a student and can understand/speak Hungarian, but cant read or write.


Let me know if you have any suggestions!"

¹ I obviously cannot guarantee you will get a job with a Fortune 100 company, or any company for that matter in this economy. There are too many factors out of my control. But neither can a college. And you have to pay them. And I've seen a lot of resumes of so-called tech graduates. They don't have any cloud experience on there.

² I also cannot guarantee the term length of the internship if you are not a good fit for our company, 6 months is the minimum based on current business plan. [It is up to you after that, if you wish to stay on]

1c66ey,1,2013-04-11,My CeaseFirePA Story,[deleted],progun,https://www.reddit.com/r/progun/comments/1c66ey/my_ceasefirepa_story/,"On December 8th, 2011, a shooter entered the campus of Virginia Tech, killed a cop, and then committed suicide when he spotted another law enforcement officer. On that same day, I received an email with the subject line of “BREAKING NEWS ALERT” from a group I had never heard of: CeaseFirePA. The letter, from their then-director Max Nacheman, just linked to a CNN article. That was about it. 

It was the beginning of a long, trying campaign by this group that has recently come to a head. I just thought I would share this experience and see if anyone sees an opportunity in this whole thing.

CeaseFirePA is a nonprofit which supports gun control here in the state of Pennsylvania. Since December of last year, they have been shamelessly taking advantage of the recent events in Newtown to push a gun control agenda. They’ve garnered some real attention in the press here in Philadelphia as of late as a result. On the surface, they are vocal supporters of the Unholy Trinity: universal background checks, the smokescreen of “gun trafficking,” and a ban on “assault weapons” and “high capacity” magazines. 

But make no mistake: that very first email about the murder/suicide at VT wasn’t just a news bulletin. Looking back at it, I saw that it had an appeal from Mike Carroll, apparently the Former Police Chief of West Goshen, PA. (Lord knows where that even is.) In it, he was advocating against the rights of citizens from out of state to exercise their rights to Concealed Carry here in the state of Pennsylvania. He claimed that this was going to get police officers killed. In light of the remarkable PoliceOne survey that was released, I think statement looks ludicrous right now. 

Anyway, if you want help getting rid of CC permits, you don’t come to me for help.

I unsubscribed from CeaseFirePA’s email list. They didn’t stop sending me emails. They were being sent to my school email account. To this day, I do not know how they got it. I wrote a reply to Mr. Nacheman, telling him that he was wrong to treat CCL carriers that way and that I oppose criminal use of guns as much as anyone else. I unsubscribed again. Still, CeaseFirePA continued to send me emails. For a while, I wondered if I could hit them for sending me spam because the “unsubscribe” feature did absolutely nothing. It was infrequent enough that I didn’t get really mad, but not so infrequent that I forgot about them. They’ve been on my list for a while.
So recently, with this latest round of gun control proposals following Newtown and CeaseFire’s new push, I got completely fed up with receiving their emails.

 I wrote a letter and send it directly to them.  In it, I addressed the fallacies in their reasoning, the reasons I have for needing firearms (i.e. no one else but me is able to protect myself and my people in dangerous parts of Philadelphia,) and I threw in facts from the Feds and DHS about the real profile for mass shooters as well as . (As far as I can tell from police records, Philadelphia only saw one death from a rifle or shotgun in 2012.) I requested that they tell me how they had gotten my email address since it was never given out or volunteered and I never requested to be included in their email chain. I unsubscribed again.

Wouldn’t you know it, I got another email appeal from CeaseFirePA two days later, asking me to show up and demonstrate support for the gun bill that’s now in the Senate. This time, it wasn’t sent to my school address. This time, they had my personal email address- not my school email. 

It’s kind of ironic (or unsurprising?) that CeaseFirePA, an organization dedicated to trampling on the rights of law-abiding citizens and treating them like criminals, is completely open to injecting itself into my online world without my permission. Yes, I know that I could block them or send them to my spam folder. I’m not worried about the content of their emails, which are the same garbage recycled through the news media every day. I’m just getting completely sick of the way that they conduct themselves. It’s completely inexcusable. 

I still wonder- but am not entirely sure- if someone who knows me and disagrees with my position didn’t originally slip them my email. Maybe I’m just getting a little too crazy.

Anyway, I’m currently thinking about what the wisest next step to take would be. (Sorry if I was pretty wordy with this post! I tend to be that way sometimes.) I don’t want to call their office and just have some intern pull me from their email list. I want to really get my voice in on this whole thing. I’m curious if anyone else has had a similar experience, or if you’ve got any creative ideas on how to deal with this situation. 

TL;DR CeaseFirePA, a gun control group trying to get rid of Concealed Carry, hasn’t heeded my request to stop contacting me for over a year. Now they’re taking advantage of Newtown, misrepresenting me, and I want to fight back.

This is a problem cause I need to successfully complete that exam to have all the points required to proceed my study. There is a change that I will have another change though.
 Meanwhile my shoulder still hurts, although they say it has cured. 
Got an exam which I thought went really well. Felt good for a week, result: I failed. Now I have only one change left for that as well.

Received an email today, they have rejected my internship (don't really know how to pronounce it in English). It's required to make 400 hours to successfully complete the first internship. I made little over 300 because of the accident I had. They don't give a shit and say that I just have to figure out a way to get to 400 hours.

I really reached a point of ""fuck this shit"". I feel like since the start of this year I had no successes at all. I know, I should feel good because there are probably people worse of than me.

My work is near the intersection of N 36st St and N Fremont Ave, so closer to there (University district?) is better.

I was wondering if anyone of you could point me in the right direction for converting these tapes. I assume it'd be just plug a vhs player into video/sound in on the computer and capture from there.

I’m Alan Grayson, and I represent Florida’s 9th Congressional District. Ask Me Anything.

Some of you may know me from my [September 2009 speech on health care reform]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-usmvYOPfco). I explained that the Republican health care plan amounted to, ""Don't get sick, and if you do get sick, die quickly.” What you may not know is that Aaron Swartz was an intern in my office, and someone whom I admired. I [spoke at his memorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Slmbmd69QHM), and am glad to have a chance to share thoughts with the community he co-founded.

Yesterday, President Obama released a budget that included the chained CPI, which cuts the cost-of-living adjustment for seniors on Social Security.  I have said this many times before, but I will say it again now: I will not support any cuts to Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid benefits. Over the past month, more than two million of you have signed on to our [No Cuts petition](http://no-cuts.com?source=RedditIntro), saying the same thing. As of today, over 30 Members of Congress have co-signed our letter to President Obama pledging to vote against any cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid benefits.

Right now, I am stepping into a House Democratic Caucus meeting on chained CPI cuts. When I return at 4PM, I look forward to answering your questions.

I just returned from my meeting. I will now begin answering your questions. 

UPDATE:  Well, we ALMOST answered all the questions -- a half-hour of ""overtime"" helped.  But now I need to go.   Thank you for giving me lots of things to think about.  I had a great time, here -- which means that I look forward to doing it again."

I would love to find roommates during that span of time to better immerse myself in the local way of life. I have never had roommates before, but I have been living in residential schools (I'm not sure the term in correct - that's like school dorms with private bedrooms) for 4 years now and have always kept good relations with my neighbors.

A bit about me ; on my personal time, I enjoy reading, watching movies, listening to music (quite a wide range depending on my mood), losing time on the Internet, hanging out or playing board/video games with friends, hiking, sailing, and visiting places (wow, longer list than I expected). Oh, and I like cooking, too - so if I could borrow your kitchenware that would be awesome.

I am ideally looking for people that I could be friend with more than just people willing to split the bill - at least people easy to live with and interested in sharing time and/or a meal (even more awesome if we can cook it together) once in a while. I don't really have preferences about the location as the commute won't really bother me for 4 months if it stays under ~1hr ; don't smoke, but don't mind if you do ; and have no problems with animals - except dogs, for which I have a quite irrational fear going on.
On a last note, like a certain number of people on reddit if I understood well, I need to be alone from time to time - if once in a while I seem to avoid you, don't be offended, I just need to recharge myself a bit.

Aaaand I was going to forget about the budget - I would prefer to stay under $1,500, but can go a few hundreds over if you propose me something truly great."

I've been cranking out applications for internships since the start of the year. I'm gonna need some advice. I'm a sophomore in college and I've had a manual labor job for the last 5 years but this will be my first internship if I get it (engineering). 

I've already had an interview for one position. It went really well, and I'm going to find out if I got the job in about a week. I think I have a really good shot at getting this one. 

I've been invited to another interview for a different internship, on the same day as the deadline I was given for finding out about the other job. I would rather have the first job (compensations are equal, but I care more about the experience for my resume), so what do I do if I get the other job before this new interview? Do I email the interviewer and say ""Sorry, something else came up,"" or do I just go on the interview anyway for the practice?

And my final issue, is about how to prepare for this interview. The hiring manager has informed me that I will be meeting with 6 people on this date. Whether this will be in a tour-like sequence one by one, or sitting at a table with 6 people grilling me at once, I have no idea. Obviously I want to prepare for the worst, latter scenario. 

I've been given the names and positions of those whom I will be meeting. Why was I given this information? Is there something I can do with it to increase my chances of landing the job? Do you have any tips for what to do when being interviewed by this many people at once?

I have saved up a lot of money and am ready to spread my wings finally.  In a month I will be moving in with a few friends.  

I am under the impression that, even though there will be four of us in the same duplex, everybody will be pretty much looking after their own meals.  Obviously, I want to avoid getting take-out every night, as its expensive and usually unhealthy.  So, I would appreciate any advice the Fittit community can provide me on how to shop for groceries.

My criteria is as follows:
- Cheap as possible, as I will be back in school in September.
- Lots of protein (because protein)
- Minimal carbs (don't want a lot of breads and pastas)
- Lots of veggies (because they're low cal, and I love veggies)

Relevant fitness information:

- Doing Strong Lifts 5x5 (2 months in, going to keep going until the program is no longer working for me (I'm following it to a 'T'))
- Currently 205 lbs at 6'1"", aiming to be around 180, so definitely cutting in the long term (I'm down from 220 since New Years).
- Strength is a long term goal, but right now my primary goal is to loose the flab
- Lift stats of the curious:

      - Squat 180lbs (still progressing, starting to get challanging)
      - Bench 115lbs (still progressing, not even close to challanging yet)
      - OHP 105lbs (stalled once at 95, and now once at this weight)
      - Barbell Row 135 lbs (Still progressing, starting to get challanging)
      - Deadlift 225 lbs (still progressings, starting to get challanging)

I am certain that I will probably be buying a lot of frozen veggies and pre-made salads.  Also, I'm sure I will buy a lot of frozen chicken breasts.  But, I need to know what I should buy to round out my meals, and to add variety.  Any of your favourite recipes would be greatly appreciated as well!

They don't fit as tightly on me as they do on the model, and a sales associate told me they'd be appropriate.

I have a BA and a masters degree in public and international affairs, which is kind of a hybrid of econ, political science and international relations, and I'm currently wrapping up an unpaid internship with a fairly prestigious organization. My bosses genuinely like me and the work that I'm doing, but for a number of reasons beyond my control there is a zero percent chance of me getting hired by the organization when my time here is up. 

I have been applying to jobs frequently for the past six months and have had very few responses, and have not even come close to getting hired.

So this leads me to the dilemma. At the end of my internship my parents would let me move back in with them, and I'm incredibly lucky to have that as a safety net, particularly because I am in debt (not a huge amount, but debt nonetheless). However, they live in a small town, where the opportunities in my field are negligible. 

My other option is to pick up and move without a job lined up to a city where I know no one but that has more job opportunities. Now this is terrifying to me, but beyond that is it even wise? I could probably pick up a service industry job to support myself, but it still seems like such a crazy, risky move. 

I don't really know who to discuss this with, because I don't know anyone in this situation, and I don't think this is even the appropriate place to put this up, but I thought maybe someone hear would be in a similar experience, or just generally have some insight. It would be very helpful to hear any and all reactions to this, or just any advice about how people in similar situations are making it work in this job market, because frankly things feel hopeless right now."

It's definitely at bit of an ""old boy's club"" - my particular demographic is seriously underrepresented. There are a few other women who are actively involved but they're older and more established. I'm 21 and will be graduating college in a month. 

I've made huge strides - I went to the state convention and got elected to the Executive Committee and I got offered two different internships that sound promising. I'm really excited about jumping in and I think I can gain a lot from my continued involvement.

But last night I was talking on Facebook chat to one of the higher-ups, a guy who has sort of shepherded me through the whole thing since I first contacted him, and to whom I more or less owe my recent successes. He said he'd been asked several times ""where he found me."" The answer to that question, which he gave, is that I found them.

For some reason that line really irks me - ""where did you find her?""

I can't put my finger on exactly what it is that is is bothersome about that. I'm not an ardent feminist by any stretch of the imagination - I think it too often succumbs to a victimhood mentality that is counterproductive to the whole movement. 

But that one little line kindled the feminist in me. It's definitely not something that would be said of a *male* my age who is eager to make a difference and move up the ladder. It's the kind of quip that's reserved for a young woman, and it denotes a weirdly utilitarian approach to my person - as if the guy had been out scouting for fresh meat. It just reeks of objectification.

-------------------------------------------------------
Edit: I figured you might want to know more about me. Here's a ""coming out"" story I had to do for my internship with my university's LGBT office. The **[blank]**s are where my last name would be:

“Coming out” I’ve learned that it doesn’t just happen once when you live with parents you know won’t accept you. When I was 14 and watching gay porn, I was still pretty damn convinced I was straight. One of the benefits of being a teenager is this wonderfully horrible ability to hold cognitive dissonance for the most extreme of social fluctuations in an effort to fit in. The first person I had to come out to was myself. This happened around when one of my friends at the time and I ended up hooking up. It was sudden and it was pretty damn hard to deny my sexuality with his lips all over my body. However, liking guys and being in high school can make for a very lonely experience. After that particular experience I knew I had a lot of self-reflection to do. 


Living abroad, within the military environment, and having super religious parents – this coming out process became my quest and I was on this journey to save myself, from myself. No one was openly out; I thought “who could I ask”. I felt I could relate to no one. My family did not have a member who was out and there would be almost no way I could contact them. How could I talk about this subject with counselors, if I could not admit this to myself completely? Slowly, thought after thought after thought I drove myself to the abyss of self-doubt, demotivation, and general apathy. I felt that my conservative environment would lash against me. That I would be the weird one, like that kid in those movies who’s only best friend was his dog or something. It was as if I was in a desert while a stampede of feral horses charged at me. Beating me into the ground, as if nothing could be heard and this weight was silent, heavy even.  Until that point, I had felt sorry for myself, cared only for what worldly perception would have of me that day. Self-aware to the point of guessing what small gesture, action, glance would produce in the minds of others. Having constant thoughts of reassurance that whatever action I fashioned would not be misconstrued as non-straight or queer; I had enveloped into myself. I ate myself alive from the inside-out – feeling like a fleeting star ready to implode. Where were my foundations? Where were my morals? Certainly I had to establish my own. Brick by brick, I cautiously looked over each attribute and decided if it was worth holding onto. Throughout this process, finally, my epiphany arrived through rebuilding myself. I knew it – I do not have to worry about what people would think about me, I do not need their reassurance – I am Nick **[blank]**, that’s who I am. Why would I do, what I do? Because I am Nick fucking **[blank]**, no questions needed. If I don’t need to question myself – they certainly do not need to question me. Liking whoever I want is who I am. Never will I have to “come out” I just need to be me; that’s who I am. “Dear world, I am Nick **[blank]**, I like boys, I like girls, I like working on classic cars, but make sure to pay attention because I will certainly will not be left unnoticed – I will do greatness through being who I am best, Me.” 


This is not a story of “coming out”, rather my story of how I became to be myself and proud to be myself. I might be a bit fickle and worldly at times, but at least I happen to know who I am. I do not need people to tell me who I am, I tell them – through my words, actions, and mannerisms. It is a fact of my being. I would not have it any other way. 

----------------------------------------

**td;dr - I like who I am and you can't tell me otherwise.**

I'm graduating with a BS in CS, 3.0 GPA. I've worked my way up from an internship started in 2010 to being a ""lead"" of a group of 4, so I would think that counts as 3 years of job experience. I've been working near full time this year while I finish up my last few classes, but I'm only getting paid ""intern"" salary, despite the workload, because I don't have the degree. 


I've been given two offers for ~$60k a year with fairly minimal benefits from both the company I'm working at now, and another I interviewed with. They both seem pretty low to me, but perhaps I'm trying to sell myself for a lot more than I'm worth. Most of the salary surveys I've looked up have new grads around 70k. With 3 years of both developing and helping manage projects, I would think I've got a bit more experience than a typical undergrad (maybe not).


I know it shouldn't all be about the money, and I think both companies seem fairly interesting, but I don't want to sell myself short out of the gate.


Anyone wiser have some recommendations on evaluating this kind of stuff? "

I am wet of ear and green of horn,

but for a career in research, for this I've been born.

Of references and prior lab experiences, I've got none to show,

but I am without a doubt, the most enthusiastic guy you'll know.

Bright-eyed, awe-struck and happy to be

in a world in which there are laboratories.

FSERQ is dead, NSERC is too tough

then work for you until I'm nothingness.

I am currently taking a course known as the engineering academy. This class is basically a four year, all of high school, course that prepares you for the first two years of college. Freshman year we worked with Solid Edge, creating 3D models of many of the design projects we had. Sophomore year was probably the most intense, time consuming year because it was so fast. Each 9-weeks we learned about a new engineering field, and then put that knowledge to the test through an experiment, and then we presented about the experiment, and how we used the knowledge we had attained to help in the experiment. Junior year is all about computer programming. We learned Matlab during the 1st semester, and are currently learning LABview surfing the 2nd semester. Senior year is where everything we have learned is put to the test. We work with local engineering firms to design a project that would benefit our local community. During this project everything we have learned throughout the past four years is put to the test. 
So, my question is going into college, am I really ahead in this field? Or do I need to do something over the summer (ie: internship, or study more information) in order to gain more experience?"

I have a degree, some years of management experience, and am contemplating two programs:  
` `  
Option 1:  A handful of undergrad prerequisites then a regular M.S. in Mechanical.  
Prereq's include:  Mech I &amp; II, Circuits, Thermodyn, Fluid Mech, Mech of Materials, Heat Transfer, and a few others.  But completing an undergrad is NOT required - you move directly into grad as soon as you clear the list.

How does the lack of an undergrad degree in engineering affect you out in the real world?  Is this something that other engineers would hold against you?  Or do the benefits of having an advanced degree outweigh the lack of background?

I'm leaning toward the graduate route, but would like to hear some professional opinions before making a permanent decision.

It's probably too soon to be having any sort of thoughts like 'what am I doing with my life' and the fact that I'm in college with so many opportunities should make this an easy fix...but it isn't really. Let me explain: the only thing I can compare this too is when somone you know has a baby and is starting a family while you're still singl with no prospects out there...my girlfriend is at a different college than me, and she seems like super woman. She's very popular and approachable, is always making new friends and always has crazy stories to tell me about college. She just crossed into her sorority tonight (which made me write this post) and she has an internship lined up for next semester in Washington D.C. On top of all that, she has an E-board position at her dorm and is planning on joining the crew team at her school. 

I want that. I want to have crazy college experiences, I want to be exhausted after every day because I'm living life to the fullest. Am I just sitting around all day doing nothing? No, let me tell you what I do...

I run a late night tv show on my campus. It's the most popular show on campus (not saying much haha) and I have a lot of fun with it. I also have an E-board position for the TV Network. Being new to the station I don't know everyone yet, but it's starting to feel like a second family, which is nice. I have an internship for over the summer, and hopefully something lined up in the schools nature preserve for next semester. I'm in a bowling league on campus and usually just chill on weekends with my friends. We rarely go out, just throw house parties...maybe that's the problem. I feel like I should branch out more and make new friends, that usually leads to new experiences. 

But even with all the activities I do, I still have huge chunks of my day open...I feel like I could do more, I want to do more...I just don't know what. I feel like I still don't have that one thing that is making my college experience what I wanted it to be, but I don't know what that missing piece is. 

I honestly just thinks it stems from my girlfriend. Not that I resent her at all, but she was always really popular in high school and I...wasn't really. Not disliked, just not in with the popular clique. So maybe I'm trying to emulate what she does to be ""popular""? I don't really know...I'm just a little confused. I think I'm doing enough with myself...maybe I just need to get more comfortable with who I am. Or maybe I need more friends that can give me what I want out of college... maybe I'll try a little bit of both. I know some people that can give me that crazy experience, I just don't go out with them as often. I think I need to try a multitude of things and see what works. But regardless, it just feels good to get that off my chest"

We're in a LDR but see each other every weekend (literally) and skype every night with texting at least every hour during the day.

The problem is that she is so stressed out and has no time to enjoy herself.  We just booked a trip to Thailand for the summer and so now she is stressing about money and taking out another loan for next year (she is definitely below the amount that I've heard of other people taking, so I'm not too concerned about her future finances).

I try to offer advice, such as quitting one of her jobs but she says that she has made a commitment.  I understand that it is a commitment but she is literally working herself to tears every night and always complaining during the day.  She also misses me, or at least shows that she's missing me more than I show, and so she sometimes stresses about that.

I have suggested meditation, but she says that she doesn't have time for it.  For a time she was depressed (undiagnosed) from her birth control but she has since switched. I suggested that she see a therapist and the one time she did and sent an email to the therapist with her feelings the therapist never got back to her and I assume this is why she does not want to go back.

Her family back at home is taking care of her dog, along with another 4 that they have illegally (3 is the max), and it has attacked the others and so she wants to find a home and I offered to look for a place for next year, but no promises.  Yet, I found a place that didn't take dogs and she literally broke down crying for a 15 minutes. This is yet another thing that she has to think about and I am extremely worried at what will happen if the dog does something else.

I feel like I'm at my wits end, as this has been going on for months with no end in sight.  Is there anything I can do to alleviate it, or just ride the storm for the next year until she graduates.

tl;dr GF has too many commitments and is overstressed and I think it's taking a toll on us."

1c43rh,1,2013-04-10,"I was asked a series of career related questions by a college student at my alma mater, and answered them with what I hope to be good advice. Thought /r/sciencecareers/ might like it.",man_risk,sciencecareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/sciencecareers/comments/1c43rh/i_was_asked_a_series_of_career_related_questions/,"How/when did you decide on your major?
I decided on Mathematics as a major during my sophomore year around Christmas time.  I had a class with a professor who I found to be extremely inspiring, and who pushed me to do it because they believed I would be very well suited to the major.  Before this, I was a music major, and for a little while afterwards I was a music and mathematics double major.  I dropped music to a minor halfway through junior year, when I started to get very serious about my career goals. 

What attracted you to your field of study?
I have always been good at math, and really enjoyed many things about it.  I love symmetry and probabilities, and thinking through interesting problems.  I was able to do those sort of things in mathematics, and as each class I took went very well, I became more and more sure that it was a good choice.

What activities/organization were you involved in outside the classroom when you were at Carthage?
I was in Carthage Choir all 8 semesters, Lincoln Chamber Singers for 2, and I acted in and sang in a few theatre shows and J Term operas.

What advice would you give someone who is trying to decide on a major/career?
Weigh things in your mind.  You have goals (or should, make some if you don’t) and you have things that give you satisfaction when you complete them and when you are doing them.  There are careers you could pursue that will lead you toward your goals, and there are careers that will lead to that sense of satisfaction and accomplishment.  These might not line you pockets or give you much free time, however.  Then there are careers that will make you a lot of money, or that do not require a lot of time or effort.  These careers may not lead to accomplishment of your goals, or may not lead to a sense of satisfaction or accomplishment, but they may make you feel more comfortable.  You have to strike a balance, and when things feel wrong, you have to be able to say “That’s it!  This sucks!  I am going to pursue that other thing I wanted to do!”

What are the top five skills someone should poses before considering this career path?
1.	Just about everyone needs to have computer skills.  You better be able to put Word Excel Powerpoint and Outlook on your resume.  If you don’t, start using them.  You can use excel to keep track of your budget, Outlook to hook up your Carthage and Gmail accounts and keep track of your schedule.
2.	You should probably learn a database programming language.  There are tons of mathy jobs that would benefit from this.  SQL is good, check out this link: http://sqlzoo.net/
3.	Learn to manage your time.  The human mind cannot multitask efficiently.  It is a one core processor, and if you are giving priority to two tasks at once, you are really just neglecting both of them.  Make your priorities into a list, and work on them one at a time until they are done, or set specific start and end times for when you will be working on particular tasks.  This will make you a much more sane person in general.
4.	Take a leadership role in what you are doing.  This is something you just have to learn by doing, and will benefit you greatly.  You are always going to have to interactions with humans, and having leadership abilities is always valuable.
5.	Get good at communicating your ideas.  You are going to deal with a lot of people who will not know what you are talking about, so you will have to figure out a way to relate it to them.  Start out by explaining your crazy hard math project to your cat, and then move up to your mom, and then to your friends.  Try to find ways to keep them interested.  This will benefit you greatly.

What kinds of courses are most valuable in order to gain skills necessary for success in this occupation?
Take a computer science course, and some courses that are more of applied math, such as financial mathematics and physics.  You want to be able to take your theoretical mathematical understanding and turn it into something useful.

What would you say is the most important part of a resume?
Experience.  Make sure your experience section includes accomplished goals for each position, like:
Tutor – Carthage College
Helped students understand complex materials
I accomplished this goal by implementing this plan
I improved the grade of students I tutored by an average of one letter grade by implementing (insert fancy teaching style or trick here)

What is a typical day on the job for you?
Right now, it is working with project teams to support Epic’s healthcare software reporting suite.  I have meetings with Epic customers throughout the day usually, and other time I spend reviewing and resolving issues that customers or Epic has reported.  

How much travel or variety is involved in your job?
I travel for 2-3 day about once every other month, and have been to 5 different states since starting, so it is pretty varied.  As far as variety, the job does not tend to change that much.

Was this the first profession that you had chosen?
No.  I studied actuarial and that is where I intend to go next.

Are there certain professional associations unique to this field?
I am now going to begin talking about actuarial, because there are none with Epic. With actuarial, there are designations and a defined career path with much room for advancement.  SOA and CAS are the main conferrers of designations.

What kind of work/internship experience did you have before this job?
I interned at Markel Corporation as an actuarial intern.  It was a great experience and I would highly recommend finding an internship to do this summer, if you haven’t already.

What do you wish someone would have told you about this occupation?
I wish someone would have told me to be patient and wait for the right career opportunity.  It can take some time to really get going with your career search, and you will then need to wait until something that is balanced and correct for your tastes comes along.  Don’t jump at the first thing just because you want to be employed, but if you do, continue searching for what you really want to do.

Would you consider this to be a growing industry? 
Both actuarial and the IT industries are definitely growing, but entry level is super competitive.  Be ready to fight for it.

What would you change about your current position if you could?
I would have waited to find a better one, and the one I got into would have lots of research and development included in it.

What are typical entry level salaries for this occupation?
For actuarial – 45,000-65,000
For IT – Varies wildly, but probably between 30,000 and 60,000

What are some related occupations?
For actuarial – Insurance in general is pretty mathy stuff, from underwriting to product coordination.  Also, risk management and general data analysis are related.  For IT (Epic) there are lots of different positions, like being a database administrator, computer wiz, programmer, software developer, technical support, project manager, etc.

I'm starting an internship pretty soon working in an immunology lab at a local hospital. I have orientation in the morning, which I'm planning to dress and present myself nicely for, but I'm not sure how to dress for the actual position. I was told that they expect me to look professional/dress nice, but I'm concerned that wearing nice clothing in a lab setting may not be appropriate. I'm a 3rd year undergrad studying ecology, so I've had some pretty messy lab sections - should I expect this one to be different? How so? I've seen how physicians tend to dress for work (if not in scrubs) - is that what I should be aiming for?

I also don't really have much in the way of nice, formal clothing, so if something were to be soiled or ruined, it would make a decent dent in my wardrobe, which is pretty minimal to begin with. 

So any advice? Helpful tips? Amusing anecdotes?"

I'd just be curious to hear how you got started, what's it like, do you prefer it to working for a big company, etc. I figure if there was some sort of market for GIS analysts who can work from home, that I'd have more freedom to move around and stuff.

1c41nv,32,2013-04-10,How I (almost) landed my dream internship at my dream company,psant,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1c41nv/how_i_almost_landed_my_dream_internship_at_my/,"I'm posting this to share with everyone my experience searching for a summer internship. This is a story about Microsoft.

To preface this all, I am a huge Microsoft fanboy; I've always adopted their products early on and continue to use them as my primary devices. I own a Surface, a Lumia 920, and a W8 Desktop &amp; Laptop. During my undergrad, I was a Microsoft Student Partner on campus.

I'm currently in a Masters Program in Computer Science (my undergrad, however, wasn't CS-related). I applied for a summer internship position as a Program Manager. I got through the phone interview and was flown out to Seattle for a day of interviews. I had four interviews, with the last one being one with the hiring manager. They all went well.

Three days later, I was sent an email from my recruiter saying essentially ""we are going to offer you a position, when's the best time to talk?"" I respond and we are scheduled to talk. A week later, as I'm waiting for the offer call, I get a call from my recruiter. Apparently, something had ""changed"" in the system. When the recruiter checked, there was all ""Recommend for Hire"" ratings from the four people I interviewed with. But now, the last guy had changed his mind. Thus, I was not going to be offered the position. Heartbroken is an understatement for what I felt. The recruiter then said that they were going to fly me out to interview with a team that was ""a good fit for me."" That sounded great! Two weeks later, I hear nothing. Finally, I get a generic response form my university recruiter saying that all of their PM intern positions had filled up quicker than they had expected and that I was effectively out of luck until August. 

In a week period, I had gone from pure jubilation from landing my dream internship to rock bottom. This was back in January, and to this day I still don't have an internship locked up yet. It affected my psyche and confidence, as well as my motivation to apply for stuff.

I guess the point of all of this is, be careful when it comes to dealing with offers with companies. I was probably being naive when it came to these things, but just a bit of advice."

1c41fg,5,2013-04-10,A lady at my internship was staring at my hand today (my hand is like your hand except not really).,EasilyEnabled,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1c41fg/a_lady_at_my_internship_was_staring_at_my_hand/,"I was born with ten fingers but only seven fingernails. Three fingers on my right hand are bad at being fingers; they're more like stumps. They're all smaller than my pinkie (which is just a regular pinkie). 

Most people don't even notice, but I don't mind talking about my hand when they do. I don't mind showing people. I've even let people touch it. That kind of stuff used to bother me when I was a kid, but I'm almost 20 years old now and they've been part of me for as long as I've been me.  

I have an internship where I work with adult learners. Most of them are trying to get their GEDs. I was teaching this lady about commas and pointing at stuff in her workbook with my right hand (I didn't even think ""woah bad idea."" I honestly forget about it sometimes). So I'm almost positive she noticed.

Do you know that feeling you get when people stare at you? Like you might not be looking at them, but you know they're staring at you? Well this lady was *aggressively* staring at my hand. I could even see it register in face when I wrote something down. She noticed that I'm left handed; I don't write with the weird hand. 

I wanted to tell her to stop. I wanted to say, ""Look, I know it's ugly, but you're staring at my hand and it's making me uncomfortable."" But I didn't say anything to her because I don't think there's any way to make ""Hey are you staring at my hand?"" not awkward. And really, I didn't think it bothered me. So what if she's staring at my hand. I'm a big boy; people have done worse than stare before. But I sat down to read a couple of hours later, and I couldn't concentrate. I am definitely bothered. 

I can deal with people asking about it. Most of the time it's just, ""Hey, what happened there?"" and I tell them. People say I should lie about it, and I love the stories they come up with. People have suggested blaming it on everything from shark attacks to heinous sex acts. But I like that it's such a simple answer. I really don't mind talking about it--as you can probably tell given how much I talk about it-- but I don't want to tell a story about it. There's a part of me that thinks ""I was just born that way"" is the best story I could tell. 

I've just never had anyone *stare* at my hand before. I haven't been insecure about it for years. Today I am insecure. Today I wished for the first time in a long time that I had a normal hand that no one would ever stare at. "

I was nominated in October to teach Secondary English Education in September of 2013. I'll be graduating from a reputable liberal arts college this May with a degree in Geography and minors in African Studies and Peace Studies. Fall of 2011 I spent 5 months studying abroad in Kenya through the University of Minnesota's Studies in International Development program. The program is known for its intensity in terms of living conditions, isolation, and cultural adjustment. I lived with two different host families as well as interned at a clinic for children with physical and/or mental disabilities (I ended up teaching English and Math). On top of that I've done a ton of other volunteer work at my college, including tutoring adult ELL's. I've also had formal business experience, while interning at a top real estate management company for over 7 months. For recommendations,  I had the top teacher at my study abroad write me one, my boss at my internship in Kenya, my boss at my internship at the real estate management company, and a PCV who is a friend as well. I feel like I have a lot of valuable experiences in my life that should help, but there is a concern...

Two years ago I was on medication for depression and anxiety. I was also diagnosed with ADHD in that time frame and still take medication for it. My psychiatrist recommended to the Peace Corps that I be placed in a lower latitude environment (he believes I have Seasonal Affective Disorder) and that I also have a supply of Adderall. If those two conditions are met then he has no concerns with my ability to complete my service in the Peace Corps. 

Recently, the medical office requested that I fill out a personal statement on my mental health that was due by April 14th, so clearly they are reviewing my files. I turned it in last Sunday night and haven't heard more since then. In my statement I explained how I haven't had issues with depression or anxiety for two years, but that I also am diligent in taking care of my health during the long winters in the state I live because I realize how positively being outside in the sun impacts my mental health. I also talked about how I completed 5 months abroad without medication and without relapsing into depression or anxiety as well. I also indicated that I would like a supply of Adderall while I'm abroad to take as needed, at least for the beginning of my service. I also tried to present my mental health history as an advantage for service in the peace corps. I wrote about quite a bit more, but I think this explains the gist of it. 

I feel like I've done a pretty good job explaining myself, but I still can't help but worry that my medical history or the need to be placed in a lower latitude environment/have supply of Adderall will disqualify me for service...

Do any of you know of others who have been qualified for service despite similar mental health issues as mine? Do you think my needs wont be able to be accommodated? It would just be nice to hear from others who have gone through the application process with mental health issues. 

EDIT: Pre-cleared medically as of April 18th, forms have been sent to placement!"

I'm just worried because I don't want to sacrifice getting an A and a high GPA just to continue taking CS classes. This would become a problem when applying for internships since my uni isn't the greatest right now (I went here to save $$$).

Source: http://www.warriorsworld.net/2013/04/10/2007-vs-2013-the-good-the-bad-and-the-biedrins/

I need to tell a story here.

I know someone who used to be a PR intern for the Warriors back in the Run TMC era. Part of his job was to go into both team’s locker rooms shortly before the start of each game to retrieve the starting lineups. For most teams, this meant walking into the locker room and finding the head coach, who was usually drawing up plays on the white board. The intern transcribed the starting five from the coach to then deliver to the official scorekeeper.

But with Don Nelson, the intern’s job was always an adventure. Most times, Nellie was drinking a beer, and conversationally yelling and cursing with his coaches and players. But on some occasions, notice I said “some” because this happened more than once, the intern would search the locker room only to be directed by the equipment manager to the exact whereabouts of Nelson.

The intern would follow the directions back into the bathroom, hesitating as he squealed, “Coach?”

“In here, young fella!” barked Nelson.

From inside the bathroom stall.

Seeing only his shoes and drawn down belt and trousers, each time the intern would back step while saying, “I can wait.”

Each time Nelson answered with, “No need. I got my five.”

Nelson would then rattle off his starting lineup while sitting on the toilet. He’d end it with, “Can you grab me a beer and slip it under the door before you go?”

Now, can you imagine Mark Jackson doing that? Pastor Jackson?

I started an internship this week and I am already very behind. It pays great, and will look fantastic on my resume, but I'm realizing I'm not as qualified in my field as I thought.

I have no really close friends. Just two years ago I had this diverse assortment of people I could hang out with, yet I've spent 75% of my weekends this year sitting in my room alone. I have difficulty opening up to people, which in turn makes them unlikely to open up to me. A vicious cycle that has led me from a varied and exciting social life to barely leaving my room. I'm a stranger to my roommates, not to mention that I have exactly zero prospects for a girlfriend. I'll be moving into a studio apartment next year unless something drastically changes, which won't help things. 

I'm suddenly waking up from complacency to realize I'm lonely and depressed, and I see no way to change it. Its all downhill from here. I thought about posting this to someplace like [/r/needadvice](/r/needadvice), but I don't think there's really anything that an internet stranger can say that will significantly help me."

Today I went to the migration office to get myself registered and also to apply for a short residence permit.

And since I will stay for 4 months, I had already taken all necessary paperwork with me.

However, when I was at the office, the guy put a lot of information in his computer about me and finally handed me a form that has to be filled in by my institute to confirm the place where I live, and that was it. I asked him about the permit and he said that I did not need one because I was only staying for 4 months. 

I am now totally not sure whether this is correct, so is there someone who can help me out with this? I don't want to get in trouble later, so it would be nice to have some advise. "

I'm working at a software company as a programmer.

The office is an open space packed with people, around 30+ people. 

I went from a period in my life of some years at home with no one and started going to the internship. 

It was a real shock for me. After 3 weeks I still haven't made any friends.

And today, after some pressure from the workers (because of my anti-social behavior), I kinda revealed I had some homosexual activity in the past (which is true, although many many years ago and never done again). 

After that I started hearing some indirect talk on this, you know, the beginning of the bullying. 

Now, I really don't know what to do. I do know it won't get any better, only worse. I don't know if it is worth it.

If I don't go anymore, I do have the possibility of doing the internship in another place. If I go, we all know this can end very badly.

I want to become an iOS developer and feel that I have a few pretty good app ideas, but I think I need to sacrifice to make this happen.

For this reason, I am asking for an opinion. For those of you that are iOS developers or managers of a team of iOS devs, I pose this situation I am considering and am looking for feedback on what could be a huge mistake and possibly a larger waste of time.

I want to offer myself for a committed 6 months or a year to a company who would take me under their wing as almost an iOS intern and help build me into a functional developer. For this, I would ask that I not get paid, with the intent of being able to be transitioned and helped along the way. I want to learn how others develop apps, from beginning to end. 

Is this worth trying? Not sure if the payoff of seeing an unpaid worker in the workforce would outweigh having to hold my hand a little bit to get me to a point where I would be able to contribute to the business and the community.

EDIT: tl;dr I want to know what you think of offering myself as a slave to an iOS app developing firm for free to learn how to program well."

For example, a computer science major may have a good 2 years of experience working on C++ assignments, from nightly homework exercises to end-of-semester projects. But is that the same thing as using C++ in the professional world? What about someone fresh out of grad school applying to a research job, does their masters degree in make them qualified for a job requiring 2 years of research experience? When a hiring manager wants a Java developer with 3 years of experience, should count schoolwork as experience or are they justified in specifically wanting 3 years of working experience?"

I am a business major who has placed so much emphasis on the proper way to recruit, network, get an internship, and get a job. I had a very basic idea of how the whole thing is ""supposed"" to go, and I always assumed the most logical thing to do would be to move to a city in my state that's comfortable and familiar to me. 

The last few weeks I've begun to think differently and realize there is no set way to do any of this. I find myself wanting to move far away, to find a new place, to strike out on my own and become my own person, and shape this person however I see fit. I think this all comes down to not being afraid of the unfamiliar anymore. I want to be happy and do things I love, that interest me, and that give me a sense of satisfaction. I realize now its ok if every one of my friends or family doesn't support particular decisions I make and paths I take, because I'm living for myself and not for them. I'm now able to put things into perspective and realize that everybody has taken an imperfect and unique path, no matter what it seems. 

I am close to wrapping up a disastrous semester in which I did very poorly, mostly as a result of built up anxiety and depression resulting from constantly stressing about this. Now, I feel optimistic and ready to get back on track so I can start carving my life out for myself. 

This is rambley and vague, but I feel like it could help someone and like there could add a lot to this new mindset I feel I've developed. It's all going to be a great adventure. "

1. What company should I be looking to intern for? I understand that working through pharmacy school is recommended in securing a job after graduation. There are plenty of CVS in my area (socal) so would it prudent to try to intern there since there might be more opportunities? What about companies like walgreens/walmart/costco/target? 

2. If I am attending a three year program in Arizona, what are some things that I should do in order to increase my chances of finding a job back home in southern california? Since it is a three year program, I will not have summer breaks to intern back in my home state. 

3. I know that networking is important during pharmacy school, but what are some techniques that you guys have to maintain a professional relationship. I would say that I am decently sociable but how exactly is having friends different from having a vast network that helps in job hunts? 

Edit: Expanding on question one, what company did you intern for? Would you intern for them again if you were back in school? Did it lead to a job after graduation? Also did you like working there?

4 student loans:

1. $23,287 @ 6.8%
2. 2,555 @ 8.5%
3. 82,147 @ 7.9% 
4. 57,968 @ 6.8%

Right now I'm on a low-paid internship ($22,000 on the year), equating to about $1300 per month coming in. I have a credit score over 700 (703 average). I own my car out right (2008) and unless something awful happens it should be okay. I have about 13k saved up over the 4 years of loans. I have 3k in a ROTH IRA, but I'm not intending on touching that unless absolutely necessary. I'm looking at reasonably making about 65-70k in my first year of work and getting a job should be relatively easy as I have several prospects lined up (I should receive a doctorate in clinical psych in about 4 months from a respected school, APA accredited, etc. etc.). I should be able to boost my income about 10% after receiving my license (about $6,500) but will incur the responsibility of liability insurance after that (about $800). 

My expenses:

Rent: 1,100 p/m
Utilities: 220 p/m
Travel: 200 p/m
Food: 150p/m
Discretionary: 75p/m

The other noteworthy thing is that I'm planning on getting married in October of this year. Fiance is debt-free and making about 50k right now, with about 6k saved up (she has not done well in saving until recently). Right now she lives with her family, so her expenses are relatively low, as follows:

Food: 150 p/m
Utils: 100 p/m
Insurances: 140 p/m
Healthcare: 200 p/m (she has some conditions that require consistent care)
Travel: 250 p/m (gas mostly) 
Discretionary: ?? Don't know.

So, my questions:
1. How in the blue hell do I dig out of this debt? I know there are several options on the studentloans.gov website, but quite frankly I don't know squat about finance outside of giving the particulars and trying to be relatively frugal. 
2. Should I apply for these repayment plans prior to getting married since our combined income will be higher? 
3. I've heard from colleagues that staying in school (taking some online comm college courses) will carry over the debt into the next year, when more benefits and lower rates should take over? Is this even true? Can anyone show me the sources that say this, or even confirm the legitimacy of the hearsay? 
4. We're both likely to take on some inheritance from family situations, however not directly from our parents, is there a best way to receive this money?
5. To me, it makes sense to pay off that $2,500 loan at 8.6. It's the highest interest rate and I have more than enough to knock it out. Is this actually a good idea?

I appreciate any assistance you all can offer in terms of insight into how to improve this situation and whether #5 directly above seems like a good idea. Thank you so much.

EDIT: Thanks to the two of you that helped. I paid off the small loan/highest interest rate and am setting up a joint account with my parents to start the process. "

Last summer I worked for a construction company. I had a lot of responsibility, worked very long hours (occasionally weekends as well) and made a lot of money.

This summer I have been presented with two opportunities. The first is going back to the construction company. This would entail the same hours, at better pay than last summer, and at a different location. The location is at least a 30 minute drive to work in the morning, and an hour+ on the way home. The work is very challenging, and last summer it left me pretty miserable and tired. This job starts 3 days after my last exam, and will go right up until my next year of school.

The second opportunity is working as an intern at a law firm. The pay is significantly less (almost 10000 less) and the work would be basic office administrative tasks (faxing, record-keeping, mail distribution). The office has a great location (probably 20 minutes to work, maybe a little more coming home), starts a couple weeks after school ends, and goes until July with the chance for a one month extension.

I have to decide within the next couple of days which opportunity I will take. While the internship has a great location, easier working hours (40 a week compared to 55 in construction), and an experience I haven't had before, the pay is quite less and I work less. While I could be miserable working hard in construction, I could be bored silly doing office administrative tasks. 

I would love if anyone could weigh in on this as the decision has been plaguing me for the better part of the last two weeks. I have done pros/cons and everything but the decision is quite hard. As well, I worry that when building my resume next year, it might be better to have had an office job (despite its simplicity) than a second year in construction. 

If anyone has ever had a similar choice, or worked in either field, any advice would be greatly appreciated."

(US),KestrelLowing,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1c7lyk/what_kind_of_credit_card_should_i_apply_for_us/,"I am 23 years old, currently a graduate student, and due to a recent occurrence where my SO couldn't get a car loan initially (he had no credit score), realized that I need to build up some credit.

I have always used debit cards, I have a total of $6000 in student loans (my masters is funded, so no additional debt), I have enough to live on and a small emergency fund, but know that if I really came onto hard times, my parents and SO would help me out.

But I have one blip on my credit - I don't actually know what my credit score is, but about 2 years ago, someone charged me for electricity when I no longer lived in a house.  It was a bill for about $150.  I tried to get it taken care of, but after calling all the numbers they gave me, nothing happened.

I no longer have people calling me about it, but I'm worried about my credit.  I think that everything else is completely clean.

With that knowledge, can anyone suggest a credit card I should apply for?  I don't want to apply for tons and have them shot down as I understand that's an issue as well.  I currently have accounts with Bank of America and Wells Fargo (school only has Wells, internships only have BOA) if that matters."

If you feel strongly that unpaid internships are unfair and the law should be more strictly enforced to combat them, please get involved with intern rights groups such as Intern Aware. As long as people care about changing things rather than accepting 'that's just the way it is' even when 'it' is wrong, there's hope of doing something positive - as you all know, and I'm sorry I even just wrote that. Barf. But still true.

No amount of wishing on my part has helped him succeed, and I need to find out how I can be more proactive.  Endless craigslist, career builder, and monster searches have done nothing but grow my apprehension.

His school, being in a smaller NW town, did not afford him an opportunity to pursue a strong internship in his field and graduated him with no job experience.  Moving home to Seattle he has been turned away from every internship/entry-level experience as he is no longer an undergraduate student.  He can’t begin to apply to the postings I find due to this lack of experience and seems to be in a position of too far along for internships and not far enough along for the job postings.  Where do you go next? Does he go back to school for a PR graduate certificate? Does he blindly send out his resume to larger companies so they can file it away? 

He is a smart and caring man. In addition to his wit, he is passionate about coffee (roasting and all) and video games.  Any advice or leads on how to break into a marketing position in Seattle?

Do people who lie on their resumes about their achievements/GPA/abilities to make up for their lack of actual capabilities, make it look like they work hard but actually does nothing, can actually succeed in life? I mean, they're not even being desperate! They could just try a little.

I have a ""friend"" (who I no longer associate with once I quickly realized how full of shit he is) who may actually score a couple of internships in a business field. This is is someone who failed out of an introductory class three times and made excuses instead of trying harder each time and eventually just gave up and weaseled his way out of the requirement. He is lazy, lives like a slob, never contributes and makes his roommates clean up after him and gets extremely defensive when he is asked to step it up... but I overheard him on a phone interview listing organization and a sense of responsibility as strong suits. 

Do people not verify info from a resume? Do they just like people can only talk but has nothing to back it up? I refuse to believe they are this oblivious. He's not even charismatic! He talks like he is a salesman making the most rigid formal presentation to sell himself, and no one who knows him would ever buy it. And he is actually landing an internship at a semi-reputable place? Would they not even care if everything he says is bullshit?

I'm going through a bit of an identity crisis about my future right now personally, but hearing that his bullshit actually works makes me extremely jaded about life, how people who don't work hard can just lie and cheat their way to positions that other people truly deserve. It makes me feel like working hard doesn't matter. It makes me feel like he's invalidating everything hardworking people do to get to the same place as him.

Lets say you hire a bright new intern out of college. We will call her Iris. Iris performs well and does a great job and is a very likeable person. She shows up to work on time and is committed to her job. She does however, have a downfall; she has a serious spending problem. She constantly lives well beyond her means and can't keep to a budget at all. So one day Iris comes to you and says she pleads her case for a raise. She has done a good job and she needs a raise so you award her one figuring it would help her get out of debt. 

A few months go by and instead of getting out of debt, Iris starts spending more because she can afford the higher minimum payments on her credit cards and now she can afford a nicer car payment. Pretty soon she finds herself in extremely high amounts of debt. So she comes begging again for a raise. Lets say you are just the best boss ever and you give her another raise to help her out. More time passes and nothing changes. Now she is in more debt than the whole company makes in a year. She wants another raise. It would be honestly irresponsible to even consider the idea. You aren't helping her she needs to fix the problem which is the fact that she spends far more than she earned. Even if you can afford it or if its easy for you to increase her salary, it would be irresponsible to continue to enable such a terrible habit.

In case the metaphor wasn't clear Iris (I.R.(i)S.) is the US Government. The unfortunate part is that it is actually FAR worse than this with our Government. Our government doesn't ask for a raise, it simply issues itself one. If you don't pay, they come to your house, take away your freedom and lock you up with every other criminal. If you refuse to go they will use violence up to and including lethal force. Also, in the analogy Iris was a beloved hard working employee that you liked. We have a congress with a 9% approval rating, less than 1 out of 10 people feel like they are being represented. Our federal government has become a cesspool of incestuous backroom cronyism. The whole charade has become an overt oligarchy trampling every freedom we once had. The analogy is intentionally weak for the reason that everyone bitches about taxes but most feel like they are a necessary evil. My point being that even if you feel that way, it's irresponsible to cave and continue giving them more of our money without demanding they FIX THEIR SHIT. 

Imagine if IRiS started showing up late to work intentionally and started threatening to cost you clients and accounts if you didn't pay her more. You wouldn't tolerate it and Iris would find herself in the unemployment line. Don't let yourself be fooled. We are told that the things we find most important are what we would lose. Plain and simple it's extortion and it needs to end TODAY! It's our generation that is going to be picking up the tab and suffering the consequences. "

I'm attempting to start a career as an editor but have only been working on Avid for a few months now and only have one short student film to my name. 

I recently applied for an assistant editing position at a television production company here in LA. The interview went well but they wanted someone with a more of a technical background with Avid. However, they offered to bring me in on an internship for a month upon which they would hire me assuming I can pass an editing test. 

I'm planning to take them up on this offer, but the interviewer suggested I read up on synching/grouping footage from multiple camera shoots (along with script synching), and more generally, transcoding.

My first question is where should I go to read up on these things? My second question is regarding transcoding. I'm not really sure what she meant when she asked for me to know more about transcoding since she didn't explain what kind of workflows they deal with other than mentioning that they use a range of different cameras on each of their shoots. Am I crazy for thinking that it's kind of impossible to just ""read up"" on transcoding without knowing anything about what formats I'm working with?

I took a mini-road-trip this week and fell in love with a small wildlife rehab center (non-profit) about 5 hours from where I currently live...and I've never really felt such a strong pull toward something in my life. I feel like I'd want to volunteer as much time as possible there.

My problem arises when it comes to income, however. It's about an hour away from large city, so I do have some opportunity there...but I'd like to migrate toward a work-from-home type career, if possible - or just something where I wouldn't have to make that hour or so commute, and as cliche as it sounds, not work long hours for the pay.


Some background:
I currently 22 and work at a T-Mobile as a store sale rep, and while I don't mind the position, I know it's not something I want to continue doing, and moving up isn't all too appealing to me outside of the eventual increase in pay (anything above sales rep and I don't get commission, so I'd have to move up to store manager or something similar in a corporate/office position to make more than I do now). I like the tech part of the job much more than the sales part of it, and my tech knowledge goes wasted on 90% of my customers. I have a two-year degree in law enforcement from my local community college, but it's kinda useless as I don't really want to go into anything related to it (changed my mind when I was a semester away from the degree). Previous to that, I went to a university for a year toward accounting, but having taken some 2nd/3rd-year classes in my first year (they fit better into my desired schedule and there were no prerequisites), I decided it wasn't something I liked (although that has changed a bit otherwise now that I'm a bit older). I worked as a pharmacy tech after getting an internship from my high school, but similarly decided it's not for me.


Realistically speaking, I can't move to the area for at least two years (for reasons too long to explain), but since this career change isn't going to take place overnight and is probably going to require some sort of formal education, I figured I'd start preparing now. And doing the simple math, I'd need to take home about $1500/month after taxes (I claim zero exemptions so I get taken out about close to 25% between everything and get a sizable tax return every year) - any more would be nice, if only to spend toward the volunteering (I'm pretty minimalistic so I wouldn't really spend much on anything outside of the necessities). My fiancee may be able to help with the monthly income, but for the time being I'm trying to look at myself being the sole provider.


So my question - what are some jobs/careers I can look into where I can make an adequate income (about $2000/month before taxes, so about $24k/year) working from home (or requiring minimal travel, especially anything long-distance) and not take up too much time (as unrealistic as it might be, I'd like to volunteer full-time and work part-time, even if that means working weekends)?


I'm really into tech and smartphones and whatnot, but I'm mostly self-taught and don't even know much that's useful (ex. any programming language, any web design knowledge, etc), and wouldn't know what to go into that I could do at home. I mean, I wouldn't mind designing a smartphone app, for example, but I don't exactly have any decent ideas for apps, especially that I can do alone or with such little experience.

I could also try fixing bricked/broken phones/tablets since I have a little experience, although that can also be kinda time-consuming and hit-or-miss in terms of the profit being made (since eBay/PayPal fees are a bummer), especially with IMEI blocking being a big thing now and certain screens (mostly AMOLED) being expensive.

I also appreciate cars, and wouldn't mind making a ""career"" out of restoring them (or just fixing them up) for a profit, if that's manageable, but I currently know very little about repairing them, and know that it's not exactly cheap to get into, and I'm pretty sure it'd be a little time-consuming as well."

I hit a point this low just over 4 months ago, and I thought I had turned everything around. It really just doesn't make sense, because everything is *seemingly* going my way. It's been about 4 months since I've quit nicotine (which I thought was the root of my problem). Stopped smoking weed in order to get an internship before going into my senior year of college (quit for just over 5 months, got an internship, will start at the beginning of summer). That's it, the ideal place that I should be in my life. Even as recent as a couple weeks ago I was going out to the bar and socializing with new friends. 

..Yet here I am, unable to leave my room/pissed at everything, for no reason at all. It just doesn't make sense, and I wonder if there is anything I can do. Right before I turned things around the first time I went to the doctor and got prescribed adderall, and I thought that this was my solution (I still have no reason to believe it is helping me out a bunch). I just don't know what to do about the other thing in my head that has me feeling like absolute shit. Do people often need Depression/anxiety meds after being prescribed adhd meds? Is there anything else I should do, anyone been in similar shoes? Just kinda need to vent I guess, as everyone else I know in my life are probably looking at me like I'm the happiest kid alive.

In my ward there's a patient with polio sequela, abandoned by the family. He has multiple, deep decubit ulcers some of them extending to the bone - you can see the calcaneum, sacrum and the tibia.

TL;DR a fellow intern and friend says it's cruel and a torture to keep him in the hospital - he's in permanent pain despite analgesics and there's absolutely no chance he's getting better. He says the patient should be killed because the pain is not manageable and it's the only way to stop his suffering.

He also says that a human being is defined by the capacity to *feel* and *rationalize* (the latter being absent in the aforementioned patient). He thinks that when one of those is lacking, it is not a life with dignity and should be put out of his misery. He is disgusted with the ortothanasia approach (I think it's the correct approach) and says it's cowardice.

----------------------

He gave me another example; everyone that does not meet the criteria for ""human being"" must die.

Let's say a *rapist* comes to the ER, severely injured because he was beaten by the police. My friend chooses not to save his life because rationally, that man is not a human being. Quote: ""*How could a rational individual with feelings rape a little child?. I would let him die because I have the power to decide his fate. He does not deserve to live"".

When I said that I would rather preserve his life, he was very troubled with that answer. *""You have to see the essence""* he said. *""What are you saving? You're not saving humanity. You're saving monstrosity"".*  

*My POV* is that indeed, we DO have the power to choose that man's fate but it is not our job nor responsibility to decide whether he lives or dies. There are other people, involved in laws and other non-medical areas, that are in charge of that. But then my friend accused me of being focused only in the *organic* aspect and not the *spiritual* side.

I'm really confused. I just think we have different ways to see the world -

He says there must be some kind of absolute truth, some kind of definitive moral code that must be followed and those who break it are *degenerated* must not receive the same kind of treatment like everyone else.

I told him that there is no absolute truth, nor absolute good/evil. I think there is no *evil human* by default, as I consider there is no *evil animal* by default. Living beings only seek the best for themselves (which does not necessarily mean it's the best for others!) because I understand it's nature's instinct of preservation (this drove him mad and said that I have no ethics and that I consider humans as walking animals)

I will not change my point of view despite my best and most trusted friend being angry with my opinion. But he seemed very dissapointed with me, and our friendship may be deranged. Thoughts?"

I'm currently working on a PhD in history and decided to branch outside of academia to gain some real-world experience before I graduate. I was lucky enough to land an internship as a market researcher for a software company. I'm excited about doing something new (yet familiar since I have a bit of a background in comp. sci.) and gaining crucial experience. The company I'd be working for was just acquired by an equity firm so there seems to be a huge surge of capital pouring in at the moment. While the position is labeled as market research, it seems to do be dealing less with traditional consumer marketing and more with business intelligence and investment. 

Anyway, the reason for my thread is to see if others know what are some potential career paths that such a position could lead towards. If I do jettison the academic dream for a corporate gig, I'd like to see myself in a management position in 5-10 years (maybe something like marketing director, or something in business intelligence). I think I'll know the answer to my question by the time I've invested some months into this job. Regardless, I wanted to ask reddit to see if there is anyone in with experience who might be able to shed some light.

VERY long read",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1c6hoy/i_dont_even_know_what_to_title_this_gf_problems_i/,"GF and I met about three years ago, when she was an intern for a professional sports team I worked with. We went on a few dates within a month or two and got along, but ultimately it went nowhere. I couldn't commit to a relationship (trust issues stemming from a previous break up with the girl I thought I would one day marry). We went on our last date in November of 2010, and talked infrequently until April of 2011 when she called to say she was pregnant (4 months along). The father is a guy she had a long history with, a guy who is IMHO psychologically unbalanced. He is emotionally and physically abusive, and she has told me about times she called the police because he hit her and threatened to kill her. I don't know why she ever stayed with him, but that's something for another thread.

ANYWAY...back to the point. She had her son a few months later, and around December of 2011 she left the father of her son because the issues I stated before escalated to new levels. Apparently he would routinely get black-out drunk and threaten to kill both my GF and their son. We got back in touch and rekindled our friendship. I immediately felt sympathy for her and her boy. But because of stupid shit in my own head, I still didn't commit to a relationship with her.

From then until this past summer, we stayed in touch as friends, infrequently at first, but then a real relationship started to grow. In July of last year I poured my heart out to her, told her about the past relationship that had my head so messed up. I told her I wanted her as my girlfriend, that I wanted to be with her and her son, and that I would do everything I could to make her happy. We've been officially together since then. I love her and her son. I know he's not mine, but I treat him as if he is.

Now, we live about an hour away from each other. I'm in school full time and work part time. She works nights full time. It's tough to see each other a lot, but we're in love, and we've been doing our best.
For the most part, Biological Father hasn't been in the picture much. He gets the child one night a week and every other weekend. When it's his ""turn"", the little guy is usually with Biological Father's parents or a babysitter. Biological Father has shown virtually no interest in his own son. GF's mom and/or dad babysit the little guy when she works and I can't get down there. I spend as much time as I can with him, and he's started to call me ""dad"", which I am thrilled with. I love that little guy.

Little guy had a seizure a little less than a month ago. It was the single most terrifying moment of my life. GF was driving with him in the backseat and me in the front passenger seat. I look back and see his eyes roll back in his head, drooling, and turning blue. We raced to the hospital, while I gave him rescue breaths (not knowing why he wasn't breathing at the time, other than he wasn't choking). We hit the sign in front of the hospital (took a turn too fast) and I sprinted with him in my arms the 100 yards from the sign to the ER doors. He got into the room and the doctors did a great job and he is fine. GF called the Biological Father to let him know what happened, and this asshole shows up to the hospital ranting and screaming about how this seizure is God's punishment for her being a cheating whore and that he fucked her two weeks ago. I should tell you that GF's father, mother, brother and family, and I are all there. And Biological Father's other son who is about 7. Everyone is embarrassed, everyone is angry, no one knows what to do. Anyway, after he's done yelling and screaming he leaves without making sure his son who just had a seizure is okay. A few hours later, he calls GF's mother and father and apologizes, and for some ungodly reason, they both tell him ""it's okay, you were just upset"". They completely let him off the hook.

And so began an endless string of texts and phone calls from Biological Father to my GF about how the whole ordeal was God's sign that the two of them should get back together. That God almost killed their son for the two of them splitting up. That if he ever found me, Biological Father was going to beat the shit out of me. That he would ""die to get [GF] back"".

This has been going on for three weeks now. GF had agreed that she would not do the custody exchanges in anywhere other than public places, and that she would not be alone with him anymore. We both agreed that he is capable of doing horrible things to himself, his son, and my GF.

Sunday, I'm at work and get a call from her sobbing about how she is supposed to pick up her son from the father, but he isn't anywhere to be found and won't answer his phone. I tell her to call the police, she does. Soon after, she calls and says everything is okay, she got in touch with the father, they are going to do the exchange at his house. This goes against our agreement for public places, but I let it go, because I just want her to have her son back. She gets him, calls me that everything is fine, and that's that.

That night, I went to a basketball game with some friends. My phone battery was low, so, in order to have some life left for the drive home, and because cell service inside the particular arena is atrocious, I turned my phone off. Now, since I was under the impression that everything with GF and her son was okay, I didn't think to tell GF my phone would be off. But she did know I was at the game. Once we left, I turned my phone on and saw 5 missed calls and 7 texts messages asking where I was. I immediately call her back, thinking the worst. Everything was fine, but she was SUPER pissed at me for not having my phone on. I apologized for being inconsiderate about not telling her I would have the phone off. We cleared everything up.

Monday I have classes all day, so we talked infrequently, but that’s been normal this semester. Tuesday, I get a picture from her on my phone of her son getting his first haircut. It’s adorable. After the haircut, they are going to little buddy’s doctor appointment to get his ears checked out (ear infection was identified as the cause of the fever that induced his seizure back in March). A little while later, I ask how the appointment went, and she says she’s having a rough day and is at her wit’s end with the Biological Father. I just assume that he’s harassing her via phone again.

Later in the day, we talk on the phone. I find out that Biological Father was with her and her son at the haircut, that they all went to lunch together, and that he was with them at the doctor appointment. The entire time he was begging her to come back to him, to leave me, that they belong together, all the usual shit he spouts. They rode in the same car together (hers). This, to my knowledge, is the most time they have spent together outside of a family court hearing since they broke up near the end of 2011. I was upset when she told me this. I felt hurt, and a little betrayed. I don’t know if that’s the right thing to feel. I mean, she’s going to have this connection to this guy forever. But she has repeatedly told me she doesn’t want anything to do with him. She says she wants to be cordial to him, because she thinks if she cuts him off from her entirely, he’ll kill himself and their son. 

I understand this thinking, and agree that he is dangerous. But my thought is: take him to court and get your son legally away from him permanently. She already has full custody. She “just” has to get him to sign away his parental rights (I know that’s hard to do). But spending an afternoon with the man you thought had kidnapped your son the day before goes well beyond “keeping things cordial”.

I have admittedly been distant the past few days. There’s definite tension between us, not helped by the fact that it’s not easy to see each other like normal relationships. I don’t even know if the hurt I am feeling is appropriate. I guess I’m just looking for someone to tell me if I should be this upset about everything, or is I should just suck it up and get over it.

**TL;DR I feel hurt that GF spent an afternoon with the man who fathered her child, even though he is crazy and she promised she would never be alone with him**

So I just got a job offer with a company (which will obviously remain nameless) for an internship. I haven't been smoking the past few months because I have been preparing for a potential job opportunity - and they might drug test me. 

So I finally got the offer -- no word on any sort of drug test/contingencies for hire at all. I get pretty tempted to smoke, and it gets harder and easier, and I'm just wondering whether or not companies usually tell you their drug testing policies, and when they do that. Does anybody have any sort of light they can shed? I've never been employed at a big company before. note: it's a financial company

So Then during winter vacation i tried to keep in touch with her at least once a week to avoid being obsessed or any thoughts of me being annoying,the only problem i had with her is that it was like 5-7 texts and then she would leave me hanging and i remember talking about our past and she told me how she had a bf,who never got her anything not even flowers and he never paid for anything and she would always drive,paid for him and went out of her way to see him and be with him because at point she really loved the person but this guy had cheated on her from the gecko and hurt her feelings,so i had decided if i was going for her that i wouldn't be like this guy and become a genuine guy that would never do this but it wasn't until she texted me one time when she was buzzed and this was a rare occasion because she's one of those girls who are kinda straight edge and she texted me saying she was drunk and i remember telling her how i felt about her and how i meant it but she never wrote back.      


  I remember texting her that i was really sorry because i felt like i came too direct and she was like all cool and then i would text her and on valentine's day i had surprised her by sending flowers to her at the school office cause thats where she works and when they had gotten delivered she had texted me on how it made her day and what not and i went to go see her and she hugged me and thanked me,i was trying to have a lone time with her to maybe ask her out to spend the day or time this week but there was these girls who cock blocked me and i just wished her a good day and went upon my day.


I thought she would text me or maybe i maybe sparked interest in her more but i don't know i waited and thought she would hit me up after work cause i know she's busy working and with her school work,so then it became a day and then 2 days and the weekend and I didn't hear not one word from her,and it became two weeks she didn't text me until i hit her up to make convo and she seemed all happy and everything but like always she's leaves me hanging with 5 back and forth replies and then it's been like once a week i try to hit her up and say hi.

So now it's been like the 2nd time i try to get over her because since those two weeks where i didn't hear from her hoping she'd hit me up or show at least some attention like i did to her but this time i feel like i'm sprung and out of ideas to win her over, but it's too hard to resist her because i have to see her these next two months around school because all our college classes and her job is in the same building which is easy to bump in to people.I don't know it's so obvious she knows i'm interested in her  and that i've tried and try to ask about her day.It's been going like this since Easter.


Sometime this week when i came back to school there was this school fair when they had tables from different internships and it was outside to the parking lot and she was part of it in one of the tables and  i've found myself seeing her but i have avoided her and not to try to make any interaction with her and i've tried to make it seem as if i didn't see her,because i was walking to the parking lot with a friend of mine,I was stopped by my school's counselor because she wanted to see how i was doing but that whole time i felt nervous because i tried so hard not to look back and make it seem like i was avoiding her on purpose which i was. So then today 4/11,I go to the science building and I'm studying for my Anatomy Lab Practical exam,with Lab group.


There's this girl who was studying next to me with some people and it happens to be that it was one of the girl's who cockblocked me on valentine's day and I didn't realize then that this girl was in my Anatomy class until like couple weeks ago when i saw her talking to janet and they had a class together,so then i glance through the see through glass walls of the schools building and i notice janet coming to the building I see that she's coming,so I try to act busy and try surpress the urge from looking down the floor(Our Science building is 3 floors) and not trying to make it seem like she's coming,so then i'm like studying reading some things and i was looking through the corner of my eye and I notice janet waking up the stairs and I'm like fuck,getting really nervous and i keep on doing and i notice from the corner of my eye she stops and then walks around and ends up going to to her friend and she's talking to them,so then I avoid any contact and try to make it seem like i didn't acknowledge her presene around me and then my buddies and I walk to class because the Exam was going to start in a couple of minutes.

I don't know try to be the man and take the initiative but i don't recieve any reprocity from her.When we see each other she always seems happy and smiles and there has been times where i avoid her because i don't want to confront her,hopefully maybe she'd text me,call me or show some interest or concern.I've been avoiding her and not trying to call her because i feel like i've tried to make an effort the best as i could but me avoiding her i'm trying to shield myself from getting hurt or putting an effort where i feel like i'm wasting my time.

So guys and girls idk what i should do she seems like a awesome person i want to be with but her actions don't show,but she's always nice to me and smiles when she see's me can it be that she just likes the attention or is it because she's trying to be nice,what's on your take of all of this and how i should go upon it? I have two more months left of school to make anything happen if there's still hope.

I'm also sorry for my grammatical errors,confusion and any misspelling that auto correct or I didn't catch."

Our company is pretty small (~150) so there is only two full time IT admins. Unfortunately they are not what I'd call ""fully qualified"" sysadmins. One was a software engineer thrown into his new role, and the other has good people and sales skills but lacks real technical skills. The reason I'm explaining all this is because I feel like I'm not being properly trained as a sysadmin as most of the time I ask them a question their answer is ""Google it"". 

So I come to you guys asking for any advice, tips, tricks, stuff you wish you knew starting as a sysadmin. Bare in mind that we're primarily a Windows shop (Mainly Win7 for PCs, and Win2008R2 for servers)

Anything from good books, stuff I should beef up on, best practices, daily routines, etc.

EDIT: Just wanted to say that I am fully capable of Googling for answers, and I realize that is a lot of the job, I guess I'm after more general do's and don'ts of sysadmins (e.g. Use Evernote to clip useful info OR Keep a log of what you do everyday to cover your ass, etc) "

Hey everyone, I have a really good problem (too many choices) but I'm absolutely stuck and I'm not sure what would be best for me this year.  I have no professional experience, so setting myself up for next summer is the most important thing in my decision. Here's my current options :
 
 * Web Development job with a reputable company in SF with an established intern program.  I'm the only intern on a small team, but I'd be working on features and not on an internship project.  I like the team.   Pay is VERY good for my skill level; $30/hr (and I'll be living rent free)  They want to hear back from me TOMORROW, putting the squeeze on my other options.

 * Freshman program at Facebook.  Focused on mobile development.  Got an interview, which is 30 minutes and only semi-technical, so it's not a done deal yet.  I think it would be a really great way to meet some other kids my age who are really good hackers, and Facebook obviously has a great rep among HR people.  It's paid, but doubtful as much as the other company.  It's also only 8 weeks (as opposed to 12+ at the other company).  I do have other offers in hand so I can turn down the high-paying web dev position and have a fallback...but is it worth it.  It's also just a bootcamp, so it's probably going to be much more structured and I'm not sure how much I will get out of it.

In short, I feel like I would get more experience at the web dev company, and grow more as a software engineer, but Facebook has that name cachet that's hard to deny.  Is it worth taking the risk to go for Facebook?

Thanks so, so much."

1canmb,2,2013-04-13,"Not sure if this is depression, or something else...",very_1984ish,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1canmb/not_sure_if_this_is_depression_or_something_else/,"Some background information first I guess- I'm 21, in my second year of university. My first year of univeristy was incredibly bad. I struggled to befriend people, and the one person in my course whom I did get along with died a few months after I met her. I was of course extremely distraught, and from then on making friends was impossible as people in my course were too awkward and uncomfortable around me. The one thing that kept me going was my course itself. It turned out to be such an interesting subject and for the first time I knew what career path I was interested in going down. I studied often and diligently, and my grades were excellent despite my general unhappiness and lack of a social life.

Then year two started. I joined the university debating club, and just like my course it unexpectedly turned out to be something I am good at that I loved doing, but more importantly I quickly made some amazing friendships. I also got offered 2 amazing paid internships at pretty excellent law firms over the summer. My social life, sex life, and career prospects have never been this great.

But for the past 12 weeks, I have had zero focus or motivation or energy. I can't get out of bed, sometimes I just lie there until I get too hungry to stay curled up. Worse, I can't study. Now, I know all about procrastination - I've always had to force myself to start homework or study, but once I got started and started accomplishing even something small, that feeling would grow until I was in a pretty good productive mood and I could work for hours. At times when it got especially hard to study, I always had a number of tricks to motivate me - listening to music, or just looking at career ads in my chosen field (maybe I'm materialistic, but the thought of earning six figures before I turned 30 always filled me with a huge amount of determination to get studying) and sometimes just looking at silly inspirational videos on the Internet.

I've dealt with depression before. I've had a remarkably shitty childhood and family life and I'm currently trying to care for a parent that's been suicidal for at least as long as I've been alive and is deteriorating. I've always been able to handle it somewhat, especially after discovering how much exercise helps with that. I felt depressed a lot last year given how badly university was going, but what's happening to me now just doesn't feel the same. I'm not sad or overly stressed out, just completely... lethargic. Unmotivated, despite the tricks that have always worked before. I can't get started studying, and when I do I don't get the same feelings of interest or satisfaction so I can't focus or keep working for more than a few minutes. I'm not even watching TV or playing video games like I normally would while not studying, I'm just kinda doing...nothing.  I can't even get the energy or the enthusiasm to enjoy games or reading or food, let alone textbooks (though I always loved studying, and I should really love it even more now that I've got a general idea of what direction I want to take my career in). I don't understand why I'm like this and nothing I do is helping. 

Is this depression, just different to what I experienced before? Someone also suggested anaemia, so I'm going to go to a doctor for a blood test on Monday to get checked out. Hopefully he or she will help me with all of this, but I just wanted to ask for reddit's opinion in the meantime. I'm slightly worried about the idea of being prescribed antidepressants within a few weeks of exams and starting my internships, but I'm more worried about failing out of college because I can't beat this. Especially when I don't understand why this is happening now.

Thanks for reading, any advice or anything is welcome."

Having in been on reddit for a while, I really appreciate the care and wisdom that the community possesses. With great trust and gratitude, I hope to hear your advice on the issue above.

My gf and I have been in a relationship for more than a year. I assure you that the length is not indicative of how much I care about this person. At this point she is looking for internships and jobs, the success of which will determine whether we can be together. (EDIT: otherwise she would have to move)

I really want to be a supportive partner, and I'm quite proud that I've been doing a good job. Yet a recurring issue is that sometimes I suffer from a bag of negative emotions as well--feeling tired, helpless, as she keeps trying without any success in sight.

Even though I have been able to contain these emotions quite well, I really do want to deal with them early. For I really fear that one day I may snap and hurt both our relationship and her career. More insidiously, I fear that my respect for her may wither little by little and disappears one day.

On the one hand, there are things that I objectively think she's been doing wrong in her career search (strategies, priorities, etc.). On the other hand, I do realize some of the frustration is due to my warped thinking. Thus, it's hard to know whether I'm providing constructive criticism.

I have talked to her about my feelings and worries, and that certainly is a good move. Yet the issue has been recurring, and I suspect that I may need a change of perspective on what is my appropriate role in her career problems.

I really care because I want her to be successful and us to be together. And yet the more I care, the more frustrated and potentially hurtful I get. This irony is what haunts me the most.

Thank you for listening, and I really look forwards to hearing your opinion. I'm surprised by how little shows up on google search on this topic, and the majority of the discussion has been (Christian) housewives supporting her laid off husbands. We are both young students so I'm hoping to hear from more perspectives.

Thank you!

TL;DR: I'm trying to be supportive while gf looking for jobs, yet I often feel tired and helpless myself. I have talked to her about my feelings, and it's a great idea, yet these feelings still don't go completely away. I do not want to keep talking about my feelings either, since that will distract her more. We are both young college graduates [22] in a 1+ year relationship."

I have searched around for a bit and I have not found any good info related to *high school* internship interviews. 

What ways should I prepare for the interview (It will be in approx 2 weeks). There's also a call-in interview prep session where I can ask about the interview process and the internship 1 week before the interview). 

I'm just wondering in what ways I can prepare. I read that the books *Programming Interviews Exposed: Secrets to Landing Your Next Job* and *Cracking the Coding Interview: 150 Programming Questions and Solutions* are good for real interviews but I'm not sure if they apply to me since it's only a high school internship interview.

I'm a bit scared that my programming skills aren't good enough for their standards, I've done programming with C# and some website design a long time ago, but I've forgotten most of the stuff. Right now I'm mainly coding in Java as I am a AP Computer Science student. Will that be a problem?

Any advice will be appreciated
Thank you!"
1cad7g,1,2013-04-13,"First Post, My Story, Some Questions. Any Chance You Could Help?",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1cad7g/first_post_my_story_some_questions_any_chance_you/,"Howdy, y'all. Long time lurker and commenter, first time poster. I'm not really sure why I'm writing today...maybe cos I took my medicine too late after a night of drinking haha, but I feel like you guys understand my situation better than most people and can maybe offer some advice. I'm really willing to try anything at this point.

Here's a general overview of my situation:
I have been struggling with very serious depression since the 6th grade. I'm now a Junior in college, so it's been around 10 years. I was initially resistant to medicine in high school and saw a therapist, which didn't help so I stopped. Things peaked around my Junior year  of high school (with one particularly bad experience, I think you all could have some idea of what I'm talking about) but I was able to control my bad thoughts, and when I left my demanding and snooty private high school, I felt much better. I have a good home life, but at times my parents, who love me more than anything (I'm an only child) could be harsh. 

Freshman year of college was the best year of my life and I was able to keep my depression to a minimal level. But when Sophomore year rolled around my depression came back hard. As of now, my Junior year of college, my depression has come on harder then ever, as I have had a problem with a woman (which started Sophomore year) who I care about very much, but will never feel the same way about me that I do, to put it as simply as I can. 

We were great friends at the time. We put a lot of pressure on each other, and basically we decided not to spend time together for a while (she kinda pushed it on me out of the blue, but I think it was good in retrospect and I agree with her). It has been good and in a way kinda therapeutic, but I still think about her all the time. Also, a few of my friends kinda screwed me over for housing next year and it has put a lot of stress on me. In the past few months, I have started on Wellbutrin and Deplin. At first it did not help, but I have recently noticed a positive change in my mood. My biggest problem that exacerbates my depression is the girl I mentioned previously. I deleted her on Facebook, Twitter, and my phone as part of a process to help move on I found online (like I said, I'm desperate for anything that could help). I recently let her know I meant no offense. I support her 100%, and I know she wants her space. I have been doing absolutely everything to be as accommodating as possible, as it is better for both of us this way.

It is awkward, as we have the same group of friends, but it has been working out alright so far. While we were apart, she found someone, and I think thanks to my medicine I have been able to manage without falling into an even deeper depression (if that's even possible; I'm pretty miserable) even though I know very little about the situation (like I said, I'm not trying to be intrusive). But now she is slowly starting to reach out. We spoke and messaged each other last night and she has re-added me on Facebook. Doesn't seem like a big deal, but it is to me. I only accepted it as not to be rude, but it feels like a mistake.

I had been steadily getting better, but I feel like, with that, I just started walking down a path I don't want to take. Just being her friend hurts, and I don't know how to deal with it. I have absolutely no idea how to let go or just move on. It's giving me grey hair, and I'm only 21 years old. This is very very disturbing to me, as my father didn't even start going grey until he was in his early 40s, and I definitely have his genes. Problems with women seem silly to some, but when you care about and have strong feelings for someone, it can be crippling. I'm sure some of you know exactly what I'm talking about. Thanks to my depression my grades are in the toilet. Maintained a 3.0+ every semester, but last semester my depression was terrible, and my grades went in the toilet. Now I am worried about finding an internship (I'm a Marketing major; if I don't, I'm screwed).

Obviously my problem is way more complicated than this, but I figured this description was pretty adequate. I have plenty of other stresses, but I chose to discuss the biggest one in detail. If I got rid of this problem, I know I could deal with the rest.

Some questions:

-The tips I got online for how to move on (for the most part) sucked. Any chance any of you have better tips/suggestions?

-Anyone else been on Wellbutrin or Deplin, or both at the same time? The Wellbutrin didn't really work at all until I started taking the Deplin with it. What do you think? Any negative effects? How about noticeably positive effects?

-Could you recommend a better medicine?

-If you were in a similar situation, did you move on? How long did it take?



Thank you so much for reading and helping. Much love, everyone. And know I'm here for you if you need it!

I'm 22, male, and a student. It's pretty difficult to organise accomodation while I'm still in Ireland, and this is further complicated by the fact I'm mid thesis and have my finals in 4 weeks, so I figured I'd come to Reddit for help/ideas. Ideally I'd like to live as close to Petone as possible as that's where the academy is based, but can travel via public transport if necessary. As stated, I am a student and while money isnt super tight right now, I would be looking for something at the cheaper (but not a slum) end of the spectrum.

1ca40a,1,2013-04-13,"Should I stay with my mopey, bi-polar, ADHD boyfriend?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ca40a/should_i_stay_with_my_mopey_bipolar_adhd_boyfriend/,"I am 26 F. My boyfriend is 24 M. We've been dating a little more than 2 years. Not only is my boyfriend very bi-polar, but our relationship dynamic is very bi-polar as well. Sometimes my boyfriend is ridiculously happy, hyper, fun-loving and romantic. This is why I fell in love with him. He is a very intense, fun and passionate person to be around. 

In his lows, he's mopey, easily agitated, extremely angry, suicidal and so depressed he's not motivated to do anything. 

I understand that people have highs and lows. I understand that it's not his job to be happy for me all the time.

He also has ADHD, which he says makes it harder for him to focus on tasks and stay motivated to get things done. True to his word, he does get really easily distracted and has hard time following through with tasks. 

So here is the thing. I feel like he's using his ADHD and Bi-polar as excuses to let responsibilities slide. He currently is doing an unpaid internship and has another part time job. But he's making barely any money (like 200 a week). He has a bachelor degree. I am the main breadwinner in our relationship, I earn about 1,000 bi-weekly. 

The money thing doesn't bother me that much. I think a guy's attitude and willingness to contribute where he can is more important than the size of his pocket book. 

He feels extremely self conscious about the fact that he's not making any money, and complains constantly about the fact that he's not providing for me. 

I tell him that there are other things he can do to help. I have given him ONE chore - the dishes. I buy the food. I cook the food (because I enjoy cooking). I pay the rent. He lives with his parents currently (but still stays at my house like 60% of the time and eats about half my food). 

Sometimes he's okay with helping out. Other times I have to remind him constantly to do the dishes. He says he'll do it, but then completely forgets and goes home. I've told him how much this pisses me off - considering it's his one contribution, and that he SAID he would do it. 

Nothing pisses me off more than when a person makes flowery promises, but doesn't keep their word. 

He routinely leaves his trash out and forgets to put food back in the fridge. I always have to remind him to pick up after himself and to throw away his trash. 

The last few times I told him to do these things he did, but was moody and irritable about it. (he apologized for getting angry later, but then didn't do the dishes the next day). I've also given him the option of cooking instead and that I would do the dishes - but he said he'd rather do the dishes. 

He complains about not having a good job, but then doesn't do anything to actually look for a better one. He once again blames his ADHD and says that I need to help him with the job hunt. So I basically have to write his resume and write his cover letter in order for him to get a better job. Which is what I've done for his current job and one he had last summer. 

I feel like I'm doing so much for this guy and getting little in return. I feel like his mother - and that's such a disgusting unsexy way to feel. Like I said, I don't mind being the breadwinner, but I expect my partner to be a MAN and an ADULT. To me, that means being direct about what you want and your feelings. Keeping your commitments. Taking care of yourself and cleaning up after yourself and your mental health. Even if you can't necessarily pay all the bills. 

Oh also, he refuses to go to therapy and had adverse side effects with Adderall (an ADD medication). He complains that taking it for 6 months gave him permanent brain damage (melodramatic much?) 

My BF grew up with parents who did everything for him, and he resents that aspect about himself. I guess most of the relationship I was hoping that if I could be patient and supportive enough he would change. I was taking his transformation from boyhood into manhood as my problem, when I really should be holding him accountable. 

Now I'm beginning to feel like he'll never change. I feel like he's going to continue giving more excuses, more sob stories and more false promises to deliver. And I'll keep having false hope that he'll bloom into the man I want him to be. 

Should I just end this relationship? It's not bad all the time. 60% of the time I feel happy and in love. He doesn't cheat and he's not physically abusive (he's said some mean things).

But I don't respect this guy. I don't trust him. I don't feel stable with him. And I know that's a big problem. 

What do you think Reddit? 

TL;DR! My boyfriend is irresponsible, doesn't contribute and blames this problem on his ADHD and bipolar. 

UPDATE: I just talked to my boyfriend about most of what I posted here. He felt really bad about everything, apologized and says he wants to make things better. I appreciate his apology and willingness to listen, I just hope that his apology is followed by action. This is a frequent thing in our relationship where he will apologize, but then the same behavior repeats itself within a few weeks. So I told him that I would like to see ACTION behind his words.

He told me that I'm not very emotionally supportive, which is true in a sense. I'm not a very emotional person. I'm very logic oriented and I see the world in a different way than he does. If a task needs to be done, I just do it rather than having to summon some kind of energy to do so. 

Sometimes I can be sarcastic and pessimistic - which is probably not the way to motivate a depressed person. I'm also the type of person who shows my love with my actions rather than my words or emotions. He is the opposite. He is a highly emotional person who says sweet romantic things, but I would like to see such promises backed up by action. 

So I need to be more emotional like him and he needs to be more action oriented like me, and maybe we can make this relationship work. 

I also need to expect that he will take care of his own problems - rather than planning out how I can solve his problems for him. 

I also appreciate all the advice from people saying I need to read more about bi-polar. Sounds like there are similar patterns for bi-polar behavior that often get attributed to laziness when that's not necessarily true. 

Thanks everyone!"
1ca3hd,0,2013-04-13,Decisions Time: Berkeley vs UCLA,twwq,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1ca3hd/decisions_time_berkeley_vs_ucla/,"Hey everyone, I couldn't find any Freshmen advice threads in here, and I need some opinions and experiences from the Cal side! Right now, it's down to UCLA vs Berkeley for Computer Science and/or Economics. To give you some background, I'm an OOS student (FL) who's been accepted into Cal L&amp;S Undeclared and UCLA L&amp;S Pre-Economics. I think I'm more interested in CS though! And I'm receiving $10K more from UCLA than Cal, but my parents fully support my choice.

I've got a few questions:

1. How large of a difference will Computer Science @ UCLA and Computer Science @ Berkeley differ? Will I be at a significant disadvantage when looking for internships and, later, work in the Silicon Valley area or for big companies if I attend UCLA? (I realize Berkeley's rankings are high up there, but practically and in real life, do recruiters take much much more from Berkeley than UCLA?)

2. I've heard that pre-Haas is very competitive and nearly cutthroat. Just how bad is it?

3. For Berkeley, is it difficult to transfer into the COE for Computer Science? I've heard that in UCLA, I'll need to take some prereqs and have 3.5+ GPA, but what about Cal?

4. For Berkeley, how does a BA in CS in L&amp;S vs a BS in EECS in the College of Engineering compare (internships, opportunities, jobs)? I heard the classes are literally the exact same thing -- but I'll just receive more humanities courses + an A instead of an S on my degree.

5. Everyone over on the UCLA side says their campus life is damn awesome. Convince me that Berkeley's is better!

Thanks so much in advance!

Fall semester I ran and lifted weights. My main focus was cardiovascular health and, in under 3 months, I went from being winded from a 10 minute mile to running a half marathon. However, all the running basically prevented me from building any muscle mass, and, for example, I was stuck squatting only 55 to 65 lbs all semester. This semester, I have shifted the focus to strength and have gone to squatting 125 lbs, benching 55 (when I started I was pinned by the bar), and have learned to complete 2 proper push ups. This may not sound like much, but for a gawky, scrawny girl with a hyperactive thyroid, its a major achievement.

My question: I have an internship this summer across the country and just rented a sublet 6.5 miles away from my job. I don't own a car, so my plan is to bike to and from work everyday. There is a gym a little over a mile from my sublet, and I'm trying to figure out if it's worth the membership fees. Will weight lifting do any good on the same day I'm doing over an hour of biking? If I don't lift, will I return to school having lost all the progress I made this semester?

I don't know anyone else who rides, and I really need some advice... I know the Ninja250 is the recommendation around here, but I really don't like the look of sport bikes, I'd much rather something that looks more ""classic,"" and has a retro UJM/triumph aesthetic, like a tu250x maybe? I've also been reading about KLR650's being extremely capable for unpredictable weather and high way riding.

I'm a student in northern New England, and I really want a bike I can ride year-round in rain and on salty roads, up and down this hilly area, and that can deal with the crappy pot holes around town. So I would mostly be using the bike locally, but I would need the ability to survive on a highway going 70mph once or twice a week for a few miles to an internship. I want a bike that can hold stuff other than me -- I need to bring a briefcase to class and work, and would like to be able to store rain gear for when its needed and maybe a pair of shoes (so i can change when I get to my destination).

Oh, and I have about $3500 that I've budgeted for this. I'm probably being extremely unrealistic, but I'm really not sure where to compromise on. I know I need a reliable and easily serviced bike since I'm not a wrench-head (yet), I have a budget (student), and I'd love to be able to commute year round (I guess except for when there is a blizzard?). Aesthetics aren't super important, but functionality and the ability to store all my crap is. Guys, help -- what am I looking for?"

The thought of doing an internship at SpaceX just get's me all giddy inside.

TBH, I'm an average student, I tend to do well in my physics and engineering courses, only because I enjoy them, but usually do poorly in anything else.  Neither do I have a lot of extra-curriculars.  I know I could just ""give it a go,"" but if anyone's dealt with getting an internship there, or anything, I'd love some input on what I could do to increases my chances.  I assume it's pretty competitive.

Other questions: What's the process like?  On their website, some requirements are fairly specific, other's have simple and general information.  What do they have you *do* to apply?

Thanks!"

Long time browser, first time posting.
I'm a Civil Engineering student finishing up my junior year. Assuming I don't pursue a masters degree, I'll be needing to find a steady job after graduation in about a year. I've been able to get engineering internships for the past 3 summers with 2 different employers. At this point my work experience has been entirely with the Federal Government (Bureau of Land Management and Fed. Highways Admin). Currently I'm still with FHWA and with my internship position, I have an option to be converted to a permanent employee upon graduating. This is nice because I have some security if I can't find a better job. Unfortunately I still am not completely sold on working for the government...  

My resume has plenty of relevant experience and acquired skills. However I'm concerned that working this long for the government may have negative implications if I decide that I want to get into private industry. Are my concerns valid?

Also, what are people's opinions about working for private vs. public? I am very much aware of the immediate differences (pay, benefits, requirements of the job, etc.) I'm just looking for any kind of advice, any opinions/suggestions are welcomed!

1c9fjy,6,2013-04-13,The Fifth Letter,AFetteredSoul,UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1c9fjy/the_fifth_letter/,"Four weeks, five letters. For four weeks I have written five letters trying to muster up the words to say to you. The truth, everything that never was mentioned, all that I have wished to tell you but failed to do so; my thoughts, my feelings, my concerns. I have failed to compose anything that is cohesive, let alone anything that really makes sense in any way. So please excuse failed organisation, scattered thoughts, and rambling. It’s the only way which I can write this, and I feel like it is finally time to at least send a letter to you, regardless of form.

I have spent the last four weeks really thinking about not only the things I did with you, between us, but also everything that has happened over the past year. 

The good, the bad, and the absolutely ugly.

Since the beginning of 2012 to the present date I found myself traveling a new country, coming home to dates and constant heartbreak, diagnosed with a lifelong chronic illness I still struggle with, traveled with family I had not seen in years, had my lifelong dream of a degree stripped from me thanks to faults not my own, friends and family passing unexpectedly. And then—then I met you.

You brought to me something that I had never experienced before: intimacy, desire, attraction, &amp;c. The list goes on and on, continuing with dozens of little adjectives that can be used to describe the connection we shared and the times that we had. Everything but one:

Dedication.

There does not need to be any explanation for my actions. You know full well what happened, and I do not wish to reflect upon it once more here in this letter. It was me being stupid and selfish. There is no other way to put it aside from that, generalised anxiety and fear contributed to this, but it was my irrational thinking that caused it all to go.

Without that nothing could really happen, could it? We never dated, as you said, yet it feels like we broke up? This is my irrational behaviour.

I spent the last few weeks doing something that I have never done before, actually setting aside time to read my various journals and notes, in all their forms, over the past few years. So many journals with their covers falling apart, pages seemingly missing, some which have been through hell and back. There are memories of some of the greatest moments of my life documented and recalled with a crystal clear memory. Three stand out above the rest:

1.) July 25, 2011: One of my last days in S. Korea, after exploring myself, staying with strangers, teaching in unfamiliar conditions, and most of all the experience of everything being entirely new.

2.) January 12, 2012: A deeply interpersonal connection with a young girl in a train ride in Paris, France. We were stuck for hours after someone had jumped on the tracks ahead of us, late at night, everyone trying to make it home. Not a word was spoken, no hand gestures made. Laughs, smiles, and eye contact demonstrated the deep connections and similarities that we all have, regardless of our differences.

3.) October 7, 2012: Meeting a girl named L (retracted) for the first time, embracing her, and experiencing one of the greatest weekends of my life—new experiences and someone who for the first time really cared about me.

All of these entries have something in common, they are honestly the only entries of hundreds scattered about hundreds of pages digital notes that are not marked with negativity, fear, depression, or profound sadness. Nothing here but a pure reflection of how the profound beauty of life, people, nature, and the little things that we all take for granted.

Here you can call me a hypocrite—and I admit to being one.

Looking back at all of this I have come to realise that I have problems that I need to sort out. I have had nearly all my friends abandon me once they left for school—including some of my very personal friendships. I moved away from a small town when I was young, and childhood friends were lost, returning back even in the summers and not one would recognise me in the parks when I was young. Something about that hurt me, and I never really wanted to connect with people again. I can still remember all of their names: Ke (Retracted), J (Retracted), R (Retracted), and L (Retracted). We ruled the playground, but once I was gone for a few months, a distant memory-- I was homeschooled during middle school, after the terrible experience of elementary school. I lost more friends from middle school too, only knowing one guy, T (Retracted), as I kept in touch from Boy Scouts, and then came high school. I didn’t know many people there of course and entered an overweight socially awkward kid who did not know any better than to be a total fool. I met K (retracted). He soon became one of my best buddies, a true bro. I can remember helping him move into his dorm a few years later, and after one semester of school he stopped talking to me. It hurt so badly. Soon after, T (Retracted) walked away too. After high school, I only met a few people that I knew, but it was like starting fresh.

Now I only can talk to four people: (Retracted). Those are my only real friends and I mean that honestly. Even still, W (Retracted) and I have been talking less and less, and the same goes with Celeste. Things are changing—and I simply don’t know what to do.

I have not met a single person at school, not one friend or someone I can talk to. I am too afraid of being hurt again. While I’ll be quick to open up and talk to people, I always shy away from being a true friend, being there for people, dedicating my emotions to a friendship. 

In short, I have trust issues. I am a fool who does not know better, and while no excuse, perhaps explains something. I do not know; I am a fool.

I did not really know how deeply you cared for me; let alone how much I cared for you until you were gone. After I let you down and let you go, and that is something that haunts me…

--

While trying to rest my mind and look upon myself in an intrapersonal connection as to what I even stand for, I spent my time free in the park. I took days off of work, too distressed to focus, and set aside classwork and walked to the park near daily and read; books that I have always cited as being a part of my beliefs, but ones that I had not the time to read in perhaps years. The collected works of Plato, the Nietzsche reader, the Federalist Papers, collections of poetry and proverbs of Shelly, Ginsburg, and more—but one of them all stood above the rest. A book that I hold so close to me that is sometimes forgotten, a book which tears fell from my eyes as I read from its pages: 

“…in spite of all the good will that was inseparable from his love, he and soon come to doubt her. He had taken seriously words which were without importance, and it made him very unhappy.”

Like words off a page etched in my soul, I recalled how much emphasis I placed on little banter about futures and getting together. Internships in V (Retracted), among other things, I took them too seriously and it began to play with my mind and what you thought we had. Moving too fast? My ignorance and preconceived notions of how relationships are supposed to go got in the way. I became irrational, it clouded my judgment. I found unhappiness in what was pure bliss… I read on.

“’I ought to have listened to her,’ he confided to me one day. ‘One never ought to listen to the flowers. One should simply look at them and breathe their fragrance. Mine perfumed all my planet. But I did not know how to take the pleasure in all her grace. This tale of claws, which disturbed me so much, only should have filled my heart with tenderness and pity.'""

You knew, better than I ever could, what was shared between us. The thing is, I always cited my inexperience and ignorance, but I was scared so absolutely terrified of putting all my trust into you. If I lost any control, it would be over, and I'd lose another. It's selfish, the opposite of intimate. I should have known, I should have taken action. You gave me nothing but love and compassion, and I denied it playing with my head. I came with too much pride in who I was and was too afraid to change that. You knew. I don't know; I am a fool… I read on.

""And he continued his confidences: 'The fact is that I did not understand anything! I ought to have judged by deeds not by words. She cast her fragrance and her radiance over me. I ought never to have run away from her... I ought to have guessed all the affection that lay behind her poor little stratagems. Flowers are so inconsistent! But I was too young to know how to love her...'""

My words cannot compare to those I read, those which tell the same story of lost love and troubles then here. These words of course are those of Le Petit Prince, a man of small stature who in his time on Earth told the story of his small planet and his love, the flower... I know not if you have read the story, but the profound beauty of the flower, its presence, disturbed the serenity of Le Petit Prince's world, so much so he leaves. My life had always been a routine, one with 'principles' and 'philosophical and moral hierarchy' all of it not what's really important.

Love. 

Take pride in what you have, and realise just how important the smallest of things are in life. Love, happiness, and peace. Le Petit Prince learned this from a fox he met on his travels. If only I knew better, if I had a fox. Have my time with monks in the mountains of Korea taught me nothing? I learned the principles of life's troubles and what was really important, discussing them while watching the lotus flowers bloom. I don't know; I am a fool.

It is amazing how much I could read into the subject of love:

 “…when a man can content himself with being in love for the pleasure of loving without expecting too much in return, this is linking of hearts, if it is no longer, as in early youth, the gal towards which love, of necessity, tends still is bound by love so strong an association of ideas that may well become the cause of love if it presents itself…since one seeks in love before everything else a subjective pleasure…” –Marcel Proust in “Swann’s Way”

Reading the profound nature of the give and take, the self-sacrifice needed to make things work. What it takes to become a pair—to rejoin halves as they say. It is not about completion, as I have said, but about complementing. Even that aside, what makes it all work is the level of intimacy and self-sacrifice that is most profound. It is a universal human emotion. 

Why is that concept so hard for me to understand? So many great people, and countless individuals lost in history have known what love is…

The idea is not new to me, far from it; it has existed in poems that I have loved and held so dearly, and very personal stories which defined what a strong romantic love could be. As with many of the things I am citing here, there is a book I hardly touch, yet one which means the world to me, one of the prised possessions that rests upon my shelf. Its cover is warn, bits of cloth peeling off as the binding slowly deteriorates and the spine breaks. Its pages are marked heavily with notes, and beginning to rip and shred from countless hours spent reading it and studying everything that exists between its covers. It was not my hand which left them there, nor does it really even belong to me. It is my mother’s collected works of Shelly. The spine rests broken, opening to only one specific page if left to open on its own. It opens to a specific page, where an old pressed and long dead single rose lay. The colour has faded with time, yet some of it remains, and petals have disintegrated as time passes leaving only parts of the flower in fact.

It is the first rose given to my mother from my father.

Why this is so important is this particular rose, in this particular book, is pressed against a poem that my mom had always told me about love. What it felt to be in love, a poem that spoke to her as a teenager and still speaks to her today. It is called Love’s Philosophy: 

The fountains mingle with the river,
And the rivers with the ocean;
The winds of heaven mix forever,
With a sweet emotion;
Nothing in the world is single;
All things by a law divine
In one another's being mingle;--
Why not I with thine?

See! the mountains kiss high heaven,
And the waves clasp one another;
No sister flower would be forgiven,
If it disdained it's brother;
And the sunlight clasps the earth,
And the moonbeams kiss the sea;--
What are all these kissings worth,
If thou kiss not me?

The concept is not new; rather the poem is one that my mother had taken off the pages and placed it into her soul; one which she had recited to me time and time again over the ages when telling the story of love between them. A story lasting years with distance of thousands of miles between to young lovers for school, education, and money that they did not have. Phone calls lasting only a minute or two a time every month or less, letters written that had to fly across the pacific costing money that at times neither my mother or father had. It was years before they were finally able to be together, happy, and living in the arms of one another. Long distance today is nothing like yesterday. How could I use that as an excused? I don’t know; I am a fool.

I let my own selfish motives and goals get in the way, I let them conquer my wellbeing--I let them rule my judgements regardless of others. That's something I have to live with.

One of the things I never said was the opinion the few friends and family I have. R (Retracted) never liked you too much, for reasons I do not know. He would scoff and me off camera and walk away. It made me so sad to lose his approval. Others who I am acquainted with whom I've confided with told me how this was all stupid. Even my mom as I sat on her bed in near tears the night before you had planned what would have been the time of our lives told me that I shouldn't go. I let my own drives for approval of others cloud what I wanted--what I craved. 

They are not me. They didn't know what we shared. 

Yet I let them be my ultimate judgment. Everyone seeks approval of friends, of a group, but when that ends up ruling their own opinions? I cannot speak on that. I'm weak. I don't know; I'm a fool.

Only one knew, A (Retracted). Every time I confided my feelings she would just tell me, ""It's because you love her."" ""I know."" I'd reply. Yet my actions, my deeds, did not reflect the love and passion I had. My words, perhaps, but not the real importance: my actions. As I continue to write this, to really think about the effect of my existence in others’ lives and what I stand for, the more I realise just how painfully right you were.

Yet I didn't listen... I never accept being happy.

There is a quote that I often cite as one of those ""words to live by"" and it goes:

""Amitié qui se peut finir / Ne fut jamais bien commencée"" -Oeuvres poétiques

Loosely translated it means, ""If a friendship can end, it never truly began."" This is the high regard that I hold my friends, knowing that it is impossible for it to end. You, in a matter of a few short months, became the closest friend I have ever had. Someone I could confide in, yet, didn't always. And this throws everything into questioning. Can things end? Can there really be goodbyes? It's hard for me to say. I don't know; I am a fool.

I write all of this as I feel that I need to. If not to act as a long apology and soul wrenching letter just trying to honestly explains myself, to act as closure. To let things rest. I don't expect you to come running back, nor do I even expect you to even reply to this. You don't have to say anything, you can keep moving on to let this enter into the pages of memories. I tickled the thoughts of buying a ticket to P (Retracted) for spring break, hand delivering this letter and explaining myself--yet I juggled between thoughts of immaturity and living life like a romantic novel. Do as you wish. I've learned a lot in the past few weeks, about myself, about others, about life. Perhaps enough, then again, perhaps not nearly enough to even begin to comprehend some of the intricacies of life. It is time for me to take responsibility and to finally do what I have always thought I'd live by. Once again I draw from the words of others, in one of the greatest quotes I have come to known:

""Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even though checkered by failure, than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy much nor suffer much, because they live in that grey twilight that knows neither victory nor defeat"" -President Theodore Roosevelt

To take action, to dare to at least try to step outside of what is comfortable and into something new. Something I have denied myself for so long, and just perhaps, the source of my troubles.

This is not another goodbye. I have said that enough, too many times to be exact. All I wish is for you to be happy, for you to dare to do those mighty things that bring you that happiness. You'll always be a part of me in ways, if not there, at least a memory. Someone who was the first to open my eyes and show me just what exists, what is possible, and what it is to love and be loved.

I still carry your drawings, I still have your writings, and every time I walk down the streets at night I can remember how my life was before, during, and after.

With a kind heart and the upmost regards,

A co-conspirator in making the world a better place,

-T (Retracted)

I spend every night crying myself to sleep. its a heartwarming feeling I know. 

Where should I start? The beginning, I suppose. 


I am a 23 year old female and my life has been all downhill. All of it. I'm afraid to be happy for even just a moment because I just know it will all come crashing down. Growing up life was hectic, My earliest memory is of my parents fighting when I was 2 and me sitting on the stairs and them not even noticing me as the screamed about my father's gambling issues. They divorced soon after and it was just fight after fight about custody and visitation. It was terrible. Then when I was 13, my father passed away. He was a former decorated police officer (SWAT to be more specific) in my area, in line to be police chief, but his gambling and then getting hooked on crack destroyed his career. He was high one day and walking around his neighborhood naked. Someone saw him and called the police. The police recognized who he was and 6 officers were sent to get him. They couldn't handcuff him because my father knew all the tactics. So the six officers took my father to the ground, face down to handcuff him and the weight of all the men, plus being high killed him. I remember the day like it was yesterday. Sitting in my living room waiting to go to a baseball game that my mom had promised my sister and I for weeks. I was happy and excited, and then she received the phone call. I cried and cried. What was I supposed to know about death at 13? I tried to live life normally, and go to school but my fathers death was reported on 4 news stations and 7 newspapers. The newspaper from his city did a front page article about his death. Everyone knew. People constantly would come up to me asking if I was alright and if I wanted to talk. I was smothered, and couldn't handle it. I kept trying to push back what I was feeling. 


After the funeral my mother changed. She became angry over the littlest things, and she started to hate me. She would constantly degrade me for no reason, calling me stupid and a mistake. Often telling me she wish she had an abortion and that she didnt want me anymore. While my younger sister was her perfect little angel. (we have the same father) My mother would make sleep on the kitchen floor over night if I didn't clean it to her liking, or have me sweep 6-7 times in a row. I love to read, and my mother would take away my books as punishment, she would disconnect the TV, Internet, and phone lines just so I wouldn't have connection to anyone. She replaced my room door with a glass door that locks from the outside. And yes, I have been locked in there. She's beaten me but not as much as she would like to, as I often ran away. And she loved to constantly call the police on me and tell them I was on drugs and have them search my room to find absolutely nothing. 


Finally when I was 16, I snapped. I ran to the kitchen, pulled out the largest Cutco brand knife we had and held it to myself. (And If you don't know, Cutco knives are great! They cut through everything!) I went to my mother, with the edge towards me, I moved the handle in her direction. I told her to push it in. She wanted me gone so badly just do it, kill me now and get it over with. She didnt and she ended up just driving me to the emergency room. Her story changed between me holding the knife towards her, and me wanting to kill myself. (My mother is very self absorbed). She didnt understand that I never wanted to kill myself, but the fact of having to live everyday with someone saying that you were a mistake and they regret not having an abortion when you have no where else to live is torture. I was in the mental hospital for 2 weeks as an inpatient before the moved me to outpatient where I was for 4 weeks. The second time around 6 months later was 4 weeks inpatient 6 months outpatient. Doctors just loaded me with whatever antidepressant, anxiety pills they could find. All the while my grade and classwork suffered. My sister during this time began to draw fake bruises on herself by mixing the crayons and coloring pencils on her skin. They obviously looked faked but my mother ate it up and told everyone I was a psychopathic bully. 

6 months after leaving the hospital for the second time, my mother deemed I was still not good enough so she called the cops and told them to take me because she didn't want me anymore. I was placed into foster care the next day. I was so alone, frightened and scared. And even though I fortunately was placed with a single mom and her adopted daughter who tried to make me feel as comfortable as possible it was disheartening. I had never felt so abandoned and alone in my life. First my father, then my mother. I had no one. I was in foster care for almost a year when my grandmother fought to get me out. She took care of me for a bit, until the grandfather's Alzheimer's got worse and she had to focus on him. My mother reluctantly agreed to let me go back to her house after that. 


She kicked me out right after my 17 birthday and placed me in Job Corps. The worst thing ever. I would not recommend this to anyone. Began smoking pot to cope with a shitty life. At least my few highs brought me some kind of joy. Through a friend there I met what would be my first, and as of now only boyfriend. Things were great at first, we got along, and I lost my virginity to hit. Sometime down the road, on of his best friends went to jail and he was absolutely torn apart over it. He called me in the back yard of our place at the time because he said he had to talk and he just let me have. Beat me so bad I couldnt see or speak. I was too afraid to move. If I tried to defend myself he hit me harder. Beating me became a regular thing and continued for the remained of our 2 almost 3 year relationship. I have two scars on my face, one on my forehead, and one on my lip of where he hit me. I see these as constant reminders of how shitty my life is and now I'll have these scars forever. While this was happening our roommates stole all of my valuables, jewelry and electronics before running off and saying fuck you. I also found out later they (2 girls) were prostitutes. Awesome. I also must add, I was working a full time job and going to school full time as well. Straight A student, and makeup hid what it could at work. 



After narrowly escaping from the abusive relationship, I was able to run away and had my sister pick me up in the middle of the night. My sister still holds it over my head to this day, saying that she never should have picked me up and she should have let him kill me.  I begged my mother to let me stay there until I could get back on my feet. She agreed and I found a new job and switched schools. After a year and a few months we were back at each others throats and I moved in with a friend and his mom who happened to have an open room. It was closer to work and school and I would spend less time and money commuting. Still able to keep my grades up. Then about 8 months ago, I finished my legal program in school and completed my internship with high marks. My place where I did my internship decided to keep me on for a big case they were working on. Everything seemed to be finally working out for me. The friend I had moved in with spat in my face practically and ended the friendship we still don't talk and Im still living there. I worked on the case with the firm for 3 months out of town. I worked my ass off. 78 hour work weeks as the only paralegal supporting 6 attorneys at trial. I made a lot of money, and I was starting to look for my own apartment, and I even bought furniture. Trial ended we won, but on some preliminary motions the judge threw out our expert witness and our case collapsed after that. Worked slowed back at the office and they cut my hours to 15 hours a week maximum. It hurt. Still does. I don't understand why those who work hard in life get nothing. absolutely nothing. My sister on the other hand, has been stung out on drugs, fired from jobs, kicked out of her university, flunked community college, does absolutely nothing with her life and my mom caters to her. Covers all her bills and gives her absolutely everything. 



Oh, and the first guy I had a crush on since my ex asked me to help him find and track down his one true love. Turns out she was married (has been for 3 years and they were together for only 2.) 


I just want to say, Thank YOU GOD, KARMA, BUDDHA, CONFUCIUS,  &amp; WHATEVER OTHER FUCKING GODS ARE OUT THERE, THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE BIGGEST FUCKING SHIT ON MY LIFE EVER. THANKS. My life sucks. I have never been in love, no one has ever wanted me, my family treats me like shit and constantly degrades me, I work hard and get nothing in return, now I practically have no job with 15 hours a week because that doesnt even cover my bills. 


I hate it when people say it gets better. Because it doesn't. Look at my life. I have lived 23 YEARS OF BAD FUCKING LUCK. Maybe I was a bad person in a past life? I am so tired of trying to be a good person, be the better person, when life obviously doesnt take kindly to that. I am utterly alone and I fight this hard battle alone. Sometimes I just want someone I can open up to and share this with and just have them hug me and tell me its going to be okay. Thats all I really need, is a hug. and someone who will let me cry because I am tired of being strong. I am tired of having to put on my big girl pants and pretend everything is okay, because its not. No matter how hard I try to forget, I still hear my mother in the background telling me she doesnt want me, I feel my ex's punches to my face, I see my sister get everything for doing nothing. I hate it, I hate life, and I hate me. I've tried to open up to people about my life, but to those I do, they just shun me afterwards. I guess it was too hard even for them to deal with. I wish someone would just accept me and this baggage I have and just be a friend. Someone who will call me everyday to check on me, someone to talk or hangout, whatever. Because right now my soul is tired and I can't take this anymore. 




TL;DR - MY LIFE SUCKS ASS. AND TO THOSE WHO SAY LIFE GETS BETTER? FUCK YOU, IT DOESNT.  I believed that for a bit and it got me more bad luck. "

1c9c8p,0,2013-04-13,Should I stay in Computer Science? [cross post from AskReddit],UnsureAboutCS,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1c9c8p/should_i_stay_in_computer_science_cross_post_from/,"Just posted this to AskReddit and thought it might be a bit more relevant here:

First time poster here looking for advice. I'm a current CS major at the end of my second year in an honors program of a state school ranked in the top 10 for CS. I've been thinking for a very long time about pursuing a different major, but haven't discussed it in detail with anyone so I was curious what you guys think. 
Because of my high school credits, I'm almost at the end of the major and just need to take 4-5 CS elective classes to graduate. So I think I'll finish my CS major but the main question for me is whether I should stick with CS as a career, and if not, what I should do while I'm still in school to open the door for a career outside CS. Would a double major would be worth doing, or should I just graduate early and see where my degree takes me? 

Anyway, I have a lot to say and don't want this to be too much of a braindump, so I'll try to keep this organized.

These are my doubts about CS:

	1) When I decided on a major, I feel like I decided to major in CS for the wrong reasons: 
I only took one CS class in high school (AP), which was nothing like the classes I now take. I never did any programming competitions and didn't do any programming in my spare time (other than a little web development). I ended up deciding to major in it mostly based on the job outlook and a vague idea that, even if I didn't know what I wanted to do yet, I could still apply CS anywhere.

	2) I feel like I naturally have a hard time dealing with abstract concepts:
Whenever my professors or classmates are reasoning through some code or protocol in class, I tend to have a lot of trouble following along unless it's presented through an analogy. Proof-based classes are the worst of all, and frankly I come out of the lectures of most of my CS classes just feeling really confused and have to spend a lot of hours trying to catch up. My classmates don't seem to have this much trouble, so it's pretty disheartening… Not to mention it's hard for me to see the value in learning a lot of these abstract concepts in the first place.

	3) I don't really see myself doing this long-term.
Initially working on little ""toy projects"" for 2-3 weeks at a time was pretty fun, but it's getting less and less rewarding for me as I progress through the major and the projects get more complex. I find all my time now is spent just trying to wrap my head around what I'm supposed to do and doing painstaking debugging just to get the smallest things working, and it's just getting to a point where it just doesn't feel worth it anymore. I can't really see myself working in industry for my whole life doing that without burning out, under stricter deadlines and higher stakes.
Not to mention I've gotten the impression that there isn't much of a career ladder for software engineers, other than to jump to middle management, which I'm not very interested in. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like an easy way to stagnate in a rapidly-moving industry, and then be laid off and become unemployable for outdated skills.

On the other hand, recruiting at my school has been great, and I was able to get an internship after my first year, as well as one at Amazon for this summer. My first internship wasn't the greatest experience - a boring project and a team where I felt like more of a chair-filler than a contributor, but I'm really looking forward to this summer. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have landed great internships this early in another major, but, like I said, I have doubts about working in the tech industry long-term. 

I guess you could say I'm not interested in CS for its sake. I want to apply it to something I really love, but I don’t really know what that is. I thought about a lot of majors before picking CS - pre-med, architecture, psychology, business, the list goes on. I do have a pretty extensive art background and it's something I've always been interested in. It's not really something I want to make a career out of by itself, though.
I've thought about taking on a second business or economics major - widely applicable, more concrete and ""big-picture"" concepts, less time spend grinding away at a keyboard, better long-term career progression. Plus it seems like a natural combination with CS. Thoughts?

Any other ideas for majors that mesh well with CS and open up opportunities besides pure software engineering?

TLDR: Almost done with CS major, realized I don't really want to do software engineering long-term, thinking about second major but not really sure

1c9aov,5,2013-04-13,I feel like I wasted the past four years of my life getting a degree that will get me nothing. I am just looking for an open ear.,blonderain,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1c9aov/i_feel_like_i_wasted_the_past_four_years_of_my/,"I have failed. This thought has carved itself into the essence of who I am across the past six months.  It hasn’t been quick, more like a path warn into the ground by feet traversing the same line over and over again until it is impossible to veer elsewhere. 

I know I am young and that according to everyone else I try to speak to I have my entire life ahead of me. And I do. I don’t see how it will be any different than now. 

I am introverted. I am soft spoken.  Rooms of people that I need to meet would be up with the thought of being in a car that has driven into a lake. And that I am sitting there as water fills slowly then quickly as my fingers fumble with the seat belt.  Meeting new people is exactly like that, exactly what future employers don’t want to see. And I know they see it as I try to sit up straight and look at them with smiles. 

I graduated last May with a degree in Creative Writing. It took me half a year to land a temp job at a local bookstore that ends the first week of June. All the money I have been making that isn’t spent on student loans, a little more than half, goes into savings. About another one hundred goes towards a bus pass and I allow myself fifty dollars for snacks a month.  I will probably have three months’ worth of payments scraped up once the job ends. 

Retail is exhausting. I get home and all I want to do is sleep. It becomes like pulling teeth to do anything that requires energy, including writing, the one thing I know without a doubt I want to do with my life. I’m falling asleep now as I write this, trying to stave off my sleeping time. As if the pause of not going to bed will keep work further away. I am struggling to put together more applications. I do not want to be doing this. I don’t know what else I can do. Any writing job requires a portfolio. To get a portfolio I need to have a job or have the time and energy to actively pursue it. I have about four hours tacked on my day that is mine. I spend about 1-1.5 hours in transit each way. 

My mother asks me if I have applied to other jobs in my field. What field? What jobs? How do I do this? How do I find a career? How do I do something that she’ll be happy with? I want to make her happy. I want to so much, I want her to look at me and see what she sees in my cousins who all have fancy gown up jobs and are making money, much more then I can ever see myself achieving. 

I can remember vividly her pleading with my thirteen year old self as she shipped me off to private school telling me she “Wanted me to have chances she never had.” Neither of my parents went to college. They assumed I would go to college and get a good job. I went to college. I have a minimum wage temp job and am living at home.
My parents took on debt for me and more as I sauntered off to get a degree in creative writing that is proving to be as useful as a dead bird my cat like to leave under the sofa every other week. 

Oh but I want to write. If I don’t it builds and builds and builds like a never ending climax until everything that touches you burns and sears.  But how? Jobs won’t take me. I would love to get an internship with video game writers, or any internship that would help expand my career options. But instead I’m told to network and meet people. How I echo back. How? How? That question is slowly becoming the only thing I hear, clogging up my ears with nothing. 
I have made nothing off the opportunity my parents gave me, noting of what my mother gave me. I’m tired. I feel like a fool and an idiot. And very lost. Like someone dumped me in the middle of the ocean and no matter how I try I cannot find purchase. 

How do I help myself? This was supposed to be a simple post. I just needed to get out of my head and I wanted someone to talk to.

I'm in deep shit here. I'll be graduating from college in June and let's just say, it's been a hard 4 years.  It's a long story, but I hope you can bear with me.

It started when I started dating my ex in high school and I went over to his place after graduation, telling my dad I was with other friends as well. When my dad came to pick me up, he realized I was all alone with my ex and that's when the trouble began.

We flew back to Korea, he insisted that I was never going back to the US for college. All summer he banned me from the Internet, from keeping in contact with any of my high school friends. It was difficult but I pulled through, but things didn't get much better when I started college. He told me that I was not allowed to travel without his permission, and that I should record whatever money I spent, and he would call me on my dorm phone during weekends to make sure I was home. After a year of that, I got a job on campus for the summer, but my dad refused to let me take it. Being financially dependent, there was nothing I could do. I had to fly home (which was California at the time, my family moved there for a year), where I knew no one, was unemployed, and had nothing to do. I stayed in my room all day and had no social interaction with anyone other than my family for 3.5 months. By the end I was going crazy and throwing up everything I ate, had severe insomnia, contemplated suicide, etc. This experience fucked me up for the next year or so, despite the fact that I got a job on campus to pay for visits to my ex and I found a way to reroute my dorm phone to my cell.

At the end of sophomore year, I broke up with my ex and started dating a new guy. I kept the relationship a secret for almost a year and a half, telling my mother (who is considerably more reasonable) a month or two before I told my father. When I told him, he said that since I was an adult, he was not going to treat me the way he did before, and I was pleasantly surprised. I had hope that maybe he would change.

Winter break of senior year, I wanted to move off campus as I only had to work on a BA thesis, since I had completed my course requirements. I mentioned it to my mother but I guess it never came up with my dad, probably because we never speak (I hate his guts - can you blame me?). He calls me and accuses me of lying to his face and that he does not trust me or believe anything I say anymore. I calmly apologize and state that I never meant to hide anything, it just never came up, and that if I knew that it would make him so upset, I would never have done it. I even ask him why this upsets him so much, if he could please explain it? However, he fails to give me a straight answer and continues to scream at me and call me an untrustworthy ingrate of a daughter, and demands that I pack my  bags and come home right away. And I lost it.

I literally saw red. I screamed bloody murder that no, I will not do what he asks, and demanded to know how long he planned on telling me what to do. I told him that I hated him and that's why I never called, and that he made me wish I was never born, and I begged him to kill me because I would rather die than spend another moment dealing with his bullshit. He had never heard me act this way so he was taken aback. He said I should just live there on my own without his help, and I said fine. He hung up, and called back (in the meantime my mom called me to make sure I wasn't going to hurt myself - she's a sweetheart like that). He asked me what I wanted from him and I told him that I wanted him to stop telling me what to do, that I was going to live my own life and make my own choices. He was affronted by this, and literally asked me ""how could you say this to me?"" to which I replied, ""If you didn't want my honest opinion, why did you even ask?"" He was silent. He said he couldn't do that, and that if that was my condition, he could never see or talk to me again. I told him that's fine. I could tell he was horrified, I could hear his stunned silence over the phone. We hung up and I came home to see my grandpa one last time before he passed away and attend his funeral (he had cancer, this is totally unrelated).

Since then, we've had a bit of tension. He basically pretended the whole thing never happened, and I've informed him and my mom that I'm staying in the US after graduation, even if I don't have a job locked down (I don't yet, I'm still looking - I do have an internship to keep me busy until August), and they are obviously not okay with that. Which brings me to my present situation.

I'm thinking of declaring independence from my family. I'm thinking of writing my mom an e-mail (not my dad; he's beyond saving) about how emotionally crippled I've become because of my dad, how I've been taking antidepressants on and off throughout my college career, how I've contemplated overdosing on painkillers so my suffering could end. I plan on telling her that he has traumatized me so greatly that there is no way I could be happy while living under his roof, even for a moment. I plan on telling her that from now on, I will make my own decisions, and I fundamentally disagree with the notion that they seem to hold about my life, which is that it is a collective decision. It's my decision, and mine only.

My boyfriend and I have been together for two years (he's white, and my dad is opposed to this - he thinks mixed babies are doomed for a life of misery, don't ask why. my mom doesn't like him because he's not rich and therefore cannot take care of me, but she is more accepting of the fact that money is not important to me and I love who I love). We plan on moving in together. Some of my friends think I shouldn't tell my parents, but I'm tired of hiding my true self. I feel as though they should accept who I am, and if they can't, that's on them.

I should probably mention that I am not Asian-American. I'm Korean by ethnicity and citizenship. I've spent 13 years in the United States total though, and I'm basically white. My dad refuses to accept this, but I think it's time that I cut him out of my life if this is the case.

What do you guys think? Do you think the e-mail and honesty is a good idea? Do you think some things just can't be communicated, and that I should maintain the relationship I have with them now, telling them virtually nothing about my life and speaking to them only out of obligation? I'm extraordinarily unhappy, and have been so for years. I want more than anything to sort this out and begin the next chapter of my life as a happy person.

That was long, but I hope at least one person reads it and responds. I just feel so hopeless all the time.

**TL;DR Bout to graduate college, my dad's an asshat, I plan on declaring independence from my parents even though I may end up poor. Good idea or no?**"

1. How large of a difference will Computer Science @ UCLA and Computer Science @ Berkeley differ? Will I be at a significant disadvantage when looking for internships and, later, work in the Silicon Valley area if I attend UCLA?

2. I've heard that pre-Haas is very competitive and nearly cutthroat. How is UCLA's bizecon program? How does it compare to Berkeley's?

3. For UCLA, is it difficult to transfer into SEAS for Computer Science? I've heard that I'll

Clearly, you're 41 going on 14, because every person I've told about my little flub has asked me what's wrong with *you* that you wouldn't go out with me. Everyone that I've spoken to agrees that I must have the biggest balls on the planet to ask out an on-duty cop twice my age. 

Plus, lets be real - I'm fucking *gorgeous*. I'm tall. I'm a redhead with blue eyes. I'm 120 pounds and I'm a goddamn athlete for crying out loud. There's a reason you came in all the time, don't even try denying it. Maria noticed you staring at me like a hungry animal everytime I worked with her, Perry called you out on it when you were on that burglary detail around Christmas, and Mike wouldn't make jokes like he does if there was nothing there. Oh, and that girl you brought in when you were looking for gas right after the hurricane? She didn't look like she liked me too much.

But you did.

I think that's why I'm so hurt. No cop in their right mind sits around for 20 minutes after he gets coffee talking to the girl about his plans to go to Costa Rica again in June, or maybe you'll follow Phish around on tour like you've done since high school, or how you're gonna make me a mixtape of music I supposedly need to listen to. No cop tells random civilians about how Jeep gave you a bad car, so they swapped it out for a new one because you got them with that lemon law shit. No cop tells the coffee girl about how he used to be a copywriter and then a private investigator and then an intern with the NHL and then this andthenthatandtheotherthing. That's what you talk about on a coffee date and thats all I even wanted.

It doesn't help me much that you're so attractive. You're tall, a surfer, and everytime you're in uniform you work the room like a Kennedy. The only thing whiter than your hair are your teeth, and when you smile it makes me smile too. You're the only reason I listen to Phish, the reason I rediscovered my love of screamo music, the reason I planned on surfing all summer. On Memorial Day you told me about a surf school in Long Beach and wrote down the name on a piece of paper - I still have it. That was when I fell for you.

So here I am, 21 years old, totally bummed about some dude 20 years my senior. I don't understand you, and I doubt I will. I also don't understand why I'm so upset about it - You can't possibly be *that* great that it's worth sitting here in the middle of the night on reddit crying over this dique letter that I would never actually send to you. Maybe you or someone you're close to is a redditor and will see this - you're pretty recognizable and so am I.  I'm so unbelievably angry at you for rejecting me the way you did I could scream.

But I won't do that.

I'll just tell you that you might want to turn public searching off your facebook (nice cover photo - your JK sticker isn't THAT funny, your initials or the car model) and that if you ever decide to call me - don't. Clearly I wasn't even worth a happy ""Oh boy,"" so just don't bother backtracking. 

Dear John,

Your Facebook is public. Sorry you have such a bad joke on the side of your Jeep. Lose my number, I don't feel like going out anymore. Hope you can deal with decaf - because I can't really deal with you. 

Maybe I'll see you at the beach this summer,

Your favorite coffee girl"

Was told this would be a good place to post also! :)

First off let me say that I have a few accounts that I stopped using. I made this one my main account, but I guess it will still be considered a throwaway as per the mods.

As per my request,

I am going to go visit my girlfriend in Germany for the 3rd time. We have been together for 2 years now and these last few times, she has payed for my flights. Why? Because I am broke and I am currently still in college. (graduating May 3, graduation May 30th) Before anyone jumps to conclusions, I am not looking for money. All I am looking for is a large suitcase. So I ask, does anyone have a large suitcase that they are willing to part away with? I have a few but they are small, and I don't have the money to get one, let alone pay 70 dollars a pop per checked baggage with United Airline. Also, I tried my family and friends to no avail.

My financial situation is pretty shitty. I am probably going to go to Germany with 20 dollars in my pocket while my girlfriend allows me to stay in her apartment without having to pay one cent. She knows that if I had a job, I would support her just as she has supported me. While in Germany, we will spend time together, and I will also have a 3 week internship in a dental office in the city of Ramstein. We booked my flight today.

1c90p4,5,2013-04-12,[FR] Dance like no one is watching. And a question on a REALLY awkward situation. (WALL OF TEXT),Formula7,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1c90p4/fr_dance_like_no_one_is_watching_and_a_question/,"*Note, sorry for the shoddy story telling and the potentially shitty grammar. I didn't sleep much and I'm kind of rushing to get this out before I get dinner and head to work for the night. Also... I haven't written an FR in over a year. Definitely not like riding a bike.*

Ladies and Gentlemen, it has been a while. I just got out of a relationship that lasted a little over a year. I just would like to say that I got into that relationship because of the things I learned here. So, while it hurts to have it end, because it was great while it lasted, I can't thank you enough for what you have shown me, and the things I am going to learn from here on out. You people are amazing. Let's get it going.

Before my relationship ended, we decided to make it an open one since the distance was weighing down on us. I was a little reluctant at first, but I figured, ""What the hell... I have nothing else to lose, this already looks like it's going the wrong direction and I might as well.""
So, my friends caught wind and we started heading out. I brought a good friend of mine along who is an **amazing** pivot. Her, I, and two other guys I knew headed out to the bar last Wednesday night. After getting in, we immediately hit the bar and I started opening girls to get warm. I was doing alright, but realizing that I wasn't where I used to be when I had met my girlfriend. It was time to make a come back to that. We talked to different people through the night and nothing was really hooking. I didn't care. It was a first night back and I was focused on being outcome independent.
Well, my friend who was pivot for me loves to dance. She's really *really* high energy and never fails to lift me up to her level. We ended up being the only two people in the bar dancing our asses off and just having a blast. I kept tabs on what was going on around me and noticed a lot of girls staring and laughing and enjoying our dance battle. One in particular, who I found real cute, went up to the bar after watching us for a while. So, I headed up to get another drink.
I stood next to her, made eye contact, and smiled while holding. She smiled back and I turned to order my drink.
As I was about to say something, I realized there was something odd floating around in my drink and I lost focus for a moment trying to figure out what it was. Eventually she leaned over and said, ""Sorry, it's a roofie."" I let out a laugh and asked why she felt that was necessary. She shot back, ""I'm a girl and I have to make my job easy!"" Without missing a beat I said, ""You could have just asked if I was easy first."" And winked at her. She laughed and we got to talking.
Eventually she asked if I was gonna buy drinks. I told her I wasn't that easy. ""I thought you said you were, easy?""
""No, I said you could have asked if I was and you never asked. So now that you know that I'm not, how bout you buy the first round and I'll get the next. I think that's fair."" She smiled and obliged.
After sometime my friends all recommended we head to the club next door. We followed and, though it was empty, we all danced the night away and brought the energy up. In fact, everyone in the club who wasn't dancing, followed us on to the dance floor and joined in. My friend was up on the Go-go stage dancing like crazy and invited my target up there. I grabbed her by the hand, pulled her in, and gave her a lift on to the stage.

To make a long story short, we had a fun time, danced like crazy, and just enjoyed ourselves. I could not isolate her that night, but I managed to get her number and texted her after she left. We had a short conversation, agreed to go out dancing again the next day, and she went to bed.

Thursday came around and we texted a little bit through the day. I invited some of my friend since she invited hers and I got a guest list to a club my friends and I frequent. She ran late, as girls do, but got there. It actually surprised me because I thought she was gonna flake. I challenged her earlier that day to see how classy she could get, she did a pretty good job dressing up for the occasion. She brought a friend and I brought one. We chatted, did shots, and I eventually grabbed her hand and pulled her out to the dance floor. My buddy actually hit it off with her friend after I did some wing work and we all got to dancing.
Not much more than dancing happened in the club. While my pivot friend wasn't there, I managed to maintain the same frame from the last night of someone who just didn't care and wanted to have fun. She loved it. It wasn't too busy to I spun her around and dipped her from time to time.
Through the night, she was definitely pacing me. Being hot and cold, pushing and pulling. In the past, I would have grown frustrated with the situation, but I continued to just have fun and not care. Eventually, she recommended we all go back to her place for drinks. So her and I walked out of the club while our friends were too busy making out. We got outside and she was cold. So, I put my jacket on her, leaned her up against the wall, and kiss closed. I made sure to not be overly excited about it.
Our friends came out and I took her hand and we headed to the car. We drove back to her place and all had a little fun. Though, she was really drunk after more shots at her house and I'm not one to take advantage. So, I stopped and told her goodnight as she passed out on the couch and headed home.

Since then, we had a brunch date that got cut short by her mom visiting unexpectedly from out of town. I met her, I was drunk, it was hilarious. But that's outside of the point. Fast forward to yesterday.

Through the week we had texted here and there but nothing major. She had come to visit me at my work once (I work at a restaurant). Eventually, we found time to meet up again yesterday.

Yesterday was a tough one. I talked to my girlfriend that day about her coming home in a few months. She said she hadn't found a job back home and was thinking about staying in the bay area where she could find work. After asking where it left us, she gave me a hesitant, ""I don't know."" We hung up and I had a pretty shitty day. Hit the gym for a few hours (I'm there so long since I'm starting to intern as a coach for the power lifting program) and my gf called me up. We talked and after some discussion and some hard moments, we broke up. There were certain deal breakers that could not be overlooked, so, reluctantly, I let go, knowing it was the right thing to do.

That night, I met up with my, now ex, gf's best friend who had become a good friend of mine. We decided to hit karaoke after I told her what happened. She recommended that I bring my HB along. I gave her a text. She was being a little lazy and wanted to stay home. So, without struggle, I told her we'd stick to our original brunch plans we had for saturday and I'd just go out. I didn't want to push the issue. She told me she was originally just going to invite me over to drink with her, but decided that karaoke sounded fun and she'd come out.
We ended up at the bar later that night and met up with some friends. The bar we went to is always pretty random and interesting things always happen there. We ran into quite a few people all of us knew and our little group of five snowballed into something around 20 people. After drinks, singing, dancing, and generally having stupid fun, we decided to hit another bar.
Through this time, two other guys who she knew from school were pretty much clamoring over her. I let them do their thing and headed into the rest of the group to talk to other people and network. I ended up #closing another girl in the group after joking around with her for a while. As the last bar closed, we all went outside and one of the guys who was hitting on my (original) target bought a flower from a homeless guy and gave it to her. I wandered off to find my friend who was driving. As I am walking , I hear footsteps rush up and turn to see the HB grab my hand and walk with me. We got to the car and drove off the get food. She stuck with me the rest of the night, holding my hand and sitting next to me.
Eventually, disappointed, the other guy left. The party continued into the night at my friends house and didn't calm down until about 5am.
I drove her home and we sat in the driveway for a bit. She unbuckled but didn't exit the car. At this point, I had realized how my time being out of the game had taken a toll on my assertiveness and over all ""alpha"" mentality. Long distance relationships can be burdening.
She stared at me and we laughed. I knew what I was supposed to say, but eventually just said, ""I'll come around to let you out."" She smiled and said, ""Why don't you just hang out for a while? It seems safer than your drive home."" (I live pretty far from the midtown/downtown area and it usually takes me 15-20 minutes to get home when I'm out). So we went inside and grabbed some water and sat on the couch.
There was about a foot and a half of space between us and I sat there awkwardly for a bit. I analyzed for a while and finally stopped and told myself, ""She invited you in at 5am, alone, and is sitting near you. You have a pair of balls. Use them."" So, I slid over, took her chin with my hand and we kissed her.
We ended up not F-closing last night. We did, however, end up in her bed and after a few tries and her stopping me (she was pretty drunk again), I let it go and figured I'd give it another shot another time and decided to pass out.
It was 6am, I was exhausted and hadn't slept in almost 20 hours.

This is where it gets interesting...

I woke up about 2 hours later and it was hot. The bed was small, we were under some blankets, and cuddled together.  I reached down to give myself a man scratch and noticed some more-than-normal moisture. Needless to say... I. Freaked. Out.

I sat there reasoning with myself. The first thing that came to mind was, ""You haven't wet the bed in almost twenty fucking years! How did this happen... After my break up, with another girl... IN HER BED."" I turned over and buried my face into a pillow. I wanted to die. I wanted to sink through the bed frame and into the wall, never to be seen again. Her alarm went off and she hit snooze and didn't move as she fell back asleep. I spent an hour formulating a plan to get out of the bed and clean myself off, but I kept being remind that it didn't change the fact that there was piss all over her bed. After about an hour and her alarm going off a few more times, I finally convinced myself to sit up and try to go to the bathroom.
She shifted and looked up at me and asked if I was okay. I responded with a nervous yes. She asked why I was sitting up. After a pause, she got out of bed and turned to look at me.
""Fuck... *fuck*"" Was all she said as she ran to the bathroom. She came back and grabbed her robe and left again. I reached over to the other side of the bed to pull myself out and realized that it was just as wet. I stood up and realized I had to take a leak... then looked at the bed and realized where the majority of the moisture was.

It hit me. And then I felt bad. She came out of the bathroom and looked at me. She pointed at her bedside table to my pill of things. ""Phone, keys, watch... is that all your stuff?"" I nodded. ""Well, I'm sorry. I hate getting that drunk in front of people I don't know that well and I've already done that with you twice. But... I know you were going to drive me to school, but I'm kicking you out now...""
Not ever being in such a situation before, I was thrown back on my heals. I picked up my things and looked over at the bed. Then, we looked at each other. She apologized, ""I'm really sorry, like I said, I don't normally get that drunk in front of people I don't know that well... This never happens..."" I grabbed my shoes and said an awkward goodbye. She opened up the door, said, ""See you..."" and closed it. I drove home in silence and astonished.

I don't really give a shit that she wet the bed. We've all done dumb shit when we were plastered. Puked, pooped, pee'd, jumped on the hoods of random cars, etc. But, I know by her body language toward me and how it had developed over the past week that she had taken a liking to me, so she was extra embarrassed. I felt genuinely bad and empathized.
Later today, she texted me that she had way too much to do this weekend and cancelled brunch. I responded after I woke up telling her that it was cool and we would catch up next week. No response still.

I understand the abundance mentality. I'm fine with it and if I have to let this one roll off, I will. In all honesty, she's a great girl and a lot of fun. I'd love to keep her around as a friend until she moves back home after school. Really, I just would rather her not feel so humiliated, thinking I don't ever want to see her again and thinking I'm going to tell everyone in town (we live in a ""little-big"" city and no, not Reno). I'm not so sure what I do here, guys.

Has anyone else been in this situation before? What do you do? I'm a pretty genuine person in the end and, if anything, just hope she isn't so embarrassed that she never shows her face again and avoids me if she see's me around town. I really do feel bad.

**TL;DR** Met a girl, had a few dates and went dancing with her. Going really well. Went to her place, didn't F-close but fell asleep together. So drunk she wet the bed. Awkwardly asked me to leave and cancelled tomorrow's date. Feel bad that she's so embarrassed. What do?

**Edit**: Shitty spelling and grammar everywhere. I'll edit it later. Sorry, just run with me here, guys."

I currently live in Southern California, USA. I have a few things that I have questions or concerns about:

-The internship pays $1700 (£1100) per month and I don't know if I will be able to live easily off of this amount. From what I have read, Birmingham is an expensive place to live.

-I'm 22 years old so I would like to live in area with a younger community and a nice nightlife. Also I would like to easily be able to join some sort of sports team or gym.

-I plan on traveling by public transportation and by bicycle while I'm there. I assume this will not be an issue. Is biking in the rain a major inconvenience?

-Any recommendations for cellular phone companies for a year contract or prepaid system? I'm just going to use the phone I have now and transfer carriers.

-What is a good bank to use?

These are the major things I can think of. I will update with more if I think of them. Any added tips will be appreciated. Thanks.

I've pretty much gotten all my credits and I do not to want delay graduation for another year because 1. On my resume, four years looks better than four and a half or five years.
2. A family member might not be with us anymore to make it to the next graduation date."

I met this man on OKcupid ~20 months ago. We met up after a few months worth of messages at a local bar. We had a meaningful conversation pertaining to our political ideologies, our pasts, and future goals. It was a effortless/natural connection and the attraction was so intense that we left ~2 hours to make out in the parking lot where he eventually followed me home. We had sex. I am very picky when it comes to looks and he was my ideal partner physically and mentally. He dressed with style, had long hair, wonderful music taste, and a fantastic sense of humor. I was infatuated. He felt the same way about me. The next day he came back over and stayed for the night. For the next 3 months we saw each other every weekend. I then went on a trip with Habitat for Humanity, and he gave me a care package to take (alcohol, baked goods, with a card). We skyped every night. I sent him a card in the mail since he was in another state with his family. The card expressed my deep feelings for him/wanting to be in a relationship with him. He said he is normally terrified of such things, but wanted to be with me in the most natural way possible.
We dated for three months when I told him I could no longer take him seriously for the long haul since he had no job or education. To pay for things he sold all of his valuables on craigslist. I was at the time applying to graduate schools and working full time advising students at a University. Over these three months I found out the following...


His background:
He used to be a professional musician in Nashville. He was also a drug addict (did every street drug except for heroin and meth). Drugs took him down and it affected him so badly that he quit his career as a professional musician. He moved out of state to where I am, to live with his brother (who is 20+ years older than him) to ""escape drugs"". He quit cold turkey. However his brother's fiance wanted him out after he lived with them for over a year and a half. During this time he said he was ""getting clean"". When I told him I couldn't take him seriously he immediately got a full time job with Walgreens. He cut off his hair for the job. He bought a nice wardrobe. He also enrolled on his own in a local community college to complete his associates degree (only 2 classes short, and had a 3.0 GPA which is great at 54 credits).
When I saw his self improvement, we made the decision together for him to move into my studio apartment (550 square feet). We had a very functional and healthy relationship, we were great at communicating. We had plenty of passionate sex. We had so much fun together. It was my first romance. He met my entire family. My family adored him. They became his number 1 fans. HIS family is not present in his life at all. He also has absolutely no friends he stays in contact with on a regular basis. His parents... I only saw him speak to them maybe twice through out the relationship. His parents never helped him financially or emotionally. His mother sent him shitty care packages now and then, but it was obvious he only had me, my friends, my family for emotional support. It was not unhealthy, though. We made an awesome team, emotionally and financially. I have never been so close with a person. He has never been so close with a person. I found out he has had 2 girlfriends in his past. One was for 3 years but she cheated on him, so they broke up (he thought he was going to marry her). The other girlfriend was crazy and his junkie partner, she didn't matter to him in the end. I was the first healthy caring person he has had in his life, basically. To be clear: he has not had support from friends, family, or significant others.


When he completed his Associates at community college and transferred to the University I work at and now go to school at (I am in a masters program/still advising students). He also started pedicabbing downtown on weekends for extra money because his wages got GARNISHED. He told me his manager at walgreens told him for the next 18 months 25% of his wages would be collected from his paychecks. He said it was because he dipped on a lease in Nashville and they found him in Florida 5 years later... Then his car started to fall apart because . He had to get it fixed constantly for a few months and ended up spending ~$3,000. Pedicabbing is odd hours on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. From 8:00 PM - 3:00 AM.
He took 3 pre law classes. I never pressured him, it was his own choice to go back to school to become a lawyer. I was in my second semester of graduate school, working and interning. We hardly saw each other because through out the week I was busy, however I have weekends free. He went to night classes Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays. Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays he was pedicabbing until 4:00 AM WHILE working full time at Walgreens during the day.
Through out all of this going on he made it clear he was a long term partner. We talked about marriage, we talked about children, he bought my family holiday presents, we nested our apartment, bought a bed together (which I had to sign on the monthly payments of 17 months at $46 dollars per month, since he has bad credit). But he made it clear and played the role of being my life time partner. He made me feel like he had my back and I had his, always.


The last few months:
On Valentines day he spent $150 on flowers and we had amazing sex. However, after that day a switch went off. He got burnt out from working 2 jobs and getting absolutely no time to eat, sleep or study. When midterms came around he had no idea what to do. He freaked out. These midterms were take home midterms, he had time to read and complete these tests for quite some time. He waited until the day they were due. He gave himself no chance at succeeding. So, he did the smart thing and withdrew from 2 of his 3 classes.
But then he spiraled into depression. He stopped taking care of himself and his appearance. I tried to be there for him and support him through it but it seemed to make him feel worse. I tried to explain my support comes from love not from a place of ""you're not good enough"". We never kissed. We never had sex for that last month. We hardly saw each other, he worked all of the time. I thought it was a money issue, not a relationship issue.


Spring break came around and for that week my bird was having surgery (whom I have had since I was 5). I was 2 1/2 hours away but before I left I bought ~$80 of easy to eat groceries so that he would at least be taken care of in his depression. The day of my bird's surgery he said he ""needed space"". I told him I needed to talk and that he needs to compromise. He said ""sorry, then"". He has never been short with me so I was in great distress. For a week we didn't talk. My parents saw me unraveling and found out what was happening. Immediately they pressured me to find out what is going on. That night, one week later, the day before coming back home, my family had a crisis. It was emotionally devastating. I thought life is stressful enough and that I needed him for support, not extra stress because at this point I was unraveling.


That phone call he said ""maybe we moved too fast. I feel too much pressure"". I was shocked. He said he thinks he should move out. He said he doesn't know what is wrong with him, but that he doesn't deserve me and is fucked up. He said he had to go (pedicabbing) and was crying. He said we would talk the next day when I drove back because he was off of work. I agreed.


I left him a voicemail that day saying what time I'd arrive. When I came home the apartment was empty. He had moved out. I walked in without him there, when he said he would be there. It was traumatizing. I called him and he said ""I moved out, with a pedicabber, arranged it last night and moved in this morning, I have to sign things so I'll talk to you later"". A few hours go by and I asked him if he was coming over to talk and he said ""It will be awhile, will you be there awhile?"" and I then called him. Crying hysterically. I asked him if he was on a lease and he said he pays month to month. He said he was not on a lease. So clearly he was avoiding me. I told him my mom was driving up to be with me and he got mad because we were supposed to talk later. I then told him I packed up the rest of his things and it was outside my door. I said I was breaking up with him because he called me babe (clearly, he blew me out, but was being delusional calling me babe), he nonchalantly said ""okay, fine"". Only then he came speeding over to get his things. While speeding over he said ""I never wanted this. I never wanted to break up. I don't know what's wrong with me."" I told him I was breaking up with him not because I don't love him, that I love him with all my heart, but the way he was treating me was making me unravel and I need to be able to go to school, intern and work. He picked up his things and tried to get me to let him in but I didn't. He then asked for a poster of my favorite band, Swans (which I put $90 to framing, saying he'd pay me back, he never did). He never paid rent. He claimed for the first week of March he was living out of his car. He never offered to pay for the bed payments (I still have +$700 payments left). Later he texted me that he is ""destroyed and sorry"".


For those next 10 days there was no contact. My mom stayed with me. I dropped 20+ pounds. I went to a psychiatrist to get put on SSRIs, I also started seeing a trauma therapist. If it wasn't for my family and friends I'd probably be out of school, out of a job, and maybe not here at all. I've never had a broken heart, and I pictured my future with this man, and never thought it was possible for him to mistreat me because we had such a good relationship. It was literally an instant complete 180 with no warnings. I tried to get him to get help, he has no insurance but our University has FREE mental health help. He said ""I can't. I am unable to be helped, it doesn't work for me"". Apparently he went to a doctor in his past and was put on anti psychotics for general anxiety and depression, but claimed it didn't work. I told him the dose was probably too low and he probably didn't have a therapist he could connect with, that it could work. He wouldn't try.


I found his mother's phone number and decided to call. She didn't even know my name. She said he lied to her that he was living with a man for that entire year. When I told her of his erratic behavior she was not even concerned. She said ""Oh I'll tell him to call you"". She was so stupidly unaware of anything going on in his life with little concern. So I said ""I am not calling for that, I have accepted he's in my past. I am calling you to let you know he NEEDS YOU"". She said she appreciated me calling, never heard from her again. She probably didn't even tell his father for all I know. My ex told me he has fucked over his family plenty, so maybe they wiped their hands clean. I'll never know.


Two weekends ago he texted me that he was ""hurting too badly, needed to talk to me and see me"" I told him only if he could be open and honest and start acting like an adult and not a child. He said he would ""man up"". The next day I was about to go shopping with my mom and he texted me ""don't want you anymore, I am not crawling back, lose my number"". I started crying again. I didn't respond. Then he said ""I crossed some boundaries and logged into your facebook (the PW was the same as the WIFI PW, but I never thought he'd invade my privacy) and now know how you truly feel about me"". I was talking to a new male friend, who was experiencing heart break as well. He became a part of my support group. It was nice to vent and feel understood. He is just a friend. My ex then says ""He seems cool, why don't you go fuck him."" I was shocked, he never talked to me like this. I told my friend he was reading our convo and was changing my PW. Friend didn't care, understood. Ex called me ""heartless"". Ex and I texted for hours back and forth. He said he was ""crying in my room all day. I am destroyed. I can't talk right now"". I told him to just hold the phone to his ear after 2 hrs+ of texting back and forth. Finally he picked up. He said ""I would never speak ill of you"" (I said to friends that he up and left me, hacked into my facebook, was going through a midlife crisis, and acting like a douche bag) I told him ""I would have never left you"". He said ""I cannot believe you're getting consolation from another man"". He told me to move on. I told him if he didn't want to be spoken of in an ill manner, he should have behaved better, and that I am single and am free to say and do what I want. He started crying saying he had to go and so I asked him what was going on and he said ""I still love you"".
For the next few hours I was a mess and we were texting back and forth. I told him we had to fix things now or else resentments would be too strong, that I couldn't go back and forth anymore. 

Then my parents threatened to kick me out of their lives if I went back to him after what he did to me. They later admitted it was an empty threat, but they were emotional seeing me hurt so much. My ex kept saying he couldn't talk now and he needed time. I told him there is no more time, we have to fix it now, I'm trying to pull you out of the dark cave but you're not coming into the light and I can't stay in the dark cave anymore because it is sucking the life out of me. He said he was pedicabbing and that he would call me later. When I asked what time he said he didn't know and that it was busy. I told him he was making me feel like an obligation. I told him I don't know if he's coming or going, what is happening, that there is no security with him and he needs to act like an adult. He replied with ""fine, I'll make an adult decision. We are over. This is official. I don't want either of us to be in limbo anymore. You are free to fuck and date whomever you like. This fucking sucks but I guess this is how it has to be. Good bye, I'll miss you"". I didn't respond. A few hours later he texts me ""I am on break, you can call me if you want to still talk"". I didn't respond. He then says ""fine, I'll take this as the cut off point. Goodbye, I'll miss you"". I responded and said ""I wish you the best, it never had to be this way, you self sabotaged and made it this way. You blew me out. You created the abusive pattern by leaving me, hacking into my facebook, getting mad at what I was saying when I am single, by giving me bait such as ""I guess this is how it has to be"" and then saying ""you can call me if you want"". If I try to remedy the situation I am just continuing the abusive pattern. It never had to be this way."" He replied with ""If you see me downtown you're allowed to say hi"". I didn't respond.
I found out from a mutual friend that he lives with a 65 year old pedicabber. He also owes the pedicab shop rent money (it is $105 each week in rent). He makes AT LEAST $1,100 a month. I asked him before we cut communication if he was on drugs and he swore he isn't and all his money goes to ""bullshit I guess"".


This past Friday I was on the outskirts downtown at a bar my friends DJ at. A fellow pedicabber offered to give me a free ride so I asked him if he knew my ex. He said he doesn't. So I said the owner of the shops name and he knew the guy and I asked if they do drugs. He said they snort and smoke marijuana. He asked for my ex's description. Apparently that night he snaked this guy out (this guy was about to get a ride then my ex rode in front of him and stole these customers from him). This pedicabber said if this happened in Washington D.C. he would get the shit beat out of him and that the Orlando pedicabbers are all careless crack heads. He said he would say something to my ex next time he messes with him for me on my behalf because he said what he did was not what someone who loves someone would do. Like my ex, this pedicabber is a drifter, and he said he would never do my ex did. he dropped me off.


I then went back to the bar and my best friend gave me mushrooms, alcohol and marijuana. I needed to leave my black hole and use drugs as a means of new realizations. I was surrounded by loving friends. But then I wanted to walk up the street with my bestfriend, while doing so, my ex rode by. There is no business to be made where I was, so he was creeping on me. Naturally, I felt immense amounts of anger, not because he came out to where I was, but because he looked AWFUL. He looked homeless. His beard was grown out. He was skinny. His hair was long. My best friend didn't recognize him and said he looked like scum. I flipped him off and said ""fuck you"". He turned around and said ""real mature"" and I yelled back ""real mature? Real mature leaving me high and dry, sticking me with the bills, dropping out of school, you fail at life!"". He texted me later saying ""I'm sure you feel really great about that, you FINALLY got to tell off the loser who broke your heart with a ""fuck you"" have a good night. I ignored it.
However today I sent him this text message... I told him ""you coming over to where I am without initiating contact via phone, you looking so terrible (my friend and I didn't recognize you, you look homeless), I was on a heavy dose of mushrooms, so when you came out of no where my anger took over. I am so angry that you ruined what we had and I am more angry at you for ruining your life when you have so much potential. I'm just really disappointed in you and what we could have been and seeing you self-destruct. Please do not antagonize me anymore. If you want help, support, or a friend I am here, but I can't see you willingly fuck your life up. Please get help"".


He responded with ""Actually, I caught a $40 ride over there earlier that night and if I looked so terrible, I'm sure women wouldn't have been hitting on me that night. Just wanted to clear that up."" So I said ""I'm sure the caliber of women is not great, but you don't look healthy, don't want to insult you"". He said ""Whatever makes you feel better. I was doing my job. I happened to see you. You said ""fuck you"". I told him ""wouldn't you have done the same if you I had done what you did to me, to you?"" and he said ""No, I wouldn't have. Not making excuses here, but I'm going through some shit, and you claimed you care and are concerned but when you act like that I know you're full of shit. Doesn't matter anymore. You should've left it at fuck you. I've always taken responsibility for fucking up I didn't blame this on you"".


My last words to him are the following: ""Lastly, you take my words for truth. But people say things they don't mean when they are deeply hurt. Speaking ill of you to my support group (whatever makes me feel better, right?) if you don't want to be spoken poorly of, act like a decent human being with integrity and a heart. Take a look at your actions. You up and left me with no warning after playing the role of my significant other (you made me believe I had your back and you had mine) my world came crashing down the way you handled your freak out (so selfish and hurtful, very sociopath like behavior BTW), you then play with my heart and hack into my facebook, use it against me when I was hurt, weak and vulnerable from your heartless actions (and stressed the fuck out because my world was turned upside down since you changed like a flip of a switch, nearly ruined my own reputation at work/internship/school) and while I was in emotional distress you kept slapping me around emotionally abusing me, giving hope, taking it away, coming and going as you please. My fuck you, speaking ill of you, is because I am a deeply hurt human being who was toyed with, abused and discarded like a piece of shit. Then you accuse me for being full of shit for saying fuck you. Those are words from the hurt/scars you have created for me. What I did was what I had to do, not the right thing to do, to get it off my chest. But look at my actions. I've been here, trying to fix things, taking your bullshit/abuse because I refuse to accept that this is you. I refuse to imagine you pretended this entire time and this is your true skin. But you're not taking a deep look at yourself and taking responsibility and changing for the better. You're stuck wallowing and blaming other people for for your careless decisions and are unable to deal with the consequences of your decisions and also unable to follow through, because you're not thinking about anyone else but yourself and your feelings. But you made it this way. I only wanted love and happiness and I gave it without hesitation, fear or doubt. Maybe you cheated on me. Maybe you did drugs. Maybe you have a baby. Maybe someone died. Maybe you killed someone. I don't know what to think and how you could do a complete 180 without hesitation, quit on me, quit on us, quit on yourself, and hurt me so deeply. You never loved me if this is how things end. Maybe you loved me with all you could love, maybe you just don't know what love is because you never had it until me. But you had it with me. You had all of me. But I had none of you. Ever""


He isn't responding.


I don't know how to move on from here. I am still overly analyzing where things and how things went wrong. Is there anyone who could provide observations? I need clarification. I am so lost and confused in my hurt.


My dad told me if he thought he was sincere about me, he would have paid the entire rent. Told my ex not to worry and to just do good in University. He said if he wanted help he would help him. But he doesn't want help. He compared my ex to a stray dog. Some stray dogs want help and are rehomed and great family additions. But some won't trust ever again and run away when trying to be helped. He told me there is no hope, that he will only drag me down, and do it again.
My ex won't hear me out. Doesn't take any accountability. Is there anything I can say or do to make him see the light? Am I doing something wrong? How do I move on? How do I stop analyzing? I have plenty of friends and family who love me. I have a great life going for me. I'll be okay. But I just can't grasp how things have fallen apart, been abandoned by ""the love of my life"", and how he could treat me so terribly. I am so broken. I want to be strong. I want to push through this. But I need advice/validation that I am not the one who ruined this. and maybe there is something else that can be said/done to fix things? I can't stand that my primary relationship is gone, unable to be fixed for even friendship. That he sees me as the one who gave up/ruined things, the nemesis. How can someone not see what they've done? Maybe I am naive. Maybe I am too hurt. Please help me gain perspective, Reddit.


Tl;DR: Ex [28M] and I [24F] lived together for 15 months, said he was in for long haul, wanted to be with me for life. Was living with brother (who I don't know really existed) getting clean for 1 1/2 years after being a professional musician/drug addict in Nashville, Got two jobs (walgreens full time, peddicabbing). Got into University to do pre law. Withdrew from 2 of 3 classes because his wages at Walgreens got garnished so he pedicabbed more and got burnt out. Felt like a failure/turned depressed/distant. Bought a bed with me, nested apartment. Met my family. He up and left me without warning saying the apartment felt like ""a coffin"", erratic behavior, might be on drugs or experiencing a mental break down, comes and goes in my life as he wants but finds reasons that I am wrong (hacking into my FB reading my messages between my support group, blaming me for speaking ill of him when I only spoke of his ill behavior, claiming I don't give a shit about him), tries to get me jealous now, always has to have last hurtful word, takes no accountability for his heartless actions). I don't know what to do or how to feel. Need perspective. Please read my post and give me your best comment."

The last few months:
On Valentines day he spent $150 on flowers and we had amazing sex. However, after that day a switch went off. He got burnt out from working 2 jobs and getting absolutely no time to eat, sleep or study. When midterms came around he had no idea what to do. He freaked out. These midterms were take home midterms, he had time to read and complete these tests for quite some time. He waited until the day they were due. He gave himself no chance at succeeding. So, he did the smart thing and withdrew from 2 of his 3 classes.
But then he spiraled into depression. He stopped taking care of himself and his appearance. I tried to be there for him and support him through it but it seemed to make him feel worse. I tried to explain my support comes from love not from a place of ""you're not good enough"". We never kissed. We never had sex for that last month. We hardly saw each other, he worked all of the time. I thought it was a money issue, not a relationship issue.


Spring break came around and for that week my bird was having surgery (whom I have had since I was 5). I was 2 1/2 hours away but before I left I bought ~$80 of easy to eat groceries so that he would at least be taken care of in his depression. The day of my bird's surgery he said he ""needed space"". I told him I needed to talk and that he needs to compromise. He said ""sorry, then"". He has never been short with me so I was in great distress. For a week we didn't talk. My parents saw me unraveling and found out what was happening. Immediately they pressured me to find out what is going on. That night, one week later, the day before coming back home, my family had a crisis. It was emotionally devastating. I thought life is stressful enough and that I needed him for support, not extra stress because at this point I was unraveling.


That phone call he said ""maybe we moved too fast. I feel too much pressure"". I was shocked. He said he thinks he should move out. He said he doesn't know what is wrong with him, but that he doesn't deserve me and is fucked up. He said he had to go (pedicabbing) and was crying. He said we would talk the next day when I drove back because he was off of work. I agreed.


I left him a voicemail that day saying what time I'd arrive. When I came home the apartment was empty. He had moved out. I walked in without him there, when he said he would be there. It was traumatizing. I called him and he said ""I moved out, with a pedicabber, arranged it last night and moved in this morning, I have to sign things so I'll talk to you later"". A few hours go by and I asked him if he was coming over to talk and he said ""It will be awhile, will you be there awhile?"" and I then called him. Crying hysterically. I asked him if he was on a lease and he said he pays month to month. He said he was not on a lease. So clearly he was avoiding me. I told him my mom was driving up to be with me and he got mad because we were supposed to talk later. I then told him I packed up the rest of his things and it was outside my door. I said I was breaking up with him because he called me babe (clearly, he blew me out, but was being delusional calling me babe), he nonchalantly said ""okay, fine"". Only then he came speeding over to get his things. While speeding over he said ""I never wanted this. I never wanted to break up. I don't know what's wrong with me."" I told him I was breaking up with him not because I don't love him, that I love him with all my heart, but the way he was treating me was making me unravel and I need to be able to go to school, intern and work. He picked up his things and tried to get me to let him in but I didn't. He then asked for a poster of my favorite band, Swans (which I put $90 to framing, saying he'd pay me back, he never did). He never paid rent. He claimed for the first week of March he was living out of his car. He never offered to pay for the bed payments (I still have +$700 payments left). Later he texted me that he is ""destroyed and sorry"".


For those next 10 days there was no contact. My mom stayed with me. I dropped 20+ pounds. I went to a psychiatrist to get put on SSRIs, I also started seeing a trauma therapist. If it wasn't for my family and friends I'd probably be out of school, out of a job, and maybe not here at all. I've never had a broken heart, and I pictured my future with this man, and never thought it was possible for him to mistreat me because we had such a good relationship. It was literally an instant complete 180 with no warnings. I tried to get him to get help, he has no insurance but our University has FREE mental health help. He said ""I can't. I am unable to be helped, it doesn't work for me"". Apparently he went to a doctor in his past and was put on anti psychotics for general anxiety and depression, but claimed it didn't work. I told him the dose was probably too low and he probably didn't have a therapist he could connect with, that it could work. He wouldn't try.


I found his mother's phone number and decided to call. She didn't even know my name. She said he lied to her that he was living with a man for that entire year. When I told her of his erratic behavior she was not even concerned. She said ""Oh I'll tell him to call you"". She was so stupidly unaware of anything going on in his life with little concern. So I said ""I am not calling for that, I have accepted he's in my past. I am calling you to let you know he NEEDS YOU"". She said she appreciated me calling, never heard from her again. She probably didn't even tell his father for all I know. My ex told me he has fucked over his family plenty, so maybe they wiped their hands clean. I'll never know.


Two weekends ago he texted me that he was ""hurting too badly, needed to talk to me and see me"" I told him only if he could be open and honest and start acting like an adult and not a child. He said he would ""man up"". The next day I was about to go shopping with my mom and he texted me ""don't want you anymore, I am not crawling back, lose my number"". I started crying again. I didn't respond. Then he said ""I crossed some boundaries and logged into your facebook (the PW was the same as the WIFI PW, but I never thought he'd invade my privacy) and now know how you truly feel about me"". I was talking to a new male friend, who was experiencing heart break as well. He became a part of my support group. It was nice to vent and feel understood. He is just a friend. My ex then says ""He seems cool, why don't you go fuck him."" I was shocked, he never talked to me like this. I told my friend he was reading our convo and was changing my PW. Friend didn't care, understood. Ex called me ""heartless"". Ex and I texted for hours back and forth. He said he was ""crying in my room all day. I am destroyed. I can't talk right now"". I told him to just hold the phone to his ear after 2 hrs+ of texting back and forth. Finally he picked up. He said ""I would never speak ill of you"" (I said to friends that he up and left me, hacked into my facebook, was going through a midlife crisis, and acting like a douche bag) I told him ""I would have never left you"". He said ""I cannot believe you're getting consolation from another man"". He told me to move on. I told him if he didn't want to be spoken of in an ill manner, he should have behaved better, and that I am single and am free to say and do what I want. He started crying saying he had to go and so I asked him what was going on and he said ""I still love you"".
For the next few hours I was a mess and we were texting back and forth. I told him we had to fix things now or else resentments would be too strong, that I couldn't go back and forth anymore. 

Then my parents threatened to kick me out of their lives if I went back to him after what he did to me. They later admitted it was an empty threat, but they were emotional seeing me hurt so much. My ex kept saying he couldn't talk now and he needed time. I told him there is no more time, we have to fix it now, I'm trying to pull you out of the dark cave but you're not coming into the light and I can't stay in the dark cave anymore because it is sucking the life out of me. He said he was pedicabbing and that he would call me later. When I asked what time he said he didn't know and that it was busy. I told him he was making me feel like an obligation. I told him I don't know if he's coming or going, what is happening, that there is no security with him and he needs to act like an adult. He replied with ""fine, I'll make an adult decision. We are over. This is official. I don't want either of us to be in limbo anymore. You are free to fuck and date whomever you like. This fucking sucks but I guess this is how it has to be. Good bye, I'll miss you"". I didn't respond. A few hours later he texts me ""I am on break, you can call me if you want to still talk"". I didn't respond. He then says ""fine, I'll take this as the cut off point. Goodbye, I'll miss you"". I responded and said ""I wish you the best, it never had to be this way, you self sabotaged and made it this way. You blew me out. You created the abusive pattern by leaving me, hacking into my facebook, getting mad at what I was saying when I am single, by giving me bait such as ""I guess this is how it has to be"" and then saying ""you can call me if you want"". If I try to remedy the situation I am just continuing the abusive pattern. It never had to be this way."" He replied with ""If you see me downtown you're allowed to say hi"". I didn't respond.
I found out from a mutual friend that he lives with a 65 year old pedicabber. He also owes the pedicab shop rent money (it is $105 each week in rent). He makes AT LEAST $1,100 a month. I asked him before we cut communication if he was on drugs and he swore he isn't and all his money goes to ""bullshit I guess"".


This past Friday I was on the outskirts downtown at a bar my friends DJ at. A fellow pedicabber offered to give me a free ride so I asked him if he knew my ex. He said he doesn't. So I said the owner of the shops name and he knew the guy and I asked if they do drugs. He said they snort and smoke marijuana. He asked for my ex's description. Apparently that night he snaked this guy out (this guy was about to get a ride then my ex rode in front of him and stole these customers from him). This pedicabber said if this happened in Washington D.C. he would get the shit beat out of him and that the Orlando pedicabbers are all careless crack heads. He said he would say something to my ex next time he messes with him for me on my behalf because he said what he did was not what someone who loves someone would do. Like my ex, this pedicabber is a drifter, and he said he would never do my ex did. he dropped me off.


I then went back to the bar and my best friend gave me mushrooms, alcohol and marijuana. I needed to leave my black hole and use drugs as a means of new realizations. I was surrounded by loving friends. But then I wanted to walk up the street with my bestfriend, while doing so, my ex rode by. There is no business to be made where I was, so he was creeping on me. Naturally, I felt immense amounts of anger, not because he came out to where I was, but because he looked AWFUL. He looked homeless. His beard was grown out. He was skinny. His hair was long. My best friend didn't recognize him and said he looked like scum. I flipped him off and said ""fuck you"". He turned around and said ""real mature"" and I yelled back ""real mature? Real mature leaving me high and dry, sticking me with the bills, dropping out of school, you fail at life!"". He texted me later saying ""I'm sure you feel really great about that, you FINALLY got to tell off the loser who broke your heart with a ""fuck you"" have a good night. I ignored it.
However today I sent him this text message... I told him ""you coming over to where I am without initiating contact via phone, you looking so terrible (my friend and I didn't recognize you, you look homeless), I was on a heavy dose of mushrooms, so when you came out of no where my anger took over. I am so angry that you ruined what we had and I am more angry at you for ruining your life when you have so much potential. I'm just really disappointed in you and what we could have been and seeing you self-destruct. Please do not antagonize me anymore. If you want help, support, or a friend I am here, but I can't see you willingly fuck your life up. Please get help"".


He responded with ""Actually, I caught a $40 ride over there earlier that night and if I looked so terrible, I'm sure women wouldn't have been hitting on me that night. Just wanted to clear that up."" So I said ""I'm sure the caliber of women is not great, but you don't look healthy, don't want to insult you"". He said ""Whatever makes you feel better. I was doing my job. I happened to see you. You said ""fuck you"". I told him ""wouldn't you have done the same if you I had done what you did to me, to you?"" and he said ""No, I wouldn't have. Not making excuses here, but I'm going through some shit, and you claimed you care and are concerned but when you act like that I know you're full of shit. Doesn't matter anymore. You should've left it at fuck you. I've always taken responsibility for fucking up I didn't blame this on you"".


My last words to him are the following: ""Lastly, you take my words for truth. But people say things they don't mean when they are deeply hurt. Speaking ill of you to my support group (whatever makes me feel better, right?) if you don't want to be spoken poorly of, act like a decent human being with integrity and a heart. Take a look at your actions. You up and left me with no warning after playing the role of my significant other (you made me believe I had your back and you had mine) my world came crashing down the way you handled your freak out (so selfish and hurtful, very sociopath like behavior BTW), you then play with my heart and hack into my facebook, use it against me when I was hurt, weak and vulnerable from your heartless actions (and stressed the fuck out because my world was turned upside down since you changed like a flip of a switch, nearly ruined my own reputation at work/internship/school) and while I was in emotional distress you kept slapping me around emotionally abusing me, giving hope, taking it away, coming and going as you please. My fuck you, speaking ill of you, is because I am a deeply hurt human being who was toyed with, abused and discarded like a piece of shit. Then you accuse me for being full of shit for saying fuck you. Those are words from the hurt/scars you have created for me. What I did was what I had to do, not the right thing to do, to get it off my chest. But look at my actions. I've been here, trying to fix things, taking your bullshit/abuse because I refuse to accept that this is you. I refuse to imagine you pretended this entire time and this is your true skin. But you're not taking a deep look at yourself and taking responsibility and changing for the better. You're stuck wallowing and blaming other people for for your careless decisions and are unable to deal with the consequences of your decisions and also unable to follow through, because you're not thinking about anyone else but yourself and your feelings. But you made it this way. I only wanted love and happiness and I gave it without hesitation, fear or doubt. Maybe you cheated on me. Maybe you did drugs. Maybe you have a baby. Maybe someone died. Maybe you killed someone. I don't know what to think and how you could do a complete 180 without hesitation, quit on me, quit on us, quit on yourself, and hurt me so deeply. You never loved me if this is how things end. Maybe you loved me with all you could love, maybe you just don't know what love is because you never had it until me. But you had it with me. You had all of me. But I had none of you. Ever""


He isn't responding.


I don't know how to move on from here. I am still overly analyzing where things and how things went wrong. Is there anyone who could provide observations? I need clarification. I am so lost and confused in my hurt.


My dad told me if he thought he was sincere about me, he would have paid the entire rent. Told my ex not to worry and to just do good in University. He said if he wanted help he would help him. But he doesn't want help. He compared my ex to a stray dog. Some stray dogs want help and are rehomed and great family additions. But some won't trust ever again and run away when trying to be helped. He told me there is no hope, that he will only drag me down, and do it again.
My ex won't hear me out. Doesn't take any accountability. Is there anything I can say or do to make him see the light? Am I doing something wrong? How do I move on? How do I stop analyzing? I have plenty of friends and family who love me. I have a great life going for me. I'll be okay. But I just can't grasp how things have fallen apart, been abandoned by ""the love of my life"", and how he could treat me so terribly. I am so broken. I want to be strong. I want to push through this. But I need advice/validation that I am not the one who ruined this. and maybe there is something else that can be said/done to fix things? I can't stand that my primary relationship is gone, unable to be fixed for even friendship. That he sees me as the one who gave up/ruined things, the nemesis. How can someone not see what they've done? Maybe I am naive. Maybe I am too hurt. Please help me gain perspective, Reddit.


Tl;DR: Ex [28M] and I [24F] lived together for 15 months, said he was in for long haul, wanted to be with me for life. Was living with brother (who I don't know really existed) getting clean for 1 1/2 years after being a professional musician/drug addict in Nashville, Got two jobs (walgreens full time, peddicabbing). Got into University to do pre law. Withdrew from 2 of 3 classes because his wages at Walgreens got garnished so he pedicabbed more and got burnt out. Felt like a failure/turned depressed/distant. Bought a bed with me, nested apartment. Met my family. He up and left me without warning saying the apartment felt like ""a coffin"", erratic behavior, might be on drugs or experiencing a mental break down, comes and goes in my life as he wants but finds reasons that I am wrong (hacking into my FB reading my messages between my support group, blaming me for speaking ill of him when I only spoke of his ill behavior, claiming I don't give a shit about him), tries to get me jealous now, always has to have last hurtful word, takes no accountability for his heartless actions). I don't know what to do or how to feel. Need perspective. Please read my post and give me your best comment."

I met this man on OKcupid ~20 months ago. We met up after a few months worth of messages at a local bar. We had a meaningful conversation pertaining to our political ideologies, our pasts, and future goals. It was a effortless/natural connection and the attraction was so intense that we left ~2 hours to make out in the parking lot where he eventually followed me home. We had sex. I am very picky when it comes to looks and he was my ideal partner physically and mentally. He dressed with style, had long hair, wonderful music taste, and a fantastic sense of humor. I was infatuated. He felt the same way about me. The next day he came back over and stayed for the night. For the next 3 months we saw each other every weekend. I then went on a trip with Habitat for Humanity, and he gave me a care package to take (alcohol, baked goods, with a card). We skyped every night. I sent him a card in the mail since he was in another state with his family. The card expressed my deep feelings for him/wanting to be in a relationship with him. He said he is normally terrified of such things, but wanted to be with me in the most natural way possible. We dated for three months when I told him I could no longer take him seriously for the long haul since he had no job or education. To pay for things he sold all of his valuables on craigslist. I was at the time applying to graduate schools and working full time advising students at a University. Over these three months I found out the following...


His background: He used to be a professional musician in Nashville. He was also a drug addict (did every street drug except for heroin and meth). Drugs took him down and it affected him so badly that he quit his career as a professional musician. He moved out of state to where I am, to live with his brother (who is 20+ years older than him) to ""escape drugs"". He quit cold turkey. However his brother's fiance wanted him out after he lived with them for over a year and a half. During this time he said he was ""getting clean"". When I told him I couldn't take him seriously he immediately got a full time job with Walgreens. He cut off his hair for the job. He bought a nice wardrobe. He also enrolled on his own in a local community college to complete his associates degree (only 2 classes short, and had a 3.0 GPA which is great at 54 credits). When I saw his self improvement, we made the decision together for him to move into my studio apartment (550 square feet). We had a very functional and healthy relationship, we were great at communicating. We had plenty of passionate sex. We had so much fun together. It was my first romance. He met my entire family. My family adored him. They became his number 1 fans. HIS family is not present in his life at all. He also has absolutely no friends he stays in contact with on a regular basis. His parents... I only saw him speak to them maybe twice through out the relationship. His parents never helped him financially or emotionally. His mother sent him shitty care packages now and then, but it was obvious he only had me, my friends, my family for emotional support. It was not unhealthy, though. We made an awesome team, emotionally and financially. I have never been so close with a person. He has never been so close with a person. I found out he has had 2 girlfriends in his past. One was for 3 years but she cheated on him, so they broke up (he thought he was going to marry her). The other girlfriend was crazy and his junkie partner, she didn't matter to him in the end. I was the first healthy caring person he has had in his life, basically. To be clear: he has not had support from friends, family, or significant others.


When he completed his Associates at community college and transferred to the University I work at and now go to school at (I am in a masters program/still advising students). He also started pedicabbing downtown on weekends for extra money because his wages got GARNISHED. He told me his manager at walgreens told him for the next 18 months 25% of his wages would be collected from his paychecks. He said it was because he dipped on a lease in Nashville and they found him in Florida 5 years later... Then his car started to fall apart because . He had to get it fixed constantly for a few months and ended up spending ~$3,000. Pedicabbing is odd hours on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. From 8:00 PM - 3:00 AM. He took 3 pre law classes. I never pressured him, it was his own choice to go back to school to become a lawyer. I was in my second semester of graduate school, working and interning. We hardly saw each other because through out the week I was busy, however I have weekends free. He went to night classes Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays. Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays he was pedicabbing until 4:00 AM WHILE working full time at Walgreens during the day. Through out all of this going on he made it clear he was a long term partner. We talked about marriage, we talked about children, he bought my family holiday presents, we nested our apartment, bought a bed together (which I had to sign on the monthly payments of 17 months at $46 dollars per month, since he has bad credit). But he made it clear and played the role of being my life time partner. He made me feel like he had my back and I had his, always.


The last few months: On Valentines day he spent $150 on flowers and we had amazing sex. However, after that day a switch went off. He got burnt out from working 2 jobs and getting absolutely no time to eat, sleep or study. When midterms came around he had no idea what to do. He freaked out. These midterms were take home midterms, he had time to read and complete these tests for quite some time. He waited until the day they were due. He gave himself no chance at succeeding. So, he did the smart thing and withdrew from 2 of his 3 classes. But then he spiraled into depression. He stopped taking care of himself and his appearance. I tried to be there for him and support him through it but it seemed to make him feel worse. I tried to explain my support comes from love not from a place of ""you're not good enough"". We never kissed. We never had sex for that last month. We hardly saw each other, he worked all of the time. I thought it was a money issue, not a relationship issue.


Spring break came around and for that week my bird was having surgery (whom I have had since I was 5). I was 2 1/2 hours away but before I left I bought ~$80 of easy to eat groceries so that he would at least be taken care of in his depression. The day of my bird's surgery he said he ""needed space"". I told him I needed to talk and that he needs to compromise. He said ""sorry, then"". He has never been short with me so I was in great distress. For a week we didn't talk. My parents saw me unraveling and found out what was happening. Immediately they pressured me to find out what is going on. That night, one week later, the day before coming back home, my family had a crisis. It was emotionally devastating. I thought life is stressful enough and that I needed him for support, not extra stress because at this point I was unraveling.


That phone call he said ""maybe we moved too fast. I feel too much pressure"". I was shocked. He said he thinks he should move out. He said he doesn't know what is wrong with him, but that he doesn't deserve me and is fucked up. He said he had to go (pedicabbing) and was crying. He said we would talk the next day when I drove back because he was off of work. I agreed.


I left him a voicemail that day saying what time I'd arrive. When I came home the apartment was empty. He had moved out. I walked in without him there, when he said he would be there. It was traumatizing. I called him and he said ""I moved out, with a pedicabber, arranged it last night and moved in this morning, I have to sign things so I'll talk to you later"". A few hours go by and I asked him if he was coming over to talk and he said ""It will be awhile, will you be there awhile?"" and I then called him. Crying hysterically. I asked him if he was on a lease and he said he pays month to month. He said he was not on a lease. So clearly he was avoiding me. I told him my mom was driving up to be with me and he got mad because we were supposed to talk later. I then told him I packed up the rest of his things and it was outside my door. I said I was breaking up with him because he called me babe (clearly, he blew me out, but was being delusional calling me babe), he nonchalantly said ""okay, fine"". Only then he came speeding over to get his things. While speeding over he said ""I never wanted this. I never wanted to break up. I don't know what's wrong with me."" I told him I was breaking up with him not because I don't love him, that I love him with all my heart, but the way he was treating me was making me unravel and I need to be able to go to school, intern and work. He picked up his things and tried to get me to let him in but I didn't. He then asked for a poster of my favorite band, Swans (which I put $90 to framing, saying he'd pay me back, he never did). He never paid rent. He claimed for the first week of March he was living out of his car. He never offered to pay for the bed payments (I still have +$700 payments left). Later he texted me that he is ""destroyed and sorry"".


For those next 10 days there was no contact. My mom stayed with me. I dropped 20+ pounds. I went to a psychiatrist to get put on SSRIs, I also started seeing a trauma therapist. If it wasn't for my family and friends I'd probably be out of school, out of a job, and maybe not here at all. I've never had a broken heart, and I pictured my future with this man, and never thought it was possible for him to mistreat me because we had such a good relationship. It was literally an instant complete 180 with no warnings. I tried to get him to get help, he has no insurance but our University has FREE mental health help. He said ""I can't. I am unable to be helped, it doesn't work for me"". Apparently he went to a doctor in his past and was put on anti psychotics for general anxiety and depression, but claimed it didn't work. I told him the dose was probably too low and he probably didn't have a therapist he could connect with, that it could work. He wouldn't try.


I found his mother's phone number and decided to call. She didn't even know my name. She said he lied to her that he was living with a man for that entire year. When I told her of his erratic behavior she was not even concerned. She said ""Oh I'll tell him to call you"". She was so stupidly unaware of anything going on in his life with little concern. So I said ""I am not calling for that, I have accepted he's in my past. I am calling you to let you know he NEEDS YOU"". She said she appreciated me calling, never heard from her again. She probably didn't even tell his father for all I know. My ex told me he has fucked over his family plenty, so maybe they wiped their hands clean. I'll never know.
Two weekends ago he texted me that he was ""hurting too badly, needed to talk to me and see me"" I told him only if he could be open and honest and start acting like an adult and not a child. He said he would ""man up"". The next day I was about to go shopping with my mom and he texted me ""don't want you anymore, I am not crawling back, lose my number"". I started crying again. I didn't respond. Then he said ""I crossed some boundaries and logged into your facebook (the PW was the same as the WIFI PW, but I never thought he'd invade my privacy) and now know how you truly feel about me"". I was talking to a new male friend, who was experiencing heart break as well. He became a part of my support group. It was nice to vent and feel understood. He is just a friend. My ex then says ""He seems cool, why don't you go fuck him."" I was shocked, he never talked to me like this. I told my friend he was reading our convo and was changing my PW. Friend didn't care, understood. Ex called me ""heartless"". Ex and I texted for hours back and forth. He said he was ""crying in my room all day. I am destroyed. I can't talk right now"". I told him to just hold the phone to his ear after 2 hrs+ of texting back and forth. Finally he picked up. He said ""I would never speak ill of you"" (I said to friends that he up and left me, hacked into my facebook, was going through a midlife crisis, and acting like a douche bag) I told him ""I would have never left you"". He said ""I cannot believe you're getting consolation from another man"". He told me to move on. I told him if he didn't want to be spoken of in an ill manner, he should have behaved better, and that I am single and am free to say and do what I want. He started crying saying he had to go and so I asked him what was going on and he said ""I still love you"". For the next few hours I was a mess and we were texting back and forth. I told him we had to fix things now or else resentments would be too strong, that I couldn't go back and forth anymore.


Then my parents threatened to kick me out of their lives if I went back to him after what he did to me. They later admitted it was an empty threat, but they were emotional seeing me hurt so much. My ex kept saying he couldn't talk now and he needed time. I told him there is no more time, we have to fix it now, I'm trying to pull you out of the dark cave but you're not coming into the light and I can't stay in the dark cave anymore because it is sucking the life out of me. He said he was pedicabbing and that he would call me later. When I asked what time he said he didn't know and that it was busy. I told him he was making me feel like an obligation. I told him I don't know if he's coming or going, what is happening, that there is no security with him and he needs to act like an adult. He replied with ""fine, I'll make an adult decision. We are over. This is official. I don't want either of us to be in limbo anymore. You are free to fuck and date whomever you like. This fucking sucks but I guess this is how it has to be. Good bye, I'll miss you"". I didn't respond. A few hours later he texts me ""I am on break, you can call me if you want to still talk"". I didn't respond. He then says ""fine, I'll take this as the cut off point. Goodbye, I'll miss you"". I responded and said ""I wish you the best, it never had to be this way, you self sabotaged and made it this way. You blew me out. You created the abusive pattern by leaving me, hacking into my facebook, getting mad at what I was saying when I am single, by giving me bait such as ""I guess this is how it has to be"" and then saying ""you can call me if you want"". If I try to remedy the situation I am just continuing the abusive pattern. It never had to be this way."" He replied with ""If you see me downtown you're allowed to say hi"". I didn't respond. I found out from a mutual friend that he lives with a 65 year old pedicabber. He also owes the pedicab shop rent money (it is $105 each week in rent). He makes AT LEAST $1,100 a month. I asked him before we cut communication if he was on drugs and he swore he isn't and all his money goes to ""bullshit I guess"".


This past Friday I was on the outskirts downtown at a bar my friends DJ at. A fellow pedicabber offered to give me a free ride so I asked him if he knew my ex. He said he doesn't. So I said the owner of the shops name and he knew the guy and I asked if they do drugs. He said they snort and smoke marijuana. He asked for my ex's description. Apparently that night he snaked this guy out (this guy was about to get a ride then my ex rode in front of him and stole these customers from him). This pedicabber said if this happened in Washington D.C. he would get the shit beat out of him and that the Orlando pedicabbers are all careless crack heads. He said he would say something to my ex next time he messes with him for me on my behalf because he said what he did was not what someone who loves someone would do. Like my ex, this pedicabber is a drifter, and he said he would never do my ex did. he dropped me off.


I then went back to the bar and my best friend gave me mushrooms, alcohol and marijuana. I needed to leave my black hole and use drugs as a means of new realizations. I was surrounded by loving friends. But then I wanted to walk up the street with my bestfriend, while doing so, my ex rode by. There is no business to be made where I was, so he was creeping on me. Naturally, I felt immense amounts of anger, not because he came out to where I was, but because he looked AWFUL. He looked homeless. His beard was grown out. He was skinny. His hair was long. My best friend didn't recognize him and said he looked like scum. I flipped him off and said ""fuck you"". He turned around and said ""real mature"" and I yelled back ""real mature? Real mature leaving me high and dry, sticking me with the bills, dropping out of school, you fail at life!"". He texted me later saying ""I'm sure you feel really great about that, you FINALLY got to tell off the loser who broke your heart with a ""fuck you"" have a good night. I ignored it. However today I sent him this text message... I told him ""you coming over to where I am without initiating contact via phone, you looking so terrible (my friend and I didn't recognize you, you look homeless), I was on a heavy dose of mushrooms, so when you came out of no where my anger took over. I am so angry that you ruined what we had and I am more angry at you for ruining your life when you have so much potential. I'm just really disappointed in you and what we could have been and seeing you self-destruct. Please do not antagonize me anymore. If you want help, support, or a friend I am here, but I can't see you willingly fuck your life up. Please get help"".


He responded with ""Actually, I caught a $40 ride over there earlier that night and if I looked so terrible, I'm sure women wouldn't have been hitting on me that night. Just wanted to clear that up."" So I said ""I'm sure the caliber of women is not great, but you don't look healthy, don't want to insult you"". He said ""Whatever makes you feel better. I was doing my job. I happened to see you. You said ""fuck you"". I told him ""wouldn't you have done the same if you I had done what you did to me, to you?"" and he said ""No, I wouldn't have. Not making excuses here, but I'm going through some shit, and you claimed you care and are concerned but when you act like that I know you're full of shit. Doesn't matter anymore. You should've left it at fuck you. I've always taken responsibility for fucking up I didn't blame this on you"".
My last words to him are the following: ""Lastly, you take my words for truth. But people say things they don't mean when they are deeply hurt. Speaking ill of you to my support group (whatever makes me feel better, right?) if you don't want to be spoken poorly of, act like a decent human being with integrity and a heart. Take a look at your actions. You up and left me with no warning after playing the role of my significant other (you made me believe I had your back and you had mine) my world came crashing down the way you handled your freak out (so selfish and hurtful, very sociopath like behavior BTW), you then play with my heart and hack into my facebook, use it against me when I was hurt, weak and vulnerable from your heartless actions (and stressed the fuck out because my world was turned upside down since you changed like a flip of a switch, nearly ruined my own reputation at work/internship/school) and while I was in emotional distress you kept slapping me around emotionally abusing me, giving hope, taking it away, coming and going as you please. My fuck you, speaking ill of you, is because I am a deeply hurt human being who was toyed with, abused and discarded like a piece of shit. Then you accuse me for being full of shit for saying fuck you. Those are words from the hurt/scars you have created for me. What I did was what I had to do, not the right thing to do, to get it off my chest. But look at my actions. I've been here, trying to fix things, taking your bullshit/abuse because I refuse to accept that this is you. I refuse to imagine you pretended this entire time and this is your true skin. But you're not taking a deep look at yourself and taking responsibility and changing for the better. You're stuck wallowing and blaming other people for for your careless decisions and are unable to deal with the consequences of your decisions and also unable to follow through, because you're not thinking about anyone else but yourself and your feelings. But you made it this way. I only wanted love and happiness and I gave it without hesitation, fear or doubt. Maybe you cheated on me. Maybe you did drugs. Maybe you have a baby. Maybe someone died. Maybe you killed someone. I don't know what to think and how you could do a complete 180 without hesitation, quit on me, quit on us, quit on yourself, and hurt me so deeply. You never loved me if this is how things end. Maybe you loved me with all you could love, maybe you just don't know what love is because you never had it until me. But you had it with me. You had all of me. But I had none of you. Ever""
He isn't responding.


I don't know how to move on from here. I am still overly analyzing where things and how things went wrong. Is there anyone who could provide observations? I need clarification. I am so lost and confused in my hurt.


My dad told me if he thought he was sincere about me, he would have paid the entire rent. Told my ex not to worry and to just do good in University. He said if he wanted help he would help him. But he doesn't want help. He compared my ex to a stray dog. Some stray dogs want help and are rehomed and great family additions. But some won't trust ever again and run away when trying to be helped. He told me there is no hope, that he will only drag me down, and do it again. My ex won't hear me out. Doesn't take any accountability. Is there anything I can say or do to make him see the light? Am I doing something wrong? How do I move on? How do I stop analyzing? I have plenty of friends and family who love me. I have a great life going for me. I'll be okay. But I just can't grasp how things have fallen apart, been abandoned by ""the love of my life"", and how he could treat me so terribly. I am so broken. I want to be strong. I want to push through this. But I need advice/validation that I am not the one who ruined this. and maybe there is something else that can be said/done to fix things? I can't stand that my primary relationship is gone, unable to be fixed for even friendship. That he sees me as the one who gave up/ruined things, the nemesis. How can someone not see what they've done? Maybe I am naive. Maybe I am too hurt. Please help me gain perspective, Reddit.


Tl;DR: Ex [28M] and I [24F] lived together for 15 months, said he was in for long haul, wanted to be with me for life. Was living with brother (who I don't know really existed) getting clean for 1 1/2 years after being a professional musician/drug addict in Nashville, Got two jobs (walgreens full time, peddicabbing). Got into University to do pre law. Withdrew from 2 of 3 classes because his wages at Walgreens got garnished so he pedicabbed more and got burnt out. Felt like a failure/turned depressed/distant. Bought a bed with me, nested apartment. Met my family. He up and left me without warning saying the apartment felt like ""a coffin"", erratic behavior, might be on drugs or experiencing a mental break down, comes and goes in my life as he wants but finds reasons that I am wrong (hacking into my FB reading my messages between my support group, blaming me for speaking ill of him when I only spoke of his ill behavior, claiming I don't give a shit about him), tries to get me jealous now, always has to have last hurtful word, takes no accountability for his heartless actions). I don't know what to do or how to feel. Need perspective..."

Here’s the thing : I’m a med student in France and I’ve been wearing a hijab for a few years now (my choice, of course). I did my first internship at a hospital earlier this year and I had to take my hijab off every day for a month (It’s the law. No religious signs are allowed) . It didn’t bother me that much, to be honest, it was my very first experience in the medical world and I had no time to think about the non-veiled situation. Now here’s where it gets more uncomfortable, we had classes in the teaching hospital and it was really weird and uncomfortable being there with people who see me every day during regular classes with a hijab on. 
For the next ten years I will spend more time without my hijab than with it and it is quite confusing because it is a part of me that I have to leave behind before starting my shift. I knew what I was getting into from the start but it’s harder than I thought it would be. I’m really scared that once I start working as an intern and spend 24hours at the hospital, I’ll be like “I’ll just drive home without the hijab, no need to put it for 30 minutes in the car, nobody’s going to see me anyway” and so on until I abandon it.  

Any advice would be very, very much appreciated. 
Jazakum Allah Khairan.

And sorry for any mistake in this post, English is not my first language.

-Describe your motivation for pursuing an internship opportunity in Cape Town.

-What are your long-term professional goals?

-Describe your ideal internship?

-When is your ideal internship starting date (month/year)?

1ccn7i,1,2013-04-14,The man [28M] who broke my heart [24F]... Please help.,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ccn7i/the_man_28m_who_broke_my_heart_24f_please_help/,"Our background:


I met this man on OKcupid ~20 months ago. We met up after a few months worth of messages at a local bar. We had a meaningful conversation pertaining to our political ideologies, our pasts, and future goals. It was a effortless/natural connection and the attraction was so intense that we left ~2 hours to make out in the parking lot where he eventually followed me home. We had sex. I am very picky when it comes to looks and he was my ideal partner physically and mentally. He dressed with style, had long hair, wonderful music taste, and a fantastic sense of humor. I was infatuated. He felt the same way about me. The next day he came back over and stayed for the night. For the next 3 months we saw each other every weekend. I then went on a trip with Habitat for Humanity, and he gave me a care package to take (alcohol, baked goods, with a card). We skyped every night. I sent him a card in the mail since he was in another state with his family. The card expressed my deep feelings for him/wanting to be in a relationship with him. He said he is normally terrified of such things, but wanted to be with me in the most natural way possible.
We dated for three months when I told him I could no longer take him seriously for the long haul since he had no job or education. To pay for things he sold all of his valuables on craigslist. I was at the time applying to graduate schools and working full time advising students at a University. Over these three months I found out the following...


His background:
He used to be a professional musician in Nashville. He was also a drug addict (did every street drug except for heroin and meth). Drugs took him down and it affected him so badly that he quit his career as a professional musician. He moved out of state to where I am, to live with his brother (who is 20+ years older than him) to ""escape drugs"". He quit cold turkey. However his brother's fiance wanted him out after he lived with them for over a year and a half. During this time he said he was ""getting clean"". When I told him I couldn't take him seriously he immediately got a full time job with Walgreens. He cut off his hair for the job. He bought a nice wardrobe. He also enrolled on his own in a local community college to complete his associates degree (only 2 classes short, and had a 3.0 GPA which is great at 54 credits).
When I saw his self improvement, we made the decision together for him to move into my studio apartment (550 square feet). We had a very functional and healthy relationship, we were great at communicating. We had plenty of passionate sex. We had so much fun together. It was my first romance. He met my entire family. My family adored him. They became his number 1 fans. HIS family is not present in his life at all. He also has absolutely no friends he stays in contact with on a regular basis. His parents... I only saw him speak to them maybe twice through out the relationship. His parents never helped him financially or emotionally. His mother sent him shitty care packages now and then, but it was obvious he only had me, my friends, my family for emotional support. It was not unhealthy, though. We made an awesome team, emotionally and financially. I have never been so close with a person. He has never been so close with a person. I found out he has had 2 girlfriends in his past. One was for 3 years but she cheated on him, so they broke up (he thought he was going to marry her). The other girlfriend was crazy and his junkie partner, she didn't matter to him in the end. I was the first healthy caring person he has had in his life, basically. To be clear: he has not had support from friends, family, or significant others.


When he completed his Associates at community college and transferred to the University I work at and now go to school at (I am in a masters program/still advising students). He also started pedicabbing downtown on weekends for extra money because his wages got GARNISHED. He told me his manager at walgreens told him for the next 18 months 25% of his wages would be collected from his paychecks. He said it was because he dipped on a lease in Nashville and they found him in Florida 5 years later... Then his car started to fall apart because . He had to get it fixed constantly for a few months and ended up spending ~$3,000. Pedicabbing is odd hours on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. From 8:00 PM - 3:00 AM.
He took 3 pre law classes. I never pressured him, it was his own choice to go back to school to become a lawyer. I was in my second semester of graduate school, working and interning. We hardly saw each other because through out the week I was busy, however I have weekends free. He went to night classes Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays. Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays he was pedicabbing until 4:00 AM WHILE working full time at Walgreens during the day.
Through out all of this going on he made it clear he was a long term partner. We talked about marriage, we talked about children, he bought my family holiday presents, we nested our apartment, bought a bed together (which I had to sign on the monthly payments of 17 months at $46 dollars per month, since he has bad credit). But he made it clear and played the role of being my life time partner. He made me feel like he had my back and I had his, always.


The last few months:
On Valentines day he spent $150 on flowers and we had amazing sex. However, after that day a switch went off. He got burnt out from working 2 jobs and getting absolutely no time to eat, sleep or study. When midterms came around he had no idea what to do. He freaked out. These midterms were take home midterms, he had time to read and complete these tests for quite some time. He waited until the day they were due. He gave himself no chance at succeeding. So, he did the smart thing and withdrew from 2 of his 3 classes.
But then he spiraled into depression. He stopped taking care of himself and his appearance. I tried to be there for him and support him through it but it seemed to make him feel worse. I tried to explain my support comes from love not from a place of ""you're not good enough"". We never kissed. We never had sex for that last month. We hardly saw each other, he worked all of the time. I thought it was a money issue, not a relationship issue.


Spring break came around and for that week my bird was having surgery (whom I have had since I was 5). I was 2 1/2 hours away but before I left I bought ~$80 of easy to eat groceries so that he would at least be taken care of in his depression. The day of my bird's surgery he said he ""needed space"". I told him I needed to talk and that he needs to compromise. He said ""sorry, then"". He has never been short with me so I was in great distress. For a week we didn't talk. My parents saw me unraveling and found out what was happening. Immediately they pressured me to find out what is going on. That night, one week later, the day before coming back home, my family had a crisis. It was emotionally devastating. I thought life is stressful enough and that I needed him for support, not extra stress because at this point I was unraveling.


That phone call he said ""maybe we moved too fast. I feel too much pressure"". I was shocked. He said he thinks he should move out. He said he doesn't know what is wrong with him, but that he doesn't deserve me and is fucked up. He said he had to go (pedicabbing) and was crying. He said we would talk the next day when I drove back because he was off of work. I agreed.


I left him a voicemail that day saying what time I'd arrive. When I came home the apartment was empty. He had moved out. I walked in without him there, when he said he would be there. It was traumatizing. I called him and he said ""I moved out, with a pedicabber, arranged it last night and moved in this morning, I have to sign things so I'll talk to you later"". A few hours go by and I asked him if he was coming over to talk and he said ""It will be awhile, will you be there awhile?"" and I then called him. Crying hysterically. I asked him if he was on a lease and he said he pays month to month. He said he was not on a lease. So clearly he was avoiding me. I told him my mom was driving up to be with me and he got mad because we were supposed to talk later. I then told him I packed up the rest of his things and it was outside my door. I said I was breaking up with him because he called me babe (clearly, he blew me out, but was being delusional calling me babe), he nonchalantly said ""okay, fine"". Only then he came speeding over to get his things. While speeding over he said ""I never wanted this. I never wanted to break up. I don't know what's wrong with me."" I told him I was breaking up with him not because I don't love him, that I love him with all my heart, but the way he was treating me was making me unravel and I need to be able to go to school, intern and work. He picked up his things and tried to get me to let him in but I didn't. He then asked for a poster of my favorite band, Swans (which I put $90 to framing, saying he'd pay me back, he never did). He never paid rent. He claimed for the first week of March he was living out of his car. He never offered to pay for the bed payments (I still have +$700 payments left). Later he texted me that he is ""destroyed and sorry"".


For those next 10 days there was no contact. My mom stayed with me. I dropped 20+ pounds. I went to a psychiatrist to get put on SSRIs, I also started seeing a trauma therapist. If it wasn't for my family and friends I'd probably be out of school, out of a job, and maybe not here at all. I've never had a broken heart, and I pictured my future with this man, and never thought it was possible for him to mistreat me because we had such a good relationship. It was literally an instant complete 180 with no warnings. I tried to get him to get help, he has no insurance but our University has FREE mental health help. He said ""I can't. I am unable to be helped, it doesn't work for me"". Apparently he went to a doctor in his past and was put on anti psychotics for general anxiety and depression, but claimed it didn't work. I told him the dose was probably too low and he probably didn't have a therapist he could connect with, that it could work. He wouldn't try.


I found his mother's phone number and decided to call. She didn't even know my name. She said he lied to her that he was living with a man for that entire year. When I told her of his erratic behavior she was not even concerned. She said ""Oh I'll tell him to call you"". She was so stupidly unaware of anything going on in his life with little concern. So I said ""I am not calling for that, I have accepted he's in my past. I am calling you to let you know he NEEDS YOU"". She said she appreciated me calling, never heard from her again. She probably didn't even tell his father for all I know. My ex told me he has fucked over his family plenty, so maybe they wiped their hands clean. I'll never know.


Two weekends ago he texted me that he was ""hurting too badly, needed to talk to me and see me"" I told him only if he could be open and honest and start acting like an adult and not a child. He said he would ""man up"". The next day I was about to go shopping with my mom and he texted me ""don't want you anymore, I am not crawling back, lose my number"". I started crying again. I didn't respond. Then he said ""I crossed some boundaries and logged into your facebook (the PW was the same as the WIFI PW, but I never thought he'd invade my privacy) and now know how you truly feel about me"". I was talking to a new male friend, who was experiencing heart break as well. He became a part of my support group. It was nice to vent and feel understood. He is just a friend. My ex then says ""He seems cool, why don't you go fuck him."" I was shocked, he never talked to me like this. I told my friend he was reading our convo and was changing my PW. Friend didn't care, understood. Ex called me ""heartless"". Ex and I texted for hours back and forth. He said he was ""crying in my room all day. I am destroyed. I can't talk right now"". I told him to just hold the phone to his ear after 2 hrs+ of texting back and forth. Finally he picked up. He said ""I would never speak ill of you"" (I said to friends that he up and left me, hacked into my facebook, was going through a midlife crisis, and acting like a douche bag) I told him ""I would have never left you"". He said ""I cannot believe you're getting consolation from another man"". He told me to move on. I told him if he didn't want to be spoken of in an ill manner, he should have behaved better, and that I am single and am free to say and do what I want. He started crying saying he had to go and so I asked him what was going on and he said ""I still love you"".
For the next few hours I was a mess and we were texting back and forth. I told him we had to fix things now or else resentments would be too strong, that I couldn't go back and forth anymore. 

Then my parents threatened to kick me out of their lives if I went back to him after what he did to me. They later admitted it was an empty threat, but they were emotional seeing me hurt so much. My ex kept saying he couldn't talk now and he needed time. I told him there is no more time, we have to fix it now, I'm trying to pull you out of the dark cave but you're not coming into the light and I can't stay in the dark cave anymore because it is sucking the life out of me. He said he was pedicabbing and that he would call me later. When I asked what time he said he didn't know and that it was busy. I told him he was making me feel like an obligation. I told him I don't know if he's coming or going, what is happening, that there is no security with him and he needs to act like an adult. He replied with ""fine, I'll make an adult decision. We are over. This is official. I don't want either of us to be in limbo anymore. You are free to fuck and date whomever you like. This fucking sucks but I guess this is how it has to be. Good bye, I'll miss you"". I didn't respond. A few hours later he texts me ""I am on break, you can call me if you want to still talk"". I didn't respond. He then says ""fine, I'll take this as the cut off point. Goodbye, I'll miss you"". I responded and said ""I wish you the best, it never had to be this way, you self sabotaged and made it this way. You blew me out. You created the abusive pattern by leaving me, hacking into my facebook, getting mad at what I was saying when I am single, by giving me bait such as ""I guess this is how it has to be"" and then saying ""you can call me if you want"". If I try to remedy the situation I am just continuing the abusive pattern. It never had to be this way."" He replied with ""If you see me downtown you're allowed to say hi"". I didn't respond.
I found out from a mutual friend that he lives with a 65 year old pedicabber. He also owes the pedicab shop rent money (it is $105 each week in rent). He makes AT LEAST $1,100 a month. I asked him before we cut communication if he was on drugs and he swore he isn't and all his money goes to ""bullshit I guess"".


This past Friday I was on the outskirts downtown at a bar my friends DJ at. A fellow pedicabber offered to give me a free ride so I asked him if he knew my ex. He said he doesn't. So I said the owner of the shops name and he knew the guy and I asked if they do drugs. He said they snort and smoke marijuana. He asked for my ex's description. Apparently that night he snaked this guy out (this guy was about to get a ride then my ex rode in front of him and stole these customers from him). This pedicabber said if this happened in Washington D.C. he would get the shit beat out of him and that the Orlando pedicabbers are all careless crack heads. He said he would say something to my ex next time he messes with him for me on my behalf because he said what he did was not what someone who loves someone would do. Like my ex, this pedicabber is a drifter, and he said he would never do my ex did. he dropped me off.


I then went back to the bar and my best friend gave me mushrooms, alcohol and marijuana. I needed to leave my black hole and use drugs as a means of new realizations. I was surrounded by loving friends. But then I wanted to walk up the street with my bestfriend, while doing so, my ex rode by. There is no business to be made where I was, so he was creeping on me. Naturally, I felt immense amounts of anger, not because he came out to where I was, but because he looked AWFUL. He looked homeless. His beard was grown out. He was skinny. His hair was long. My best friend didn't recognize him and said he looked like scum. I flipped him off and said ""fuck you"". He turned around and said ""real mature"" and I yelled back ""real mature? Real mature leaving me high and dry, sticking me with the bills, dropping out of school, you fail at life!"". He texted me later saying ""I'm sure you feel really great about that, you FINALLY got to tell off the loser who broke your heart with a ""fuck you"" have a good night. I ignored it.
However today I sent him this text message... I told him ""you coming over to where I am without initiating contact via phone, you looking so terrible (my friend and I didn't recognize you, you look homeless), I was on a heavy dose of mushrooms, so when you came out of no where my anger took over. I am so angry that you ruined what we had and I am more angry at you for ruining your life when you have so much potential. I'm just really disappointed in you and what we could have been and seeing you self-destruct. Please do not antagonize me anymore. If you want help, support, or a friend I am here, but I can't see you willingly fuck your life up. Please get help"".


He responded with ""Actually, I caught a $40 ride over there earlier that night and if I looked so terrible, I'm sure women wouldn't have been hitting on me that night. Just wanted to clear that up."" So I said ""I'm sure the caliber of women is not great, but you don't look healthy, don't want to insult you"". He said ""Whatever makes you feel better. I was doing my job. I happened to see you. You said ""fuck you"". I told him ""wouldn't you have done the same if you I had done what you did to me, to you?"" and he said ""No, I wouldn't have. Not making excuses here, but I'm going through some shit, and you claimed you care and are concerned but when you act like that I know you're full of shit. Doesn't matter anymore. You should've left it at fuck you. I've always taken responsibility for fucking up I didn't blame this on you"".


My last words to him are the following: ""Lastly, you take my words for truth. But people say things they don't mean when they are deeply hurt. Speaking ill of you to my support group (whatever makes me feel better, right?) if you don't want to be spoken poorly of, act like a decent human being with integrity and a heart. Take a look at your actions. You up and left me with no warning after playing the role of my significant other (you made me believe I had your back and you had mine) my world came crashing down the way you handled your freak out (so selfish and hurtful, very sociopath like behavior BTW), you then play with my heart and hack into my facebook, use it against me when I was hurt, weak and vulnerable from your heartless actions (and stressed the fuck out because my world was turned upside down since you changed like a flip of a switch, nearly ruined my own reputation at work/internship/school) and while I was in emotional distress you kept slapping me around emotionally abusing me, giving hope, taking it away, coming and going as you please. My fuck you, speaking ill of you, is because I am a deeply hurt human being who was toyed with, abused and discarded like a piece of shit. Then you accuse me for being full of shit for saying fuck you. Those are words from the hurt/scars you have created for me. What I did was what I had to do, not the right thing to do, to get it off my chest. But look at my actions. I've been here, trying to fix things, taking your bullshit/abuse because I refuse to accept that this is you. I refuse to imagine you pretended this entire time and this is your true skin. But you're not taking a deep look at yourself and taking responsibility and changing for the better. You're stuck wallowing and blaming other people for for your careless decisions and are unable to deal with the consequences of your decisions and also unable to follow through, because you're not thinking about anyone else but yourself and your feelings. But you made it this way. I only wanted love and happiness and I gave it without hesitation, fear or doubt. Maybe you cheated on me. Maybe you did drugs. Maybe you have a baby. Maybe someone died. Maybe you killed someone. I don't know what to think and how you could do a complete 180 without hesitation, quit on me, quit on us, quit on yourself, and hurt me so deeply. You never loved me if this is how things end. Maybe you loved me with all you could love, maybe you just don't know what love is because you never had it until me. But you had it with me. You had all of me. But I had none of you. Ever""


He isn't responding.


I don't know how to move on from here. I am still overly analyzing where things and how things went wrong. Is there anyone who could provide observations? I need clarification. I am so lost and confused in my hurt.


My dad told me if he thought he was sincere about me, he would have paid the entire rent. Told my ex not to worry and to just do good in University. He said if he wanted help he would help him. But he doesn't want help. He compared my ex to a stray dog. Some stray dogs want help and are rehomed and great family additions. But some won't trust ever again and run away when trying to be helped. He told me there is no hope, that he will only drag me down, and do it again.
My ex won't hear me out. Doesn't take any accountability. Is there anything I can say or do to make him see the light? Am I doing something wrong? How do I move on? How do I stop analyzing? I have plenty of friends and family who love me. I have a great life going for me. I'll be okay. But I just can't grasp how things have fallen apart, been abandoned by ""the love of my life"", and how he could treat me so terribly. I am so broken. I want to be strong. I want to push through this. But I need advice/validation that I am not the one who ruined this. and maybe there is something else that can be said/done to fix things? I can't stand that my primary relationship is gone, unable to be fixed for even friendship. That he sees me as the one who gave up/ruined things, the nemesis. How can someone not see what they've done? Maybe I am naive. Maybe I am too hurt. Please help me gain perspective, Reddit.


Tl;DR: Ex [28M] and I [24F] lived together for 15 months, said he was in for long haul, wanted to be with me for life. Was living with brother (who I don't know really existed) getting clean for 1 1/2 years after being a professional musician/drug addict in Nashville, Got two jobs (walgreens full time, peddicabbing). Got into University to do pre law. Withdrew from 2 of 3 classes because his wages at Walgreens got garnished so he pedicabbed more and got burnt out. Felt like a failure/turned depressed/distant. Bought a bed with me, nested apartment. Met my family. He up and left me without warning saying the apartment felt like ""a coffin"", erratic behavior, might be on drugs or experiencing a mental break down, comes and goes in my life as he wants but finds reasons that I am wrong (hacking into my FB reading my messages between my support group, blaming me for speaking ill of him when I only spoke of his ill behavior, claiming I don't give a shit about him), tries to get me jealous now, always has to have last hurtful word, takes no accountability for his heartless actions). I don't know what to do or how to feel. Need perspective. Please read my post and give me your best comment."

1ccl9t,2,2013-04-14,What are your recommendations for reaching 150 Hours for CPA,notrllysure,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1ccl9t/what_are_your_recommendations_for_reaching_150/,"I'm currently finishing up my second year of undergrad and pursuing my BS in Accounting. How it stands right now I have several options and am trying to get some advice on which way to go about it. Currently I have one internship with a small unknown company and should have another one next summer after my third year.

These are just some of the many ways I could go:

Option 1: I can graduate a semester early with a major in Accounting  while having not much of a workload to keep GPA high. Then I can get a Masters in Accounting to finish up the hours as well as use that to help prepare myself for CPA.

Option 2: Same as above, but increase the workload a bit, but graduate the same time (a semester early) with an economics minor and then go into Masters. The downside is might hurt GPA a bit, but would have a minor, but I don't know how beneficial that would be.

Option 3: I am also interested in possibly getting an MBA. Similar to option 1/2, but switch out Masters in Accounting for MBA. Although I may need work experience before going directly into it. 

Option 4: Graduate in four years with a Major in Accounting and a Minor in Finance. The benefit is I can work it out so that I have completed 150 credits overall so that I can sit for CPA, or I'll be damn close. I might have to take one or two classes afterwards.

Essentially what I'm wondering is how beneficial would it be to have minors in either Econ or Finance? Is it better to go straight into trying for CPA right after undergrad or get work experience? Is a masters in Accounting worth it or better to get hours done in undergrad?

Thinking it in my head I had a lot more scenario's than while typing it out and it sorta helped me get a better view myself. Either way I have only recently really committed with Accounting and don't have too much background on what I should do, so whatever advice you can help out with would be great. "

I had the rope ready. I was going to the party to see my friends for what was going to be the last time. I started talking to you. Meeting you convinced me to hold on for just a while longer. I can still remember the shine of the green glitter on your cheeks on St. Patrick's Day. Over time I got to know you. Over time I grew to love you. You kissed me first. You told me you love me first. You accepted me despite my mental health problems. You didn't mind that I had to drop out of college because of my health. You believed in a future.

You moved back home after college. I paid for flights every month to visit you despite being barely able to afford it. I learned yours and your parents language. I eventually moved away from my country, culture family and friends for long period of time for you because I knew to be with you I had to.

You became someone else. You changed from the down-to-earth, easy-going, effortlessly beautiful, electric woman that gave me hope. You made me feel like everything that came out of my mouth offended you in some way. When you were down, I listened with an open mind from a non-judgemental perspective. When I was down, you made me feel inadequate and guilty for thinking or feeling that way. I regret not saying that that's how you made me feel. You constantly judged me and my values. You could have been a racist criminal and I wouldn't have cared, I still worshipped the ground you walked on. You always worried what was  could go wrong as opposed to what was right, what could have gone bad instead of what was good. Every time you did that it broke me down just a little bit more than the last time. You scared the shit out of me.

I went home to my family for Christmas. You suggested that I bring my second suitcase that I used to store the clothes I kept in France. On skype you were distant. You never had time to talk. You made plans to move to another city. You dropped hints. And I noticed them. I confronted you. You said you just didn't like seeing me on skype because she wanted to be with me in person. I went back over to France. I thought everything would be alright and you said it would be.

You kissed with open eyes. I could feel you recoil every time I touched you. You started sleeping with your back to me. But you introduced me to your extended family. We went to your friend's party. You never said a word to me the whole night. I confronted you. You said we were becoming different people. You were the one who originally said you wanted a future and I obliged. You said you weren't sure about your relationship now and didn't want to make sacrifices, despite how much I had to sacrifice. I said there was hope. I saw hope. You refused to see it. I didn't get a wink of sleep.

You officially broke up with me the next day. I had to stand your presence, you touching me, you asking me if I was okay you acting as if everything was alright for 3 days until I could get a flight back home. You drove me to the airport. You made small talk. You said you'd ""miss me"". You kissed me on the lips. Just so you know, that was the worst thing you could have done to me. You shouldn't have touched me. You should have just left me alone, but no.

You e-mailed me 3 weeks after with your ""How are you?"" and told me about how you got that internship you wanted. You said about how you knew I'd need space yet you fucking email me with a newsflash. You just wanted to ease your fucking conscience, you didn't really care how I was doing. I hate your guts but I love you too, and I can't tell you how much I hate you. You quit when the going got tough, despite relationships facing many other challenges. You can't act as if everything is alright, but you know it's lie.

I constantly think about what I did wrong. I constantly beat myself up about every single aspect of my being. I was getting better and now I'm back crawling through piss and shit, because you threw away the future that YOU wanted with ME, just because it wasn't as ideal or easy as you thought it would be.

Despite what has happened, I still can't stop thinking about you. I still love you, and I hate myself for being so weak in that regard. I hate that I wasn't worth it, that I just wasn't fucking good enough for you. I FLEW OVER TO YOU JUST FOR YOU TO FUCKING BREAK UP WITH ME!!

 I just want to forget about you, but it's so fucking difficult. I can't trust anyone now, and I don't think I will for a long, long time.

So my years of existence have finally boiled down to this - time to pick a college. I have been admitted to several fine institutions in the United States but I have narrowed my choices down to two: Duke University Pratt School of Engineering and New York University Stern School of Business. I am probably going to pursue a career in finance after college.

I have talked to a lot of my friends, parents' friends, current students and employers and I am getting mixed feedback.

Why I should go to Duke Engineering: I have been told that Finance is an ""easy"" subject and I should learn something ""harder"" in my undergraduate years. A lot of my friends' parents who work on Wall Street have told me that most of their colleagues have degrees in Engineering, Math and Physics, not Finance. The analytical skills developed in Engineering is really important for financial jobs. If i'm really into finance/business, I should just study an MBA later on. Also Duke's alumni program is phenomonal.

Why i should go to NYU Stern: Location location location. It's in the city and, from what I've heard, internships are easy peasy to get. People have told me that I know I'm not going into an Engineering career, so i shouldn't waste my time studying it. Dive right into the Financial district. Also, NYU Stern has a great staff for teaching business.

I am very much into Starcraft and also passionate about  scientific research. It is finally time for me to combine those two into one project. In my academic life I am studying in the M.Sc. program Neuro-cognitive Psychology at the LMU Munich (Germany). Recently, I finished an internship about economical decision-making and I was thinking that this field may also be a great opportunity to design a project around Starcraft. Video games are rarely (if ever) used in psychological research (Skillcraft with its expertise research being the exception). However, they have clear advantages. Especially in Starcraft, you can pretty easily get access to tons of data through replays without necessarily having to conduct expensive classical experiments. My personal goals are to make a first step in showing the scientific world of how valuable researching computer games is for various fields and to get an article published in a peer-reviewed journal in about one year.

I am now planning to put together a team of about five people. Fellow scientists who are also passionate about Starcraft and are able to dedicate some time to this side-project, please message me! **I am explicitly looking for anyone in any field as long as you personally think that you can contribute to the success of the project.** For example, an expert in game theory would be great to discuss what should even be treated as an decision within a game. I could also imagine someone from the field computer science to be a valuable member by developing a suitable means to extract the data from the replay files. Do you really want to contribute but do not know how? Just message me and I will happily discuss the possibilities with you.

Since I want to exert full collaboration from the start, any ideas are welcome! You think decision making is boring and have a cooler idea? I want to hear it! Even if you do not want to be on the actual team but have a great idea, please tell me!

What else would you like to know? Feel free to ask here or via direct message!

So, what would be a good way to spend my summer?  I'm planning to use my EMT license and volunteer with an ambu. corps, and apply to volunteer at a hospice. 

Also, I'm taking a gap year.  Or two.  So I'm not taking the MCAT this fall.  I just don't want to feel useless this summer, because in previous summers I've always had a fellowship to do research at my school.  I have half a mind to take a break with the premed activities this summer and just do something fun like train for a triathlon, take the lead of my church youth group again, go camping and get drunk a lot.  At the same time, I feel like my lack of an official internship this summer, as a soon to be senior, is really gonna hurt me."

1cc1ur,3,2013-04-14,How do I start a career in coaching American Football?,Moustachio3d,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1cc1ur/how_do_i_start_a_career_in_coaching_american/,"Ultimately I would like to end up at either the NCAA or NFL level, but I'm unsure of what my first step should be to get into the coaching field.

I graduated from college with a B.S. in psychology 10 years ago, and have worked mainly in retail and tech support ever since.  I have a small amount of coaching experience with Pop Warner and flag football from before I graduated, but I haven't had an actual paid position anywhere.  I essentially need to start from scratch.

I see three different paths to try: get certified to teach and start at the high school level, apply for internships at college and professional programs, or go back to school in a sports related major.  There are benefits and drawbacks to each path, and I can only choose one to start.

My main concern with starting at the high school level is being able to transition to a higher level once I've gained experience.  Do college coaches hire people from the high school ranks?  If so, how much experience is typical?

If I apply for internships, what kind of qualifications will be necessary?  How often do coaches bring in people with basically no experience to work on a staff?  How would I make myself stand out from the other people applying for similar positions?

If I go back to school, what should I major in?  AFAIK there aren't any classes to take for coaching.  Are there classes, volunteer credits, or extracurricular activites that could give me the opportunity to work with the football team and coaching staff?

Is there another avenue that I'm missing?  I would definitely be interested in learning about other options to get into the coaching field.

I'm tired of working jobs where the only thing I look forward to is going home everyday; I want to do something that makes me look forward to going into work.  I love football and have such a passion for it, but my passion alone won't be enough to get me my dream career.  Help me Reddit, you're my only hope!

TL;DR: I have no coaching experience, I want to know how to become a football coach.  Suggestions?

Thanks to everyone that took the time to read my long post!"

When I visit, she tries to take me out to eat at different places, and there's some pretty delicious restaurants! But we rarely do anything else.

It's my main reason NYC is out.), and a fun time for people my age: activities, night life, art scene, etc. 

I used to live near Atlanta, and that was OK. I would like to go farther (but not too too far, since I'd want my parents to be able to visit some.) and perhaps bigger. 


I'm looking at these cities so far, but I don't really know anything about them. If you're living in any of these, please let me know your opinion on them as far as diversity and liking living there in general!

I decided to join the IT field about 6 months ago with minimal experience (graduated college 2010 with business degree).  Did a 6 month internship at a school system, learned a decent amount and got the A+ cert.  After that ended I got a job at a tech services company with the knowledge that they were hiring me for my potential, not my experience or expertise but would learn quick and on the fly.  

First week was absolute hell and harder than anything I imagined.  I thought I knew a decent amount about computers, networking, and software troubleshooting....WRONG.  There is so much info coming at me from all directions and programs to learn that I've never heard of - basically caused a panic attack on day on my third day.  I am lucky that I was told to ask questions, but there's a decent amount of apprehension that I may be asking too often and looking incompetent.  

My boss spoke to me and mentioned that he saw that I was getting overwhelmed and told me that is the worst thing that can happen in a job like this and the moment that anxiety hits, its game over.  He added that what we are selling at our company is the confidence to solve any issue that comes our way.  That stuck with me well and it really changed my view for the better, but I realize that I do not know where to look (i know, google), but I really want to have the confidence and game plan to know how to attack a problem I am completely unfamiliar with.  

I guess my big question to the big IT/computer tech experts out there is what do you recommend to a new guy like myself with minimal knowledge to learn how to troubleshoot and problem solve like a pro and instill confidence with the client on the other line?  I really want to succeed at this, but at this point I am unsure where to point my efforts.  Thanks in advance!"

 After a month of no PMO, i just came back from a trip with my friends and i have to stress this fact to others who is going through this journey as well, IT WILL CHANGE YOU! To summarise the trip, i, who was a beta male or worse before this has become a fckn alpha male. This is why,
1. Whenever i speaks, everyone paid attention to me.
2. I crack jokes easier than breathing the air.
3. I noticed the alpha female in the group whom i was afraid of before started seeking for my attention. When i noticed that, i told myself, it works.
4. I bonded with my friends much more within these 3 days than 5 years in high school. They started to talk to me instead of me talking to them.

 That's all i could think for now. To cut things short, never, ever, ever give up in this journey because believe me, it will definitely improves your life. Cheers!

I will know exactly where I will be this summer tomorrow, but I will be somewhere different next summer and then my permanent position will probably will be somewhere different once again so I can get experience in all the different agriculture your great state has to offer! 

The problem is other than the airport in Detroit I have never been to Michigan. I am not a traditional student (29 years old), and before I went to college I was an event planner so I have done a fair bit of traveling but never Michigan related. I have lived in the mountains of VA for most of my life, but spent my early 20s in CA and Las Vegas, so I don't care about moving itself, but I am worried I know nothing about your state. 

I like outdoorsy stuff, especially hiking and flat water paddling, I am assuming MI will be good for this? Are people friendly compared to Southerners? What do people do during the winter, especially since I have never experienced more than 38 inches of snow a year? Am I going to go insane from Nov-April or are there awesome new activities I can try out? I have skiied like once, so should I plan on getting better at that? Do people snowtube, because I love snowtubing? 

My BF will be coming with me once I get a permanent position and I know Michigan has some economic woes, but is that pretty much state-wide? We will probably be in a rural area due to my job and his current job is manager of a shop that installs leather kits and electronics and sunroofs in cars for dealerships, so I am worried he won't be able to find a job. He has great mechanical aptitude and is a hard worker and a smart guy so I  hope he can turn his previous work history into something, even in a small town. 

Sorry for all the questions, I am just trying to figure out if I am doing the right thing. I want this job, it's my ideal career and I volunteered lots to get my foot into the door, so I am excited but nervous about the location. Thanks! "

One year onwards I’ve been in my first relationship and it taught me a lot about myself and the true meaning of what it meant to care for someone. When we did break-up I didn’t really feel anything and I was happy since I could pursue the millions of hot girls in Australia. It has taught me that the true things in life don’t necessarily last unless you put work into it. It showed me the life I was missing if I had kept playing video games and nothing else.


I plan to achieve during this year is truly find my passion in life which I plan to transfer to a lesser status university in order to pursue that dream rather stay in a prestigious university pursuing a degree I hate. I am going to keep busy by applying for internships so that my summer is not filled with nothing to do. I must decide if I want to take career path with the defence force(which has been a dream since high school) or just go through the private route. Since it takes sacrifice that I might not be able to make.



I don’t think I would have time for a relationship any time soon since with university and work,  most of my weekdays and sports on the weekend take up most my life. Currently, my schedule is hectic which I usually only work like one day a week and I’m going to have a set plan so that I know what I’m doing each and every day. But I would continue the approach and meeting new people which is an ongoing process which I plan become a natural. I think 1000 approaches are a considerable number which I plan to finish by the end of the year.



As well, I consider working out a big ‘must’ in my life and I should start going to the gym on the regular and take care of myself better health wise. These would include a decrease in intake from the ‘junk food’ area and more healthy options which is a pretty big ask but I can make it work. Hopefully I can have those abs of steel within a couple of months.  One of the ways is to try out a bunch of martial arts and improve on my sparring skills a bit.


Finally, fashion I consider an important part of how people perceive me and I think I found some stuff I really like which is a mix of Japanese and Korean clothes that I find better fit to my style. Although, it costs a lot of money to change a wardrobe I plan to do over time. Then I can look like a sexy Neal Caffrey .

So that’s it this is my goals for this year and I hope myself I do achieve it otherwise I’m facing my biggest fear heights by skydiving. But I’m going skydiving anyways

Goals
•	Find my career path
•	Have fun with all the sexy girls out there
•	Work out regularly
•	Dress like a boss
•	Make dah money 

I’m 18 and I plan to make the most of my life you should too

(languages, frameworks, etc)",solid_steel,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1cbotb/learning_broad_or_going_deep_languages_frameworks/,"I have been doing a web-developer internship for the past 3 months and it's been a really wild ride. I came in with pretty much a handful of Python experience and a tad of very basic Django stuff and I ended up on projects doing Ruby/Rails, PHP/CakePHP, JS/Angular/jQuery doing things from writing test cases to developing the front-end (lots of JS) to expanding existing functions or writing brand new ones in both Rails and Cake. A lot of learning, reading manuals, and fun.

What I want to ask is this: is it good that instead of focusing on a small subset of these technologies, I'm spreading myself out over all of them? I can't say that I know either PHP or Ruby, but I can say that I know enough of them to get a lot of things done in Rails or Cake - I think I get the basic flow of these languages, at least enough to build things with a reference manual at hand to check up on the standard library.

Which option is better career-wise? I was thinking of starting freelancing soon for some dev-client interaction experience, does knowing a single framework very well give you more traction vs. knowing a the basics of a bunch of technologies?"

It may sound stupid, but this is the first 'interview' I've had and I don't even own a suit yet, but I'm wondering what those who are more seasoned in the professional world think of this.

Should I wear a suit? If not, what sort of outfits should I go for for the 'smart casual' look? I place a lot of importance in how a person looks, and would like to have something slightly unique about my appearance, but obviously nothing too striking.

So it's not surprise my job prospects are zero in world where you need a bachelors degree to work at a fucking McDonalds. 

But that is not the worst of it. I will be the first one in my family to graduate college and I will have nothing to show for it. Meanwhile my cousin already has a nice comfy business job lined up thanks to family ties and I will always be compared to him and compared to him, I am the most worthless person in humanity. 

I've been shit at everything I've done. I was useless at football, getting my ass kicked by those stronger, faster and better than me all around. Some of the kids I've played with, who would smoke weed in their free time have full ride scholarships to D-I schools, while I worked my ass off and got nowhere. 

My grades are fine, but not good enough. I have a 3.0. Failure. No one will hire me with that, especially with my shit majors and unrelated internships. I WORKED MY ASS OFF AND IVE GOTTEN NOTHING EXCEPT FAILURE, MEDIOCRITY, AND LIES. 

I go into a room full of people and I still feel alone, I talk with my family and I feel alone. I am with my friends and I feel alone, and soon they will see my as a failure for failing to contribute to society. I don't want to wake up tomorow. I want to die in some kind of accident. Just a random death and let the word get on with itself. I just want to be at peace and I'm running out of ways to do that. I hate myself and I've hate what I've become. Everything I've done I've failed at and I'm a horrible person. If life is the best thing you experience then FUCK THAT. Just let me go.

Thanks in advance for any help, and if I should post elsewhere let me know that too!

Anyway, so I had an internship last year and earned less than the minimum required to pay state income tax (&lt;$8,000 in MA). However, I had state income tax withheld - about $250. When I filed my taxes, I mistakenly marked down ""Amount of tax paid"" as the same as what I had had withheld. In essence, this made my refund AMOUNT double - with 250 withholding and 250 paid, I was due ALL of it back (again, not actually required to pay income tax b/c total income was so lot). 


I got a notice saying that I'd fucked it up, and that they'd adjusted my return to fix it. However, I think in fixing it, they somehow marked the rest of my refund as invalid; I never received any refund at all, not for the 1/2 amount I should have received.

Is it too late to fix this now? I sort of looked into it last year, but got discouraged and kind of gave up after I couldn't find any info or didn't know how to proceed. Who would I contact/how would I go about figuring this out?

Thanks!"

So my years of existence have finally boiled down to this - time to pick a college. I have been admitted to several fine institutions in the United States but I have narrowed my choices down to two: Duke University Pratt School of Engineering and New York University Stern School of Business. I am probably going to pursue a career in finance after college.

I have talked to a lot of my friends, parents' friends, current students and employers and I am getting mixed feedback.

Why I should go to Duke Engineering:
I have been told that Finance is an ""easy"" subject and I should learn something ""harder"" in my undergraduate years. A lot of my friends' parents who work on Wall Street have told me that most of their colleagues have degrees in Engineering, Math and Physics, not Finance. The analytical skills developed in Engineering is really important for financial jobs. If i'm really into finance/business, I should just study an MBA later on. Also Duke's alumni program is phenomonal.

Why i should go to NYU Stern:
Location location location. It's in the city and, from what I've heard, internships are easy peasy to get. People have told me that I know I'm not going into an Engineering career, so i shouldn't waste my time studying it. Dive right into the Financial district. Also, NYU Stern has a great staff for teaching business.

**TL;DR: If I want a job in Finance, should I go to Duke Engineering or NYU Stern for undergraduate studies?**"

I've held several jobs since high school and but last August I became employed. I was determined to just concentrate on school, however my savings wouldn't last me. So I looked for jobs under 3 requirements:

1. No fast food jobs
2. No retail jobs 
3. Not minimum wage

I couldn't find anything. After months of searching, I dropped my retail job requirement and I started replying to jobs listings that required bachelors degrees stating that I do not have my degree yet, but would like a paid internship. After searching everyday for the last few months I'm starting to lose it.

I live with my parents and I have no money. My parents offer my money, but I refuse. I can't afford to go out, I'm embarrassed to go out with my girlfriend because she pays for everything.

I feel like I'm one of the brightest students in my University's CS program. I understand the material. But when I look at job listings, I feel inferior and incompetent. My degree is completely useless to me and my whole university education was a sham. I wasn't prepared for a job. I just don't know what I'm going to do. If I can't even find a decent job now.

tl;dr been unemployed for 8 months. Can't find a decent job.

Because I failed at my first try at college, which my parents were paying for, and because I'm too lazy to work while I'm in school, I feel like a complete failure and a waste.  Sure, I have a host of mental health problems but I can't blame them.  I've made choices.  I'm a scumbag and don't deserve what I have.  Every time I try to get better, whether it's exercise, finding a job, getting an internship, making friends; something goes wrong and pushes me back down.  I get sick, I have a panic attack, whatever.  I fall back down and fail again.  It's getting harder and harder (read nearly impossible) to believe that I can succeed at anything anymore.  No matter how hard I try, no matter how hard I work, something is going to come up and sway me back down, so what's the point?  I want to either die, or just stop feeling, stop caring completely and just do whatever I have to do to survive and stop dreaming of ever doing anything more."

One labeled me INTJ, the other INTP.  I think that in most ways I am probably closer to INTP, although I can see why the first test labeled me as INTJ.  

So I am an INTP female soon to graduate college with a degree in journalism and specialization in public relations.  However, after completing my major coursework and a couple of PR internships, I've realized that this is not the type of work I want to do.  I don't especially like the amount of people I have to interact with, and I don't find the work very fulfilling.  My major is almost all girls, and I'm not close friends with any of them simply because our interests are complete opposites.  A weakness in math held me back from pursing a career in science or engineering, even though I had some interest (and still do).  

So is it too late for me?  Am I doomed to be stuck in a career I have no passion for?  What is your career/careers you think are good for INTPs?"

I recently got accepted into a nursing internship program on the ICU floor at Kaiser Permanente in California and I'm extremely excited about it!  

They generally don't hire new graduates (where I am anyway), but I've heard a few new grads getting hired because the assistant manager found a way to get around union rules.  He does this by creating a series of temporary, on-call positions (each lasting 3 months) without benefits.  This allows new grads to work in the department for a year until they're no longer considered new grads, at which point he is able to hire them as official, full-time employees.  

I only know of one assistant manager at one specific Kaiser facility who does this, and it's not the one I will be interning at.  When the time comes, I'm thinking of speaking to my manager about this possibility. 

Would any of you be able to elaborate more on this strategy? And is there a good way I should suggest this to my manager?

I'm a 21 year old college student, so a neighborhood with a similar demographic (20-30s young professionals) would be ideal.

Are there any similar areas in the vicinity of Southlake, with easy access to shopping, nightlife, and recreational activities (gyms/parks, although this is probably most optional)? Since the stay is so short and the maximum lease I would be willing take on is 3 months, finding the perfect accommodations may prove to be difficult, but hopefully there is something suitable for me out there.

I do not have a career lined up yet. The past few weeks, I have been applying like crazy to every entry-level position I can find in my preferred city.  

Yesterday, I submitted a resume to a contracting agency for a Java Developer position.  An employee from the team called me to today to discuss the position.  She asked for my salary requirements and I told her $40,000/year.  I'm not sure what I was thinking; I guess I thought if you gave a low number, you would seem more employable or something.

After another phone call with a manager, I received an email asking for my authorization for the agency to submit my application to clients. Lo and behold, it said my rate was $20/hour.  Because I currently make $22/hour at my internship, I would feel cheated if I made much less after graduation.  I should have done the math beforehand.

Would it be impolite to email the company back and ask to raise my salary to something around $25/hour?  This would be more desirable as an engineer.  The position is for a java developer, however, so I am not sure if $40k is standard for that position. 

I am also not sure whether to keep pursuing this position in general, either.  I wasn't given much time to research the agency beforehand, but afterwards, I discovered that the owner of the place was charged with tax evasion and that they are notorious for grossly underpaying contractors. 

The contract is up to 2 years; however, it is also possible that their client might hire me full time after 6 months, too.  I'm paranoid about not having any offers right now and would rather not have any huge gaps in work experience after my internship ends, so I'm too afraid to ditch this opportunity entirely.  At the same time, I don't want to get involved in something below my potential that would be difficult to quit. 

tl;dr: can I ask to raise my salary from $20/hour to $25 for a java developer position without coming across as rude?

Any help or general input on contracting, etc., would be greatly appreciated. :)

I want out because I feel limited by where I am now and I feel a new location would give me the inspiration I need to excel. I have always loved to travel but never had many opportunities. Anyways my information is below and thanks for taking the time to read. :D

I'm 20 years old

I have a High School Diploma and some college credits

I can respond quickly and do tasks quickly (used to work at McDonalds) 
I have very basic photoshop knowledge(worked as an intern using this tool) 
I worked as a Resident Assistant

Have knowledge of Microsoft Word and Powerpoint as well as very basic Excel knowledge

Only know how to speak English

I've been charged with possession of Marijuanna (sch VI is the official term I believe) 
I had 2 other charges but they were dismissed

Location could be temporary or permanent depending on how things go 

I am mixed (Black &amp; White) and I live in Tennessee

First off thanks for responding! I would like to work on art and write.

I would be willing to work at whatever job is required to keep a place to live necessities etc. for me to get out until either takes off.

I don’t have any money currently but if I found a place to go with work I would be able to sell my game systems, audio system, and television to get the necessary funds. So probably 500 would be an estimate amount maybe more.

I have debts at the college I used to go to and a student loan out so I am unable to enroll because they are holding my transcripts.

Realistically a new state would probably be in my reach due to the limited funds I have.

They always say how great it is that I am doing what I am doing and whatnot (which is stupid, because many people do what I am doing) but they never compliment me on my actual work. It is like employers are seeing me as a woman in technology and not a potential candidate for the position.

But, in my haste, I decided to go ahead and submit my application because I was confident the people I emailed for references would respond positively, and the system was so horrid I already had to reenter everything three times before it would submit. Of course, no save function.

Here's the problem: the one supervisor emailed me back that she would be happy to act as a reference, however she noted that her records showed I had been there from Jan to May, as opposed to the September to July I had put on my resume and in the site's application. I had conflated the time period I worked there with another minor part time I held between September and July, since both were 2-3 years ago. The position's crappy web application does not allow adjustments once an app has been submitted.

Now I find myself in a very bad position, not just with the position I applied to, but with my reference. I will apologize to her and correct the mistake immediately for future applications, but I have no idea really how to approach the situation. Any help would be immensely appreciated."

I'm talking a skill or fun thing that you do like drawing or an instrument or anything really that other people can come here, read what you wrote and say, ""Hey I want to add something to my life maybe I'll try that.""

It'll be cool if we can get a nice list of things for people to do so no one's ever bored. :D

I decided to post this mostly because I keep seeing posts from people who are bored or just don't want to do anything and need ideas or something to get some excitement into their life. I answered one of those today so I'll just paste my response here:

* Do lots of pushups. Get riled up and then run into a supermarket and scream.

* But definitely just do something random, or plan on doing something so you can look forward to it. I have college in six months so I'm bored out of my skull but I started to build myself a computer and I'm super excited even though I have to sit 9-5 in a desk for my internship (it suxxxxx).

* If you have money to blow (although it'll go to good use, we're not just blowing the money here) go scuba diving if you haven't yet. No joke. It might seem like a crazy thing to do if you haven't before but EVERYONE has to try it at least once. It's incredible and it **will** give you a renewed interest in the world I promise. I'm not kidding, don't just say oh scuba diving that's crazy, or it'd be fun but I'm not actually gonna do. If you can afford please go pleeeasseee :) ([this](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.3162916675770.155817.1350938558&amp;type=3) is a fb album from the first time I went, I've seen a lot more awesome things but it should give you a taste.

* If you've got a forest around go for a walk or some shit. Take a friend. Wander around. If you go into a forest and just let your imagination squirt everywhere you will have a great time.

* You should make something that you do on a schedule or just make it your thing like a blog or something. I saw you said you draw and you want to go take pictures. Why just draw or just take pictures? Make it a thing where you post the pictures somewhere and go out of your way to find interesting things to photograph, draw stuff for people, it'll give you ideas to draw and it'll be fun.

* A big thing you can do, that takes some commitment but I promise you is worth it: Learn an instrument. I've started learning piano at about 9 and then of course at about 14, the beginning of high school, I realized guitar was a lot cooler, you know, get the girls in all that. I may not have succeeded in getting the girls but I've been playing guitar for five years and it's awesome. If I'm home I can never be bored. Bored? Reach over grab a guitar and start playing, walk downstairs and play some piano. Music just makes me happy.

There's so many things that different people do that there's no way to do everything but when you're stuck in that I don't know what to do phase and you're just wandering around, realize that there is plenty to do and go do it. :)"

These two positions are pretty much the same; both require 3+ years of experience, both are in Buffalo Grove, and they want someone experienced with:

* WebSphere

* Struts Framework and relational databases

* Applicable presentation layer experience with JSP, HTML, JavaScript, JavaScript libraries (jQuery) and AJAX

This next one also requires 3+ years (ideally no more than 5), but the requirements are a little different.

1ceft0,5,2013-04-15,[HIRING] Java/J2EE Developers - All Levels,Sourceress_Allison7,chicagojobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagojobs/comments/1ceft0/hiring_javaj2ee_developers_all_levels/,"**CVS Caremark** is looking to fill nine java development positions in the northern Chicago area. Most of them are located in Buffalo Grove, IL; two are located in Northbrook, IL.

I’ve briefly summarized the jobs and their requirements below; to learn more about the positions and apply, please click on the associated links. They all require Java/J2EE experience.

The first position is in Buffalo Grove and is very entry level. They want someone who’s graduating in the spring; no previous full time work experience is necessary but they do want someone with an internship or co-op under their belt. You can learn more about the job and submit an online application by clicking [this link here]( https://sjobs.brassring.com/TGWEbHost/jobdetails.aspx?partnerid=25545&amp;siteid=5087&amp;jobid=129200).

For this next position, they want someone with 2+ years of overall experience, with web development experience and experience accessing databases. [Click here]( https://sjobs.brassring.com/TGWEbHost/jobdetails.aspx?partnerid=25545&amp;siteid=5087&amp;jobid=86630) for more information and to apply online.  This position is in Northbrook.

These two positions are pretty much the same; both require 3+ years of experience, both are in Buffalo Grove, and they want someone experienced with:

* RAD

* WebSphere

* Struts Framework and relational databases

* Applicable presentation layer experience with JSP, HTML, JavaScript, JavaScript libraries (jQuery) and AJAX

This next one also requires 3+ years (ideally no more than 5), but the requirements are a little different. They want someone experienced with content management, ideally Oracle UCM/Stellent, but experience with a similar product will do.

About a month ago, I accepted an internship offer at Amazon working with their e-commerce team. Recently however, I have thought about requesting a switch to the retail team. The reason being, I feel that I am more interested in the consumer interaction aspect of Amazon. Either way, I will be making the best of any situation I find myself in. However, those with some knowledge, can you tell me about what I can expect working with the e-commerce team versus the retail team. Have you heard of any experiences from colleagues that work with these teams? And is it worth it/ possibly jeopardizing to my offer, to request a change? Thanks in advance!

EDIT: Project Descriptions

eCommerce Services
From massive scale &amp; reliability, to the customer interaction &amp; innovation that powers new businesses across Amazon, the eCommerce Platform Service group is at the heart of Amazon's growth and success.  We take pride in making what is complex to be  simple. The software components we create are fundamental building blocks, used by other teams at Amazon to build their retail websites. We're responsible for ensuring these websites stay up and running. Everything needs to respond gracefully to very drastic changes in usage patterns - from a few hundred new users up to a few million, in a very short timeframe. Our systems are part of every purchase, shipment, browsing instance and login while our constant innovation enables and powers new businesses from Kindle to AWS to fulfillment to mobile.

Retail
Amazon retail technology teams are dedicated to delivering the Internet's best shopping experience to each customer who visits an Amazon retail website globally. Every day millions of customers visit our websites and mobile apps from around the world to discover, research, and buy from a vast assortment of items. We tailor the experience to accommodate our growing and diverse selection as well as to the device the customer is using on that visit-- helping customers make buying decisions, enabling discovery of products they were not aware of, and addressing customer pain points. In addition to shopping for physical goods, we are also working on shopping for and consuming digital products.

But I'm getting the feeling that a lot of people (industry in particular) want to shift towards dry lab work rather than wet lab.

Personally, I enjoy wet lab work immensely. I'd like to move into industry or maaaybe get a masters but I'm kind of put off by the Phd--&gt; academia track. I'm one of those few people who wouldn't be that disappointed in being a tech for the rest of my life. A pay check would be nice as well.

How much do you people send on your SO?,bRichthofen,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1cebaq/my_relationship_is_making_me_go_broke_how_much_do/,"Brief introduction, 19 years old male, in college. I go to a school with an internship program, so I make about 12k-15k after every eight months of studying. So you could say that I have a salary of 12k-15k as a college student. I usually use my money to pay off my tuition fee, so I can graduate without debt.

I have a gf of the same age as me. She's not in the internship program, so she's a regular student. She's great, I love her, but she doesn't seem to value money.

I come from a fairly conservative and wealthy family (by Eastern America's standard at least), who believes that if I have a reasonable source of income, I should take care of my own dues. My gf doesn't necessarily come from a home that does well, but she has the parents who are dead set on paying for all four years of her college years.

When we go on dates, or plan for dates, it seems like she prefers to do things that are a little bit too extravagant for my likes. $100 cab rides are nothing to her, spontaneously buying multiple hundred dollars worth of shoes, clothes and etc. are all very minuscule concerns for her. Buying three figure sports tickets and meals seem to be her idea of dates. In essence, she's spoiled when it comes to money. It's a little odd, because her parents don't make much and it seems like she's squandering their support simply because it's not her money.

I try to pay for most of our date fees, and meals and it's slowly breaking my back.

I can no longer keep up with this. I live on a tight budget, and I want to save up as much as I can before graduating so I can attend graduate school and further. I've also physically experienced enough to know that my parents have gained their wealth through a strict spending habits of money, and I model that standard.

My question is, how much do you spend on your SO? I'm guessing a marginal difference between males and females, since the former gender is often ""socially obliged"" to take care of the bills. I spend about $600-$700 as a college student. "

I got a call back this morning from an Internship i applied for at a Fortune 500 Insurance Company for a Engineering Data Analyst position. I was not really expecting to get an interview and am the middle of weight loss, so my options for proper attire are very limited.

Here is my dilemma, I do not think I have appropriate clothing that will fit. I am in the middle of losing weight so finding something last minute OTR that will fit adequately would not be feasible. Also given the time constraint I am left with what options I have available in my house. 

Here is what I believe my options to be. For Reference I am a 41/42R for jacket size, 34x30 pants. 6'0 197lbs. 

1. A 44R Alfani suit from Macy's, although I had it taken in slightly to accomodate previous weight losss, the shoulders I too big and I feel like it could pass for a Zoot Suit. 

2. I have a 42R Jos. A Bank Suit that is in good condition, and the jacket fits like a glove. But the pants that came with it are 36x34 and pretty baggy so I would need to rush to tailor those at home tonight. 

3. I have many Button downs, and I have ties that match, so that is not an issue. I have both Grey and Khaki pairs of Dockers D2s that fit me well and I can match with any of these suits. However my only available sport coat is a 42R Brooks Brothers Linen Sport coat. It has rough textured fabric, so it's definitely not a very formal option.

I am all set for shoes regardless of what I choose for clothing.

So MFA, with this knowledge let's see if you can help me answer a few questions?

1. How Long does it take to tailor pants DIY? I am capable enough at sewing that I wouldnt have to learn how to do everything from scratch. 

2. If I can't get those pants to fit, what would be the best alternative I can throw together?

3. What would be considered appropriate dress at a corporation like this? I know that for the employees in their office, a polo and jeans is acceptable but obviously as an interviewee the rules are different. 


I apologize if I did anything wrong information wise to anger anyone. 

Any help is appreciated.

I was evicted from an apartment at 18. My parents can't/won't help me, although I've pleaded several times throughout the years. My friends aren't in a situation to provide loans, either. Medical debt is stacking, and my health is getting worse. I've been having seizures at work (engineering intern) and getting sent home, so my wallet is struggling even more than usual. I'm trying to get through this semester at school, but have missed the final payment on tuition. I also have to pay rent this month, but my roommate situation just got messed up too, so I am stuck with an extra $450 to pay. I have to see doctors and pay for meds. It's all stacking up.

So I've been looking into getting a small loan (or any other option? not sure what a line of credit is, or if its available) until I can get on my feet. I have poor credit due to the eviction and no cosigner, so I don't know what options there are and which ones are safe. I'm really against taking out loans and know there are a lot of ripoffs, and am usually very frugal, but I feel as though I have been backed into a corner. 

This is not a plea to receive free money. I genuinely want to figure this out and move on with my life, and finish my engineering degree. I make $14/hr, so when I'm working full time I can handle costs, but these last 2 months have been hard on me and I just want to get out of the hole before it gets too deep."

Fuck you, all companies that rejected me, especially that big shot automobile one that hired the girl who can't even manage to be there next semester, because she failed some courses and has to take them during the internship semester. I would love to see the look on the recruiter's face when she tells you she won't be able to make it.

The main outline is to fly to Bangkok, stay there a few weeks and then go to Cambodia -&gt; Vietnam where I will pick up a motorcycle (had a friend do this last year and he REALLY recommended it) in Ho Chi Minh City, motorcycle my way up the coast to Hanoi, and depending on the circumstances I will either sell the bike there or go via Laos back to Thailand.

After this I have some options. Either I go back to Sweden and be happy and satisified (hopefully) or I'll book a flight to Australia and try to land a job there via the working visa that they give out to young people on vacation. The reason is that I will have some friends in the US the next year on some internships and I'd really like to visit them as well.

So, I've heard a great deal about working the mines in western Australia, because of their remote location and hard work, they pay off a great deal I've been told. How hard is it to get one of these jobs? I'm in really good shape and do weightlifting 3-4 times a week plus I run at least 2 times each week. If I can't get one of these jobs, how much can I expect getting a unqualified forklift job or something similar in the big cities? Is my plan at all realistic? And please include some comments on what I should do while I'm in Asia as well.

Thanks for all the answers!"

If people were mentioning places to visit, then I would have a general idea of where they are too.  It also saved me when my phone died (which I was using for GPS) and my roommate had borrowed my normal GPS.  I saw a sign going to X highway and from there I knew where to go.

edit: I think I explained this badly.  Obviously you should memorize the roads, and it will happen naturally once you drive them enough.  I mean that this LPT should immediately be one of the first things you do when you move to a new area.  "

1cdk89,17,2013-04-15,I'll turn 29 next week.,[deleted],ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/1cdk89/ill_turn_29_next_week/,"I was born with a cleft palate, and despite being fortunate enough to have it repaired at an early age have still struggled most of my life with social acceptance and self image.  I can't really look back on my life and think of a time that was truly happy.  

In grade school I was made fun of relentlessly.  In high school my nose started to cave in on itself and the scar on my lip started to stretch badly.  I was socially awkward and ostracized.  I spent the majority of those years skipping school and being very reclusive.  My parents tried their best but fought most of the time and weren't really around.  My sister treated me badly so she could fit in at school.  I had tried to kill myself twice in high school, although I had only made a serious attempt once.  In my hysterics I was taken by the police and my mom came and picked me up.  Seems a bit funny now.

I was smart enough in highschool to get into college without really applying myself.  I had a single room in a 3 room freshman suite.  That whole year was dominated by anxiety.  I stopped going to class.  I stopped eating.  I mostly just slept.  My entire world revolved around how people perceived my distorting features.  It was an oppressively lonely time and place for me.  Needless to say, isolating yourself to that extreme extent is not a good strategy for staying in school.  My record was frozen and i left and went home.

The summer after I left buffalo my father prioritized me getting my face fixed.  This kind of facial reconstructive surgery is never perfect but it was probably all I could hope for at the time.  My septum was reinforced, my nose fixed and my lip put in proper proportion.  There were 2 of these surgeries.  During this time my father became ill and I became alopeciac (started randomly losing my hair).  During this time I started an engineering curriculum at a local school.  I did quite well, the curriculum came easy for me, and despite having to shave my head and having completely random spots of hair covering my head and face, I was doing better making friends and sticking in school.  Within the 2 years completing the curriculum my father passed away.  When that happened i lost all the rest of my hair and started gaining weight.  I was emotionally numb at that point.

Despite being emotionally and financially broken I was able to finish my 2 year program, keep some friends and transfer to a rather good 4 year school with enough financial aid to make it on loans.  The first year went rather smoothly as I managed to use the friends I met in the 2 year school that I transferred with to help make new friends.  The first year went smoothly.  The school work (mechanical engineering curriculum) came easy and I had a fairly high GPA.  I had made new friends.  I took a research internship that summer.  That's when the backslide started.  I started losing my eyebrows and didn't have the comfort zone of my other friends around me.  I became reclusive again but still managed my way through it.

The next year, my senior year, I was completely withdrawn.  I made it through the first half of the first semester but kept fighting with my facial hair and eyebrows.  At this point the hair on my head was all gone.  I started skipping class and not leaving my room.  I was made by one professor to go see a counselor (which was not at all helpful)  I got through by the skin of my teeth.  I still managed mediocre grades (a 3.0) but because i was a transfer it had a substantial affect on my overall Gpa.  My roommates were going through relationship drama which made me feel so much more alone on top of that.  I searched for jobs but was unfortunate enough to graduate through the market crash (2008).    I had to go back to my mother's house. 

I spent the 3 months after graduation just looking for engineering jobs.  I spent the 3 months after that just looking for temp work.  I couldn't believe i couldn't find anything with such a powerful degree.  My family consisted of my sister, who moved away long ago and my mother, who on a good day I felt was there for me and on a bad day I felt resented me for not being born as she wanted (she can spectacularly obsessed with appearances).  At this point a piece of the inside of my nose was causing me pain and I couldnt breathe.  I needed health insurance badly.  I found a box boy position at a local warehouse store that gave health insurance after a certain period of time.  I worked there for a year and then scheduled an operation.  That life was a bit heartbreaking.  I was completely alone and the friends I had made in school were all moving on.  Some getting married.  I didn't have any social life.  I still, at the age of 26 had never been on a date.  My situation, being broke, broken and alone and living with my mother was not a recipe for a relationship.  The job was menial and I felt I had more to offer the world.  I applied to graduate school and was accepted.  I worked at the box store the rest of the year and then left to school.

The beginning of graduate school was ok.  My apartment was a dump but I actually knew people their from undergrad.  The last vestiges of my eyebrows and eyelashes were falling out but I didn't let that get to me so much.  My first semester I met knew friends and formed stronger bonds with my old friends.  I worked hard (and gained 50 pounds) and got a 4.0 on the semester, which i was rather proud of.  The second semester I was finally completely hairless.  The little remnants of my eyebrow I shaved off.  I still had like half of the eyelashes on my right eye.  Despite that, I was okay with myself more than I had ever been before.  I tried to go out more and try to meet girls.  This was a rather embarrassing failure.  On paper, aside from my appearance, I felt like I had a good thing going.  I was charismatic, much more than most of the engineering students I was around, I had a good sense of humor, I had perspective, and I had a little bit of confidence.  None of that really mattered as I didn't get anywhere with any women.  What bothered me the most was that I was starting to have unwanted feelings for a female roommate that was becoming a good friend (or so I thought).  I was incredibly lonely and again started to become reclusive.  My adviser noticed and had me start seeing the therapist again.  My depression had actually become worse than it was ever before.  I had trouble getting out of bed many days.  I missed a lot of class, which in grad school is a catastrophe.  I wasn't fulfilling my research obligations.  I wanted to just get over it.  It was a willful battle against the more loathe aspects of my nature.  Almost at the last minute I got over it.  I made up enough work to get 3.0s in 2 of the 3 classes i was taking (which in Grad school is the lowest acceptable grade).  In the 3rd, the class I actually was most involved in I got an incomplete.  It was incredibly gracious of the professor to give me the I and I should have just wrapped up my work and been done with it.  Instead I became more reclusive.  The entire summer washed away.  I was just in bed and depressed.  

The next semester I managed to extend my TA somehow (I was very good at it) but half way through the semester I had an incident where I was drunk and tried to kill myself (although it was a half-hearted attempt).  My therapist forced me into a hospital.  I was stuck in there for a week.  It was a miserable experience.  When I got out, I was by the rules no longer enrolled in school.  I still had not finished the incomplete.  I had lost my TA position and lost my side job in the bar to boot.  I had no income and huge bills and was forced to see a psychiatrist every month if I wanted to ever return to school.  The focus at that point slowly shifted from getting in a good enough state to get back to school to getting in a tenable financial state.  I eventually got my job at the bar back, but that wasn't enough.  Work in that town was hard to come by, there were 4 universities of students who needed work in this small area.  This limbo lasted the rest of the school year plus another semester.  At times i thought I could make it through.  At the end I got kicked out of my apartment because I couldn't pay the rent.  

Since then i've been searching for work for the past few months.  It's hard to find anything.  It's hard to explain why i got mostly good grades and didn't finish school.  It's hard to float my resume on a Bachelors degree I got years ago and some coursework.  I'm in debt to so many people.  I'm stuck back in my mother's house (thank god for that).  All the friends I ever had have long since moved on with their lives.  I don't see anybody except for my mother who seems to hold back a river of disappointment with every interaction.  I still have never had a relationship, never had a real kiss or a meaningful embrace.  The part of me that cares is slowly dying away.  I wan't to accomplish something, to experience something.  The worst part is, is that all these failings are mostly my fault.  The phone doesn't ring anymore.  Nobody thinks about me anymore.  I'm 29 next week.  I mostly wish I had killed myself when I was 17."

I don't know if it's the way I'm changing and thinking only about getting out of college and finally working, or if there's something about me that's wrong. I met a girl in my major and we've been doing work together for months, and I really see myself dating her because we have so much chemistry. We hang out all the time together and spend tons of time doing things that couples would do, but there's no relationship in sight (and she's not interested). I got a great summer internship and imagined dating her by then and speaking to her all the time about how crazy her internship was and how mine was, but we would be across the country from each other. All these thoughts in my head. I imagined so much happiness.

I got the internship, but I didn't get her. As I get ready to leave this school, I've come to the realization that I don't have much time left to get into a stable relationship and that I might never get this opportunity together. I'm a really social person, but I suppose I just *never* found the right girl.

I'm so happy to have a somewhat solidified career plan, but what I wanted out of my life right now isn't exactly what I'm getting.

**It's so difficult to look at what I've achieved when all I can think about is what I failed to achieve.** I just want someone to love and wake up next to every morning, knowing that everything in this world is beautiful because I can feel like I belong. But I can't feel that."

1cdewz,1,2013-04-15,Need help understanding my thought process,[deleted],mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1cdewz/need_help_understanding_my_thought_process/,"Using this as a throwaway account...


**Background:**  I'm going to be as brief as possible so a lot is getting left out but I'll try to include the important stuff. I am a fourth year male engineering student at a decent university and I get decent grades with about a 3.0 GPA (4.0 scale). Parents divorced half-way through third grade and fought violently over my sister and I for years. Ended up kicked out of my mom's house for 8th grade (sat on the lawn waiting for my dad to drive over an hour to pick us up) and completely lost myself at that point. Went from being able to count every rib in my chest to having man-boobs and quite the gut as I gained weight. End of 8th grade year a lot of manipulation was going on (money and mind games) and long story short, my sister and I ended back with our mother for high school. I was pretty unhappy at this point, I contemplated suicide often and genuinely hated who I was. Thought about bringing it up a few times but my sister was in a mental health hospital for other reasons and I didn't want to cause any more trouble than was already happening. Made it through high school playing sports all the way through and lost a lot of weight, grew a bunch and became what people told me was attractive. Had a girlfriend junior-senior year, first person I trusted since I could remember and she cheated on me. Graduated high school and moved to a different state on a whim to start fresh. College has been pretty boring, stayed out of trouble - no drugs, occasional drinking, pretty bland.


**TL;DR:** normal life of someone with divorced parents.


**Questions I have:**

1. I don't remember most of my life pre-senior year of high school. I would say all of my life but I have probably 4 or 5 specific memories from when I was really young and my parents fought and I obviously remember what I highlighted above. Why can't I remember? It eats at me every day not knowing what most of my life was like. It's so bad that any time I have to do security questions for password recovery, I don't know any of them. ""First Pet?"" ""First childhood friend?"" ""Favorite grade school teacher?"" etc..

2. I am successful. I know I am. Logic says I am. I had an amazing internship. Made amazing money. Do well in school. I'm great at meeting new people. I'm good at talking to girls. I'm somewhat attractive. I know all of this. Well, *sorta*. My engineering brain says all of this. But something else won't let me believe it. Something big and consuming. It feels like it's burrowing from my stomach into my chest and my brain feels like it's attacking itself with sensory overload. I overthink everything and, in turn, I still hate myself. I'm 6' and 155-160lbs. Not fat by any means but I still see myself as that kid. I still hate myself. Why don't I see myself as I should?

3. I have a lot of resentment towards my sister. She did her best to make me look like a fool to all of her friends (18 months apart) and she was always the favorite in our family. I was the laughing stock both in the house and in the school. A lot of the complexes that I have from my childhood are directly related to her. I hold all of this resentment towards her even though I don't want to. I want to forget, I want to move on. Why can't I let go?

4. Not really a question, more of an addition but these insecurities and emotions are ruling my life. I always thought (and still do) that if I were strong enough and had enough will power, I would be able to logic through it. Logic always prevails. That's what I've been told for year after year. Why can't I? Why is my thought process so illogical? Why are people who have pretty normal and successful lives so unhappy? I still think about death occasionally (not so much suicide - don't think I would ever do it) and it doesn't scare me really. I feel sort of indifferent about it. 

I just want to try to understand why someone who has been through standard difficulties for a child growing up can have so much trouble finding peace with his/herself. All I want is some serenity in my mind. I would love for one night where I don't lay in bed while my mind lights up like fireworks. 

**Drugs** - not an option. I want to find a way to be happy on my own, not lean on a crutch the rest of my life

**Doctor** - I'm in America where we decided that it's okay for our citizens to be uninsured and therefore I don't have an affordable way to seek help."

I am a college student that just turned 20. I recently opened a Vanguard Roth IRA and maxed out for both 2012 and 2013. I have worked a year's worth of internships at large companies which has left me with a fair amount of money that I don't need immediately. After the 10k+ that I dropped into my IRA, I should have about 25k+ left after I complete my internship in September and return to my last year of school. I want to start saving for a down payment on a house for maybe 5 years after I start working, and I should note that I expect to be working in California, which is very expensive housing wise. Assuming I would keep 10k set aside for a ""rainy day"" fund, I should have about 15k that I could invest to save for later. The only large purchase that I can forsee before purchasing a house would be purchasing a car. What would be your suggestions with what I should do with this money? Hold on to it for a little longer?

I don't need to hear about how pointless these degrees are and that I should go back for an engineering degree or work at starbucks: what's done is done at this point. The only kind of education I am thinking of getting further is learning some coding in my free time with codeacademy and maybe getting an A+ certification or something, with the idea of trying to start over into the IT world. I'd like to try and see if I can use my education first, though.

I am currently working as a graduate assistant at my university doing office stuff, nothing particularly amazing though. This position ends in a month though. Prior to that I had one decent internship doing marketing for a symphony, but I had no great contacts come from that, and before that it was shitty retail jobs. 

Any tips on what directions I should be looking into with this kind of degree/how to break in to the field? Or any related field that isn't retail, sales, or the food industry? I have looked at some new unpaid internships (which I am not opposed to doing), but I am finding a lot of them want undergrads/younger people, particularly because some of the ""communications coordinators"" are, for example, 24 year olds with BAs. This is also because a lot of internships legally have to be for ""college credit,"" which is no longer applicable to me.

If anyone has some tips on how to get some career going and not hate life, I would be extremely appreciative."

1cd74c,1,2013-04-14,I have trouble talking about my issues.,That_One_Shy_Guy,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1cd74c/i_have_trouble_talking_about_my_issues/,"I have been on reddit for a long while now, but never really created a user because I just enjoyed reading and browsing through the different subreddit's. Whether it was to get a laugh or to read one of those few articles that got me really feeling or connecting with the person posting. 

I never really felt the need to post anything because I thought that my post would just be looked over or receive a few replies, but never really get a response that would help me. However, I decided I would finally make a post about my issues, something I just can't see myself ever doing with someone face to face, and see what kind of advice / responses I can get. So, here's a bit of a background on me.

I have said it to one other friend of mine before this, and he is the only person I have ever really told that I am depressed. I am currently in one of my last semesters in college and have really known I have been depressed since I was just a freshman in high school. Throughout high school I was bullied because of my size, and I often got into fights because I didn't like to take what people said about me. I had a small group of people that I guess I would consider friends, but I always felt I was on the outside of conversations and I would often just sit there and listen to conversations without ever really putting in much input. While in high school I also was the person that the group of people turned to if they were having issues. I don't know how it really started, but whenever someone in our group of friends was having an issue of some kind I was the person they turned to when they wanted to vent and get their issues off their chest.

I felt I did this because I was a good friend and found this was something I was good at. I talked several friends out of hurting themselves anymore, a few cut themselves and I guess I was the only person that noticed and took them to the side and used my way of connecting with their emotions to get them to talk about their issue, and was always there if something was wrong with their lives. However, as high school progressed the bullying continued, I was bullied at least three or four times a week at the minimum, and I continued to hear out my friends issues. This eventually led me t having to bottle up my own issues because there was no one else in my small group of friends that I ever felt really comfortable expressing my own issues to. I became more and more quiet, not that I talked very much in the first place, and just continued to be the big, kind-hearted guy who always stuck up for his friends and listened to their problems.

Now in my senior year of high school I decided to ask a girl out that I really connected with and we seemed to really connect with one another. She was one of my friends who was always extremely happy and a loving person. She was not one of the popular girls, but generally got along with everyone she talked to and was much more involved in high school than I was. This was around the time that Facebook was starting to become big and we chatted on there almost everyday. We flirted with one another and I thought she was having he same feelings for me that I had for her. So, one day I worked up the courage to ask her out only to have her say that we were just too good of friends and that if we tried to date things could get weird. 
After that conversation I promised her we were still friends, and to her I made it seem like nothing had changed because of that. I bottled up my emotions and just finished off my high school career with a small group of friends. 

I started college and went to a college where I did not know anyone, and would have to make a new group of friends. I thought I found a group of friends, but as a semester went by I realized I only hung out with them because they talked with me and we had one or two things in common. The big issue with them, though, was that one had scammed me out of some money, I did not realize this until a few semesters later, and the rest of them did drugs. This was just something I wouldn't do and I slowly began to distance myself from them. I slowly found that after I distanced myself from them that I had no friends and I hardly talked to anyone at the college. So, I decided to become a resident assistant because this would make me interact with people and get me more involved on campus. I was an RA for one semester and found that I really couldn't balance being an RA and my school work. So, I stopped doing that but because of being an RA I got involved with an organization on the campus that did basically all of the events that happened on campus and got me talking to people. However, I found that I wouldn't really let anyone close and while I talked with everyone in the group multiple times a week I made it seem like nothing was wrong with me, even though when I went back to my room I felt empty and alone. 

Flash forward to today and I stopped getting involved with all of the groups I had become a part of because of school work or having everyone who I knew in the clubs graduate and move on. I have made one friend from the hall council that we were both a part of and we still talk weekly, but he is so much different than me. He introduced me to some people, and I have made a few more friends because of this. However, none of them really know me and as far as the know I am just fine and there is nothing wrong with me. My friends from high school I still talk to occasionally, but I haven't really sen any of them in a long time. I did attempt to meet up with the girl I had asked out a few times, but the only time that we were actually able to meet it was with another two people and one of the other people was an ex of hers who it was obvious she still had feelings for and was distracted the entire night and we hardly talked that evening. 

So, here I am putting on an act everyday that everything is fine with me when really when I get out of my internship everyday I go back to my room and just feel like crap. I would never hurt myself, do drugs, or anything dumb like that because I can reasonably think about the consequences of each action and what it would do to me. However, I do think about each and can understand why some people do, do some of those things but I just couldn't ever see myself doing any of them because I know most of them are selfish acts. 

I just don't know what to do anymore though. I go through each day trying to be happy, put on a not sad face, and try to get through every day. I just need some advice on what I should do. I have becoming more and more depressed for the past two weeks to the point where I just feel like lying down and doing nothing. I'm just feeling really helpless. Everyday I go through it like a machine: put on a strong outer exterior, don't show any weakness, don't let anyone see your problems. I feel so empty. It's hard to go through each day because I can't think of any motivation to do so other than the fact that I should."

1cczco,4,2013-04-14,Need some internship advice!,Bazpingo,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/1cczco/need_some_internship_advice/,"Hey guys. 

I landed an unpaid internship at a small production company. I'll be mentored/supervised by two producers, starting out with script reading/coverage and hopefully progressing towards development. I'm doing this for the summer - I'm a 21 year old film student and I have a year left of school before I graduate. However, they've told me that they're looking to possibly hire successful interns as assistants after a few months of work. 

Here's my dilema. My main source of income is freelancing as a set dresser/PA on commercials and independent shorts. I've wanted to do an internship for years now and the fact that it's unpaid is not going to deter me from working my ass off. This is also going towards a course credit. However, I would like to make some money this summer as well. An ideal situation for me would be working both the internship and a couple of gigs this summer. So I'm trying to figure out how to ask if I could say yes to job offers while working the internship, schedule permitting. Of course I'd be willing to ask them first before taking a job and for the foreseeable future, this internship is my top priority so I won't let a gig fuck that up. 

How should I approach the producers I'm working under with this question? Should I approach them at all? This is pretty delicate for me, I don't want to seem unappreciative of the offer AT ALL and I don't want to seem like I'm trying to have my cake and eat it too. I'd also like to offer myself to the producers as a production PA if any gigs come up - but would I get paid? Could I ask without shooting myself in the foot? 

Any higher-ups reading this, what would be the best way to approach my new bosses? Thank you all for your time either way :)!

Here's a brief update from day 61. Sorry I haven't been really active, I've been super busy lately. (Which is a good thing.)

**Quick Rundown:** 20yr old straight male in college. Masturbated ~twice a day on average. Always had a bit of trouble with sex, but it was mostly due to anxiety. Developed HOCD* after a bad breakup. Started masturbating really frequently to try to block it out. Got sick of always lacking interest in real women and being a victim of my anxiety. Needed a reset.

So this month has actually flown by. I've kept myself really busy and actually have been getting a ton done this past month. I edited my friend's entire short film, I wrote my first script for a short I'm directing this weekend, and basically got together the entire cast and crew together myself. It's been a month of pulling really big things together. 

I've always been the guy that gets really psyched over something and then my interest wanes after a week or so. Not anymore. Been pouring my heart and soul into the things I want to get done. It's been surprising to everyone around me, especially myself. This is definitely NoFap at work. I've become a more passionate person. I don't need instant gratification. I don't avoid my huge wave of work to just jerk it and laze around. I step up, be a man, and get shit done. Hard to believe I used to trade this feeling for sitting alone in my room, hand on my junk, staring at a computer screen.

Friend-wise: I've been making leaps and bounds. I began to force myself to get over my slight social anxiety. Just gotta think, ""eh, fuck it."" Go ahead and text your friends to hang out or talk to that beautiful Brazilian girl you sit next to in class or strike up a conversation with your professor after class. I've learned that my anxiety had been lying to me. Making me think situations would end up extremely awkward, or I would come off as stupid, or the person wouldn't like me. Once you ignore it, it begins to lose it's grip.

And women! Oh gosh, I can feel the desire slowly seeping back into my brain. I used to be so stuck up about women, finding faults in the smallest things. Why, you ask? Oh, because I was used to the perfect women I saw on the internet. Who weren't even real. Who I had no contact with. Fucking pathetic. I've begun to notice the way a woman looks at me, or her smile, or her laugh. Small things that interest me about her. It feels amazing.

Exactly a month from today, I'm taking a road trip with one of my new friends from school out to LA, where I have an internship for the whole summer. I'll be driving from Philadelphia across the country. I would've never said ""yes"" to this unless I was on this journey of self-improvement. 

**NoFap works. It's a journey to improve yourself, so get going. You're the hero of your own story, start acting like it.**

See ya at Day 90.

1chqan,97,2013-04-16,Just did a google search of my own name and possibly found a reason why I'm not getting calls for interviews...,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1chqan/just_did_a_google_search_of_my_own_name_and/,"I've been looking for a job the past few years and never have been called for an interview. Even though I tailor my resume to each workplace I apply to even if it is a entry-level job (McDonalds at the least.) I have also four years of general volunteering services (From kitchen assistant to grounds maintenance) and I always check up on my application after turning it in consistently. But to no avail I never have gotten a job, except for an internship for a camp that already knows who I am as a person.

Now I want to move on from my internship and find a job elsewhere, it's been a month of job hunting and thirty applications later called in each business and about 3/4th of the places I applied to just hired the position.

So I worried about the smaller things like my ethnicity and age. Those things were way off and just after making an earlier post on here decided to see what would come up if I googled myself. When I did I found multiple profiles in sites such as Formspring, FB, Bebo and Myspace that I had made in middle school and my first two years of high school that are pretty embarrassing. Most of them consisted of things I wouldn't even associate myself with now and didn't remember having until now. I realized that a simple google search probably prevented myself from getting a job for the past three years.

I already have emailed most of those websites to see if I can deactivate all of my old accounts as I had lost all of my passwords to those profiles. Anything else I have not done?



TL;DR Google yourself before looking for work to see if there is anything online that might prevent yourself from getting a job/career



Edit: Thanks for the advice and such! I'm going towards adopting a different form of my name and building new from there."

I'm a senior at Pennsylvania College of Technology studying residential construction management and I'm currently looking for an internship for this summer. I was planning on working back home in NJ for the summer with a local company but a good friend of mine offered me a place to stay for the summer if I happen to find an internship in CO. She told me I would probably never leave if I spent even just a few weeks out there so why not see what CO has to offer?
I have been looking online for different internships but I'm having trouble finding offers geared towards residential construction management. Most of the companies with an online presence are larger commercial companies which would not fill the requirements set by my college.
If you know of any residential construction companies located within an hour of Denver that are looking for interns your help would be greatly appreciated. A link, email, or phone number would help me out so much. Or if you happen to own your own company and are looking for an intern message me and we can get in contact and I can send you my resume.
Thanks in advance for any help that any of you may provide and I look forward to the possibility of spending some time and working my ass off in CO."

I have been regularly working on his construction sites during my summers since I was about 12 years old. I then decided to go to college for construction management. I am now in my 4th year on a 5-year plan (yeah go ahead laugh it up lol) but I haven't taken school all that seriously. I have gotten mostly A's and B's but it has not been very challenging. It is a decent size division 2 school of about 15,000 students. However, I have not learned hardly anything useful for my construction career. I am now at the point where I must take an internship and decided to do it through my father's business. He does mainly commercial and large industrial steel buildings with about 40 employees or so. As you can imagine with most family businesses our relationship has begun to change. It seems like the only time we talk anymore it has to do with business in some way. I am his only son and it seems my entire life has been laid out not allowing me to make any of my own decisions. I know that I can go off and do whatever I want but we are from a town where everyone knows everyone and I would feel responsible for all the lost jobs and disappointment of my family as a whole. However, at the same time I don't even know if I am capable of being as successful as my father has been. I don't like the idea of working non-stop for the rest of my life just to have a lot of money. I already cannot get the business aspect out of my mind and it seems like I will never have peace of mind again unless I get out of what most would call ""the American dream"". If I end up fulfilling my ""destiny"" in taking over the family business my relationship with my father will be pretty weak, which I find extremely sad. Him and his father (my grandpa) seemingly hate each other and I fear we will be the same. On the other hand, If I leave and make my own life for myself he may resent me all the same. So, with that being said, any tips, pointers, hints, words of wisdom, etc, etc, would be appreciated by anyone that has gone through a similar situation or not for that matter. I know parts of this start to sound like I'm just looking for somebody to feel sorry for me but that is not the case. I don't like to talk about this with anyone so some outside inspiration would be awesome. Thanks for reading and I hope to hear from you Redditors! "

-Jquery
-A little bit of VHDL, and experience working with the Digilent Basys 2 Board

Starting in September I'll be doing a full-time internship in a hospital for a year.  I'll be moving to a new apartment in September to be closer to the hospital.  

I want to move to another city a couple hours to live with my bf and write my thesis from there for the summer.  We are serious about each other and plan on getting married soon after my internship ends.  However, the relationship has always been long distance (we've been together for a year) and we've mostly only seen each other on weekends up until now.  I would like to try living with him sooner rather than later.

My supervisor thinks that moving there for the summer is a terrible idea because my thesis has been advancing more slowly than it should be and I will no longer be guaranteed funding after my internship year.  We agree that it's crucial for me to get as much writing done on my thesis as possible this summer.  My supervisor thinks that I will lose too much time in the transition from here to my bf's place and from my bf's place back to here in September.  She said that she is concerned that I will take too long long to finish my thesis and run into issues with the administration (this would happen after 7 years), or even that I will decide to not complete my thesis in the end.  She even offered to pay me extra to stay here for the summer.

I will be leaving my furniture here in storage so I don't think it will take too much work to move there and back, but I've never attempted a move like this before.  Personally I think I will be more productive there because living with my bf will be motivating.

Has anyone been in a similar situation?  I'm so caught up in my PhD that I'm afraid I'm losing perspective.  I've been experiencing a considerable amount of guilt and anxiety over not progressing faster with my thesis that is preventing me from seeing the situation objectively.  My worst fear is not being able to complete my PhD.

I noticed many of my fellow juniors were already working nice paying internships in development but I was unable to find one since I lacked the skills necessary having just started my computer science classes, and even though I was junior, the only classes I had taken up until then were gen eds. Senior year when I finally had developed programming skills through classes/self-studying I was unable to find an internship in development since many companies preferred sophomores or juniors since they would be around longer than seniors. So i ended up taking an unpaid internship through my college working help desk at the local city hall. I'm nearing graduation now but I'm having trouble landing interviews since my only experience is help desk and it involved no development whatsoever. What should I do to increase my chances to be considered? I feel a bit low knowing that I have coeds who have had high paying development internships while I was working at the grocery store to support myself. I keep hearing about doing projects on github but I have no idea how to get started, and those would have to wait till after I graduate since I'm currently working around 35 hours a week between my part-time job and my internship, as well as taking 18 credit hours worth of classes in order to graduate on time. 
I have uploaded my resume to googledocs in case someone has any pointers. I live in the chicago-land area and most of my web development skills I've learned through codecademy. I learned android development from a college course.

I went three piece black suit last year, and while I got plenty of compliments I wasn't thrilled with the end result. Of course, I've been browsing(read:lurking) in MFA for quite a while, and thought one more prom thread couldn't hurt too bad. Forgive me if it's too long a read, I'm excited and don't get many chances to dress up. The prom is in a month, so I've got more than enough time to get an outfit together. 



I live in a beach town(my school is situated on the beach, the prom is taking place at a hotel on the beach) but nobody there embraces the formal-casual style that can be associated with where we live. So I thought after last year, I could escape the ill-fitted black suit that everyone wears to prom and buy a suit that I could use again(college semi-formals, internships, that deal) and get it tailored. I'm a 6"" 160lb, so not incredibly lanky but not an athletic build, if you needed to know. 


Did some research, and a navy or dark blue suit would fit best for what I'm going for. It's formal enough but not as formal as a black suit and I can get more than one use out of it. I found some H&amp;M suits that work and there is an outlet that I'm going to this weekend to see the material and if it is what I'm looking for. This [blazer](http://www.hm.com/us/product/04773?article=04773-A) has a matching pair of pants. If you've got a better suggestion on where to get suits(I'm limited in local area shops or I'd buy local) I'm all ears. 


Going bowtie because I love em'. A pattern bowtie that pops would be great, if you have a suggestion or a website to browse for one, I'd love to see it. (only stipulation is the color, red) 


My girlfriend is wearing a solid, dark red floor-length dress, and I ran it by her and she said it'd be fine if I went a little more 'casual' than her(and showed her what I was thinking with pictures). What this means is I'm thinking about brown penny loafers. Sadly, these [penny loafers](http://www.gilt.com/brand/gordon-rush/product/148511063-gordon-rush-spencer-penny-loafer) are out of stock(and no longer on sale). If any redditors know of a replacement of a similar style and price, I'd be very glad to look them over! If you think brown is too casual, I'm open to suggestions with black shoes. 


Finally, I'll be trying on a vest to see if I like it. If not, I'd like a suggestion on what to wear underneath the jacket. Plain white with an oxford collar seems to be the way to go with the vest, but I'm not sure if it's too plain without a vest. Suggestions here are very welcome.


Other than that, I'll be getting the suit and shirt tailored at a local shop to make it really fit. My price range would be around $300 for clothes, at the most. I figure I might end up growing out of these clothes, but I do want to look great while I'm in them. If I made any mistakes or you require some more information please ask!(I think it's all here, I really did make a check list.).
Please weigh in! If the response here is good I'll post pictures as I get them.

Thanks in advance!"

I've been playing Arkham since 2010, and it amazes me how much fun I can still have with this game. Anyways, here's my story:

My wife is out of state doing her internship, and I'm stuck here by myself until my semester ends. This week is the week where every project I have is due, so I didn't even go down to my hometown this past weekend to hang out with the guys I usually game with. So, without many options but still wanting to play something, I played a solo game of Arkham Horror, for old-time's sake.

**Setup:** Dunwich Horror game using three investigators (Mandy Thompson, Wilson Richards, Leo Anderson) against Tsathoggua.

**Game:** The game started with Mandy Thompson being devoured first turn by an ill-timed encounter card, after which I replaced her with Kate Winthrop. I was unable to gain sufficient momentum in the beginning of the game, which really cost me later on. The doom track rose quickly as I struggled to keep up with all of the open gates around town, trying desperately to gain clue tokens in order to seal them. Monsters were relentless and kept getting harder due to the fact that Tsathoggua all but prevents you from spending monster trophies, so the easy ones weren't being added back to the cup (or basket, in my case). By the end of mid-game I had only managed to pull off getting two gates completely sealed, and that's when it happened: A gate burst. Now one of my two precious seals had been violently ripped away, the terror track was rising, and six out of my limit of eight open gates (I had an item that increased it by one from seven) were on the board. In a futile attempt to get the gates under control, I sent all three investigators into the Other Worlds, where they all ended up losing their sanity, being lost in time and space, and spit back out into the asylum. During the misadventures in the Other Worlds, another gate had opened, bringing me to seven. As the turn ended in which I healed all three investigators' sanity, the eighth gate opened, summoning Tsathoggua. There was no hope for this fight; Tsathoggua's attack is horrific (discard one gate trophy and two monster trophies or be devoured), and I had very little weaponry to contend with his -6 combat rating. I lasted three rounds of combat before being crushed, my game ending in failure.

Overall I had a lot of fun playing it. It was a frantic, doomed-from-the-start kind of game, but it was thoroughly satisfying."

1ch9oe,1,2013-04-16,My first real job ruined my self esteem and maybe my chances at another position. How do I move on?,GardenSlugger,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ch9oe/my_first_real_job_ruined_my_self_esteem_and_maybe/,"**TL;DR - Bullied by my old supervisor, confidence shattered, trying to move on. Possible rumors/shit talking from old supervisor around my city. Afraid I'll never be able to find another position.**

This turned out really long. Sorry! Also I'm using a throwaway. This is not my main account.

I'm in my early 20s. I was ""laid off"" from my first job at an advertising agency early this year. I'm the type of person who has always taken school and career choices pretty seriously. My parents also always instilled a sense of humility in me so I've always been willing to bend over backwards. (I honestly think this has made me a little weak-willed and thrown off my sense of self respect when it comes to authority figures) I had to complete an internship for school so I chose my agency strategically in order to win a job after interning. I did this successfully.

The branch of the company I worked for had only 3-5 people ever working in that office with a high turn over rate. I was so confident and proud of myself. I think I was a model intern and a really good employee (again, at first). Because there were so few people in the office, I worked in close proximity with the head of my department. Often there would be no mid-level person between us so we'd have to work together, covering that position's duties. I was proud that I was able to step up and work on tasks that should've been far out of my reach.

At first, I was totally starry-eyed and looked up to my supervisor so much. She loved this. She did the job I had dreamed of while I was in school and she was incredible at it (still is). Once I was hired on full time, I started noticing small things she did that felt direct and targeted.  My mom was the first one who brought up the word ""bully"". My supervisor would often say really inappropriate things to/about me in front of clients and our coworkers. She told a new hire, ""GardenSlugger has to do what I say because I say it."" Sure I did. I was the junior. I understand that but to state it in such an overt way... Was this over the line? I was also expected to go to Starbucks every day to get her latte, no matter what - one lone latte since no one else in the office drank Starbucks. She wouldn't even tell me to go. She would passively-aggressively whine about *really* *needing* *caffeine*. She created an environment where I felt it was difficult to ask questions and therefore get the training I needed to get better at my job. Often questions were met with an eyeroll. She would also constantly spout off tons of garbage about other employees to me, so I knew she would definitely have no qualms about telling everyone how ""useless"" I was. There are a ton of other examples but I basically felt like I was trapped in high school again but it was much more serious this time - my apartment, job and future were at risk if I pissed this woman off.

My morale was so low and anxiety so high that I would often throw up on my way to work in the mornings. I was terrified of what she would say to/about me, feeling unable to fight back. I felt like this for months, questioning my own sanity. I was so afraid that I was coming off as an spoiled, too sensitive brat. Eventually I was only concentrated on my anxiety and was becoming absolutely terrible at my job. I would forget things, make mistakes with clients, miss deadlines and screw up small tasks. I knew I was becoming total shit. The confidence I got from being top of my class in school lay in shreds. She told me there was just not enough work to support my position and that I was laid off. I think she just couldn't stand having me around anymore.

Before you ask, yes, I did try to rectify the problem. Unfortunately the company was based in a country where HR doesn't exist so that was out. I spoke to the VP in our branch about my supervisor's behaviour. The VP promised he would talk to my supervisor about it, but the VP left the company shortly afterwards and my supervisor became the head of the branch. I couldn't confront her directly because I knew she would take personal offence (instead of listening) and my head would probably be on the chopping block. I guess it was anyway. I wrote my concerns about her when review time came along. This was supposed to be anonymous feedback, delivered by someone else in the company. I even wrote my own list of improvements *I* needed to make that I would've presented and discussed with her at the time of my review, which never happened. I tried resisting her behaviour and even standing my ground when she would make cruel comments. I'm sure I could've done more but I know how girl bullies work and they do not respond well to confrontation.

My industry's community in my city is small and she is well known. I'm interviewing tomorrow for a position that I really, really want to get. The recruiter that set me up with the gig informed me that the person I am interviewing with ""knows someone"" at my previous agency and was wary about meeting with me. So now I'm terrified that my reputation is ruined, even without being officially fired. 

How do I move on from this? (In terms of employment and my own confidence/mental well-being)"

*EDIT:* Front page?! This is amazing! Thank you all so much!

Dear Riot and Redditors,


  My name is Hunter and I am a high school student in the 11th grade. At my school, we have a senior project called CapStone that we are required to pass in order to graduate. For it, we must shadow or volunteer for 20 total hours. We must then write a report, create a PowerPoint, and make a product to show what we have learned from our time. I've been having to think about what I could do for awhile now. My friends are doing things such as car mechanics, teaching, and sports training, but I've decided I want to do something involving my passion of gaming.


  My grand idea would be to somehow incorporate League of Legends/Riot Games into my project. I would love to come out to the Riot HQ (I'd pay my expenses of course) and shadow an employee for 3-4 days. As stated above, I need twenty hours, so if I were to shadow three 7-hour work days I would already be done. This would be an amazing experience and would give me the inspiration I need to do well on this project.
I'm thinking maybe I could learn something about champion design and perhaps design a champion as my product? (not for play, just for show). If anyone has any way of getting me in contact with Riot that'd be amazing, or if a Riot employee sees this and would be willing to help would also be cool.


  My second idea was to shadow a pro player, but with LCS going on and all, that probably would be difficult for them.
If anyone has any other ideas I would love to hear them! But Riot, this could be my dream come true for a school project. It's a pass or fail so if I fail, I don't graduate. This could be just the thing I could do to pass exceptionally!


  Well guys, reddit, thanks for giving me your time here! All that's left to really say is thank you..and...RIOT PLZ! (:

I've never kissed, made love, or felt as passionately as I did with him.

5 months of just casually dating someone -- through my college graduation, through summer, through my internship 2 hours away -- and he still kept in contact with me. Before I left, we saw each other every week. When I got back, we were seeing each other almost everyday. He told me things he only told he serious ex-girlfriend; he told me I was incredible and that you hadn't felt this way about a girl in a long, long time. He told me he wasn't seeing anybody else but me. He was my ideal, everything I'd ever look for in a guy. I felt stupid for thinking he was just trying to get into my pants, because now that I look back on it, his feelings were genuine. Who wants to be with a girl through all that time? And ""casually,"" at that?

And then the summer was over and I landed the job 200 miles away. He was going to ask me out to be his girlfriend officially, but distance got in the way. On my last night, we stayed up together and talked about all the things we were going to do -- all the things we wished we could see each other do. And then we slept together one last time and said our goodbyes.

Now it's been 8 months, and I'm still here, far away from him. He still occupies my mind -- something reminds me of him everyday. Since then, we've exchanged a couple texts back and forth. 

And then you called me out of the blue yesterday. Just to say hello and that you were wishfully thinking I was around. That I looked gorgeous and that you wanted to see me. Is this real? *You're still thinking of me, too?*

I think I'm in love with you. I just don't know how to approach this -- I don't want to be some crazy girl that you dated 8 months ago that's trying to get back in contact with you. But if you didn't feel the same way...why did I just randomly cross your mind?

Help?,[deleted],Conservative,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1cgxms/my_universitys_college_republicans_club_was_taken/,"So there are two College Republicans on campus, the original one (which was taken over), and the federated one (which has appointed positions; and was generally non-operating). During the elections the SFL and YAL saturated the room (a club that was originally around 15 constant members, turned into a room filled with 65 people), although SFL and YAL are generally just libertarian clubs, the people who run this are active and vocal Anarcho-Capitalists.

I am en route to being appointed President of the federated club, and I need ideas of ways to make the other club completely irrelevant.

I'm able to get the University Media to participate with me. I plan on getting greek life involved in the club, which is very possible. I plan on getting high-profile guest speakers, which I have the connections for.

I feel like I have a good team and a host of ideas. But I feel like I'm missing ideas that can make this other club completely irrelevant.

Are there any events that people absolutely love doing? Or any advice you have to offer? Or anything at all?

I got a lot of advice when I first started that I ignored and now want to set it out in the open for other stubborn students to ignore. 

1) don't settle for Bs or Cs
    Now that I am about to get out, I think back on all the times I      decided not to destroy myself for good grades, and I regret it. My options are limited as far as graduate school goes because my grades aren't amazing. 

2)Buy a casio right away. I started out trying to avoid using the TI graphing calculator I had in favor of an FE approved TI model. It was a good idea, but I learned just before the FE that the casio fx-115ES Plus was amazing. I can easily say it gave me an extra 20 to 30 minutes on the morning exam and the same on the afternoon portion. It can do stats, vectors, and linear algebra.

3)Do an internship for one or all of your summer breaks. It will help you find a job straight out of school. I haven't graduated yet, so can't complain about the difficulty in finding a job, but have thrown 10 applications out into the world with no response. I envy my fellow students who are already employed via their internships."

I've already graduated from UCF with one Bachelor, and going back to school to acquire another Bachelor in Information Systems Technology at Seminole State College. I've taken programming classes (C, C++, Javascript) in the past, and I'm currently working on getting my CCNA and A+ certifications. I have experience working for multiple companies as an IT Technician, using a ticket based system (Remedy), working on and fixing laptops &amp; desktops, and remote login support via calling center. I currently have an IT internship, however they only require 20 hours a week and they are flexible (I can work 4 hours for 5 days, 10 hours for 2 days, or anywhere in between). My availability is open (days, nights, weekends). As of my course study, all my classes will be provided online. Send me a message and I'll gladly compose a resume for you.

Thank You."

2. Is it a nice place to bike around the campus area? Is it bike friendly? Possible to bike from off-campus housing to the school for class?
3. How are the houses? I want to live off-campus. Are the landlords generally okay? Are the houses in good condition? Can you find a room in a house that's pretty close to the school for $550 or lower?
4. In what area of Kelowna do most students live?
5. To english majors: How is the English program? Do you recommend it? Do you do internships during the study period? What kind? Have internships led to any job offers for you or people you know?

1cgq85,2,2013-04-16,Can engineers ever decide between more than 1-2 job offers?,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1cgq85/can_engineers_ever_decide_between_more_than_12/,"As an undergrad I always thought that I would work my way through college and then at the end I would apply to a dozen companies, interview with several of them, and then go through a handful of offers and select the best-fit job.  As I approach my final year in college (9 years later!) with a PhD, I wonder if this thinking was naive?  I think I expected it to be like college admissions, with firm deadlines and an expected schedule of when you would hear back.

* **As an engineer, do you really ever get to evaluate more than 1-2 job offers at a time?**

As I inch closer to graduate, it seems less and less likely that - even if I *can* interview with a *dozen* companies in the same week - **the chances that I can get them all to give me an offer letter at the same time seems impossible**!  My last internship took *8 months* from successful interview to matching me with a position and giving me a formal offer.  And, **the window in which to accept or reject an offer is ridiculously short**, even for start-dates a year away.  (E.g. If I successfully complete my next internship this summer they *will* give me an offer, but I only have *3 weeks* to accept - 2 weeks if I want the signing bonus.)

So what do engineers do?  How can you line up job offers to hit at the same time so you have the most options?  If it helps, I'm still in school for my PhD, and I know when to expect one job offer after my internship this summer.  Do I just wait for the first offer and then knock on the other companies' doors and say, ""Hey, last chance to make me an offer before I accept this in a week?""  It seems like HR departments tend to drag their feet until the last possible minute."

I have a question regarding summer internships in the engineering field. Since I am only about 4 weeks away from my summer, it's getting very close to decision time for me about my summer plans.

This will be my last summer for an internship as I graduate next year. I am a ME but am wanting to get into the BME field for my career. I have applied to a few BME companies for summer internships but haven't heard back yet. I currently have an offer from a well respected engine company that I have interned for in the past. If I don't get any offers from BME companies I will accept my offer from the engine company. But b/c I really don't have a passion for engines, I would really prefer to get an offer from one of these BME companies.

My question then is, do you think it's a good idea to go to these BME companies and tell them I have a deadline to make a decision with this other company in an effort to try to get an internship with them? I'm really not trying to use that as a bargaining chip or to gain leverage. I genuinely just want a job in the BME field but I only have about 2 weeks to reply to this engine company.

The **TL;DR** is we're looking for social media interns for 3 months, travel and lunch costs paid for, after which you'll be paid as we should be in stage 2 investments. If not - we'll ask for you to either volunteer or leave with a glowing reference if you've made it that far. We're not out to exploit anyone but neither do we have the money to pay anyone just yet. 

We're a startup as lean as they come.

So if you're still interested the details are below.

---------------

We're looking for several self-motivated individuals who have a passion for social media to help form a team for a media website located in Google Campus, Shoreditch. We're a start up and as such the positions are unfortunately unpaid however we can pay for your travel and lunch. 

As you're an intern, and you'll be working with people who remember how grueling it is, we'll be keeping your hours and time spent with us to a reasonable pace of 4 hours for 4 days a week. With only one of those days spent on campus - the rest of the time providing you have an internet connection and computer capable of running some web apps you can work remotely. If you wish to work from the campus that is fine - we're just wanting to ensure the best we can for your needs so you can perform your responsibilities.

So the bad news is that it's unpaid, for all of us so far, but the good news is our venture has found its first round of investment to allow us big boy servers and to actually redevelop our site into something usable. The even better news is that if we can gain traction we have various interested parties who are looking to invest further.

That's where you come in - we need your help to grow. We need you to help us maintain our small existing community and to help it blossom into something much more.

As this is going to be my team I'm also going to want to teach you so you can walk away from this if need be and straight into a job if things go south. A lot of places expect you to do grunt work and just chew through some admin work until your time is up and they churn you out but I'm looking to form the foundation of a strong team. I want to be able to give you a task and have complete faith that not only will it be done but you'll make it your own. Because I'll be trusting you with more than just posting images but representing a company that's gathering some serious attention. 

I want someone who in 3 months time when we've our second stage of investment I feel that not only do I want them to stay but that their up to the salary we'll be offering.

-----------------

**Job Details:**

**Position:** Social Media/Marketing Intern

**Starting date:** 29/04/2013

**Remuneration:** Travel Costs/Lunch

**Responsibilities:** You'll be responsible for social media engagement, monitoring, moderation, and outreach. You will be taught how to use various CRM tools and how to seek influencers and communicate with affiliates in a tone that belies our company mission...one which is essentially to cater to a generation with the attention span that does not exist. Our demographic is the 16-25 crowd and they don't exactly give much time for things these days. 

You'll also be learning various marketing techniques and as such we'll discuss areas you can work on developing if you have an interest in doing so. We've various big names mentoring us and have an established and experienced team on this project who are already known experts in their fields. Take advantage of that.

**Requirements:** You need to understand social media beyond the point of ""Getting it"". You need to be interested in it. Whether it's Twitter, Facebook, or G+. Why? Because you're going to be taught how to use these as a tool beyond liking your Mother's photos of the cat. 

Beyond that you don't need to have a degree, or prior experience, just be willing to learn. It would help that you're computer literate though.

It's a given that you need to be driven but if we're going to trust you to work remotely we also need you to have enthusiasm and be contactable. I need to work with people I can rely on. 

**Location:** Shoreditch, Google Campus


So if you're interested - hit up daniel@planetivy.com and ask me some questions. Feel free to PM or ask some questions here too.

I'll have plenty for you so let us make it an even trade off."

I have a friend doing an internship in Paris, and she lives in a terrible shithole: it's damp, dark, rotten, smells awful and there's a big water leak in her bathroom. The landlord says he's going to ""fix"" things but that it's ok for her to live there in the meantime... But I don't think it is, she can't stand it anymore and it's affecting her badly, she really needs to get out of here to get some rest as she's seriously depressed. She knows absolutely no one in Paris and has barely enough money to pay the rent (that's why she had to live in this shithole in the first place, but it got progresively worse). 

So I guess my question is what could she do in order to spend a couple of nights somewhere else in Paris? She can't afford an hotel and has to stay in the city for work... Maybe couchsurfing or something similar? I have no clue how to help her and she seems desperate, so any tip would be welcome. 

Thanks a lot. 

Edit - Ok so I guess couchsurfing is the way to go, she'll try that and I'll tell you how it goes. Anyway, many thanks for the support and the generous people who offered to help, you're all stand-up guys and gals. It's good to feel like you can count on the community when you need it ;) "

1cg7pl,1,2013-04-16,"I (F, 21) feel my world will fall apart when my SO (M, 23) graduates and leaves me for a new career.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1cg7pl/i_f_21_feel_my_world_will_fall_apart_when_my_so_m/,"Relationship experts of Reddit, I need some advice and general comforting. Brace yourself for a wall of text:


In about two and a half weeks, my boyfriend (M, 23) of almost two years will be graduating and leaving me (F, 21) and our college town for his new career. We decided it would be best based on his new job (which entails mainly traveling to job sites across the country for extended amounts of time with long work days) to break it off but still want to remain good friends. Obviously the fact that we know our time together is coming to an end is quite depressing, and neither one of us really knows how to handle it. Thus far we’ve had the “neither one of us thinks the LDR would work at this time in our lives” talk and the “we’ll still be really close friends” discussion, but have pretty much left it at that and ever since have avoided the topic, spending our time together as usual. Lately I've been getting very sad, crying at night knowing our days together are almost over and time seems to be going extremely fast.


We started seeing each other within the first few weeks of me entering college, and have been together ever since, seeing each other almost daily. The longest we’ve gone without seeing each other has probably been about two to three weeks during the summer. We never really considered ourselves a couple until later on, but we’ve always been close and in a generally exclusive relationship. We’ve of course have had our ups and downs, but overall have had a really great and open relationship for the past twenty or so months, the longest either of us had been with another person. He means so much to me, and while I wish we could stay together even when he leaves, I know it makes more sense to end things on a good note and possibly pick things back up once he has more of his life in order. I know he’s really scared about entering the real world, and the uncertainty and unknowns of his new career are huge factors. I also don’t know if I could ever be so close with someone again, at least while I’m still in college. He encourages me to date again once he leaves, but I don’t know if I can anytime soon.


Because I started seeing him within the first month of being in college and we spend so much of our time together, I literally have no idea what to do with myself once he’s gone. I have a few close friends, but almost all will be graduating or gone for the summer, so I don’t really have anyone to turn to when he leaves. Summer in this town is pretty dead/deserted, so not many people will be around to meet. Literally the only person I would be hanging out with is my real older brother (who I love dearly), but has a full time research job with university and therefore won’t be able to hang out a lot anyway.


To fill my copious amounts of free time I landed an internship which will be about 20 hours a week, plan on continuing to volunteer at the local animal shelter, and will be taking an online class during the summer, but I’m not sure how I’m going to get by outside work or school, ie weekends, evenings, and overall free time. I still have two more years of university left, live alone, and, to top it off, my best friend and psuedo-older-brother will also be graduating at the same time as well, leaving to take jobs in other states. I’m a generally shy and quiet person, but managed to make this great group of friends when I first arrived to college, mainly neighbors from my freshman year (including my boyfriend). The downside was they were all older than me, but I figured I wouldn’t have to worry about it for a year or two. That time has come, and I’m kinda freaking out.


I really do not feel emotionally ready for any of this at all. 


But back to my boyfriend and our future relations. I’m pretty bad about keeping in touch with friends via phone and internet, since I always feel a much more personal and stronger connection when I can see and not just hear someone. Skype/FaceTime have, however, helped a lot but it’s never the same, of course. He'll be working very long days and will probably not be able to talk often while at the various job sites. I'll be very busy myself with classes once fall semester begins, and we probably won't be able to meet in person very often due to conflicting schedules. 

What efforts can we make to keep our friendship alive? How should I approach this subject when talking to him about it? How can we make the transition from intimate and seeing each other daily to platonic and only speaking occasionally and rarely seeing each other for an unknown amount of time? 


**TL;DR:** Basically I feel like in three weeks, my whole life is going to fall apart when my boyfriend (and best friends) graduate and enter the real world, leaving me behind. I have no idea how I should or will handle it. I’ve made efforts to keep myself busy once my boyfriend and friends leave, but I feel it may not be enough and I will be overall very sad and depressed for the whole summer and some time beyond.


So Reddit, has anyone been in a similar situation? How did it work out for you? Does anyone have any general advice or things to make me feel better before I have a huge mental breakdown?

Firstly is not taking advantage of internships. Turns out experience matters. A lot. And getting your foot in the door helps immensely before graduation. 

Secondly is thinking college is ""easy"". It was, I had really good grades, graduated with honors, never really studied, just passed test. Almost 2 years since I have graduated I feel like I really missed a lot of opportunities to hone my craft, and instead just passed tests and assignments like I always did.

Thirdly, and lastly, not running with it the second I graduated. I took time off to help my sick family, and now being out of the loop I am finding it incredibly hard to be employed. As bad as it sounds I almost wish I would have let my aunt and dad fend for themselves while I secured my future. And that feels horrible to say. Because right now all I have is debt and time wasted to show for my studies.

So, reddit, what's you're biggest college or shortly after college regrets? I know I am far from alone in this one.

1cg4kn,6,2013-04-16,Can anyone make me feel better? :/ (long post),simplegrays,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1cg4kn/can_anyone_make_me_feel_better_long_post/,"My good old friend depression is back! I spend every night crying myself to sleep. its a heartwarming feeling I know.

Where should I start? The beginning, I suppose.

I am a 23 year old female and my life has been all downhill. All of it. I'm afraid to be happy for even just a moment because I just know it will all come crashing down. Growing up life was hectic, My earliest memory is of my parents fighting when I was 2 and me sitting on the stairs and them not even noticing me as the screamed about my father's gambling issues. They divorced soon after and it was just fight after fight about custody and visitation. It was terrible. Then when I was 13, my father passed away. He was a former decorated police officer (SWAT to be more specific) in my area, in line to be police chief, but his gambling and then getting hooked on crack destroyed his career. He was high one day and walking around his neighborhood naked. Someone saw him and called the police. The police recognized who he was and 6 officers were sent to get him. They couldn't handcuff him because my father knew all the tactics. So the six officers took my father to the ground, face down to handcuff him and the weight of all the men, plus being high killed him. I remember the day like it was yesterday. Sitting in my living room waiting to go to a baseball game that my mom had promised my sister and I for weeks. I was happy and excited, and then she received the phone call. I cried and cried. What was I supposed to know about death at 13? I tried to live life normally, and go to school but my fathers death was reported on 4 news stations and 7 newspapers. The newspaper from his city did a front page article about his death. Everyone knew. People constantly would come up to me asking if I was alright and if I wanted to talk. I was smothered, and couldn't handle it. I kept trying to push back what I was feeling.

After the funeral my mother changed. She became angry over the littlest things, and she started to hate me. She would constantly degrade me for no reason, calling me stupid and a mistake. Often telling me she wish she had an abortion and that she didnt want me anymore. While my younger sister was her perfect little angel. (we have the same father) My mother would make sleep on the kitchen floor over night if I didn't clean it to her liking, or have me sweep 6-7 times in a row. I love to read, and my mother would take away my books as punishment, she would disconnect the TV, Internet, and phone lines just so I wouldn't have connection to anyone. She replaced my room door with a glass door that locks from the outside. And yes, I have been locked in there. She's beaten me but not as much as she would like to, as I often ran away. And she loved to constantly call the police on me and tell them I was on drugs and have them search my room to find absolutely nothing.

Finally when I was 16, I snapped. I ran to the kitchen, pulled out the largest Cutco brand knife we had and held it to myself. (And If you don't know, Cutco knives are great! They cut through everything!) I went to my mother, with the edge towards me, I moved the handle in her direction. I told her to push it in. She wanted me gone so badly just do it, kill me now and get it over with. She didnt and she ended up just driving me to the emergency room. Her story changed between me holding the knife towards her, and me wanting to kill myself. (My mother is very self absorbed). She didnt understand that I never wanted to kill myself, but the fact of having to live everyday with someone saying that you were a mistake and they regret not having an abortion when you have no where else to live is torture. I was in the mental hospital for 2 weeks as an inpatient before the moved me to outpatient where I was for 4 weeks. The second time around 6 months later was 4 weeks inpatient 6 months outpatient. Doctors just loaded me with whatever antidepressant, anxiety pills they could find. All the while my grade and classwork suffered. My sister during this time began to draw fake bruises on herself by mixing the crayons and coloring pencils on her skin. They obviously looked faked but my mother ate it up and told everyone I was a psychopathic bully.

6 months after leaving the hospital for the second time, my mother deemed I was still not good enough so she called the cops and told them to take me because she didn't want me anymore. I was placed into foster care the next day. I was so alone, frightened and scared. And even though I fortunately was placed with a single mom and her adopted daughter who tried to make me feel as comfortable as possible it was disheartening. I had never felt so abandoned and alone in my life. First my father, then my mother. I had no one. I was in foster care for almost a year when my grandmother fought to get me out. She took care of me for a bit, until the grandfather's Alzheimer's got worse and she had to focus on him. My mother reluctantly agreed to let me go back to her house after that.

She kicked me out right after my 17 birthday and placed me in Job Corps. The worst thing ever. I would not recommend this to anyone. Began smoking pot to cope with a shitty life. At least my few highs brought me some kind of joy. Through a friend there I met what would be my first, and as of now only boyfriend. Things were great at first, we got along, and I lost my virginity to hit. Sometime down the road, on of his best friends went to jail and he was absolutely torn apart over it. He called me in the back yard of our place at the time because he said he had to talk and he just let me have. Beat me so bad I couldnt see or speak. I was too afraid to move. If I tried to defend myself he hit me harder. Beating me became a regular thing and continued for the remained of our 2 almost 3 year relationship. I have two scars on my face, one on my forehead, and one on my lip of where he hit me. I see these as constant reminders of how shitty my life is and now I'll have these scars forever. While this was happening our roommates stole all of my valuables, jewelry and electronics before running off and saying fuck you. I also found out later they (2 girls) were prostitutes. Awesome. I also must add, I was working a full time job and going to school full time as well. Straight A student, and makeup hid what it could at work.

After narrowly escaping from the abusive relationship, I was able to run away and had my sister pick me up in the middle of the night. My sister still holds it over my head to this day, saying that she never should have picked me up and she should have let him kill me. I begged my mother to let me stay there until I could get back on my feet. She agreed and I found a new job and switched schools. After a year and a few months we were back at each others throats and I moved in with a friend and his mom who happened to have an open room. It was closer to work and school and I would spend less time and money commuting. Still able to keep my grades up. Then about 8 months ago, I finished my legal program in school and completed my internship with high marks. My place where I did my internship decided to keep me on for a big case they were working on. Everything seemed to be finally working out for me. The friend I had moved in with spat in my face practically and ended the friendship we still don't talk and Im still living there. I worked on the case with the firm for 3 months out of town. I worked my ass off. 78 hour work weeks as the only paralegal supporting 6 attorneys at trial. I made a lot of money, and I was starting to look for my own apartment, and I even bought furniture. Trial ended we won, but on some preliminary motions the judge threw out our expert witness and our case collapsed after that. Worked slowed back at the office and they cut my hours to 15 hours a week maximum. It hurt. Still does. I don't understand why those who work hard in life get nothing. absolutely nothing. My sister on the other hand, has been stung out on drugs, fired from jobs, kicked out of her university, flunked community college, does absolutely nothing with her life and my mom caters to her. Covers all her bills and gives her absolutely everything.

Oh, and the first guy I had a crush on since my ex asked me to help him find and track down his one true love. Turns out she was married (has been for 3 years and they were together for only 2.)

I just want to say, Thank YOU GOD, KARMA, BUDDHA, CONFUCIUS, &amp; WHATEVER OTHER FUCKING GODS ARE OUT THERE, THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE BIGGEST FUCKING SHIT ON MY LIFE EVER. THANKS. My life sucks. I have never been in love, no one has ever wanted me, my family treats me like shit and constantly degrades me, I work hard and get nothing in return, now I practically have no job with 15 hours a week because that doesnt even cover my bills.

I hate it when people say it gets better. Because it doesn't. Look at my life. I have lived 23 YEARS OF BAD FUCKING LUCK. Maybe I was a bad person in a past life? I am so tired of trying to be a good person, be the better person, when life obviously doesnt take kindly to that. I am utterly alone and I fight this hard battle alone. Sometimes I just want someone I can open up to and share this with and just have them hug me and tell me its going to be okay. Thats all I really need, is a hug. and someone who will let me cry because I am tired of being strong. I am tired of having to put on my big girl pants and pretend everything is okay, because its not. No matter how hard I try to forget, I still hear my mother in the background telling me she doesnt want me, I feel my ex's punches to my face, I see my sister get everything for doing nothing. I hate it, I hate life, and I hate me. I've tried to open up to people about my life, but to those I do, they just shun me afterwards. I guess it was too hard even for them to deal with. I wish someone would just accept me and this baggage I have and just be a friend. Someone who will call me everyday to check on me, someone to talk or hangout, whatever. Because right now my soul is tired and I can't take this anymore.

TL;DR - MY LIFE SUCKS ASS. AND TO THOSE WHO SAY LIFE GETS BETTER? FUCK YOU, IT DOESNT. I believed that for a bit and it got me more bad luck.

Today however, a real change in my life occurred. I would like to start from the beginning. 

Tl;dr I have reached many pinnacles and lows, but I aim to go beyond them.

It started off 2 years ago. I was a junior in university smoking pot and drinking like it was my duty. Imagine a 5'5 Malaysian Chinese American surrounding himself with typical college douchebags. In my spring semester I had done a lot of ecstasy and was into electronic music. One day I did way too much. I honestly thought I was going to die because the effects were too much for my conscious to handle. The next day, I wrote in my old blackberry a message to never be the same person. 

I had begun to slowly transform my mindset and started working harder in school. I stopped hanging out with my roommates and friends and went to the library to do some serious work on my GPA. It was tiring and that first step seemed like a long leap, but after a while I really started to feel a change. Then one day it all came crashing down as my roommate had not only gotten arrested for smoking in the dorms, but also got me involved as I had a Tupperware case in my closet that had suspicions of marijuana. In the end, I was suspended for a year.

I had no one to blame for myself. I let myself get involved with a lot of bullshit and surrounded myself with a poor selection of friends. Telling my parents was a new low for me. Not only are they strict and Asian, they work so damn hard for me to be in school. I won't lie to you all, I took advantage of my parents kindness, hardwork, and love. It hit me every night that I was a complete failure to them. I love my parents, and since they still loved me despite my stupidity, they sent me to shanghai for a year to learn Chinese. 

You may think that sounded like a punishment, but it was a blessing in disguise. I studied my ass off for a year to be able to reach some form of fluency. I met amazing people along the way, and still keep in contact with them. I learned responsibility since I had nobody to lean on. I've had nights I went out and partied as well. It was a great and fun learning experience. I was experiencing a high as I was learning to really be comfortable with myself. I even worked out everyday in a gym with equipment dating back to the 70s. I was on a good roll. Then I started dating this Chinese american girl from California. I started to learn what love is and how to really treat and care for a woman. It was great and she really cared for me. China taught me so many life lessons.

When I came home I continued to work on my body and mind. I was really rooted in my Chinese background and now love my heritage. Fall semester was coming up and I was aiming to take 6 classes. I sat in the front of every class and asked way too many questions. I didn't give a fuck, my parents were paying for my education and I was going to get the most out of it. I even scored a awesome internship with Mercedes-benz. School was going great, but my Long distance relationship wasn't. California girl couldn't trust me. She was a huge motivator for me to do well in school and just be a successful person in life. I was starting to doubt and confuse myself. Our relationship went on and off till January. She finally dumped me on Dec 31st. Just one year before we had spent new years together at the bund. I fell into another low. Let me tell you guys, fuck bitches get money is nothing but the truth while in your 20s.. 


It took me a while, but I also was able to pull myself up from that situation. I probably didn't mention it before, but all of this pulling myself up or overcoming a plateau was from the help of r/Getmotivated. At the end of the fall semester, I got on the deans list. Worked 30 hours at my internship, worked 15 hours at Tesla motors, and put on 10 pounds of muscle. I slept 4-6 hours a night. I went into straight beast mode. 

Come winter, I took 2 classes and continued my strong work ethic. I ended up finishing up with Tesla motors after the holidays (winter help) and picked up another internship with a medical marketing company. When spring semester started I was now doing 40 hours between 2 internships and taking 6 classes. I never once stopped working out. I like to think that keeping healthy and fit goes beyond changing your body, it really changes your mind and keeps you on a routine. I did this for a good four months. It really put a toll on my mind, but I was still doing good in school and really learned how to manage my time. Then spring break comes and the house I was staying at had an armed robbery. I woke up at 6am to a gun to my head. They were after my housemates weed who also lived on the same floor. Waking up 6 am about to get ready for work, and I'm back at square one. (The house I lived in was such cheap rent... That I put myself in another shitty situation where I was surrounded by shit friends. I was only in the house from 10pm - 7:30am, and was too close to school for me not to give up). After that whole incident, my housemate was arrested because some girls that slept over called the cops on the robbery and he had a lot of weed apparently. He took the blame and I got the fuck out of the house immediately. If any of my roommates are reading this, I'm sorry but I'm really not. I moved to a new place the following Wednesday and have been living peacefully ever since. 

I have about 5 weeks left of school. Today is when I get to the life changing part. I was offered a job from the medical marketing internship. For me, I had never thought that working hard and pushing through all obstacles would really change my life. I just want people who are currently out there that were in my position to know, life can be changed. If something is wrong and you don't feel right about it, change. If you don't like your friends, change. If you hate your job, work harder for a new one. If you hate your body, go to the fucking gym. Life has so many ups and downs, you have the power to make changes in your life. It doesn't start with waiting on others, it starts when you go out and do the god damn thing! 

I'm sorry for the long post and I don't mind if this gets down voted. I'm not a good story teller and its something I'm working on. (Started a blog) I just want people to know that success is around the corner, you just really have to work for it. I haven't accepted the job offer because I know there's more out there than trapping myself in a life I don't want to live. I'm still young and learning, so I'm not sure about it, right now I'm focusing on making deans list again! 

Also,
Stay hungry my friends!"

Just discovered this subreddit, so awesome! It's nice to see redditors who are in the dietetics field. So I'm a junior, I'll be applying for programs pretty soon, and I'm having trouble narrowing things down. 

My ultimate goal is to get a Master's degree, so I know this is a definite must for me. I just can't decide which I should do first. I've gotten mixed opinions from those in the field, saying ""You should get your RD first, you'll be more likely to get an assistantship in grad school."" And ""Go to grad school first, you'll be more competitive for the internship!"" And then of course, there's combined, but the lovely thing about internships is that they're one year, and I could move almost ANYWHERE for just a year and if I hated it, I could go somewhere else for grad school. With a combined, I'd be stuck there for at least 2-3 years, i'm assuming. 

So I'm torn! Any further advice on to which one to do first?

1cg0cx,1,2013-04-16,What are some well-paying ACTUALLY entry-level jobs that don't require 5 years of experience?,Sir-Climhazzard,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1cg0cx/what_are_some_wellpaying_actually_entrylevel_jobs/,"Hey Reddit friends,

Just curious on your opinions on what career fields actually have some well-paying jobs that don't require you to have been an unpaid intern for the past 5 years.

I went to college for Graphic Design for 4 years, had to transfer colleges half way through so I lost some credit transfers and so I don't have the official BFA yet. I'm taking a break from school due to financial reasons and some of these job descriptions are just ridiculous.

""Entry-Level"" to me means 1-2 years of experience plus whatever you learned in college. Most of the Entry Level jobs I see on LinkedIn require 3-5 years of experience and not just ""general"" experience they want you to have very *specific* experience in that one niche they are hiring for. I realize every company wants to hire the perfect fit with minimal need for training but seriously - are there any jobs out there that understand that for a new job, there will be some things you know, and some things you will need to be trained on.

I'm applying to various job types at this point, as I can't be super picky however everything above $35K per year, from what I can see, refuses to pay for any training and expects you to know 95% of the job before you start.

I'm 24, currently making in the mid 30s however my student loans are killing my ability to save money for my future and so ideally a job at 40k+ per year would be more ideal.

Does anyone have any experience/tips/information with this?

Thank you!"

I've had an interest in DigiPen for a few years now and I'd like to attend after a graduate high school (By that time I will also have accumulated two years of college credits), and I have a few questions. 

* I see no listing on the admissions requirements saying I'll need to take a second language, is a language not required?

* I remember seeing that it's suggested that we have a portfolio of work to show when applying. I don't have any notable examples of art or game related projects to show that are recent. I have examples of some scripting projects I did at an internship and a few graphic design projects (event poster designs, logos, etc.) that might be worth showing. What sort of stuff should we really have in that portfolio, and how important is it? I've been focusing on school and working part time that I haven't undertaken any real programming or game development related projects in my free time, and it's a bit concerning.

* I'm most interested in the BSCS program. Will that degree and the things I learn through the program be applicable and accepted for other programming jobs outside of game programming? 

* I'm not currently taking any CS classes because my schedule is full with core classes at the moment, should I put more effort into making sure I take them? I have past programming experience is Lua, Perl, Visual Basic, and I've experimented with C++ and C#. 

* Have a lot of students had success finding paid internships? 

* I know there aren't any dorms, but how affordable are the apartments within driving distance (&lt;15 minutes) of campus, and what are they like? 

If anybody can help answer some of these questions or provide any other information that might be good for a potential student to know I'd really appreciate it, thanks a bunch!"
1cfy8j,1,2013-04-16,Considering becoming a therapist (advice?),[deleted],askpsychology,https://www.reddit.com/r/askpsychology/comments/1cfy8j/considering_becoming_a_therapist_advice/,"I'm going to write away, so if you want to skip, my basic question is if I should persue it and what I can expect from schooling.

Anyway, I'm in my late 20's and I'm thinking about going for it. I've made some choices in my life that lead me away from it, such as dropping out of art school and taking a fairly decent paying job that I held for many years, then lost. So, at the time, things seemed pretty happy go lucky, but now, not so much. I'm thinking of returning to school and doing it for something I know I'd enjoy.

Since I was 14, people have been saying I should be a shrink. It actually surprised my entire extended family when I chose to go to art school. And, I too, flirted with the idea. However, what I never told anyone then, was that I didn't think I could emotionally handle listening to people tell me about some traumatic experience. Well, over the years, I managed to hear plenty of traumatic stories and I realized, not only could I handle it, but I could process the information. Recently,  a friend of mine told me that he was at a party and I was brought up and apparently everyone started saying, ""He'd make a great shrink..."" Obviously, I was flattered,  but I also realized,  maybe I just should be one. People always tell me they feel comfortable telling me anything. I am very understanding and non-judgemental, which I think people can sense that, because I've had people I barely know confide in me their traumatizing life events, such as rape, molestation, brutal violence. I am warm and open, which lets people just approach me with anything, which I think is a good skill.

Also, I'm no stranger to mental illness. I've personally dealt with it, but have also dealt in depth with other people who are bipolar, borderline, schizophrenic, disassociative, and many other personality disorders, anxieties, and so on. I have never had difficulty dealing with this individuals at the worst of their symptoms.

I feel like this might be a good path, but my concerns are that the schooling won't be what I expect. I am older, fortunately not married or with children, but I do have a long term girl friend and we intend to marry. Is this too much, still? I worry too that the schooling will be... well, let's put it this way, art schools don't nurture art, they want you to be cookie cutter in your approach. Is this similar? I admit, I've hated school in the past, but I have a great knack for grasping material. I mean, what can I expect? What steps does one take? From experience, is there like a internship for shrinks? Fill me in, please."

Since then we recently have had a member of our staff leave, which I'd assume opens a lot of salary cash. I also believe that my work has greatly helped the company and in some ways made parts better. 

I live an hour from work and pay 100 for gas week and have my apartments lease up in a month and would love to move closer to work. But I cant afford to do so unless I am was salary. Now how should I go upon asking about becoming salary to my boss? or do I wait till the fall to ask and just lease somewhere for a few months which could prove difficult to find. To be honest I am completely clueless on what to do and am a little afraid to ask..

Ironically enough, I have about a 3.6 GPA but am at extremely high risk for deferral due to a C I received in a foreign language class in Fall semester of my freshman year, and the fact that I X'd out a poor grade (D+) in A100.

The Kelley advisor went over the admission statistics with me and said that no one with more than one deferral risk was admitted last semester. I have a pretty decent GPA, some impressive extra-curriculars and I'm two courses short of being ready for I-CORE. I also have submitted a letter of recommendation from one of my business professors, but I believe that it is still very plausible that I will receive a rejection. The Kelley advisor told me that it would be either an acceptance or denial; I have too many credit hours to be considered for a deferral. 

I know that the typical route is to move into SPEA, however to be blunt, I don't want to pursue a career related to public policy or environmental affairs. I'm of the belief that switching to an undesirable major because I couldn't get into Kelley is a bad idea, and I will be stuck with a major in a field that I frankly never want to enter into.

I would probably take a semester or two off, attempt to do a meaningful internship and apply to transfer to another business school. However I'm really interested in experiences others have had with being rejected from Kelley, or if you simply have any advice for my situation in particular."

I am asking because I do not have a strong source of advice within my family as none of them have been to college and the best they can offer are simple platitudes which, while appreciated, are not all that I need. 

As a brief back story to my current plight, I am the first in my immediate family to go through college. I was the typical, ""over-achieving, good kid"" growing up. I was valedictorian in high school and graduated in the top percent in my college class after choosing to go to a state school to keep my post-college debt under control. I decided to get my B.S. in Business Administration, I had a great and actually relevant internship, and I had a great capstone project experience. That's when everything went to hell.

As well all know, the economy exploded in late 2008, just months before I graduated. I came out of school and could not immediately find a job with companies tightening their financial belts. A friend of mine ended up getting me a job at a call center for a company that he was doing HR for. It beat living back home with my mother, but it was honestly a textbook case study in a horrible company for a number of reasons. Long story short, after being there for two years, I was terminated due to budget cuts and despite my most sincere efforts, I am still unemployed and it has been more than 6 months. Having been such a hard worker my entire life, this is anathema to me. 

TL;DR: I am currently considering returning to my alma mater to pursue a computer science degree (since my former peers seem to be doing just fine in their fields/STEM degrees are good/all that) beginning in the Fall semester of this year. All things being equal, I'd rather just start working as I enjoy the work my degree is in, but I can't find anything no matter how hard I try.

1cfnqs,1,2013-04-15,Questions about setting up NAS,[deleted],computertechs,https://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/1cfnqs/questions_about_setting_up_nas/,"Apologies if this is the wrong place for this question, /r/techsupport didn't seem appropriate

[Short version]

Need to set up a NAS accessible via internet. Is [this one](http://www.seagate.com/external-hard-drives/network-storage/business/business-storage-4-bay-nas/) any good and will there be any issues running it from a home using standard cable internet?

[Long Version]

So I was just asked by my dad to look into setting up some kind of ""file server"" for his business.  After asking some questions, I decided what he really wants is some kind of NAS setup.  I have plenty of experience with computers, worked in the IT department for my city for a couple years as an intern, almost have my CIS degree completed etc, etc.  But I've never really dealt with NAS before so I figured I'd ask here for some input.

Heres the situation: small business. 3 employees, all in different cities.  Its an engineering business, so the storage is for their various design files. mostly solidworks I think.  The NAS itself will be set up in the house.  I did a little searching, and found one from [seagate](http://www.seagate.com/external-hard-drives/network-storage/business/business-storage-4-bay-nas/) that looks like it would do the job just fine and its a brand name he knows and likes, so thats a plus.  

My main question is about access.  I'm assuming the actual file transfers are handled through a web interface of some kind, so that should be fine.  The only issue I can think of would be how the other employees will be able to connect to it.  Do NASs typically come with some sort of software that handles the remote connection, or am I going to have to deal with keeping the employees up to date on the current IP address? I just keep picturing it as an FTP server and having to deal phone calls asking for the current IP address. 

Like I said, I have zero experience with NAS, so any input would be appreciated.  Bonus points if anyone here has any experience with the Seagate NAS I linked.

I am considering industrial design and ultimately automotive design. I am passionate about art and everything automotive. 

However, my drawing skills are anything but exemplary. I rarely draw anything at all, but I have have always been around cameras and I feel confident in that area of art, especially when it comes to capturing the curves and design put into cars.

I have a strong desire to work in the design field. I am considering going to either my state university or perhaps a more ""general"" art institution to get better at design, build a better portfolio, and move on. I am considering School of the Art Institute of Chicago to work on my general art, and then transferring to Art Center College of Design in Pasadena to get my bachelor's degree in either Industrial or Automotive Design. 

I am also considering Cleveland Institute of Art because they have close ties with major automotive companies and students usually have a job or an internship after graduating. 

I also have an interest in computers. I know there is a high demand for programmers. I am unsure if programming makes it's way into the design world at all. I am aware that software is used to render designs and things of that nature, but I don't know if going to school for programming/design is a good idea or if it will be a struggle.

A job fair is coming up soon and I think it's pretty much my last chance to get an internship for this summer. I've been applying to internships and going to job fairs and company tech talks all semester with no luck. My resume was pretty bad, but my neighbor (a manager at a tech company, he reviews resumes and interviews people all the time) helped me fix up my resume a few weeks back.

However, in its current form (as attached above), I still haven't heard back from the few companies I applied to (when I send applications online, I usually tailor the resume and cover letter towards the specific internship). I want to fix it up as much as possible before I go to the job fair this week, so that I don't give the recruiters something they'll promptly place in the trash bin.

I really need some brutal honesty. I've revised it so many times to get it to its current form, which I think is pretty good, but I'm still not getting any responses.

This would be my first (and only) bank internship/experience and would be one of my selling points when applying to positions later down the line. The only issue is that Bank A’s internship is notoriously known for being “grunt work” which offers little experience in actual bank work. Bank B’s internship, however, is comprehensive and allows interns to work hands on with the bank’s operations.

My question is which internship would be, best knowing that I want to end up at Bank A? Should I sacrifice experience to get my foot in the door at Bank A or gain experience from Bank B and use that later on when applying to Bank A?

Anyway, I'd really like some resources. What I mean is, I've been doing the craigslist thing and going directly to publishers for entry level / internship postings. I am wary of Monster.com and the like because I feel the competition would be intense on a larger site.

I am particularly interested in editorial work, but I am not opposed to copywriting or teaching summer programs so I can at least have relevant experience on my CV afterward. I'm basically interested in beginning a career path that will take me into publishing, but I do recognize I'm on the lower rung (or at least, that's what I've come to terms with).

Any resources or ideas to help me cast a few more lines would be precious indeed."

The salary is almost double what I am making now and it's about the same distance away from my home.  I plan on sending the letter back stating that I am available but I have questions and need advice so that I can prepare, please.

When I send the letter back stating that I am available, it asks to attach a resume, do I include company x on it?  Besides my internship, the position that I currently have is probably the most relevant to the job that company y is inquiring about.  The reason I ask is because I do not want company Y to contact company X about me.

If I do include company X on my resume, how would I go about asking my boss to use as a reference?  Should I use him as a reference at all?  I do have 2 or 3 other references that I can use.

Since I am relatively new to company X, (I have not accrued time off just yet) how can I take off from work should company Y want to interview me, and without company X knowing?

So January of 2012 I started dating this dude. He was my first EVERYTHING. First relationship, sexual partner, ect. The relationship was very unhealthy. I am pretty sure he cheated on me. He would lie to me all the time and hang out with girls and go to parties without letting me know. He pressured me into a lot of drinking and drug use and sexual things I was not comfortable with. The first time we had sex we drank a lot and I smoked weed for the first time and blacked out and woke up with his penis in me. I wanted my first to be with someone I loved, blah blah blah, so I tried my best to make it work. I have daddy issues and low self esteem already so it didn't take much for me to stay with him.At the beginning of our relationship, our routine was that I would drive to his house, watch him get wasted/fucked up, we would fuck, then I would drive home after he passed out. He would tell me he loved me and he would eventually get his act together, ect. However, let me mention he was very sweet and charming and he did good things too and we did have some good times together. Anyways, fast forward to july 2012. That night we were at my house with my friends and my mom and everyone was drunk. However, my one sober friend even remembers him talking down to me. My friends afterwards told me they got so pissed that night cause of how he was talking to me. My mom said he was saying things like I was such a slut, ect. She was pissed. This went on the 3rd of july. that night when everyone was upstairs, my dude decided that he was mad at me for being drunk and didn't want to sleep with me upstairs, so he went downstairs to sleep on the couch. drunk me wants everyone to like me so i went downstairs to try to make him not to upset and just cuddle. i was starting to sober up at this point (2 or 3am... i started drinking that afternoon) and was just a little tipsy now. I laid down on the sofa beside him facing the inside of the sofa. he kind of turned over on top of me and i was stuck. He started fingering me (i was wearing clothes, they were just soffee athletic shorts) and i told him to stop but he wouldn't. then he pulled down his pants and shoved himself inside of me ( was still wearing my clothes, he just pulled my shorts to the side). I kept hitting him and telling him to stop it but i tried to stay quiet so i wouldn't wake people upstairs. I was crying and then he started having anal with me and i hurt really bad so i got hysterical then he like snapped out of whatever trance he was in and just got up and went to the bathroom. He came back and said he was so sorry and just passed out. I was freaking out. My whole family woke up that mmorning and we were supposed to go to the beach so i pretended everything was fine and that never happened. He then told MY BROTHER and all my MALE FRIENDS about the first time he and i ever had sex and even told them other sexual things about me when i wans't in earshot. I had to hear this from my friends. There was a month where I wouldn't have sex with him but I was so desperately trying to forget what happened and I convinced myself that if I stayed with him it wasn't rape it was just a relationship problem. This turned into months of depression and i started cutting myself and tried to commit suicide. I would sometimes cry after sex and he still kept trying to pressur eme into anal and i would cry and we would get into fights over it and other things. He would say I'm being emotional and crazy. My grades were slipping and I didn't want to do anything and thought I wasn't good enough to do anything. This year, 2013, I finally broke up with him. It was a messy break  up. I wrote him a letter explaining what happened on the 4th wasn't ok and how he treated me in general wasn't ok and that it was over and that i wished him the best in life and was very nice about it. A week after breaking up with him I strated talking to my now current boyfriend, M. M and I have been friends for a while (he was actually one of the guys there on the 4th... he says that he had to leave because he got so mad with how my ex dude was talking to me). Our talking quickly escalated into a happy relationship due to us already being friends. He and I have been together 3 weeks now. However, in this weird 1 month period of M and I talking, my ex dude kept contacting me. I almost went back to him. There was 3 days where I visited him every afternoon and we talked about things and even kissed and I told him I was going to quit seeing M and we were gonna get back together. However, as soon as I left, I realized thats the same thing that girls in abusive relationships do and I have to stop this. I finally broke it off completely and told him to move on. He kept calling me and texting me and coming by my house. When I was there and when I was gone. He'd come and talk to my mom and talk to her on the phone. It was almost like harasment and i keep my dorrs locked bevcause of him. He's been arrested multiple times and has a short fuse. Last week he texted me some break up song and I called and told him to quit sending me shit. He started a conversation and I was like fine, I'll be nice. He told me about how he's out everyday of the week partying and dancing with all these girls and living it up ect. and I told him about how I am maintaining a 4.0 and got the internship I wanted. He then texted me later that night saying that im a piece of shit and a waste of the year and he hopes matt cheats on me with a slut and breaks my fucking heart, ect. I HAVE NEVER CHEATED ON ANYONE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE OR ANYTHING EVEN CLOSE TO IT. I did not deserve that. He then called me 36 times and left messages saying hes sorry and he loves me. Today my boyfriend woke up to his tire being slashed. My ex knows where he lives and knows his car. My boyfriend has seriously no enemies... he is the definition of a nice guy. We both know it has to be him. There is secutiy footage at his aprtment complex but the security people says itll take a while til they can process the footage.. wtf. Anyways, he filed a police report. I am livid. I am so frustrated. I wish I could move away. I am so tired of always getting panicy when I hear a motorcycle thinking its him. I hate having to keep my fucking door locked and I am tired of having to deal with this. Idk what to do. I'm afraid that my ex is gonna break me and my boyfriend apart. I'm so lost"

About three weeks ago I received a internship offer from a very small company (Company A) for the summer. I accepted it even though the pay was relatively low and travel time of around one hour (each way) was pretty high because I was getting nervous that I will not find anything at all. Right here (cscareerquestions) I also read that March is getting late for getting internships. Furthermore, no one who I met at the career fair was calling me. Right after I accepted, I started receiving calls from people who I met at the career fair. After interviewing with Company B, I've received a offer that is double in pay. Furthermore, Company B is bigger, much closer (15 minutes), and growing quickly.  

I am wondering if it's okay to decline the offer after accepting it? And if yes, then how should I contact them and what to tell them?

TL;DR: Received offer from Company B after accepting offer from Company A. Company B is closer, bigger, pay is higher and opportunity for growth is better. I am wondering if it's okay to decline the offer after accepting it? And if yes, then how should I contact them and what to tell them?

I'm not trying to brag so I apologize in advance if it seems that way, I'm just very excited because I picked the wrong school to attend. (Went for in-state w/ scholarship over total ranking and regret it)

I had a quick question about handling an interview opportunity. I have already accepted summer internship positions with a Federal Judge and a military JAG Headquarters (both unpaid). A local and Fortune 100 local company has request an interview for their paid summer legal intern position.

I would like to attend the interview, however I don't want to burn bridges with the Federal Judge, or the JAG office. I would love a paid or unpaid position with the Fortune 100 company this fall and I would love the chance to get a job in their legal department after I graduate in December and take the February BAR.

How would you all handle the interview which would allow me to meet the staff and try to set myself up for a fall or full-time position?

I am considering having the interview and waiting to see if a summer internship offer is extended. If so, regretfully decline because of the internships I have already accepted, but ask to be considered for a fall internship position.

Alternatively, if I was to get offered a summer position with the Fortune 100 I could turn down the JAG and save 6 weeks of high living expenses, stay local which I love, and the Fortune 100 position is paid. I have already signed and returned some waivers and student standing forms and the JAG is letting me work for 6 weeks instead of the mandatory 10 weeks. Lastly, I am not even sure the Fortune 100 would let me only work 6-8 weeks since I am unable to turn down the Federal Judge.

I would love criminal law and corporate law with both of them being my strong areas.

Thanks for any suggestions!"

I hope to get an internship with Autodesk or some such firm next summer, and intend to take a computer graphics course in the coming spring semester. What background should I be building in terms of knowledge and projects if I want to break into this field as a career?

I imagine certain higher-level math topics would be very helpful, but beyond that I'm not sure what simulation and modeling engineers need. Any experiences, suggestions, or resources would be appreciated!"

one position at this company i was already rejected for (within 12 hours by email) because of my answers, but clearly people in school or jsut out of school dont meet these requirements for what i am led to believe are entry level jobs (and the fact they are interviewing undergrads sort of shows that too).

so what do you recommend? i dont want to lie and waste their time, but these online application processes AUTOMATICALLY reject you based on your answers to questions...

ive also been rejected automatically by the computer's application process for my GPA (which is only a awful 2.3 but i also worked full time majority of school, including an internship on top of working my other job). i often get told by companys, just apply online thats the only way or stuff like that. 

i tried applying for a position in canada but one of the questions was do i have a canadian drivers license, so i said no, when i submitted it, it instantly rejected me, didnt even email me.

tried applying to colorodo DOT, wouldnt even let me apply because i wasnt a colorado resident. 

I am tired of this, especially the online application process.

Shell shocked and heartbroken***

***- Story***

I'll be upfront and say I violated her trust by looking in her phone. It the first and only time I have ever done that in a decade of dating various women.

I'm 28. I have a full time job with a growing company, just got my own division, and bartend one or two nights on the weekends for extra money. I can make 500-1000 in a few nights. I workout 6 days a week and powerlift frequently. I've got a 6 pack and I can bench 375. I have a BS and have just enrolled in a one day a week MBA program to further my career. I do many things to further my development as a person, business, and my relationships. I would say I am a great catch.

She's 24, goes to school full time, and will graduate this summer. She as a part time unpaid internship in her field that will turn into a full time position in a month, and bartends on the weekends to pay bills. She is gorgeous, funny, has good values, and is extremely driven. Our sex is probably the best I've ever had. I would say she is a great catch... until today.

Our relationship started out as we were both bartenders at a venue. She was in school, and I was doing it to make cash after my previous division had shut down. We started at the same time, and  I was immediately attracted to her, and pursued. She was about 8 months out of a 4 year relationship with someone who she shared a house, dog, boat, and many bills with. They knew each other for years before that, and lived and worked together. He apparently cheated on her multiple times and was a general dick. She got tired, left, moved to our area. It took about 6 weeks for her to finally say yes to hang out with me. She said it was because she thought I was out of her league.

It was amazing. Sparks flew, lightning crashed, the waters of the seas parted. It was as if we had grown up together, the similarities were so striking.

She was reluctant to disclose our relationship, because a manager and bartender were fired for dating. I agreed, and was a bit fun to have a secret relationship at work where no one knew. We both met each other's families about a month into it, and everything was amazing. I left our venue after about 6 months because I was able to get back into my field. She still didn't tell anyone we were dating, which was a serious flag for me. She brought up marriage constantly, children, and being together. Being an attractive bartender you can guess she gets a lot of male attention. I don't give a shit about those losers, but I did state explicitly that if she wanted to hide me, she could hit the road. You cannot talk about love, marriage, and kids, and not want to let everyone know you are taken. She agree that it was wrong and hurtful and wouldn't hide me. Shit hit the fan when a male bartender there slapped her ass in front of me, and she confessed she hadn't told him we were dating [more than dating if you are talking about fucking marriage IMO.] She went to dinner with him one night for about 2 hours. She didn't tell me and I saw them come back. I told her she could have all the male friends she wanted, but that it was disrespectful to try and hide it from me. I almost broke up with her right there, but she begged me not to. From then on she had little contact with him, but I clearly knew he was interested. We would see him around at places, and he would never look me in the eye, and would stay away from us unless I wasn't near her. Then he'd go over and give her a hug and talk until I started to come back. Cockroach.

Months pass, things are good, we rarely ever fight. If we do its mainly because we are both busy and haven't seen each other. Last I had heard, she wasn't talking to him anymore because he was an asshole and was mean to her. I again said I don't care who you talk to or hang out with as long as you do it in a manner that is respectful to me and our relationship.

This morning the alarm went off at 6AM. She hopped in the shower. Her phone buzzed. For whatever reason, my groggy self looked over at her texts. It was not him, and didn't open any of them, but I saw his name about 4 spaces down. Curiosity got me and I opened it up. 

I found texts about him wanting to be with her, missing her, and why won't she talk to him. She says it's the way things have to be. I start shaking. I scroll up and find more texts about him missing her and wanting to see her, and playful flirtatious banter between them. Nothing too serious, and girls flirt with everybody. I already know this. I calm down a bit. 

***I scroll up again and see him say ""I want to smack your ass again,"" and she responds ""I'd like that."" My heart drops. Further back and another one saying ""I want to kiss you again"" and her saying ""Me too."" I am shaking with rage at this point.***

***I scroll up further and see a picture he sent her from January. It is 3 pictures of them in a photo booth, one hugging, one tongues touching, and one embraced in a deep kiss.*** 

I am fucking devastated. 15 seconds of looking at this and my whole world has shattered.

I thought about just leaving, but my rage and sadness went into overdrive. I walked into the bathroom and asked her ""Do you love me?"" She says with a smile and happiness in her voice, ""With all my soul baby!"" I reply with ""Then why the fuck is there a picture of you kissing ______ on your camera and texts message saying he wants to slap your ass again???""

She manages to get out a ""...why did you go through my ph-"" before I shut her down ""It doesn't matter, what matters is that there is a picture of you kissing a man that isn't me, and sexual text messages between you."" 

I was seriously about to rip off the shower door, and I'm sure I looked horribly angry. She is silent, and says it was just a joke, it was a work party [that I had somehow never heard of,] and that other people had taken pics kissing him. It happened once, and that was it. I say ""That's a lie, why is he saying sexual things to you, and I want to slap your ass and kiss you AGAIN?"" She says it was wrong and she shouldn't have done it, and it was a joke. I ask her why she didn't tell me, and how she would feel if I was texting someone else sexual messages and fucking kissed them and took pictures of it. She says she would be crushed, and is silent. I leave.

I left and went to the gym and work. She will not be home until 7 or 8. I sent a few texts ripping her a new one, and her maintaining it was just that once, and it was just a joke and she's sorry. I ask her if she wants to continue this relationship, she says yes. I reply that she had better show some damn respect for me and our relationship, and she'd better think long and hard about that before we talk again. There has been radio silence since that time. 

***- Questions***

I've got one foot out the door. My life is too goddamned important to me to waste time on liars and cheaters. However, I do love her [stupid me right?] 

I'm a calculated individual, everything I do has a purpose and script. I've written down everything I wanted to say, how betrayed and disrespected I feel. I have questions I want to know, and I want the truth. I am ready to accept that I will not get them. Our trust is gone. I violated hers by checking her phone, but she fucking went nuclear on our trust by hiding this, and she's probably done more. 

If she fucked him, I'm gone. If it was just an emotional affair, and some kissing somewhere, I will make an effort to move forward. I absolutely want this taken care of, and I am willing to talk extensively with her about it. If she wants out, I'll say I love you, go be happy, and I'll get the fuck out of there.

I'm just so angry, and so hurt at the same time. I do untold amounts of shit for her it's unreal. Flowers, jewelry, cook, clean, romantic getaways, vacations. I would never cheat, I turn down advances of some seriously hot tail, I don't respond to flirting texts from exes or co-workers. I have an amazing place for her to live. I've got my shit together, and am working to continue to grow and provide a life for the woman I love. I don't control her or make her answer to demands. She can go out with work or school colleagues and drink, I just ask she not drive drunk. She can not come home and stay at other people's houses, I just ask that she tell me she's ok. I just ask for respect, like I respect her. Not to be boast, but I work out 6 fucking days a week and look like a fucking greek god. What in god's name could possibly entice her about a guy that has nothing going for him [bartender, in school, DUIs, former alcoholic, Weighs 60 lbs less than me?]

This is probably so rambling, I don't know where to start. Does anyone have any advice? Remember, I have no problems dumping her immediately. I can get another one tomorrow if I so chose. I do however, love her, and want a future. But I want the truth, and I want fucking respect, just like I give to her.

I don't know if I'll the truth. If she doesn't want to give it to me, or isn't remorseful, I'll be hurt and move on.

Give me your best, and your worst. Slap some sense into me, or help me go in the right direction."

I've been on the paleo diet since August of last year. I feel amazing. I've been pretty faithful to the diet except for some frozen yogurt here and there. I'm a girl, I'm 5'4"" and weight about 115 lbs. I'm not fat by any means but I want to get ripped.

I also bike to and from work 3.2 miles each way and then 7 miles one way to my internship 2 days a week.

My diet consists of 3 eggs, and veggies (peppers, onions, squash, sometimes sweet potatoes, etc) chopped and fried in coconut oil and some black coffee or sometimes coconut milk (canned) in it. I sometimes add some bacon.

For lunch I usually have a similar meal except for either burger or chicken or some pork of sorts instead of eggs. Sometimes I'll bake a potato if I'm too lazy and have that instead of veggies.

Dinner is pretty much the same as lunch.

I work 7 days a week. I work 5 days at a coffee shop and 2 days at my internship. I do my best to get 8 hours of sleep a day but sometime that's not possible.

Anyway, I gave you as much information as I could about myself to see if you have any suggestions, tips or changes that have worked for you. I want to significantly improve my physique and cut the last bit of fat around my waist and on my abdomen.

In September I landed an internship, but it was really through a government program aimed at helping people who they feel are 'at risk' (minorities, poor) gain a few months experience after graduation. After my 3 month internship (where I learned very little, I was essentially sent to a backroom and told to 'have fun' with the terrible access DB) the location I was working asked me to stay on for another 4 months - I did, but at this point it was strictly an administrative job. Throughout all this I applied to as many jobs as possible, with no luck.

Eventually last month (right before the end of my 4 month contract) I landed another internship for a strictly development job, but it was unpaid. Being my only other option, I took it. I have been working at this location for nearly a month, and while it is strictly a development position - this is not an internship by any stretch of the imagination. I am essentially free labour - there are no senior devs or juniors for that matter, only other interns. Many of those interns are still in school, and I am the only full time intern at this location - they essentially have thrown every IT related task my way, and while sometimes they have been challenging, I don't really feel like this location is in any way a professional environment nor do I have any opportunity to learn from other professionals (like I would expect in a real internship). I don't plan on being here much longer.

That being my current predicament, I am continuing my search but am finding more of the same - unpaid internships from places that I can't justifiably even call 'startups' where I would be free labour for 3 months, or junior positions that look for 3+ years experience with a whole host of technologies. The few jobs that seem to meet my bracket (recent grad, little experience) are most likely flooded by many applications, and I don't feel like my extremely ethnic name is doing me any favours.

I spend about 2-3 hours a day on average studying - usually watching videos and doing online tutorials. I also recently started up a github account where I added some old projects I've worked on, and am planning on starting as many new projects in my spare time as possible.

My current skillset of languages and technologies that I feel I have an intermediate level of skill in:
C#, Javascript/jQuery, HTML/CSS, SQL
A variety of DB platforms
A couple of CMS

Things I am learning or things that I should be an 'intermediate' in soon:
Ruby, PHP, Sass, Ajax (particularly with JSON)

Things I have experience with, on varying levels:
C++, Java, MVC frameworks, XML, android development, LAMP/WAMP solutions

I'm going to continue to study as much as I can, and really feeling comfortable with Ajax and PHP are my near-term goals, along with filling my github profile with a lot of small projects. Other than that though, I am not sure how to make myself more attractive to employers, and I feel like applying to 5 or so job postings a day isn't really getting me anywhere. What advice can anyone give me? If you need more information please ask, I'd be happy to provide some."

I really love this place and hate that I'm leaving in May. At this organization I have been with they currently don't have any open positions and do not have the grant funding to take on another employee even part time. They said they would gladly be a reference for me. It's something /shrug. 

I do have a temp position with a photography company starting in May after my internship. However this pays only $10/hour, is 21 miles away so gas will be an issue, I have to go through construction on the high way, and it's in a big city with little to no parking. I'll do this as a last resort, but I really would like to find something closer to home. I'll even take something for less pay if it means I don't have to sit in rush hour traffic for 1 hour to and from and I won't be paying all my money earned toward gas and taxes... 

Ideally I would like to work with youth as I would like to be an LPC one day. However most positions working in social work want a masters.  

So for right now I have been trying to find office assistant positions (as I have some office experience from my internship managing files.) Even if I can be an office assistant for a non-profit that works with youth, that would really make my day.  

Long story short, I've updated numerous times and sent out my resume to many places around where I live, yet have yet to get any bites. I've opened a Monster account but all I get are fishy ""you-employ-yourself"" or telemarketing companies calling me. I've even resorted to Craigslist and can't even get anything there. Getting really discouraged here...

I have no clue how to list any achievements on my resume because I'm not the type that necessarily stands out or makes any ground-breaking decisions in a job. I just do my work. I mostly have experience from temporary jobs from early on in college as I wanted to get school done first. Am I just that unemployable because it looks like I ""job hop""?

My last internship was with a social agency, which allowed me to develop skills in social media analysis learning how to extract insights from social data. 

With this experience in hand, combined with the dearth of entry-level planning opportunities, I've currently about to interview for a social media analyst position, which, while sounding interesting, is still not quite strategic planning. One concern that I have in regards to the role, is that at my current internship, I saw that most of the work done by analysts was post-campaign analysis and reporting, with not much strategy from their insights. As someone with a primarily qualitative research background, the quantitative aspect is also slightly intimidating.

My question is whether steering my career in this direction would be likely to eventually help me align it with planning as opposed to say, an account exec role in an agency or a gig in market research? Also if any people here that are currently social analysts, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the role.

21 year old student, about to finish up my last year in college at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts with a degree in Environmental Science and concentration in Geology. I have been thinking a lot in the past few weeks about moving out of the country once I graduate. This week's bombings have flicked a switch in my brain- maybe I really do need to get out of here...

I have read that many of the countries I have listed are very particular about who they give visas to and that they only take workers with specialized skills.

My specialized skill: I have been working with GIS (Geographic Information Systems) for the past year, both in school and as an intern for the city of Boston. I hope to continue to get better at this niche skillset and am wondering if I will have a better chance of finding work overseas if I pursue a Masters degree abroad.

I have tried looking for job postings and internship opportunities with no real success... I just don't know where to look! Germany and the Nordic Countries simply fascinate me and I am drawn to their culture, way of living, and outlooks. I am anxious to get over there and submerge myself completely.

Some more questions:

* If I were to apply to a job, would I have to secure it and THEN apply for a visa?

* Does securing a position with a company ease the visa process?

* What are some good resources that I can begin to study before I graduate in a year?

* Would pursuing a Master's degree in a different country help me getting a job / work visa in that country during / after I have finished?

* What are some good websites to find jobs / internships in Nordic countries?"

I recently (May 2012) graduated from a state school in Texas with a B.S. in computer science. Literally the day after graduation I was called up by a friend who desperately needed techs for a large EMR rollout at a local hospital. I took the job and worked from May to January on this project, quickly being given the responsibility of ""managing"" a small group of guys for hardware/software setup and deployment. My pay started at $12/hr then bumped up to $14 after 2 months. I stayed with this contracting company and in January the systems admin for a contract they hold at a doctors office quit. They desperately needed an admin to fill the spot, they sent me to interview with the Dr.s office and the next day I was onsite as the admin, thrown to the wolves. I've had to learn on the fly and taken on waaay more responsibility (obviously).

The Dr.s office has two locations, 14 doctors, ~100 users, 8 windows servers, one of which is their mission critical EMR SQL database. I'm in charge of being sure all things network, server, client related works. Server updates, db updates, backups, email, new users, blah blah, your typical admin. I also commute 1hr each way for this job now.

So the kicker: I was given a raise to $15/hr to take this job. This seems pretty low to me? I'm in East Texas, Tyler area. 

The doctors office LOVES me (they hated the old admin, he sat on projects and was ""lazy"") I work my ass off at this place and feel underpaid. Am I wrong to think this? I've been here 3+ months, too soon for raise discussions?

I've desperately looked for programming jobs closer to home (Tyler, TX), but they are few and far between, plus I made the mistake of gaining no practical programming experience (internship) while in college. I'm currently working on small personal programming projects to boost my resume...

Sorry for the long winded post, what do r/sysadmin?

EDIT: In my 3 months here I've tackled 3 major projects that the old admin neglected: 
1. Setup and installed a guest wireless network, isolated from work network using VLANs. Old admin couldn't figure this out I was told.
2. Removed old 3Com networking equipment and replaced with new HP equipment.
3. Installed completely new phone system (setup voice VLANs and QoS)"

- Enrolled in an Engineering curriculum
- 2.5GPA or better

This is a paid position, and we've had very good luck with UH students because many of them choose to stay on with us part-time during the school year 10-15 hours a week.

It started with a shitload of work to do. It got to the point where I had so much to do that I didn't want to start on any of it (which isn't uncommon).

I'm in a relationship, and my SO is being an asshat. It's only been about a month, but I miss my ex. My current SO has a very important job and works a lot (plus he's moving), so he can't always talk/text all the time but usually once a day. It will be 3 days this evening, but he's on FB all the time and does not talk to me. I find out a couple of days ago that the friend that is visiting him is female, and was his best friend in college. And he didn't think to mention that. Last time we saw each other it had been 2.5 weeks since we had the last time, and it will be 2.5 weeks again until I see him because of schedules. Oh, did I mention last time that he chose to sleep instead of sex? He did. I don't want to go into too much detail about him because it could be a post in and of itself. I've talked to him about it, and he says he'll work on it, but I'm not seeing it. I'm trying to be patient (which is *very* hard for me), but both my patience and understanding are wearing thin.

Then comes the work. I am a researcher, and my advisor has decided that I will stop collecting data on my current project after this semester. No big deal. But my next project (my thesis) is at a stand-still, and there's nothing I can do. I applied to about a dozen summer internships and have gotten rejections from all of them except one, which I am unlikely to get. What's really awful is that I *know* I am good at what I do, and I've been at an internship before and done very well. I was almost positive that one of them in particular would fit, but I received that rejection yesterday.

So, combining all of this: I have way too much to do and no motivation, no plans for the summer, I'm in debt, and my boyfriend is an ass right now. I'm trying to reach out to friends, but they're all busy. TwoX, it's been a while since I've posted, but you ladies have never let me down.

I could use some love.

'divider', looking it all over for the bar code so she could scan it.

'Hmmm, I don't know. Do you have an alarm, too?' I asked.
'No, just this remote thingy,' she answered,
handing it and the car keys to me. As I
took the key and manually unlocked the door, I
replied, 'Why don't you drive over there and
check about the batteries. It's a long walk....'

She was 23-24 years old, her name is Elena (but her sister kept calling her Ella). She told me during our long conversation she goes to the University of Arizona and is a Business major. She was about 5'9"" with heels. I asked did she watch March Madness basketball - she laughed and said no I don't really follow the cardinals (i guess she meant Wildcats)  She was caramel skinned and brunette and I think she told me she was a Spanish-German-Filipino mixed heritage. I told her she looked like an almost exact replica/doppleganger to a girl I knew from high school.

She told me her family was from New York. She has a pair of angel wings tattoos visible from her shoulders down. I asked her what will she do in the summer and she said she hoped to get an internship back in New York before she graduates (I assume in august?)

Unfortunately she told me she doesn't have facebook and the email she left me was in fact incomplete (university email) and I have got a bounce back. She did jokingly say next time you're in New York - give me a buzz and we can have that dinner. So there it is - I know statistically the odds are very slim (i've reposted in the U of Ariz subreddit) but I am a little curious and perhaps a little smitten.

As you're an intern, and you'll be working with people who remember how grueling it is, we'll be keeping your hours and time spent with us to a reasonable pace of 4 hours for 4 days a week. With only one of those days spent on campus - the rest of the time providing you have an internet connection and computer capable of running some tools you can work remotely. If you wish to work from the campus that is fine - we're just wanting to ensure the best we can for your needs.

So the bad news is that it's unpaid, for all of us so far, but the good news is our venture has found its first round of investment to allow us big boy servers and to actually redevelop our site into something usable. The even better news is that if we can gain traction we have various interested parties who are looking to invest further.

That's where you come in - we need your help to grow. We need you to help us maintain our small existing community and to help it blossom into something much more.
As this is going to be my team I'm also going to want to teach you so you can walk away from this if need be and straight into a job if things go south. A lot of places expect you to do grunt work and just chew through some admin work until your time is up and they churn you out but I'm looking to form the foundation of a strong team. 

I want to be able to give you a task and have complete faith that not only will it be done but you'll make it your own. Because I'll be trusting you with more than just posting images but representing a company that's gathering some serious attention. I’ll be there to hold your hand but I’d like to have someone we can see fly with this.

Job Details: 

**Position:** Social Media/Marketing Intern

**Starting date:** 29/04/2013

**Renumeration:** Travel Costs/Lunch

**Responsibilities:** You'll be responsible for social media engagement, monitoring, moderation, and outreach. You will be taught how to use various CRM tools and how to seek influencers and communicate with affiliates in a tone that belies our company mission...one which is essentially to cater to a generation with the attention span that does not exist. Our demographic is the 16-25 crowd and they’re part of the right now generation.

You'll also be learning various marketing techniques and as such we'll discuss areas you can work on developing if you have an interest in doing so. We've various big names mentoring us and have an established and experienced team on this project who are already known experts in their fields.

You’re not going to be told to go get likes or other useless metrics - but shown how to engage with people and how to build relationships. 

**Requirements:** It's a given that you need to be driven but if we're going to trust you to work remotely we also need you to have enthusiasm and be contactable. I need to work with people I can rely on. You need to understand social media beyond the point of ""Getting it"". You need to be interested in it. Whether it's Twitter, Facebook, or G+. Why? Because you're going to be taught how to use these as a tool beyond liking your Mom's photos of the cat and telling the world how hungover you are.

I don’t expect you to have a degree in English but I do expect you to be grammatically sound for when it counts. 

**Location:** Shoreditch, Google Campus


So if you're interested - hit up daniel@planetivy.com and ask me some questions. I'll have plenty for you so let us make it an even trade off. If you have a CV please send it through but if not write up a cover letter about yourself.

Some people have even described the company as 'cool'. On the other side of the spectrum, The Sourcery is one of the worst companies for internships. First off, they can't even spell sorcery correctly. We have also heard that they use dark magic. This corrupts the interns and leads to a decrease in productivity unseen since the Great Depression.

So I'm looking to move to the Richmond area this summer, I'm a Seattle WA resident. I'll hopefully be starting school in the spring up in DC, however I have a place to live in RVA and I'm looking for work right now at least until the spring. 

I work as an EMT in an emergency room now for 5 years, and I've worked as a firefighter for 2 years while I was in college. I've also worked for the State of Washington doing Search and Rescue, some disaster planning and search management. At this point, a job outside the hospital might be a refreshing break, but, I'm open to anything. 

Anything helps! I won't have to worry about housing, but, definitely would want an internship/job/etc to get settled into the area. 

Thank you guys!

I am left with the question: how do you go about finding a piercer?

I am trying to find a decently priced piercing shop with a good reputation, but have no idea on how to go about this. Are there any sites for these things? or does anyone here have a place they would highly recommend in the Denver area or greater Colorado?

**2,466** readers for **2 months!**

The Butthole. The *BUTTHOLE*. I have seen it, and it’s fucking terrible.

Now, I cannot explain in words what the Butthole looks like, because I’ll just sound insane. I didn’t have a camera with me at the time, so I couldn’t take a picture of it or my expression as I was seeing it. Believe me, it is horrible, I hope you never see it.

I am now one of the people on /r/WeHaveSeenTheButthole, we’ve all seen a absolutely horrid figure that we hope you will never see in your LIFE. Unfortunately, many people have seen it twice, some thrice, maybe even fourice, if that’s even a word. Could someone from /r/Logophilia help me out on that one?

It seems that you seeing the Butthole is inevitable, since so many people have seen it already. I mean come on, [Spongebob’s seen it](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view2/4609030/spongebob-sees-the-butthole-o.gif), [Bert’s seen it](http://i.imgur.com/AgsGW.gif), and even [Pinkie Pie](http://i.imgur.com/IPngP0L.gif). It’s spreading, and it’s spreading fast.

The Butthole just posted pictures of itself recently, but it quickly deleted them. *That's* how we all came to see it, after those unfortunate people who've seen it before us. I pray for you guys. I really fucking do. Like, getting-on-my-knees-with-a-gun-and-knife-pointed-to-my-head-threatning-to-kill-myself-until-you-realize-I-care-for-you kinda prayer. 

Some people think that the Butthole is a “he” or a “she”, but I can assure you, that it’s neither of those things, it’s not an animal, human, or anything that is logical in the universe, that’s all I can say without sounding crazy. Now, it’s time to talk to the first person to see the Butthole, /u/CTRL_ALT_RAPE.

&gt;##1. Why did you create /r/WeHaveSeenTheButthole?
&gt;&gt; **/u/CTRL_ALT_RAPE** It all started [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/16yg3y/speeding_ticket/c80nfjo) as a joke, I wasn't even expecting any subscibers.

&gt;##2. What’s your favourite post on this subreddit?
&gt;&gt; **CTRL_ALT_RAPE** My favourite was [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/WeHaveSeenTheButthole/comments/1a3hdu/mrw_i_have_to_click_on_the_butthole_link_for_the/), having a reddit admin post here made my day.

&gt;##3. Have you seen the Butthole?
&gt;&gt; **CTRL_ALT_RAPE** Too many times.

&gt;##4. On the topic of buttholes, give or receive?
&gt;&gt; **CTRL_ALT_RAPE** Neither.

&gt;##5. Anything to say to your subscribers?
&gt;&gt; **CTRL_ALT_RAPE** If you haven't seen the Butthole as of yet, still subscribe, it will only make your inevitable first time more special.

There you have it, you now have a new creature to do your research on, maybe suggest it to your teacher so the whole class has to do an exam on it with pictures and shit. Teachers love dem pictures. Well, this has been your intern KangaDude873 (PKA Kanga), and farewell."

I'm white, 5'8, healthy weight, brown hair, brown eyes. Your pic gets mine.

My hobbies include writing, crafting (like knitting!), and listening to podcasts (mostly NPR). The music I listen to is super mellow and indie/folk-like. I like boring food, but I am not a boring person. I love telling stories about my life and learning about other peoples' experiences. I value introspection and commitment to personal growth. I do not smoke anything and I have no desire to. I'm interested in exploring bars/local restaurants and going to storyslams and shows and free concerts and doing other wonderful Chicago-y things while I'm here (but no clubbing. I'm miserable at dancing slash that's not really my scene anyway).

I'm coming into this with an open mind, but finding some sort of romance or meaningful connection would be nice. This means I'm not looking for blatant hookups. Sorry. The closer in age to me, the better (but like I said, open mind!).

If you're interested, send me a PM with some info about yourself. If you don't know what to write, then tell me a story about something interesting that happened to you in the past week or something. Hope to hear from you soon!"
1ciknf,1,2013-04-17,I'm not sure what I'm feeling and I think I need help,toomuchtimeonthis,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ciknf/im_not_sure_what_im_feeling_and_i_think_i_need/,"Hey everyone, this is the first thing I've ever posted on reddit, but I figured it's about time I share this with people and maybe get some helpful insights. I'll start off by saying I'm not sure I'm depressed, because, outside of the basic definition, I'm not really sure what depression is. Here's what I do know: I am always worried. Always. Mostly about the future, sometimes about myself, sometimes about my mom who is still dealing with the death of my father three years ago, and sometimes about my brother, who is separated from all his friends and knows no one his own age anymore. I am also a sophomore in college, and I am constantly worried about school, internships, and getting a job after graduation. These are obviously normal things to be worried about, but I feel like they take up a disproportionate amount of my thoughts. 

Also, I have a tendency to think of myself as lesser, and whenever I think of myself as better than anyone I immediately feel bad about it. It's like I have a need to feel like I am worse than everyone else. I am also overweight (not obese but still noticeably chubby), and every day i tell myself I'm going to change and every day I end up overeating and then hating myself for it. It's like I have zero control over myself. I also spend a lot of time in bed, laying down watching TV or sleeping. I tend to think of myself as just lazy, but maybe that has some sort of relevance as well?

Also, I'm not sure if this is just a common thing for everyone, but I seem to go out of my way to make myself feel sad. I purposefully seek out depressing things and read/watch/listen to them, and I don't know why. This has been true since my dad died. Sometimes I'll still talk to him at night when I'm alone, pretending that he's listening. I should add in I have never had thoughts of suicide, and there are days where I can be totally happy most of the time. But there are days where I just feel really down, where i don't want to talk to anyone, and where I just stay in my room. I guess the days of happiness are what confuse me when it comes to whether I am depressed or not.

Lastly and perhaps most importantly, is that I am gay. I am still in the closet with literally everyone I know, and I don't know when I'll be able to come out. It's not that I don't accept myself, because I do. I have no problems with being gay, and I have accepted that I cannot change myself (I used to be convinced I could get over it, but I grew up and know that I can't now). I guess the reason I don't want to come out is that I'm scared of losing people. I'm sure I'd be surprised by the number of people who are accepting of it, but for some reason I can't get over that psychological hump. I'm scared and it makes me simultaneously feel better and feel worse by putting off for the future. My mom is conservative, but I think she has evolved to the point where she would still accept me. On the other hand, she has told my brother and I to our faces that she would prefer we not be gay. I'm scared to come out, but I'm also scared of the psychological toll staying in the closet is having on me. 

I don't know if anyone can help with this or offer any helpful tips, but, for whatever reason, I suddenly felt like i needed to get this out. I really don't mean to trivialize depression if I'm really just overreacting here, and I hope I don't offend anyone. I just thought maybe some people here could help. Thanks "

I think that if we can get about 100 people who want a chance to skate at the home of the greatest team ever alive, we would all have a great time.

I'm sure that amongst 4,178 of us, at least 100 of us would be willing to put about $56.5 each towards this event. If we can genuinely get the support to accomplish this, we could represent Leafs nation in the best way possible. Show people that the ACC is not solely run by corporations, that true fans are out there and are more than willing to spend time at the ACC.

&gt;Thank you for your inquiry with Air Canada Centre. We’d be more than working with you to help this dream come true.

&gt;Attached you will find our Ice Rental Package that will provide a more comprehensive guide into booking an event with us.

&gt;As this year draws to a close for our regular season, we unfortunately will not have ice in for rental until next season. Our private events are usually confirmed 4-6 weeks out from the event date – Please hold on to this information and reach out to Janis Holohan in August. At that time she will have a better understanding of the NHL and NBA schedules for the 2014 season, and will be able to tell you a more appropriate time slot to get you into the building.

1) When it comes to high level languages, I want to learn through a project.

I'm sure you all have. But today I had a new and rather demoralizing experience.

I'm an undergraduate intern in a university lab and one of my tasks is to weigh out very small samples using a micro balance. The micro balance I'm using is nicer than the ones I've used before and has a fancy double-sliding case that surrounds the balance. The problem is, the case only opens on the right side. That means I have to load the samples (held by tweezers) using my right hand. I am okay using my right hand for most tasks but I just didn't have the fine motor skills. I spilled a few samples and dropped the standard used to calibrate the balance (an absolute no-no). I felt useless and clumsy. I was close to just walking out of the lab because of the mistakes I had made.

So I guess my question to y'all is, are there any lefty researchers out there that have any advice regarding standard lab equipment? I want the experience of working in a lab, but I don't want to jeopardize the research just because I can't use the equipment.

I don't really post a lot but I don't know what to do and needed some advice. So here it is. 

I have been with my boyfriend for a little over a year. And he is absolutely great. He is a great boyfriend and even greater friend. The relationship we have is great. The problems I think are with me. 

Lately I have been becoming really insecure about myself. I am in college and I still have doubts about what I want to do. My parents are going through a nasty divorce with my two younger sisters caught in between. So there's that. But all of a sudden I just am second guessing everything, especially when it comes to my relationship. I have been living with my bf for 6 months now and I'm afraid one day he will want me to move back to my place. I wonder if he will ever get bored with me because of the fact that we live together. I constantly worry about what my bf thinks of me. Lately I have been a little moody/short with him but I don't want to turn into a bitch of a gf because he deserves way better. I don't have a lot of confidence in myself. All of my friends are getting internships and starting some good jobs and I still have no clue what I want to do. I want to do so much for my bf to show him I love him but money is tight. He really does deserve the best. And I don't want him to leave because I could have been a better gf. 

I feel like a mess on the inside. And I don't know how to sort through all of these feelings. I don't know how to stop being so hard on myself and insecure about my relationship and myself. :/

TL;DR: I am feeling insecure about myself and I am afraid that insecurity will drive my bf of a year out of my life. I don't know how to stop being insecure.

I recently graduated with an ME degree from a decent school. Unfortunately, my GPA is not that great (slightly above 2.5). There are many reasons for this (had to work two campus jobs to afford it, stayed very involved in extracurriculars, etc.), but at the end of the day it's my fault and something I have to own up to in an interview. I have a decent resume with skills and two internships, and I don't include my GPA. I don't get many interviews, and the two people I *have* been on the phone with pretty much stopped me at my GPA.


Technically my degree did not include a concentration, though I did enjoy/pursue design and manufacturing (both of my internships were in that field, and in the three related classes that I took I have all A's/4.0).  When applying for these type of jobs, would it make sense to include on my resume ""Major Concentration GPA: 4.0"" or ""Design/Manufacturing GPA: 4.0"", or will that be too jarring when they hear what my overall GPA is? I feel like 3 classes may not be enough to justify a re-categorization, and that the disparity between that and my overall GPA is too large.


Anyways, any advice/opinions? Before it's suggested, other categories such as ""Major GPA"" and ""Upper Level GPA"" are still sub-3.0... I know it was a failure on my part, but any feedback is appreciated!"

I'm however taking a break from the architectural career, and decided to pursue one in the graphic arts. *

So I landed a job at a golf cart accessories manufacturer as an in-house ""graphic designer,"" paying 12/hr, 40 hrs/week which is certainly enough to live on for now, but I also want to save up to go back to grad school in a few years. I enjoy creating the content for my job, as its a new venue for me and provides continuously new challenges; but after going through school and working at a couple other internships where things were more flexible, I find the 9-5 schedule really limiting and stifling. Also the people I work for are not of the design mind camp in the slightest, the owner who started it all never even graduated high school and got his education the hard way through perseverance and sweat. While they seem to like the work I produce, especially the instruction sets - which I modelled after Ikea-style, but adding in some techniques I picked up for line drawings in architecture - they are unwilling to budge on allowing a more flexible schedule. Specifically, I get really burnt out after 4 - 5 hours of continuous drawing production, and my previous workflow would consist of 2 - 3 hours of work, followed by 30 minutes - 1 hour of ""reset."" usually consisting of a walk, mindless doodling, or the good standby of funny stupid stuff on reddit. They keep getting on to me for ""not being productive"" and ""wasting time""(they monitor computer usage and have cameras about the warehouse) and are completely unwavering on schedule(I must show up at 8:00 and leave at 4:30, which especially sucks if I hit a creative stride where I would normally work untill 8-9pm.) I'm producing work faster than they can give it to me, but they still act like i'm lazy when i'm not being constantly ""productive."" I've tried suggesting moving me to salary instead of hourly, giving me a key so I can come and go as I please, but they have this idea of what an employee should be and aren't willing to change. The straw thats really breaking my back is last week they ""had a talk"" with me about my work ethics, which we cleared things up and I've since tried to fit into their model of an employee, but that same day they re-posted the craigslist ad I replied to. (this was late in the week and I didn't notice till the weekend) when I asked them about it a few days later, they said ""oh, we posted that before we had that talk with you because we weren't certain you were really interested in this position, and forgot about taking it down."" Its been 2 days since they said that and the ad is still up, which really makes me feel unvalued/that I might lose my job at any moment.

Thats a link to a few images from an instruction set and some ads i've created while there.

If you go check out http://golfcart.com/downloads.htm ,(thats not who I work for, BTW, i've tried to hide that because i'm still employed) you'll see pdfs of instructions sets that are very typical of the industry as a whole, and can see what I had to work with/ how much I've improved them.

I know who their main competitors are and that those competitors are backed by big investor companies, who I feel like would be more than happy to not only pay me more, but also pay me on contract so I could work on my own schedule. But I'm also just assuming that and I don't really have any experiences, and I'm afraid that plan could backfire on me as well(legally/morally.)

So redditors, I ask you. Am I just in feeling as I do? should I seek out other employment? is there some angle that I'm not looking at this at? any words of advice/encouragement would be greatly appreciated.

I'm trying to scout out a subletter for my room from early/mid-May to mid-July.  Move-in date could probably be flexible (and pro-rated), but I have finals until the 9th so I need a few days to get my shit together.  Then I'm moving to Baltimore for the summer for an internship, so I'll definitely be out by the end of that weekend.

Two of my roommates will also be looking for subletters so if you want to come as a group, that'd be cool too.

A little about the house:

It's old and has tons of charm, at Diamond and Gratz! It's three stories and a full basement with a ton of storage. Full laundry room, free (not coin operated) use of washer, dryer, and utility sink and a little back yard with a grill. Other roommates that aren't subletting are 2 ladies, but we've lived with dudes before so it wouldn't particularly matter.

Room will be unfurnished, but has three awesome closets including one walk-in. I can leave a bookshelf or two if you need them. It is the biggest room in the house located on the 3rd floor and will fit even up to a King sized bed. You'd be sharing the abnormally spacious bathroom with one other (very considerate) person.  If you're a guy and prefer not to share a bathroom with a girl we can work that out- there are two bathrooms on the 2nd floor so we can switch it up.

Rent is $480/month plus utilities (maybe around $60-70). Rent (and utilities) would be prorated for May and July-- rent being roughly $240 each for May and July and utilities dependent on the bill. I would prefer a security deposit of $240 but wouldn't cash that check unless there was a problem.

I can get you some pictures if you want to see it, or feel free to come by for a visit and check it out.  And let me know if you have any questions at all or want to figure out move-in dates."

I try to follow up on the jobs I applied for, but I am finding it extremely difficult to obtain the proper contact 
information. 

EDIT: I would just like to thank everyone for their input. I will start attending engineering events and posting my resume on job search sites and see how those work out."

I'm not yet 21, so the bar scene probably isn't right for me, but I like science, art, music, caffeine, and books.

I'm looking for things I could walk to in 20 minutes or so from campus, or other things accessible by public transit.

I'm posting this for my reddit lurker boyfriend, who is looking for a place to stay during his summer internship. He is working in midtown manhattan, so there must be convenient public transport there. 

Approximate dates are June 1 - August 15/22. 

Budget is around $800/mo, but this is a little flexible. 

Must be a private room furnished with at least a bed and a desk. 

No preferences for number of roommates, gender, etc...

He's laid back &amp; respectful and would help keep communal areas clean. He'd be working a lot, but in his free time, he likes video games and sports among other things (Game of Thrones! Food! Movies/TV!). Also, I may visit from Boston once or twice (for a weekend), so I would be staying with him.  

Let me know if you think he's a good fit for your place or if you'd like to know more! Also, advice for finding a place would be great. :D

Cheers."

1cmph0,0,2013-04-18,Why does this keep happening to me?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1cmph0/why_does_this_keep_happening_to_me/,"Been fired from 5 jobs in the last 2 years under really strange circumstances that take me totally by surprise and seem more like bullshit than reality. I am never late for work (usually arrive 15 mins early to get coffee and stuff and work past when everyone else is gone), always dress professionally (shirt and tie, khakis, leather shoes).


**Job 1:** Worked for the company for 8 years. A new supervisor became my boss and within 3 months I was fired for ""falsifying records."" His actions were illegally discriminatory and I ended up suing and getting a settlement from the company.


**Job 2:** Was working on a help desk for 5 months total. Before they even hired me they told me they thought I'd have a lot to learn about servers but wanted to give me a chance. Throughout the entire time I was there the boss would micromanage me daily and required me to account for every minute I was at the office in a ticketing system which captured work time real time. Any time not on a ticket was to be entered in the system as ""lost time."" One day boss calls me into his office and says ""Sorry, I gotta let you go, it's not working out."" When I asked why I was told that he was getting too many complaints from customers. When I asked for specific examples he couldn't think of any. I had never heard about one customer complaint the entire time I worked there.


**Job 3:** First day of work I was told to access a certain custom made Access database and update information in it based on conversations I had with people on the phone.   Later that day I'm told that I corrupted the whole database by not having the correct settings in Access. NO ONE told me about any such settings, and as a matter of fact I followed a step-by-step guide to a tee on how to set Access up before doing any work.  I was fired the next day.


**Job 4:** I did an unpaid internship with the county as a degree requirement.  I followed my supervisor around, kept my mouth shut and took notes. By the end of the first day the supervisor told me she didn't know if she'd have enough hours for me to fulfill the requirements of this position and told me I should try to look for another opportunity. The next day she made a rude comment about my heritage and by the end of the week she called my faculty advisor at the school and made up insane lies about me which she used to justify my firing and which caused the school to kick me out of the degree program so I couldn't graduate with that degree and had to change majors.


**Job 5:** After I graduated I started to work as a software developer. Third day of work boss gave me a bug to fix.  Nailed it in half a day and the team told me how impressed they were.  Forth day boss gave me a really old, unstandardized set of code to work on. Apparently all the developers thought it was such a PITA that no one had touched it in 5 years. With less than a 30 minute explanation as to what the code was all about my boss sent me back to my desk to work on it.  The next day I continued on it then was sent offsite for training for 2 days.  When I came back my workstation had been replaced and all my settings, software, etc where gone. I spent most of the day setting all that stuff back up and didn't get much work done.  When I came back in on Monday my boss wanted to talk with me.  He reviewed my code and pointed out my errors. Then he told me that my skills didn't match watch he needed from a developer and fired me.


**TL;DR: My question is, where am I going wrong?  Does it seem like I could do something better or is this stuff really as insane as I think?**"
1cmp77,2,2013-04-18,Having some issues regarding our landlord. Any advice is appreciated (California),toOsOUpy,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1cmp77/having_some_issues_regarding_our_landlord_any/,"Myself and a friend are currently subleasing an apartment. We only have one week on the sublease left but have been having some disagreements throughout our stay and I just want to know where we stand. I do not necessarily want to take any legal action, but again, any info on who is in the right / wrong would be much appreciated.

I could go into great detail about these issues in the comments if needed but I figured I would get to the point to start with. We have had issues with our landlord entered our apartment without notice, with very little notice, and sometimes notice weeks in advance and without a reminder. He has gotten upset over the cleanliness of the apartment (we clean the apartment once a week and he still has found things to get upset over) and has said that we must from now on keep the apartment to his specifications at all times in order to show the apartment when he wants to. He is also very condescending and has made several remarks about having to live paycheck to paycheck despite us being in college and only working paid internships while paying rent on time every month as well as tuition.

**Lastly, and most concerning**, is that we have just found out that the apartment complex he is renting from does not allow sublets. He listed his apartment online, had us sign a lease, and entered into a business agreement and did not mention this to us at all. He hasn't notified his neighbors or the leasing office and does this on a regular basis. He has even gone so far as to say do not get mail or packages delivered to avoid suspicion / ""unwanted questions""  What does this mean for our lease and our position as his ""tenets"" right now? Is he exempt from following the lease we signed? are we exempt? What would happen if we brought this to the attention of the leasing office? Should we?

Again we only have one week left and just want to be done with this guy. Being in college I am not about to get anything that would possibly result in a huge loss in money but I'd like to get some sort of opinion just in case.

Thanks so much!

**TLDR** - Signed a sublease with a guy whose apartment complex does not allow subleases and has also broken his own lease several times."
1cmp0i,3,2013-04-18,I'm about to give up and end it all. Please help me random internet strangers. (X-post from r/jobs),[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1cmp0i/im_about_to_give_up_and_end_it_all_please_help_me/,"Before 2010, I was a confident, outgoing, and charming guy with the potential to change the world. I was in college had just gotten back from a year abroad and was aiming for graduate school. I considered my life to be an extraordinary success.

In October of 2009, the first friend I had ever made decided to take his life. He had just recently gotten back from overseas, a member of the Armed Services. He took his life publicly in front of some of our friends in the back of a movie theater. I remained strong. It motivated me to go to the gym, it motivated me to study, and it moved me forward.

In winter of 2009, my father started to make some strange financial decisions. First he bought a new couch and new television set which I really thought nothing of. It wasn’t until the holidays that I realized something was very strange. He bought a new tractor for the family farm, and he bought me a Four-Wheeler for the holidays. I never wanted one, and was aiming to move abroad full time – which he knew. My mom and I began to ponder what was going on. Right after the holidays he began sitting on the couch more than usual. He starting saying he was in pain, unbearable pain. He then stopped going to work. One day, he fell on the floor and tried to crawl outside for a cigarette. It was the most demeaning and embarrassing moments of my life, seeing my father in such dire need of a cigarette. My mother and I ran to try to help him up. My mom happens to be a physical therapist and noticed my father’s spine just wasn't sitting right. She told me to go back to upstairs and to go back to bed, she then called the ambulance.

The next morning, I woke up and received a call from my mom. ""Come to the hospital, your father slipped a disk in his spine - will have to have surgery.""

The next couple of weeks were very dramatic. My dad was in the hospital recovering from falling and preparing for surgery. They discovered he had a degenerative bone cancer found in mainly African-American men, which is highly unusual because my family is Caucasian.

The surgery was very long and then afterword he hooked to a machine for what felt like an eternal march into Hell. After two days in the Intensive Care Unit and my mom and I were approached by a close family friend, a clergy member, and several nurses. They told us to go outside and that it was time to have a conversation. They told to us to think about making a decision on his life.

It was the hardest moment of my life to date. Mom and I both cried and hugged each other and knew the right thing for our family was to let him go if it came to it.

In February 2010, while my dad was still in the hospital, I met a girl on campus. Things were beginning to look hopeless except she somehow managed to light up the world. We had a quick conversation, but never moved much beyond that.

My dad had made it through his surgery. He came out of the ICU and then struggled for months at the hospital. During this time I was taking well over 20 credits in the hopes I could graduate on time. Surprisingly during that stressful time, I had the highest GPA during that semester than any other. I would show up at the hospital every day and do my homework and study while holding his hand, smiling, hoping he would wake up. It was very dramatic, but I continued on.

Later in the spring of 2010, the girl I had mentioned earlier happened to run into me again, and I asked her on a date. Romance bloomed. However, hospital drama was putting a damper on my spirits and I quickly found I was not the only one who needed support. She did too. She was a graduate student from the Caribbean who moved to the US for college, and decided to stay for graduate school. She left everyone she knew, both friends and family, to come to my sleepy town of Muncie for a graduate program that no longer exists. We fell in love because we needed each other. Some would call it fate. She helped and motivated me to apply for an MBA, something I had dreamt of doing for several years.

While my dad was in the hospital, college began creating many hurdles to jump through in order to graduate. By this time, it was fall 2010 and I was not able to transfer any study abroad credits because they came from a college, my college did not recognize, one in Israel. The college did not recognize my four semester’s worth of Hebrew and insisted I take two additional semesters of Spanish to fulfill my language requirements. Then I was discouraged from writing a thesis and found out at the last minute that I would need an internship in order to graduate. I was given no help to navigate the bureaucracy. That is something I did on my own. As a political science major I began applying to every policy and government internship program I could, embassies in Chicago to government relations at the University. Everybody I applied to or interviewed with turned me away.

During fall 2010, my dad was now home from the hospital but still had to go to chemo therapy and physical therapy. I would take him to his appointments, and then quickly run to class while he was in therapy. It was a 30 minute drive in both directions. One day after driving my dad home, and coming back to school I noticed a poster for an internship at Republican Party HQ.

I did not put any though into it. I reached out and grabbed all the posters and ripped them off the walls. I made sure no one else knew of the opening. I interviewed for the position even though it was over an hour's drive away. I did not see this as a challenge, but rather an opportunity to graduate.

My father was counting on me to graduate before he passed away. My father started viewing my graduation as his goal. It inspired and motivated him knowing if he worked hard the doctors would give him permission to be at my graduation, nothing could stand in his way. So he started fighting therapy and doctors more than ever. I would become the first in my family to graduate college. I knew I could not let him down. And there she was the kind, gentle voice in my ear from the Caribbean. She gave me rest and she supported me. She helped me realize the potential of an internship. She became a supportive whisper like a gentle breeze in a sleepy field.

I decided to do the internship, even though it was over an hour away from home. I drove through snow and ice, wind and rain, fires and sunshine to make it there three days a week. I was needed so they asked me to stay for four days a week. I ended up working the full week. It may have been a political internship but fortunately I wasn’t doing policy work, I was doing administrative work. I assume the biggest reason they wanted me to stay longer and longer, is that they were teaching me skills and I was picking up things and beginning to teach myself basic graphic design and was making event flyers, brochures, and they even published a directory that I had made for them.

And then, one late winter morning in 2011, I was coming back from the internship. I wasn't used to walking in such nice business shoes. I slipped on the ice walking from the car to the front door; there was no traction on the shoe. I had broken my wrist. It got worse before it got better, a month went by before my parents and my girlfriend realized I was in real pain. I had asked her to be my girlfriend officially over the summer of 2010. She had become my backbone, while I gave mine to my father who had lost his.

My hand was officially broken. They did a scope on my wrist and found nothing except some torn cartilage. It still hurts today, several years on. I had a cast on for several months. I talked to a doctor who told me I needed to get a second opinion. I asked him how logical he thought it was that an uninsured 24 year old could actually afford a second medical opinion.

To top it all off my dad was informed he would have to go through a bone marrow transplant. My mom was forced to make a decision to be with my dad back yet again in the hospital or with her son now at a surgery center. The pain she went through is still with her.
I started applying for real jobs and graduate schools in early 2011. I got lucky and was accepted into a MBA program that was an accelerated one year program at a good school. The jobs I applied for in 2011 all rejected me. The graduate program accepted me right before I was going to make a decision from a personally set deadline between schools, the military, and working.

After the internship was over, I graduated. My dad made it less than several weeks after a major surgery. The doctors had no hope he would make it, yet he prevailed. He climbed nearly 100 stairs with a walker determined not to miss my graduation. For the first time in history though, graduation was always outdoors – that year they had to move the whole ceremony indoors because of rain. This ruined my girlfriend’s day because of scheduling. With the original schedule she would graduate in the morning and I in the afternoon, with the rain schedule we would graduate at the same time. I was the only person she knew at graduation, and I had to walk in a different room. She walked alone, by herself. No one clapped for her. She boldly grabbed her degree and quickly came to find me. I was happy my dad had made it, but crushed my school did not handle that well.

For graduation I went to visit my girlfriend’s parents in the Caribbean. Without her knowledge, I had ulterior motives I asked for their permission to marry her. This was more difficult than you think we come from very different backgrounds from faith to race to creed. It wasn't easy but I had convinced them. I proposed soon after. We moved in together in a different city and I got my MBA. She worked as a security guard, a mortgage processor, and a secretary, which were all temporary work and internships. Hiring manager to this day still believe she moved around too much, yet we remind them temporary work pays the bills for only a limited time – and then you have to find new work. If someone hired her she would stay and so would I.

Then in fall 2011 I lost a friend to the Indiana State Fair Stage Collapse, some of my peers from high school were much closer to her. I have a reason to mourn her passing; she was who I asked to go to senior prom with specifically because I knew she wasn’t interested in going with anyone from our school and it would take the relationship pressure off me. That is another story, but has added to my struggles.

 My MBA was not easy. It was accelerated and I had to learn accounting, finance, all while competing with peers who had studied and worked in it for years. I fought hard. We would also do consulting projects with each semester. The workload was intense enough, that I would complain to my wife that 24 hour days were too short to complete the work.

2012 came and I got married in a beautiful ceremony. We had both been applying for jobs, internships, and opportunities since early 2010 when my dad was first in the hospital, yet still had heard nothing. We got married very soon after I graduated. We didn't spend much on the wedding, we refused to take out any loans for the wedding, and I had saved enough money to take her on a honeymoon that lasted for several weeks. Getting married was its own challenge. Synagogues, Churches, and Secular places were all charging exorbitant fees and strict religious guidelines, and many made us feel hurt for being in love. We had always believed when people wanted to wed it was something to celebrate not to discourage. We overcame the obstacle however. I digress.

We thought at least one of us would have gotten job after we got back from our honeymoon the fall of 2012. We had to make a hard decision and move in with my parents. It took a while but I finally found a paid internship and we moved out in December. Now here we are going on our fourth year, and yet somehow my dad is still alive, my wife and I are still together, and neither of us has yet to find a job.
I'm growing sick and tired of pretending I can work hard to get one on my own. I’ve gone to networking events, I’ve called companies, I’ve gone door to door, and we apply online daily. I am being told I'm over qualified and inexperienced or that I'm under qualified and over experienced, and sometimes that they'll help find a job and they never follow through. And I strongly believe it is our Federal Congress who has the biggest role in causing my inability to get a job. And it’s because of two very different laws:

Obamacare - has a become a barrier to entry because small companies and business owners are now telling me they are too scared to hire me because they do not know if they will be able to afford to pay for a new employees.

Citizens United - has allowed corporations to skirt paying taxes, meaning that the Government has no more ability to pay to hire on new staff.

I’ve just got one last thing to say and it’s specifically addressed to all legislators Federal &amp; State - watch your back. My generation is headed to the ballot. We are watching you. And we can see that You have created No New Jobs.

I'm applying for an internship position at a small newspaper, and I am currently working on my cover letter. I was hoping to get a little guidance for the information I should include.

Of course, I'm including my college experience. However, besides that, I am fairly limited in any real world (paid) experience. I am trying to illustrate my big ambition for journalism and writing. I was wondering if there were any editors or journalists who could lend me some advice. 

Should I include some of my favorite authors and the books I've read? Should I address my limited experience and present it as an opportunity to learn, or should I only focus on my strengths as an applicant? I have written hundreds of pages of poetry - are they appropriate examples of writing experience? It doesn't seem that poetry has any value in the journalist world, but it is material.

Lastly, the editor has asked me to present two writing samples. One piece I am going to send is a 20 page report on bike lanes that I wrote for my last writing class. Incredibly boring subject, I know, but I did well on it, and I'm going to rewrite it to make it more entertaining. Other than that, I am curious as to what I should send. Would it be poor etiquette to write a mock report based on a fabricated news story? Or should I send a short story that I have already written? 

There's a ton of questions here, I know. If you have any advice to offer on any or all of them, I will be deeply grateful!

Thanks!"

It inspired and motivated him knowing if he worked hard the doctors would give him permission to be at my graduation, nothing could stand in his way. So he started fighting therapy and doctors more than ever. I would become the first in my family to graduate college. I knew I could not let him down. And there she was the kind, gentle voice in my ear from the Caribbean. She gave me rest and she supported me. She helped me realize the potential of an internship. She became a supportive whisper like a gentle breeze in a sleepy field.

I decided to do the internship, even though it was over an hour away from home. I drove through snow and ice, wind and rain, fires and sunshine to make it there three days a week. I was needed so they asked me to stay for four days a week. I ended up working the full week. It may have been a political internship but fortunately I wasn’t doing policy work, I was doing administrative work. I assume the biggest reason they wanted me to stay longer and longer, is that they were teaching me skills and I was picking up things and beginning to teach myself basic graphic design and was making event flyers, brochures, and they even published a directory that I had made for them.

And then, one late winter morning in 2011, I was coming back from the internship. I wasn't used to walking in such nice business shoes. I slipped on the ice walking from the car to the front door; there was no traction on the shoe. I had broken my wrist. It got worse before it got better, a month went by before my parents and my girlfriend realized I was in real pain. I had asked her to be my girlfriend officially over the summer of 2010. She had become my backbone, while I gave mine to my father who had lost his.

My hand was officially broken. They did a scope on my wrist and found nothing except some torn cartilage. It still hurts today, several years on. I had a cast on for several months. I talked to a doctor who told me I needed to get a second opinion. I asked him how logical he thought it was that an uninsured 24 year old could actually afford a second medical opinion.

To top it all off my dad was informed he would have to go through a bone marrow transplant. My mom was forced to make a decision to be with my dad back yet again in the hospital or with her son now at a surgery center. The pain she went through is still with her.

I started applying for real jobs and graduate schools in early 2011. I got lucky and was accepted into a MBA program that was an accelerated one year program at a good school. The jobs I applied for in 2011 all rejected me. The graduate program accepted me right before I was going to make a decision from a personally set deadline between schools, the military, and working.

After the internship was over, I graduated. My dad made it less than several weeks after a major surgery. The doctors had no hope he would make it, yet he prevailed. He climbed nearly 100 stairs with a walker determined not to miss my graduation. For the first time in history though, graduation was always outdoors – that year they had to move the whole ceremony indoors because of rain. This ruined my girlfriend’s day because of scheduling. With the original schedule she would graduate in the morning and I in the afternoon, with the rain schedule we would graduate at the same time. I was the only person she knew at graduation, and I had to walk in a different room. She walked alone, by herself. No one clapped for her. She boldly grabbed her degree and quickly came to find me. I was happy my dad had made it, but crushed my school did not handle that well.

For graduation I went to visit my girlfriend’s parents in the Caribbean. Without her knowledge, I had ulterior motives I asked for their permission to marry her. This was more difficult than you think we come from very different backgrounds from faith to race to creed. It wasn't easy but I had convinced them. I proposed soon after.
We moved in together in a different city and I got my MBA. She worked as a security guard, a mortgage processor, and a secretary, which were all temporary work and internships. Hiring manager to this day still believe she moved around too much, yet we remind them temporary work pays the bills for only a limited time – and then you have to find new work. If someone hired her she would stay and so would I.

Then in fall 2011 I lost a friend to the Indiana State Fair Stage Collapse, some of my peers from high school were much closer to her. I have a reason to mourn her passing; she was who I asked to go to senior prom with specifically because I knew she wasn’t interested in going with anyone from our school and it would take the relationship pressure off me. That is another story, but has added to my struggles.
My MBA was not easy. It was accelerated and I had to learn accounting, finance, all while competing with peers who had studied and worked in it for years. I fought hard. We would also do consulting projects with each semester. The workload was intense enough, that I would complain to my wife that 24 hour days were too short to complete the work.

2012 came and I got married in a beautiful ceremony. We had both been applying for jobs, internships, and opportunities since early 2010 when my dad was first in the hospital, yet still had heard nothing. We got married very soon after I graduated. We didn't spend much on the wedding, we refused to take out any loans for the wedding, and I had saved enough money to take her on a honeymoon that lasted for several weeks. Getting married was its own challenge. Synagogues, Churches, and Secular places were all charging exorbitant fees and strict religious guidelines, and many made us feel hurt for being in love. We had always believed when people wanted to wed it was something to celebrate not to discourage. We overcame the obstacle however. I digress.

We thought at least one of us would have gotten job after we got back from our honeymoon the fall of 2012. We had to make a hard decision and move in with my parents. It took a while but I finally found a paid internship and we moved out in December.
Now here we are going on our fourth year, and yet somehow my dad is still alive, my wife and I are still together, and neither of us has yet to find a job.

I'm growing sick and tired of pretending I can work hard to get one on my own. I’ve gone to networking events, I’ve called companies, I’ve gone door to door, and we apply online daily. I am being told I'm over qualified and inexperienced or that I'm under qualified and over experienced, and sometimes that they'll help find a job and they never follow through. And I strongly believe it is our Federal Congress who has the biggest role in causing my inability to get a job. And it’s because of two very different laws:

Obamacare - has a become a barrier to entry because small companies and business owners are now telling me they are too scared to hire me because they do not know if they will be able to afford to pay for a new employees.

Citizens United - has allowed corporations to skirt paying taxes, meaning that the Government has no more ability to pay to hire on new staff.

I’ve just got one last thing to say and it’s specifically addressed to all legislators Federal &amp; State - watch your back. My generation is headed to the ballot. We are watching you. And we can see that You have created No New Jobs.

I'm probably going to fail out again for the third time. i dont think i can do this. i dont even want a job programming doing computer science. i hated working at the internship i had. everyday i came home and was too exhausted and depressed to do anything except sleep and go to work again. the idea of doing that every day 50 weeks a year for the rest of my life makes me just want to kill myself. i have no idea what i could do instead though.  i only came to college because i was told i would never amount to anything if i didnt go. i have been seriously depressed since even before my dad died, i havent gone a day in the last 3 years without suicidal thoughts.  i probably have add but cant afford to go to someone for help.  i have no insurance, 35k in debt that i racked up taking loans out for school that i am getting 5+ calls a day from debt collectors. i have been un employeed leaching off my friends and family for the last year and a half. i wish i wasnt such a coward.  im too afraid to get help yet too scared to actually go through with killing myself. so imstead i spend every day being miserable telling myself that i just need to toughen up, get more discipline and i can overcome anyproblem on my own. but that is a lie and i know it. ive not asked for help explicitly because i dont even know what to say. everytime i try i chicken out and smile and laugh and say it was nothing and not to worry about it or me.

i wish i was never born.

last week i went to the free clinic at my school and saw a doctor about the pain in my groin that i have had for the last month and was diagnosed with a hernia.  the surgery is going to cost over 5k, they said might be up to 12k.  so now i have to beg and borrow money from my family to see doctors and get the surgery to fix it. i dont feel like i am worth fixing. i dont want to be a burden to those around me. i would rather just not exist anymore. i know my mon / brother will loan me all the money i need but I'm already so in debt i feel so worthless asking them for it. there is no way im going to be able to pay them back in a reasonable amount of time.

i told my gf very angrily one time that i would be better off dead in a ditch somewhere, and that nobody would even care. she got very upset naturally. but even i know that isnt true when i think logically about it, but its how i felt at the time i said it. 

the sadness comes and goes, and when it goes away i simply revert back to my, if i just had more discipline i can overcome anything mode which puts me in a mindset that im overreacting and dont need to get help. 

one of my greatest fears about asking for help with depression or add is that any medicine they give me will change who i am.  i had friends who got add medicine, and became visablly addicted to it. they were constantly inceasing his dosage because he was gaining a resistance to it.  but, he managed to graduate and now has a job where i am stuck in this shit hole of a city pouring my life down the drain.

i am extremely hypocritical.  i say i am afraid of rotting away at some office job, yet all i can do is think about killing myself.  no matter what problem i run into  think, oh that doesnt matter because before that happens ill just kill myself then wont have to deal with it. 

i am 26, have been stuck trying to get my 4 year degree in computer science for almost 8 years now.   im so sick and tired of this. i just want to be done and out of here already, then maybe i wont be so sad all the time. but despite everything i skip class, dont do the homework, fail at studying, fail at homework. fail at group projects. i havent gone a single semester in school without alot failing every class. i was an A student in highschool, but now i cant even manage a C most of the time.

i dont know what to do. if i pass all my classes this semester ill have 2 more semesters left. and if i fail even 1 class it will be 3 semesters, but that doesnt matter because i probably wont pass any and ill be kicked out again.

how the fuck am i supposed to pay back my loans on minimum wage. i feel as if i was tricked into going to college, but at the same time dont see any other options. you either have a college degree or end up making less than 30k a year. so my only option is to go more into debt on the slight chance i wont fuck evrything up and somehow make it out of here alive with a degree.

I'm fat, lazy,  ugly,  and every time i try to lose weight or become more active, or just try to have a hobby,or even just fucking show up for class, it  goes good for the first bit,  but soon enough without fail i always fuck it up.  give up. you useless worthless piece of shit. just kill yourself already.

***Well let me get to what spawned this post***

I interviewed for one internship and found out I didn't get the job yesterday, which was fine, no big. Then today I got a call from a different company asking for an interview (I was fucking pumped, perfect timing), their second sentence: ""You haven't gotten a DUI have you?"" whoops denied an interview with them.

I am never late for work (usually arrive 15 mins early to get coffee and stuff and work past when everyone else is gone), always dress professionally (shirt and tie, khakis, leather shoes).

**Job 1:** Worked for the company for 8 years. A new supervisor became my boss and within 3 months I was fired for ""falsifying records."" His actions were illegally discriminatory and I ended up suing and getting a settlement from the company.

**Job 2:** Was working on a help desk for 5 months total. Before they even hired me they told me they thought I'd have a lot to learn about servers but wanted to give me a chance. Throughout the entire time I was there the boss would micromanage me daily and required me to account for every minute I was at the office in a ticketing system which captured work time real time. Any time not on a ticket was to be entered in the system as ""lost time."" One day boss calls me into his office and says ""Sorry, I gotta let you go, it's not working out."" When I asked why I was told that he was getting too many complaints from customers. When I asked for specific examples he couldn't think of any. I had never heard about one customer complaint the entire time I worked there.

**Job 3:** First day of work I was told to access a certain custom made Access database and update information in it based on conversations I had with people on the phone.   Later that day I'm told that I corrupted the whole database by not having the correct settings in Access. NO ONE told me about any such settings, and as a matter of fact I followed a step-by-step guide to a tee on how to set Access up before doing any work.  I was fired the next day.

**Job 4:** I did an unpaid internship with the county as a degree requirement.  I followed my supervisor around, kept my mouth shut and took notes. By the end of the first day the supervisor told me she didn't know if she'd have enough hours for me to fulfill the requirements of this position and told me I should try to look for another opportunity. The next day she made a rude comment about my heritage and by the end of the week she called my faculty advisor at the school and made up insane lies about me which she used to justify my firing and which caused the school to kick me out of the degree program so I couldn't graduate with that degree and had to change majors.

**Job 5:** After I graduated I started to work as a software developer. Third day of work boss gave me a bug to fix.  Nailed it in half a day and the team told me how impressed they were.  Forth day boss gave me a really old, unstandardized set of code to work on. Apparently all the developers thought it was such a PITA that no one had touched it in 5 years. With less than a 30 minute explanation as to what the code was all about my boss sent me back to my desk to work on it.  The next day I continued on it then was sent offsite for training for 2 days.  When I came back my workstation had been replaced and all my settings, software, etc where gone. I spent most of the day setting all that stuff back up and didn't get much work done.  When I came back in on Monday my boss wanted to talk with me.  He reviewed my code and pointed out my errors. Then he told me that my skills didn't match watch he needed from a developer and fired me.

**TL;DR: My question is, where am I going wrong?  Does it seem like I could do something better or is this stuff really as insane as I think?**"

Below is my response (which is a bit of a novel).  

I'm depressed to be from the same state as her, and that I did once vote for her when I was a dumbass 18yr old.
___________

Senator Feinstein:

I appreciate the time you had your interns take in order to send me your form letter further explaining your position against responsible gun ownership and the Second Amendment.  I am especially grateful that my Senate acted prudently, upholding the fundamental rights established at the creation of our amazing and wonderful nation, rather than act on fear and disproven false-statistics that has been pandered by the anti-gun lobby.  I understand your frustration being defeated twice now, however I would implore that you consider that your opinions may not reflect the opinions of your constituents, which as you may recall, you were elected to serve.

I, too, am heartbroken over the recent and historical violent tragedies that have shook our nation.  Shootings and gun-related crime is abhorrent, and definitely one of the problems that our society faces.  However, I disagree with your solution path: regulating and banning weapons.  I believe our disagreement is inherent in the belief I hold that guns and weapons are not the issue, rather, the issue has deeper roots within our society, by which mental health, improper or non-existant training, vilainizing guns, and a lack of enforcement of established regulations have exacerbated.

It has been repeatedly studied and concluded that areas with increased gun ownership have some of the least instances of violent crime.  Contrasted with such areas like Chicago and Washington D.C., after implementing extremely restrictive gun laws and regulations have seen violent crime increase.  In fact, FBI data shows that since 1990, while estimated gun ownership in the U.S. has risen, the rates of violent crime has decreased overall.  Recently a survey of our police and officers of the peace indicated that these members, who serve on the very front lines of violent crimes, do not feel that banning assault style weapons, or further regulating guns reduces gun violence.  In fact, an overwhelming majority of respondents indicated it would make the situation worse.

In the most strongest way I can, I urge you to reconsider your position and perhaps focus on the issues behind the guns which cause these despicable acts, and tragic events, rather than take away rights of the citizens.  And while I may have voted for you in the past, if you continue to vote to take gun rights away from responsible citizens, I will do everything in my power, including donating heavily to your opposition, to see that you are not elected again.

Thank you for your time (both for the intern reading this, and perhaps Senator Feinstein if this comes across your desk)!

Would taking this job boost my chances of getting in to that school? If I lived there for the year prior to beginning an MD, would I get residency or at least preference over OOS?

I'd say the weakest part of my application is volunteering and clinical experience. Would it be better to focus on these things over the next year or should I go for a new challenging research position at my dream school?

If i didn't take the job, I'd continue working in a lab at Penn State, get some first author publications, take anatomy and physiology at the uni to prepare for med school (i've never had these before), and beef up my volunteering (i have hospice patient care/companionship set up to begin this summer, and I'm looking into volunteering at a low income clinic in the area- looks promising).

Thanks for you input in advance, Every bit of advice helps!!"

**A bit about me**
   I am going to be honest right from the beginning. I have made some bad decisions earlier in my life and have pretty much pissed everything away. Currently, I am 23 years old with only one semester completed in college. I am not currently enrolled, but am striving on getting back in this summer or the upcoming year. I have some major gaps in my employment history from either working under the table at a different company for more pay, which was a mistake, and nursing my sick mother. The employment history I have is full of your run-of-the-mill retail/sales positions. The only positive I can imagine is that I have been top sales a few different times between my jobs. I was fired from my first job when I was a 16 for refusing to complete a task. I know my resume will look terrible with all these holes in my schooling and employment. However, I am determined to climb out of this hole that I have dug myself into and strive to make it in Finance/Accounting. 
   Even though I have no true idea of the steps I am supposed to take from here, I have been diligently researching away. I have come up with options that I would love feedback on. I would also greatly appreciate to hear any additional ideas you may have. The time for sitting on my ass and feeling sorry for myself is over. As I read from a business article a Reddit posted last night, I must, ""Own my mistake and move on."" 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Options that I have thought of: [For breaking into Finance and making myself, as a whole, more employable]**
   
   1) Join Linked-In and begin networking! I hear this is a great tool. I wish I had learned about this sooner. My girlfriend has a great finance job at a Fortune 500, so I assume that will be an invaluable contact.

   2) Sign up for FAFSA. If my grades at the end of my sophomore year are sufficient, my father has agreed to cover any additional cost after that.

   3) Start working toward a CB from AIPB.org to make myself more marketable in the finance world. Hopefully it will help me land a job in the finance industry to gain much needed experience. 

   4) Apply for paid/unpaid internships. This, I believe, will give me decent experience in the industry while also making my past mistakes seem less relevant. If I am not able to be given an internship while out of school, I am willing to pay for a college course right now so I could start interning sooner. Also, it would be an option to wait until my FAFSA application goes through and start interning when I am fully enrolled.

   5) Seek professional help to clean up my resume and find suggestions of more helpful things to add.

   6) Find suitable references and/or get in contact with old ones. I wish I realized sooner the importance of keeping work relationships even after employment has ended

   7) Grab all the certifications I can. I hear they are a joke, but at the same time look decent on a resume. It will not put me on par with the candidates with flawless records, however, I could use any help I can get at this point.
   
   8) Perfect my skills in Excel, and start learning similar applications that are used in the industry.

   9) Clean up my Facebook, as well as delete old social media profiles, to promote a better image of myself

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

I would be very grateful if you could contribute any ideas or expound on the ones I have already mentioned.

Have an awesome day everyone! Thanks!!!"

I am going to be a junior and I am a Mechanical Engineering major. I retracted my application from UCF (which I got in) because I know 0 people there, the school is really large and intimidating, and I can see myself more in the relaxed atmosphere of FAU. I guess my question to you all is, what is the ME program like? Good? Bad? How will it stack up against other schools (besides UF and FSU)? Do they offer good internship programs or are students sort of left on their own to search? Just general questions about the ME program. I'm calling the department today to look for a TA'ing or tutoring job, but I feel like when I (and I will) ask these questions they might not be as truthful and blunt as a student who goes there. Thank you!"

I have an offer from a company to come to Berlin after completing a short internship period and work for them full-time. I want the job. It's something I want to do. BUT I have a really comfortable job (that I hate) here in the US. I don't know anything about Berlin, and I don't know how expensive it is to live there - plus my wife would obviously come with me. The salary is about 30k in euro, roughly $39k.

The interviewer said that Berlin is much cheaper to live than any big US city, and cheaper than a lot of European cities as well. Estimate for nice apartments in the city center were around 3-500eur. Plus, I wouldn't have/need a car. That said, I want input from unbiased internet strangers who I trust to tell me the truth. HELP!

It's not an opportunity that would come around often, and I don't have much holding me back, but the internship would be very low pay for a couple months compared to what I make now, and I know very little about Berlin."

[Cost scaling isn’t linear, but making it nine times larger seems likely to make it cost at least five times as much and take at least twice as long, which looks harmful to getting to the goal.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85t61v?context=5)|The tube-capsule had some serious issues. First of all the parachutes had to be placed aft, divided in several chambers always being a huge risk for entanglement during deployment. Also, we really wanted to have the kind of safety system which is provided by the LES. There are other reasons as well, but those were the main causes for the change.  There is no doubt that we could reach our goal much faster if we kept the old design, but we felt it was the right way to go, even though it might end up costing us 10+ years. Keep in mind we love the R&amp;D in this as much (or even more) than the final flight. So, we dont mind adding year to this phase... Thanks for being an inspiration to us!
[When will you dock with ISS?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85qh99?context=5)|If we cant get the reentry systems to work we might just dock to ISS and claim our right to be saved by other nations by the UN Outer Space Treaty..
[That's... hopefully a joke?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85s1ro?context=5)|Yes... but hey.. it might work.. still a joke..
[1\) What kind of grassroots support have you gotten from locals in Denmark and neighboring parts of Europe?  2\) I will likely be visiting friends in Berlin in a few months. If I can, I'd like to make a short visit to Copenhagen and write an article for my blog and repost it on some space non-profit sites here in the US. Would that be possible?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85rnkq?context=5)|1) In Denmark we have a support group called Copenhagen Suborbitals Support. It has about 800 members all paying app 20 euros/month. This is fantastic. They also help out with a lot of technical stuff like live streaming. Besides that there a lot of private people donating in Denmark and around the world in general. I think app 4000 people have donated so far. 2)If you email me I am sure we can find a date for this!
[Aside from money money money, what can we (your fans and admirers\) do to help you achieve your goals?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85qln7?context=5)|Thanks for being a fan, I you are.. Biggest help is to spread the word. Next best thing is to donate if possible. But the mental support is the most important.. I also believe that if we have enough ""fans"" no one can stop this project, even if it becomes mixed up in future legal issue :)
[Do you have any kind of rough estimate as to how much it would cost me to go? Also, is the goal suborbital only, or further distances planned depending on interest/success? Edit. I've been up too long..forgot to say thanks for the thread. So thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85pyfl?context=5)|This is a non profit mission. Launching ourselves into space. Not paying tourist. This way we get around most legal issues. Suborbital missions is a good sound way to start. Its like crawling before you walk. When we succeed doing this we may go to orbital.. 
[It took the US ten years from launching a monkey to returning it alive. How do you motivate yourself (and others\) for what looks like an extremely long-term project? To be more specific: Most entrepreneurs achieve their goals through a healthy dose of reality distortion in the form of unrealistic optimism, which might not be optimal if you are trying to safely launch a human being into space. How do you manage your (and the public's\) expectations about the likelihood of success?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85r8z1?context=5)|We might spend 15 years for a 15 minutes ride. But the ride itself is not as important as the actual work on a daily basis. The development time is fantastic and I feel lucky that I am doing something which is learning me new stuff everyday. Its a very special feeling and the reward you get. Also, I believe you must give yourself a very very difficult task to solve. By doing so you are forced to learn and forced to go new places as a person, a group or a society. If you do something easy you dont learn anything and the result is not really interesting because you didnt learn anything new. Rememeber.. the more people who believes it cannot be done or it is crazy, the better. Because it tells you that you are working something new which might change the world a little bit...
[Thanks for doing this! In the future, would you like to see other people and groups try to emulate what you're doing? Could DIY spaceflight become a 'normal' thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85qdyo?context=5)|I really hope so.. If there should be some kind of ""legacy"" from our work I would like it to be a change in perspective on how we see human spaceflight. Not only for big companies and governments..
[Open source manual: introduction to space travel for beginners?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85qmcs?context=5)|I hope.. We try to show as much info as possible.. My blog ""rocketshop"" on wired.. our webpage www.copenhagensuborbitals.com etc.. if you dig, you probably find the info you are looking for on how to do this..
[What drove you to want to do this?  Is this something that you've wanted to do for a long time?  Do you have a explicit interest in astrophysics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85qizo?context=5)|I love space. I love going from idea to sketch to building machines and hardware. I met the right person (my co-founder) Peter Madsen who also wanted to do this project so it made sense to do this.  I love science in general. Math, physics etc. I demand to give myself difficult challenges everyday and this project is perfect that way..
[Peter Madsen is an amazing guy. So inspirational and passionate about what he does. Talking rockets with him in Amsterdam over beers was my highlight of last year. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85rxbb?context=5)|I know. Yes, Peter is a fantastic co-partner in this project!!
[Besides solving the issue with the capsule door, are there any benefits to having the seat in the capsule upright? From my very limited knowledge of space capsules, I believe that most capsules have the passenger lying on their back to help prevent blood draining into the lower body. Even though this can be avoided using a pressure suit, do you have any thoughts on this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85qou1?context=5)|You follow the project I can tell :) There are alot of things working better with an upright seat. Regarding acceleration (g-loads) you have to look at the numbers. We will max have 10g running the LES engine, during a failed launch, or during splashdown. Its not a problem in this kind of seat in these short time frames.. I refer to the NASA MSIS manual (google)
[Who do you think with be the first to Mars? A Government or Private company?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85qv7t?context=5)|I have no doubt that SpaceX will set foot on Mars. It is one of their plans and these guys rock! I am a big fan and they mean business. But you never know if the chinese suddenly go bananas and leave for mars soon..
[The Chinese will not be leaving for Mars anytime soon*, feel free to go for the gold.  ^* ^they've ^done ^the ^whole ^manned ^spaceflight ^thing ^which ^quite ^unsubtly ^screams ^""our ^ICBMs ^are ^the ^real ^deal"", ^no ^need ^for ^them ^to ^blow ^their ^budgets ^on ^a ^Mars ^Shot.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c861gou?context=5)|We will leave that to spaceX then.. :)
[Sorry for being late to the party but I've still got a handful of questions if you've got the time to deal with them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c86bd28?context=5)|I dont think we would ever test orbital flights with animals. There is no point in doing so. When Iran launched a monkey it was a political statement saying that they can keep a complex being alive in space but it doesnt make sense related to science. The very early flights with animals such as dogs and monkey, in the 60ies, made sense because we had no understanding of survival in space. Now we know so much more.
[You've hinted before that you'd like to go orbital, one day.  This is what's kept me extremely interested in the future prospects of your group.  Clearly we are speaking of a far off time, but what would you say needs to happen first for this to be possible?  Would you consider X amount of suborbital flights to be a requirement before moving ahead?  Would you eventually test your orbital craft with live animals or would a live human suffice?  Would funding present an insurmountable obstacle for designing a booster large enough and for the SM/coms/nav?  Do you expect difficulties from governments beginning to take too much interest at this point?  Any ideas for a heatshield?  Cork?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c86bd28?context=5)|As stated earlier you never know if CS decides to go from sub- to orbital once suborbital missions have been accomplished. That leap will make sense but I truly believe it will take another 5-10+ years.  I dont think there will be much change in government involvement if we go orbital. If we get into trouble on these matters it will happen already in the suborbital phase. Some people tell me that this project will be stopped when we show a real capability of going 100+ km. But I dont. Lets try and see what happens :)
[Hi there. I run a website (shameless plug for everyone else: www.astronomyaggregator.com \) and I've asked a couple of questions of you in the past when it comes to the whole CS project via twitter.  Theres a bunch of questions that I'd love to ask you about the TM65 engine and your plans for the next generation engine, since I run the site as a hobby while my day job is a mechanical engineering student.  Is there any chance I can publish those answers on my site as an article? Do you folks have an exclusivity agreement with Wired?  If so I'll just ask here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85scl0?context=5)|I know your site and we have spoken before..thanks for the support. As you can see on our website we write ""absolutely no rights reserved"". It is just me bloggin on wired. Everything else on our CS-site, here or if we talk can be used with not strings attached..
[I am a big fan of the program but one thing that I wonder about with ""open source rocketing"" is if you ever worry that your work could be misused by people/groups to build their own missiles?  Is there some risk that your work could indirectly contribute to weapons promolgation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85tee6?context=5)|Perhaps. But just as well as we find most of our information on the internet everyone else can do just that as well. The open source aspect of this project is much more about the actual process and how we think. 
[When this project is done and you have successfully launched and landed Peter... Then what? I heard you planned building a blimp, but isn't that a little lame compared to rocketry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85raj1?context=5)|I might fly go on a high-apogee suborbital mission. We might go orbital or we just go do something else.. its difficult to say. One thing is for sure... it will be hard to find another project topping this one..
[How do you go about launching one of the most powerful non milatary rockets? surely there are many laws against doing this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85s4e1?context=5)|Well. Its all politics. We happen to live in a country (Denmark) which has no beef with anyone. If we did this in Irak or whatever, we might see sanctions like the ones for Iran or North Korea. Also, we are launching at sea because we discovered that the law of the any country stops 12 nautical mile from the coast. Then you enter advisory space and basically the wild west for rocket guys..
[Shouldn't you rather keep the *keys* private instead of the crypto code itself? As a computer science guy security by obscurity makes me shudder..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85t3em?context=5)|Yes.. the key. You see why this part of the project is not in my hands. Luckily all of us..
[I don't know of any danish laws preventing you from publishing it. A car can be used to kill people, yet it is not illegal to publish instructions on how to build a car...just to make a stupid analogy :-\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85r3wd?context=5)|If you give detailed info on both how to build a rocket and turn it into a missile with easy downloaded software you might end up with trouble if someone ""bad"" uses it.. Someone will always bend the politics this way.
[Have you and Peter Madsen already decided who will be the first to go up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85qu8q?context=5)|Yes. we have found a perfect arrangement starting with Peter and then we see how its goes.. :)
[Every project needs spokespeople. The two main news channels I am aware of are your blog and Peter's. Do you have any arrangements within CS regarding who is allowed to speak on behalf of CS? How much ""I"" is there in the ""we""? Does everyone speak for him-/herself? If yes, are you afraid of confusing people by too much cross-talk? Keep up the good work! Edit: spelling.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85t825?context=5)|I guess Peter and I are the official spokes-guys for this project. We must always be in tune with aligned vectors. So, you will normally hear about the same approach or mission layout from the both of us. But then again, the two blogs are also personal blogs and it might present crazy ideas or thoughts which are not official CS ideas. Yes, very confusing.  But, you can always trust our website. Thats is the final word...
[Do you enjoy crossdressing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85sgja?context=5)|I guess you read my twitter post :)  hey, who doesnt. I was young and needed the money..

(not a private offer :D\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85st4a?context=5)|Personally I dont care about money. They are a tool just like anything else to achieve a goal. Since I have managed so far I never think about this. Id rather starve doing this project than being forced to do some kind of crappy job.. Do you have a non-private offer? :)
[Can we start to herald that the first(official\) crossdresser in space will be danish? :\)  Secondly, what size of donation for CS would be required for you to wear a dress for your first launch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85t416?context=5)|Im pretty sure I will be removed (officially) from the team.

[In this case: would you offer tours of your facility to corporate clients (not in the space sector!\) in return for a small fee? Would that be a viable way to generate finances for the project, or would it interfere too much with your work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85rb89?context=5)|Thats actually something we do to finance the project and it is always fun to have people at the facility debating our technology. So, please let me know and we will find the time for you guys..
[I realise that engine related questions may be better asked to Peter Madsen but can you share more details about the fate of the TM65 new years test? From what I saw on the livestream the engine cooling failed (or you had a massive fuel leak in the chamber\) but besides that I have not found any solid detail about what happened, why it happened and what the future plans for the TM65 might be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85r3kv?context=5)|The TM65 engine is a double hull structure running alcohol inside for cooling. This process went wrong and actually created a pressure inside the structure which made it collapse. This specific TM65 engine will not be fired again but a new one for the HEAT2X rocket is already being developed..
[How high to you have to be to call it suboribtal?  Seems to me that even skydiving is a suborbital flight.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85vbr4?context=5)|The general definition for a suborbital space flight is a parabola jump above the karman line which is 100+ km. Not much skydiving going on there (I hope). If you dont have enough velocity to remain in orbit you call it suborbit.
[I am always intrigued by the concept of cost-effective spaceflight. Can I ask what enables you to achieve spaceflight so cheaply?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85rokm?context=5)|There are many factors. First, no one gets paid but that doesnt do it. We only use off the shelf product like normal water valves etc and we do not try to optimize the machines using titanium etc. Just plain iron or aluminum. As long as the engine is powerful enough why bother. Remember that the last 5% optimization will make the development cost explode. If you look at www.copenhagensuborbitals.com and check out the Vice video you may see how we do it. Also, if you follow my wired blog [Link to www.wired.com](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/rocketsho) or the work at [Link to twitter.com](https://twitter.com/KvonBengtso) you will soon see how :)
[By DIY, do you mean a product with assembly required that a consumer could launch themselves into space with? If so, it would seem as though there would be a lot of liability involved. What would be the price point for such a product. Would it be only available to big buyers like corporations and governments?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85rp8s?context=5)|No. its not like an IKEA furniture :) DIY just refers to the fact that we are building the rocket ourselves. No one can buy one for home assembly exactly for the reason you mention. We do not want to mix third parties into the mission because you will be stuck in legal issues just like Virgin Galactic and other commercial product.  If we build and fly our own space rocket there are no demands for requirements in any law books. Only making sure that no one else is harmed. We work in a legal vacuum.. 
[What are your goals in this space program? Are you planning on merely orbiting, or do you have more longterm goals such as reaching the moon or other large bodies.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85s1sr?context=5)|For now its just a suborbital mission to 100+ km. Above the karman line. What will happen next is unknown. We do believe that a suborbital mission on a shoe string is difficult enough :)
[I'm looking into doing something involving space (building rockets, working at NASA, etc.\) as a job because space is awesome and I want to go there. Your diy spacecraft is amazingly inspiring!  How did you get into doing this? What advice would you give to someone who wants to follow in your footsteps? Anyway, keep being awesome.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c860j5m?context=5)|If you want a space job you must go the traditional way getting the traditional degrees. I did that as well and got two masters degrees ending up working for NASA. But its wasn't until I learned to weld I was able to actually do something about it.

[What major political red tape do you have to get through to get your propellants/launch waivers/etc?  What are your biggest technological gaps right now?  How much help do you get from people outside of your project compared to how much research/testing you do on your own?

We have fixed the launch issues by doing sea launch. I would say that active guidance for rockets are one of the major gaps right now. We will eventually master this technology but it will take a while:) But also issues like capsule hatch and certain radio technologies are tough areas. We dont really get any help from the outside except when we are asking for ideas/solutions and people are sending those to us. Almost all research and testing are done inside Copenhagen Suborbitals. If someone comes to us with a certain set of skills we add that person to the project. In-house R/D are the fastest and best way to do it..

I am happily married so I dont use my name for reproduction but perhaps a beer or a donation..
[Hey, big fan from Canada here. Why did you decide to use liquid fuel, or hybrid fuel as opposed to straight solid? It seems like a solid fuel booster would be a simpler design. But what do I know, im not the rocket scientist. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c86dlli?context=5)|Solid propellant is one of the few components that will require special permission. Liquids are just liquids.  Working solid propellant are dangerous and very complex especially when you do large scale. Even the smallest cracks in the cast may make the booster explode. The casting process have to be done in vacuum and we dont have the capabilities to do such large scale casting at our facility.  Also remember, a solid booster cannot be turned OFF when started..
[Ah, I see. I had no idea they had to be cast in a vacuum! Thanks for responding, best of luck to you guys.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c86xwk6?context=5)|Vacuum casting does not have to be difficult. We do it all the time. But large scale!!... 
[Haha large scale is always the issue! Is this rocket going to be a single stage, or two stage design?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c87nvx2?context=5)|For the suborbital flight we plan using a single stage...

I would love to have such volunteering work for this project... How to proceed?
[I think the biggest issue would be software licensing, unless you are on open source software like OpenFOAM.  what do you guys use for meshing and solving? Also for CAD?  If you could get around that issue, I think a lot of people (myself included\) would love to help in any way.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c86873j?context=5)|For basic 2D CAD you can find a lot with no cost. Hardcore 3D, FEM and CFD is done using SolidWorks who is a software sponsor for this project.
[Great to see continued progress on this, as an early supporter. I haven't been keeping much up with progress lately though. When is launch test planned, and will it be streamed like the previous attempt?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85s0ve?context=5)|We will have a number of launches this summer using active guided rockets and 1/3 scale capsule LES test. It will all be broadcasted live on the web. you can always check out www.copenhagensuborbitals.com . Thanks for the support!!
[Isn't a large portion of the cost of getting into space the fuel? How are you planning on getting around that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c86f8dd?context=5)|No. We are using LOX and alcohol. LOX is a sponsored product by AirLiquide but is actually fairly cheap if we had to buy it. Alcohol is not expensive either.  When we will be launching a 1.6 meter diameter booster it will be expensive (alcohol), but in general propellant is not the main expense in this project.
[About a month ago, you talked about retrorocket-braked return. Is it still a considered solution ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8mf/iam_kristian_von_bengtson_an_architect_on_a_diy/c85r0b2?context=5)|Afraid not.. I like the idea.

I emailed Terrapin and told them how sad I was that my favourite drinking glass had been destroyed, and they mailed me a new one!

I am currently completing 2nd year of a 3 year Bachelor of Information Technology course, majoring in Computer Science and Games Development.   
In the course we have focused on C++, and C# coding wise, Computer networking, maths and physics, and Operating systems.  
First year also touched on HTML5 with CSS, and SQL.  
I'm at the point where I really want to consider my work options. Because I was adult entry when I started (I am now 25), I don't want to waste time, and I want to go straight from completing the course to finding a job. When I say a job, I would look for any relevant programming role. I would also love to work on A.I. although that is something that might be way down the line.  
  
Outside of uni, I have no idea how the I.T industry works. What would be relevant job prospects for a recent graduate, who has no prior experience in the industry?  
What would be the best thing I could do at this point to strengthen my job prospects?  
I also am based in Australia, where I hear the I.T industry is not as strong.  
I've read a few other posts here, and seem to see alot of advice saying to network and look for internships. The thing is, I have kept to myself, I've gotten good grades, but I haven't really spoken to many other students/professors. So at this point I am half worried as well.  
Internship wise I'm not even sure where to look.  

I can see that if I continue down this path, even if I complete uni with good grades, I might be stuck because I didn't network.  

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Currently, I am 23 years old with only one semester completed in college. I am not currently enrolled, but am striving on getting back in this summer or the upcoming year. I have some major gaps in my employment history from either working under the table at a different company for more pay, which was a mistake, and nursing my sick mother. The employment history I have is full of your run-of-the-mill retail/sales positions. The only positive I can imagine is that I have been top sales a few different times between my jobs. I was fired from my first job when I was a 16 for refusing to complete a task. I know my resume will look terrible with all these holes in my schooling and employment. However, I am determined to climb out of this hole that I have dug myself into and strive to make it in Finance/Accounting. 
   Even though I have no true idea of the steps I am supposed to take from here, I have been diligently researching away. I have come up with options that I would love feedback on. I would also greatly appreciate to hear any additional ideas you may have. The time for sitting on my ass and feeling sorry for myself is over. As I read from a business article a Reddit posted last night, I must, ""Own my mistake and move on."" 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Options that I have thought of: [For breaking into Finance and making myself, as a whole, more employable]**
   
   1) Join Linked-In and begin networking! I hear this is a great tool. I wish I had learned about this sooner. My girlfriend has a great finance job at a Fortune 500, so I assume that will be an invaluable contact.

   2) Sign up for FAFSA. If my grades at the end of my sophomore year are sufficient, my father has agreed to cover any additional cost after that.

   3) Start working toward a CB from AIPB.org to make myself more marketable in the finance world. Hopefully it will help me land a job in the finance industry to gain much needed experience. 

   4) Apply for paid/unpaid internships. This, I believe, will give me decent experience in the industry while also making my past mistakes seem less relevant. If I am not able to be given an internship while out of school, I am willing to pay for a college course right now so I could start interning sooner. Also, it would be an option to wait until my FAFSA application goes through and start interning when I am fully enrolled.

   5) Seek professional help to clean up my resume and find suggestions of more helpful things to add.

   6) Find suitable references and/or get in contact with old ones. I wish I realized sooner the importance of keeping work relationships even after employment has ended

   7) Grab all the certifications I can. I hear they are a joke, but at the same time look decent on a resume. It will not put me on par with the candidates with flawless records, however, I could use any help I can get at this point.
   
   8) Perfect my skills in Excel, and start learning similar applications that are used in the industry.

   9) Clean up my Facebook, as well as delete old social media profiles, to promote a better image of myself

   I would be very grateful if you could contribute any ideas or expound on the ones I have already mentioned. I am very happy to have a source like Reddit to bounce ideas off of my peers. A handful of these came from advice given to other Redditors. I would like to thank everyone that is constantly participating on this Sub Reddit and supplying it with incredibly helpful feedback.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Half-way through writing this post, I paused for a decent amount of time to create a Linked In profile. It hasn't been perfected yet, but I am happy with it for now. Since I have no finance experience I have listed myself as a Sales/Customer Service Rep. I am a bit hesitant to add my work history at the moment until I receive a little feedback. I would rather not shoot myself in the foot right off the bat!

If anyone is looking for more connections on LinkedIn, feel free to add me. I literally just started mine and could use more connections! 

Here is [My LinkedIn Profile!](http://linkedin.com/in/frankroemisch) 

Thanks Reddit! Have an awesome day!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Also if anyone knows any work in Finance, Accounting, or a similar field, please let me know! I will list my skills and such here. I have many more, however, I am only going to list the skills that could somehow relate to a finance position. Would prefer Chicago area, but will relocate or telecommute for the right fit!

**MY SKILLS:**

1)Customer Service

   *Great at diffusing hostile situations.

   *Actually listens to a customers wants and needs.

   *Smiles are contagious, that's why I always have a positive attitude.    

2)Sales

   *Can up sell and tack on accessories at an above average rate

   *Have always met or surpassed sales goals.

   *Knowledgeable about products offered.

   *Frequently looks to help coworkers so we can meet our departments goals.

3)Type at 50 WPM

4)Very familiar with telecommunications sales

5)Familiar with the entire Microsoft Office Suite

**Weakness:** 
   I am not as confident at outside sales jobs (Eg. cold calling) as I would like to be. It is something I am gradually working on. I am reading some public speaking articles in my spare time so that hopefully I can soon turn this into a strength.

**Strengths:**
   I have always had a knack for making others happy. It is something that has really defined me in every job I have had. Fortunately, that goes hand in hand with Sales, my other tremendous strength. With those two advantages, I am able to become an asset on any team.

1clgdj,115,2013-04-18,Unsolicited advice for job seekers and employers in the tech industry in India. [OC],sig-seg-me,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1clgdj/unsolicited_advice_for_job_seekers_and_employers/,"Unsolicited advice for job seekers and employers in the tech industry in India.

[Part 1]

Why am I posting this?
-----
I've been in the software industry for many years now. I've interviewed and been interviewed in all kinds of situations, and I regularly hear about other peoples experiences. I saw a few questions come up here and elsewhere about interviews, and I thought I can chip in with some advice. 

I see a lot of interview advice geared towards the west, but I don't see much about the scene in India. I want to create something specifically targeted towards developers in India because, in my opinion, there is a lot to interviews that varies across cultures - ranging from demeanor to dress code. I also see job seekers and employers making a few common mistakes, and I feel somewhat alarmed to see some things getting repeated so often that they are becoming almost cultural. So consider yourself warned: I do have an axe to grind.


Who is this for?
-----
You're one of these:

- A fresher (aka: new grad, fresh grad, NCG, etc )
- A mid-level lateral hire. Someone with &lt;=10 years of work experience looking to move.

Or, alternatively:

- An engineer interviewing people to join your mid-size (&lt; 1000 employees) company
- An engineer looking to hire for your startup

Or you are just curious about the process in general.

Prerequisites / Related work:
-----
There is a ton of information about interviews already available on the Internet. I don't want to repeat this corpus of information. I would recommend that you go through a few resources that I feel are important. Many of them seem to be pitched for a specific company, but I feel they are good advice in general

- Process: http://www.kchodorow.com/blog/2013/02/28/guide-to-tech-interviews/
- Content: http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html
- Questions and approaches: http://www.piexposed.com/
- Useful websites: Glassdoor, Career cup

Who is this NOT for?
-----
- You hate the software field but like the money, so you want to get into middle management. Please go look in a mirror and think about your life. You are the root cause of a lot of problems with the Indian IT industry.
- You cheated through your basic C programming course. Please go shoot yourself. You're part of the reason there's a negative stereotype about Indian developers.
- You work in roles other than design/development/QA. I know nothing outside these fields so please don't take my advice.
- You're a prodigy without a formal tech education - I honestly don't think the university degree matters, but I've never met one of you in person so I wouldn't be the right one to talk.

So, enough with the preamble. On to the more useful information:

Candidates:
-------
Here's the first thing you need to know: The concept of the 'interview process' is a myth. There's no single interview process. No one seems to have any clue why certain candidates get hired and some candidates get rejected. As an interviewer, if I had to rank candidates from 'good' to 'bad' I wouldn't know where to begin. The distinctions are very arbitrary and hiring decisions are very very subjective. Companies try to minimize this, but it's been proven that interviews seem to be no better than arbitrarily selecting people.

It's your job as a candidate to maximize your chances of being ranked 'good'. There are no shortcuts to achieve this: you need to be a good developer. There's no cheatsheet or magic list of things you need to know. 

**Fresh graduates:**


You are in college and it's time to look for a job. Here are a few things I would strongly recommend:
First off, understand that you are competing for a job. You will be compared against other candidates. Despite what your friends will tell you, there are no 'tricks' to getting hired. Your goal is to maximize your chances of getting hired, and considering how random hiring decisions are, the only thing you can do is to honestly and sincerely work on being a good developer.

- Don't be a rat in the rat race. This industry can be very enjoyable if you take time to cultivate and follow up on your interests. You may have to sneak time to do what you like to do while you do something else to earn money - sadly, that is the reality of the free market.

- Be curious! Why do you fall for the general rhetoric that liking your subjects is uncool? I find even the most minor things to be endlessly fascinating. (Seriously, why does a compiler think the ""#"" is a special symbol anyway? What the hell does ""little/big endian"" mean? What's so dynamic about dynamic programming??)
- Learn to use the Internet as a source of information, and not as a source of entertainment or a one-stop shop for solutions.
- Work on stuff in your spare time. For some reason, most colleges in India haven't embraced this concept, so most students come up with barren resumes. I would LOVE to see personal projects on your resume.
- [Edit: ] If you're a CS/IS student, or interested in algorithms in general, [Credit to /u/slumdawggg] solve problems on [codechef](http://codechef.com), [Sphere Online Judge](http://www.spoj.com/),[TopCoder](http://topcoder.com), [Interview Street](http://InterviewStreet.com). Another helpful site is [Geeks For Geeks](http://geeksforgeeks.org). [Credit to /u/one_brown_jedi] And [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net).
- Are you an Engineer? Do you know what that means? Do you _want_ to build things? If so, why aren't you building them?
- Whatever field you are in, DO NOT specialize too early. Software guy? Learn python, C++ AND Scala, instead of one giant kick-ass project in Scala. Hardware girl? Work on embedded systems alongside your Verilog behemoth. Systems ninja? Learn a bunch of simulations and topologies, or learn to build an Android app. Get your hands dirty with different things! I hate seeing a girl from college who is an expert in MATLAB but can't explain why it's not used everywhere. You're wasting your potential. Your professors will tell you to be an expert in one thing, but you need to understand the ecosystem you exist in before you can specialize.
- Join student organizations that are involved in tech. Your college probably has an IEEE or ACM student branch. Perhaps there's an LUG nearby. Maybe a few friends are building an app for your college fest. Whatever, just get involved in tech in an organization.
- Do an internship if you can. The benefits should be obvious, and you might earn some money as well.
- Keep an updated resume at all times after your 2nd year. Get your resume reviewed by many people. Check if members of your faculty have industry experience. Hit up your seniors who are in companies. Maintain a personal website perhaps.
- Don't have a ""dream job"" or a ""dream company"". There's no such thing. You may think that your life will be incredible if you join $company but chances are it'll be just as good in many, many other places. Companies are made of people just like you.
- Don't plan to be a job hopper. Loyalty may be underrated, but there is great personal growth to be had in staying in one job long enough to make a positive impact on the industry.
- Don't be cynical. Your peers will tell you that ""No good work happens in India"" or ""IT jobs here are just people who cut paste code"" or ""It's just a software coolie position"". I can go on for hours with detailed examples about why they are wrong, but the fact is that the work is pretty good and it pays well.
- DO NOT LIE AND CHEAT your way through college.
- Try to cultivate non-technical interests as well. You're going to be cooped up in a cubicle farm for months on end with a bunch of people. Would you rather be with a group filled with bookish nerds? Or in a group that has smart people who happen to play mridangam/take photographs/go dancing?
- Learn to talk to strangers about yourself and technology. The hardest thing to do in an interview is to walk in and be ""on"" immediately. Especially in India, where you're not likely to talk about your work to anyone except people you are very comfortable with, it can be quite hard to be friendly with strangers. 
- Seek out smart people among your peers or teachers/juniors/seniors/relatives and cultivate relationships with them. You know all the sports guys hang out with other sports guys, right? Why are you not trying to find people in college who want to work on fun stuff? Do they not exist? 
- Learn to function in a team. What does this mean at your level? Basically, learn these things:
   * Learn to make time commitments and keep them
   * Learn to listen to your team mates and help them out 
   * Learn to ask for help where appropriate 
   * Learn to describe your work clearly and concisely
   * Learn to be impersonal: There is a world of difference between ""Why didn't you do it this way?"" vs ""Would this way also work?""
   * Learn to manage your time well (really, a to-do list that you track regularly is all it takes)   
   * Learn to deal with people who don't do any of the things above (this can be the absolute hardest. It was for me.)
   * Learn to take feedback (solicited or unsolicited) without getting riled up about it.
   * Learn to separate your 'professional' connection from your 'personal' connection. If you end up doing all your projects with the girl/guy you're dating or your roommate, chances are you have no idea of how to work with strangers.

  You probably notice that ""team work"" basically means ""be a good person"". Well, yes. Unfortunately, we don't learn many of these skills from our parents and friends. The somewhat hierarchical nature of our personal lives does not mesh well with corporate teams where everyone is a peer but does not necessarily share a personal connection. However, the things on top should help you go a long, long way. Work in teams in college where possible, and don't stick to the same team forever.

[28m]",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1clbgq/my_ex_27f_wants_to_hang_out_we_didnt_have_an_ugly/,"We broke up about 2 months ago, it wasn't an ugly break up, we'd been fighting and not really having much fun together anymore so we decided to call it quits.  Other reasons for the break up include her depression: she's a cancer survivor but still hasn't returned to the workforce (4 years now), although she volunteers and is doing an internship now and is applying for jobs finally.  I've also been in 3 different relationships for a combined 10 years now with only a couple of months in between each so I felt like some time single would be good for me.  Our relationship has been long distance for basically all of it also, but when we saw each other she would stay at my place for weeks so we became really close, but it definitely got old and hurt our relationship.  I also spent 4 months abroad last summer, during which she said some things that hurt, like that she had never thought about us long term, wished we'd dated more before going out (we talked on phone for a month then I visited her once and we basically started going out, after that she started visiting me for weeks at a time), that we don't have that much passion, so that I think is when it started dying for me.

Another issue is I'm a stoner (smoke every night before bed, sometimes during day if nothing to do - I'm in grad school so I have more free time than when I was working).   And it's not that she disapproves, it's just that I've been thinking that maybe a stoner gf would be better for me in the long term, I feel like a non-stoner gf would expect me to quit at some point, which I don't know if I ever will.  She's sweet but sometimes rubs me the wrong way and I get annoyed with her quickly, which I think is not fair for her.  Then when I get annoyed she gets angry, and this has led to a lot of fights, even at Disneyland... who fights at Disneyland haha...!  

So that's why we broke up, two months now, we've talked on the phone once, some cyber sex unfortunately, there's obviously still feelings there.  She texts me Tuesday that she has tickets to a show on Thursday and she wants me to go with her.  She says that she really wants to see me - ever since we broke up she's also sent me a letter and a couple emails saying she misses me etc.  But that if after this concert I don't want to hang out again, she'll stop asking, so she's pretty chill, not a crazy girl who'll keep texting me for days or something.  

Anyway I can't decide if I should go... I'm going to be gone for the summer for an internship so I'm thinking if we can manage to wait until after the summer it might be better to try and start over once it's been 6+ months and we can think more clearly about what we both want.  

TL;DR Broke up with ex due to arguing, long distance, gf said bad/hurtful things about relationship, her depression and not having a job for almost 4 years, me being in grad school, me smoking pot a lot.  But she's really sweet, seems dedicated to give this another shot (she says she was a bad gf), has a good sense of humor, likes to get out and do things.  Not sure if I should meet up with her, she really wants to."

I am currently a sophomore majoring in Environmental Science and Resource Management, and I was loving it at first but now as I have began to take a few ""upper level"" courses I'm finding that I'm not really being challenged or learning much of anything new. I'm also finding that Environmental Science is a fallback major for many of my peers because they could not get into the almost non-competitive (requires a 2.5 in intro bio class) biology major at my university, which I feel may negatively impact the way that potential employers view my choice of major. I have recently been looking for undergraduate research and internships related to Environmental Science and I have felt like many people write me off and do not take me seriously... I am fairly confident I have a strong resume (I currently have a great office internship related to the environment), I know I do well in interviews and with speaking to people, and I think am pretty normal when it comes to first impressions (no face tattoos, etc.). 

The only factor that I can really think may be impacting me is my major... thus I am thinking of switching to Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation Biology and using my ESRM credits to get a minor in Environmental Science. This way I could still pursue a similar path towards conservation and resource management, while perhaps having a stronger science focus that would look better in the eyes of potential employers.
I've already talked to an adviser and it is very possible for me to switch majors... but I need to decide and do so this quarter!

So here are my questions for you all... how do you feel employers view Environmental Science majors? How are other Environmental Science majors feeling about their choice of major?

I'm a Graphic Design student at the University of Cincinnati who has an internship this summer in New York. My boyfriend (musician and music journalist), our friend Cat (also a Design student), and I are looking to sublet a 1BR apartment together. We are hoping to find something less than $2000 total.

We don't have any specific location, just anything anywhere that fits our budget. Our internships are in Manhattan, though, so the closer to there, the better. If you have a multiple-bedroom apartment with one or two rooms open, we would be up for that, too.

I also have a three-year-old, trained and well-behaved Pomeranian that would be with us.

Furnished would be preferable, since we are not able to bring much stuff with us. But desperation is starting to kick in, so we would consider unfurnished.

If you have a place available for only a portion of the time we'll be there, please still let me know. Maybe we could arrange staying in one place for the first two months and another for the last two?

1cl79w,1,2013-04-18,(F19) Engaged to (M24) question concerning internship and potential female roommate...in a one room hotel.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1cl79w/f19_engaged_to_m24_question_concerning_internship/,"(Note: We are writing this together, but I (F19) am the one who is doing most of the typing. Please forgive any silly grammatical errors caused by the dual voices.)

I am a 19 year old college junior who has been in a committed relationship with my fiance for nearly two years, he (M24) popped the question last August. He is what I like to call my ""mind-twin"" and we both claimed very early on in our relationship that we felt an incredibly deep connection to one and other. We knew within months of dating that we wanted to spend as many happy years together as possible.

Both of us are 100% committed to one and other, exclusively and neither of us have given the other any grounds to believe otherwise. We have lived together since the 6th month we were dating with no issues other than upturned toilet seats and an unkempt bed. 

My fiance (M24) has been accepted to a very important internship which is located approximately one hour away from our home. He will be working 8-5 with occasional overtime, which including his commute would make his work day over 10 hours a day. As he is not a fan of driving and with the added expense of gas we have collectively decided that he should try to acquire housing in the very small town where his internship is located, population 2,000. Which in and of itself is an incredible challenge and we have been having difficulty finding something reasonable. His internship is scheduled to begin in mid May. 

Today my fiance was contacted by a (single) woman who is also a college student who has an internship in the small town. She expressed a tentative interest in rooming with my fiance in a small local hotel which has a $30 daily rate. They would be splitting the costs and sharing a room, bathroom, and living quarters, but would have their own beds (side by side, no division). My fiance and I had discussed the option of a roommate, and one stipulation had been put into place, that no members of the opposite sex were allowed. Obviously, this is now a confusing situation for both of us as my fiance wants me to feel confidant and content, I want my fiance comfortable and housed, and we both want to be happy with the arrangement. And though I trust my fiance completely, I am truly not very confidant in the purposed situation but I also understand his need for reasonably priced housing. 

He has already told me that he will keep looking for another prospect if I feel uncomfortable with this one, however, I am unsure how I feel. Would I be happy with him living with ""another woman,"" absolutely not. Could I survive with him living with ""another woman"" for three or so months, most likely. My fiance has offered to be more than accommodating, even offering to leave Skype running as to make me feel more secure (I declined, for obvious reasons). However, as I said I don't feel very good about the situation at all, but thought I should get a second, unbiased opinion before casting my vote. Does anyone here have any advice as to what the heck we can make out of this situation? Does anyone have any similar experiences? 

TL;DR: Male fiance has internship an hour away, and has the option of rooming with a college aged single female in a hotel room. Woman in the relationship, though completely trusting of man, is not entirely comfortable with the potential situation. Thoughts?

1cl6kb,1,2013-04-18,Sad South Asian college student who HAS to be a doctor!,[deleted],college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1cl6kb/sad_south_asian_college_student_who_has_to_be_a/,"Hey all!

   I'm a college sophomore. South Asian. I mentioned my race just so you guys could understand my situation. So my parents want me to be a doctor, doctor, and doctor. If not, they will be SAD, and I care about them. We are the first generation here in America, and you know, we have to make a good stand and all. I don't really care about the latter part but my parents do and I care about them. I've already told them how I'm not good at the sciences and how I might end up just being f***ed over as I get to my senior year and not make it to medical school. And, medical school is SO tough, and I'm gonna' be studying something that I don't enjoy at all. It will be hard for me to say the least. When I say this to my parent, they just say, ""its just 8/10 years, and you will be making a ton of money, you will have prestige, and you have an excellent GPA. We don't see a reason for you to drop out of pre-medical program."" Its true I have a good GPA, but that was just because I studied almost 24/7, and never did anything else except studying, studying, studying, and studying. I want to live my life also. I'm working hard on something that I don't enjoy at all, to say the least. I don't hate sciences. Well, I'm slow at them and don't get them as easily as my peers do. Even when I put SO much effort into it. I think its just not my subject. So, there it goes, I'm hating what I'm studying, and my parents don't seem to understand me when I say it.

Now, the question becomes, what do I like then? Well, music is what I LOVE. But, I know that every musician has an uncertain future. Music will be something I'm considering to just do as my side career, because I don't think I can depend on it to even make a decent living for myself and my family later in life. Other than music, I have no passion for anything at all. I'm about to be a junior and its really worrying me. I don't know what I'm doing with my life. I don't know if I should just say ""please dad/mom, I love you guys but let me make this decision. I want to be doing something I love for the rest of my life."" Or, just go with this pre-med program. I have a good GPA, if I just do some more work around (labs, internships, etc.), I might be a decent candidate for medical school (which I'm saying right now will be a nightmare for me because its going to be hard and I don't enjoy sciences). Or, just choose some random subject that I'm kind of interested in, and don't care about my parents, and go with it.

I'm sorry for such a block of text but I really feel helpless, hopeless about my future. I want to know what you guys have to say. Thank you! :)

tl;dr - I HAVE to be a doctor according to my parents. I love them, but they will hate me if I chose not to become a doctor. I hate sciences.

1cl37w,0,2013-04-18,Will Work For Free – If You are Posting a Job in This Forum PLEASE READ (Business Professional Seeking Career Change),[deleted],forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/1cl37w/will_work_for_free_if_you_are_posting_a_job_in/,"If you are a professional with an opportunity that you are looking to fill and you’re willing to try a rather nontraditional approach, please read on. (Resume is available upon request, pm me for serious opportunities.)

Who I am
According to my job title, I am an Integration Analyst for a $7B, Fortune 500 company.  I specialize in business rules analysis, implementation planning, task prioritization and delegation, collaboration and task resolution between cross-functional teams, and translation of technical details and specifications to non-technical audiences.

What I’ve done
I’ve been with my company for the last 8 years, but previous leadership roles include:
General Manager - Extended-stay-style hotel (part of a major chain)
Chairman - Student Activities Organization (university)

What I do currently
o	Discovery meetings and analysis to determine business customers’ needs and objectives
o	Configure a proprietary ecommerce application for business customers—according to their purchasing policies
	This includes:
	- Establishing customer’s account structure
	- Establishing customer’s user permissions and access levels
	- Implementing controls to eliminate rogue spending and drive program 	compliance
o	Pre-implementation demo and training end users on how to use our web application
o	Post-implementation application troubleshooting, configuration updating and account support

What I’d rather be doing
My experience has been limiting when compared to my abilities.  I’m far more creative than my technical background implies.
I’m looking for an opportunity to use this creativity and be challenged.  I would like to work with a collaborative team, sharing ideas and brainstorming, analyzing and devising best approaches/best practices, innovating existing practices to be more creative, effective, and agile.  I have an intrinsic artifice for incorporating mainstream ideas and modern interest to refresh and update a legacy product/service/system.



The rules
I will:
o	Work for free
o	Work evenings and/or weekends (if this is an unpaid opportunity)
o	Meet with you in person to ensure we are a good professional match for one another
o	Give my absolute best and excel at my assignment (My day job pays the bills, I’m not hinging this on compensation.  I want to learn something new and feel the gratification of achievement again.)

You will:
o	Not waste my time with silly, offensive, or illegal offers/tasks
o	Provide a clear directive and end goal
o	Share this posting with your good friend who is a recruiter/headhunter
o	Share this posting with your good friend who is a hiring manager that has a paid position available and suitable to someone with my skill set

Please describe
o	The nature of the role or responsibilities you need filled
o	Yourself, your experience, and your relation to the role/responsibilities (will you be a supervisor, team member, sponsor, customer, etc. to the role I may be filling)
o	Your company, your company’s product/service offering


Why am I doing this?
o	Because I work remotely (in LA) for my Illinois-based company and out of sight really does mean out of mind.  I have had no advancement or learning opportunities with my company and I don’t want to grow cobwebs on my brain.
o	Because when I searched for internships, the majority of them required candidates to be enrolled students (I have already completed my degree…many years ago).
o	Because when I searched for “adult internships in Los Angeles” the search results were dominated by adult industry…(we’ll call them “opportunities”)...results in LA.
o	Because HR recruiters and talent acquisition professionals simply don’t reply to my job applications.
o	Because what I lack in experience has been exclusively due to a lack of opportunity, not potential or ability.  I think that’s worth stating.
o	Because I cannot honestly say that I’ve tried everything to get a better job…maybe until now.

Preference will be given to:
Small businesses and operating, funded startups (yes, I will work for free, but only for established companies)
Large corporations with paid management positions available (yes, I will quit my day job, but only if you offer me a better one)

I will at least give you the courtesy and respect of a reply if you do respond to this ad (with a serious opportunity).  I guess because of that I wouldn’t make a very effective recruiter.

I'm a college student graduating in... wow, a month. My GPA is pretty awful (actually awful), but my resume's fantastic otherwise because I have had some pretty cool experiences over my time at college and some pretty kickass summer internships despite my bad GPA. My friends always joke to me that if I had done a little better in school, I'd have my choice of jobs; they're probably right.

So the conversation inevitably turns to the job hunt. ""How's it going, Nomaider?"" And I usually tell them, ""Nothing yet!"" And everyone tells me, ""Don't worry about it, Nomaider, you'll get a job! You're an awesome guy, you have a great personality, etc."" And I laugh and then we'll have another drink or keep talking about whatever we were before.

Thing is? I've applied to no jobs: nothing. I'm writing this right now, and... I have absolutely no idea why I haven't. It seems incredibly stupid. But every time I go to apply, I feel just wretched. I love university so much, it's... just weird that it's going to end. Just like that. Bam!

I have some connections, I've been in touch with a couple very irregularly but I probably haven't followed up like I should. Eh, I guess I'm just putting this out there because I've been systematically lying to everyone I know about... applying for jobs.

Haha wow, I can't believe I've done this. I don't really even know where to start? But I guess I probably should. Sorry, this is a whole stream of consciousness thing. Thanks for reading, Reddit. Probably should get my stuff in order.

**TL;DR** Haven't applied to any jobs, generally lie to people when they ask. Not sure why."

Take a look at my Linkedin profile and let me know what you think.

I've completed 76 credits of the Computer Science degree at University of Wisconsin Green Bay.  I'm going to be moving to Hillsboro, Oregon, which is just outside of Portland.

I'd like to find a software-related job, but don't know if I'll have any good prospects.

There are personality traits that I have that will work well for me, I'm enthusiastic, I really like people, and I'm honest, but those aren't hard skills.

Though I've been doing web programming for the past few months, I'm interested in more as well.  For the two years I was at UW Green Bay, the major language studied was Java, so I would say that I could answer very basic questions about the language.

I've only worked in a very small team, so I don't have any good experience using Git, Mercurial, or SVN in a group.  (I know I need to learn those things well.)

I know the OOP paradigm, and am familiar with, but do not know very well, programming methods like Agile and Waterfall.

I'm not currently enrolled in a program, and I think that's going to hurt me when it comes to looking for internships and work-experience type jobs, but I'm optimistic and I'm looking forward to the search.

If anyone can give me advice based on what I've laid out here, I'd greatly appreciate it.  I'm going to constantly be working on my skills and improving myself, as that's what a person dedicated to software needs to do, but is there anything I can apply for *now*?"

This year, I have taken my high school's CCNA course (I am a current Junior), and I am currently on track to get certified by the end of June. I am reasonably confident in my ability to get certified, as I placed 6th in my state for the first round of Cisco's NetRiders competition.

My interest in networking has only increased since I started taking this course, and I have been trying to find a way to see if networking is really something I'd enjoy doing for a career. While I have attended a couple IT job shadows, they were more showing us around their campuses and selling us on jobs at their respective companies.

So my question for you guys is: How would I approach companies to ask if they would be interested in allowing me to intern/work/shadow at their company? Or is there something else I should be doing instead to get first-hand real-world networking experience.

Please help me random internet strangers.,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ckszr/im_about_to_give_up_and_end_it_all_please_help_me/,"Before 2010, I was a confident, outgoing, and charming guy with the potential to change the world. I was in college had just gotten back from a year abroad and was aiming for graduate school. I considered my life to be an extraordinary success. 

In October of 2009, the first friend I had ever made decided to take his life.  He had just recently gotten back from overseas, a member of the Armed Services.  He took his life publicly in front of some of our friends in the back of a movie theater. I remained strong. It motivated me to go to the gym, it motivated me to study, and it moved me forward. 

In winter of 2009, my father started to make some strange financial decisions.  First he bought a new couch and new television set which I really thought nothing of. It wasn’t until the holidays that I realized something was very strange. He bought a new tractor for the family farm, and he bought me a Four-Wheeler for the holidays. I never wanted one, and was aiming to move abroad full time – which he knew. My mom and I began to ponder what was going on. 

Right after the holidays he began sitting on the couch more than usual.  He starting saying he was in pain, unbearable pain. He then stopped going to work. One day, he fell on the floor and tried to crawl outside for a cigarette. It was the most demeaning and embarrassing moments of my life, seeing my father in such dire need of a cigarette. My mother and I ran to try to help him up. My mom happens to be a physical therapist and noticed my father’s spine just wasn't sitting right. She told me to go back to upstairs and to go back to bed, she then called the ambulance.

The next morning, I woke up and received a call from my mom. ""Come to the hospital, your father slipped a disk in his spine - will have to have surgery.""

The next couple of weeks were very dramatic. My dad was in the hospital recovering from falling and preparing for surgery. They discovered he had a degenerative bone cancer found in mainly African-American men, which is highly unusual because my family is Caucasian. 

The surgery was very long and then afterword he hooked to a machine for what felt like an eternal march into Hell. After two days in the Intensive Care Unit and my mom and I were approached by a close family friend, a clergy member, and several nurses. They told us to go outside and that it was time to have a conversation. They told to us to think about making a decision on his life.  

It was the hardest moment of my life to date. Mom and I both cried and hugged each other and knew the right thing for our family was to let him go if it came to it.

In February 2010, while my dad was still in the hospital, I met a girl on campus. Things were beginning to look hopeless except she somehow managed to light up the world. We had a quick conversation, but never moved much beyond that. 

My dad had made it through his surgery. He came out of the ICU and then struggled for months at the hospital. During this time I was taking well over 20 credits in the hopes I could graduate on time. Surprisingly during that stressful time, I had the highest GPA during that semester than any other.  I would show up at the hospital every day and do my homework and study while holding his hand, smiling, hoping he would wake up. It was very dramatic, but I continued on. 

Later in the spring of 2010, the girl I had mentioned earlier happened to run into me again, and I asked her on a date. Romance bloomed.  However, hospital drama was putting a damper on my spirits and I quickly found I was not the only one who needed support.  She did too. She was a graduate student from the Caribbean who moved to the US for college, and decided to stay for graduate school. She left everyone she knew, both friends and family, to come to my sleepy town of Muncie for a graduate program that no longer exists. We fell in love because we needed each other. Some would call it fate. She helped and motivated me to apply for an MBA, something I had dreamt of doing for several years. 

While my dad was in the hospital, college began creating many hurdles to jump through in order to graduate. By this time, it was fall 2010 and I was not able to transfer any study abroad credits because they came from a college, my college did not recognize, one in Israel.  The college did not recognize my four semester’s worth of Hebrew and insisted I take two additional semesters of Spanish to fulfill my language requirements. Then I was discouraged from writing a thesis and found out at the last minute that I would need an internship in order to graduate.  I was given no help to navigate the bureaucracy. That is something I did on my own.  As a political science major I began applying to every policy and government internship program I could, embassies in Chicago to government relations at the University. Everybody I applied to or interviewed with turned me away.

During fall 2010, my dad was now home from the hospital but still had to go to chemo therapy and physical therapy. I would take him to his appointments, and then quickly run to class while he was in therapy. It was a 30 minute drive in both directions.  One day after driving my dad home, and coming back to school I noticed a poster for an internship at Republican Party HQ.

I did not put any though into it. I reached out and grabbed all the posters and ripped them off the walls. I made sure no one else knew of the opening. I interviewed for the position even though it was over an hour's drive away. I did not see this as a challenge, but rather an opportunity to graduate. 

My father was counting on me to graduate before he passed away. My father started viewing my graduation as his goal. It inspired and motivated him knowing if he worked hard the doctors would give him permission to be at my graduation, nothing could stand in his way. So he started fighting therapy and doctors more than ever.  I would become the first in my family to graduate college. I knew I could not let him down. And there she was the kind, gentle voice in my ear from the Caribbean. She gave me rest and she supported me. She helped me realize the potential of an internship. She became a supportive whisper like a gentle breeze in a sleepy field. 

I decided to do the internship, even though it was over an hour away from home. I drove through snow and ice, wind and rain, fires and sunshine to make it there three days a week. I was needed so they asked me to stay for four days a week. I ended up working the full week. It may have been a political internship but fortunately I wasn’t doing policy work, I was doing administrative work. I assume the biggest reason they wanted me to stay longer and longer, is that they were teaching me skills and I was picking up things and beginning to teach myself basic graphic design and was making event flyers, brochures, and they even published a directory that I had made for them. 

And then, one late winter morning in 2011, I was coming back from the internship. I wasn't used to walking in such nice business shoes. I slipped on the ice walking from the car to the front door; there was no traction on the shoe. I had broken my wrist. It got worse before it got better, a month went by before my parents and my girlfriend realized I was in real pain. I had asked her to be my girlfriend officially over the summer of 2010. She had become my backbone, while I gave mine to my father who had lost his. 

My hand was officially broken. They did a scope on my wrist and found nothing except some torn cartilage. It still hurts today, several years on. I had a cast on for several months. I talked to a doctor who told me I needed to get a second opinion. I asked him how logical he thought it was that an uninsured 24 year old could actually afford a second medical opinion. 

To top it all off my dad was informed he would have to go through a bone marrow transplant. My mom was forced to make a decision to be with my dad back yet again in the hospital or with her son now at a surgery center. The pain she went through is still with her. 

I started applying for real jobs and graduate schools in early 2011. I got lucky and was accepted into a MBA program that was an accelerate one year program at a good school. The jobs I applied for in 2011 all rejected me. The graduate program accepted me right before I was going to make a decision from a personally set deadline between schools, the military, and working. 

After the internship was over, I graduated. My dad made it less than several weeks after a major surgery. The doctors had no hope he would make it, yet he prevailed. He climbed nearly 100 stairs with a walker determined not to miss my graduation. For the first time in history though, graduation was always outdoors – that year they had to move the whole ceremony indoors because of rain. This ruined my girlfriend’s day because of scheduling. With the original schedule she would graduate in the morning and I in the afternoon, with the rain schedule we would graduate at the same time. I was the only person she knew at graduation, and I had to walk in a different room. She walked alone, by herself. No one clapped for her. She boldly grabbed her degree and quickly came to find me. I was happy my dad had made it, but crushed my school did not handle that well. 

For graduation I went to visit my girlfriend’s parents in the Caribbean. Without her knowledge, I had ulterior motives I asked for their permission to marry her. This was more difficult than you think we come from very different backgrounds from faith to race to creed.  It wasn't easy but I had convinced them. I proposed soon after. 

We moved in together in a different city and I got my MBA. She worked as a security guard, a mortgage processor, and a secretary, which were all temporary work and internships. Hiring manager to this day still believe she moved around too much, yet we remind them temporary work pays the bills for only a limited time – and then you have to find new work. If someone hired her she would stay and so would I. 

Then in fall 2011 I lost a friend to the Indiana State Fair Stage Collapse, some of my peers from high school were much closer to her. I have a reason to mourn her passing; she was who I asked to go to senior prom with specifically because I knew she wasn’t interested in going with anyone from our school and it would take the relationship pressure off me. That is another story, but has added to my struggles. 

My MBA was not easy. It was accelerated and I had to learn accounting, finance, all while competing with peers who had studied and worked in it for years. I fought hard. We would also do consulting projects with each semester. The workload was intense enough, that I would complain to my wife that 24 hour days were too short to complete the work. 

2012 came and I got married in a beautiful ceremony. We had both been applying for jobs, internships, and opportunities since early 2010 when my dad was first in the hospital, yet still had heard nothing. We got married very soon after I graduated. We didn't spend much on the wedding, we refused to take out any loans for the wedding, and I had saved enough money to take her on a honeymoon that lasted for several weeks.
Getting married was its own challenge. Synagogues, Churches, and Secular places were all charging exorbitant fees and strict religious guidelines, and many made us feel hurt for being in love. We had always believed when people wanted to wed it was something to celebrate not to discourage. We overcame the obstacle however. I digress.

We thought at least one of us would have gotten job after we got back from our honeymoon the fall of 2012. We had to make a hard decision and move in with my parents. It took a while but I finally found a paid internship and we moved out in December.

Now here we are going on our fourth year, and yet somehow my dad is still alive, my wife and I are still together, and neither of us has yet to find a job. 

I'm growing sick and tired of pretending I can work hard to get one on my own. I’ve gone to networking events, I’ve called companies, I’ve gone door to door, and we apply online daily. I am being told I'm over qualified and inexperienced or that I'm under qualified and over experienced, and sometimes that they'll help find a job and they never follow through.  And I strongly believe it is our Federal Congress who has the biggest role in causing my inability to get a job. And it’s because of two very different laws:  

Obamacare - has a become a barrier to entry because small companies and business owners are now telling me they are too scared to hire me because they do not know if they will be able to afford to pay for a new employees.

Citizens United -  has allowed corporations to skirt paying taxes, meaning that the Government has no more ability to pay to hire on new staff. 

I’ve just got one last thing to say and it’s specifically addressed to all legislators Federal &amp; State - watch your back. My generation is headed to the ballot. We are watching you. And we can see that You have created No New Jobs.  

**EDIT 1**: Simply needed grammar and continuity issues

**TL;DR** Fed up with applying, almost took my life, still struggling

However when potentially looking for jobs that are leaning one way or another, will the decision to work for my representative hurt me? It's a fantastic opportunity either way even though a lot of it is just filing papers and handling calls. Thanks for answering in advance. I'm really conflicted."

[What is the government's plan for the Chernobyl area? Keep it as a wildlife preserve? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fkpgo?context=5)|Well, they have to preserve it just because it is polluted for another thousands of years... so it is not for the sake of the wildlife, but for the sake of the living people.
[I've been looking around on a map. Is this the correct building?  Do you think you could draw a rough map of the floor you lived on? I've been trying to find interior layouts for a recreation of Pripyat in minecraft.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fkkkh?context=5)|Yes, this is my house. I wouldn't be able to recreate the floor, since i didn't go to other flats... What is that with guys and Minecraft? I don't dig that game=)))
[Have you suffered from any illnesses related to the radiation, given the very young age at which you were exposed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fmfdn?context=5)|Me not, but my dad died from the ilness related to the radiation. nevertheless, I dont know how did it influence me on a longer run...
[Was your fathers cancer somehow related to Chernobyl?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fmudn?context=5)|I wouldnt speculate on that. he was a scientist and worked in Chernobyl all his life, going inside the sarcophagus and exposing himself to radiation. So it might not only be 1986 but the rest of his life too.
[Do you ascribe your father's death to having worked at the plant?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fktqz?context=5)|Not only to that. He dedicated his whole life as a scientist to work in Chernobyl..

Any tips/suggestions on visiting Pripyat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9flghd?context=5)|Well, the whole Prypyat is interesting. now they actually prohibit to enter the buildings, but I guess people's private apartments is actually the most interesting part.
[Did you enter the city/area alone, is that even (legally\) possible? or as part of a tourist group?  Link to www.kiddofspeed.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9gz86s?context=5)|I went to Pripyat as a journalist with my own car, but was assigned a guide. Usually journalists can go for free, tourists have to pay and people, who were evacuated can go on certain days (like anniversary)
[Can it really be considered your home town if you moved away at age 1?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fowqv?context=5)|It can be, since it formed who I am and where I am right now.

[Does there remain a significant amount of radiation in Pripyat?  Were you given information about Chernobyl/Pripyat in your upbringing?  If so what were you told and did you believe this information to be accurate for what had happened?  Was your father called in to aid with repair, for lack of a better work, the catastrophe? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fkilq?context=5)|My dad worked at another bloc of the reactor the night of the accident. he was an engineer and later on he found a Chernobyl Center for radioecology and environment protection, which did research in Chernobyl. They also worked with a lot of scientists from Japan, now after Fukushima we know why... there are some really radioactive spots in chernobyl area, while other are relatively not dangerous. basically, if you want to get a significat dose of radiation, which will somehow influence your health, you have to stand in a single spot without moving for like 2 weeks...
[Will pripyat ever be inhabitable in our lifetime? would you move back to rebuild the community?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fkwz1?context=5)|Pripyat will never be inhibited. For most, the territory is polluted for another thousands of years and buildings are already in a very bad state.
[How realistic is the Pripyat mission in Modern Warfare? That ferris wheel is burned into the minds of millions...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fs52l?context=5)|The Ferris wheel is there. It never operated, cuz they were going to open it on the 1st of May...

According to mom mom, noone knew what happened, telephones were not working etc. People were not in panic or anything... And the info about the wheel working is only on the English version of wiki, the Russian and Ukrainian one mention, that it never operated, so did the guides tell me.
[I have a few questions about traveling in the area: - are the guides trustworthy? - is it moderately safe? - would it be safe for an American?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fqaw8?context=5)|The guides are assigned to you by the authorities. All toures are well-orginized and as far as I know, it is safe to go there and there is no difference whether you are American or else=)
[If there are guides assigned to you, how did you manage to pull off a nude self-portrait?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9frz1j?context=5)|I was in my apartment and I asked for 10 minutes to be alone...
[The evacuation was done in a hurry and many personal belongings were left behind.  Did you have time on your return visit to collect any possessions.  I suppose your old clothes don't fit now, but maybe some books or family photos, heirlooms,  etc?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fmncx?context=5)|Actually, people were able to collect some of their belongings afterwards. I have all the films from my Prypyat apartment, as well as books. inside of the houses was pretty safe.
[Is it true there are wolves running wild through there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fksm8?context=5)|I havent seen any, but it is true that flora and fauna is very vivid. There are wolves and bears and wild bores...
[That's really cool man, I'm happy you weren't there for the catastrophe. Do you think there are people still living there? With this, do you believe some are mutated to some degree?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fqufu?context=5)|Mutation was very rare. Many people's health was influenced, but noone can say for sure for what extent.
 |I was there for the catastrophe, my whole family was. My dad was even working on the plant on the night of the accident. We were evacuated the next day after. There are some people who returned, they are all now over 70 and pretty much okay. Noone mutated, def not to the horror movie degree, this would be just scientific bullshit.
[Has there been evidence of mutation? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fremm?context=5)|If you go to the Chernobyl museum in Kiev, they have couple of example of mutant animals there...

What did they tell you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fma1k?context=5)|Well, my dad worked there afterwards as well, so I knew pretty much everything. You can watch this movie by National Geographic ( Seconds from Disaster), which my father was a consultant to. I was there while they were filming too.
[I'm glad I visited this sub today. I normally don't but I'm glad I got to see this. The pictures are beautiful by the way. How does it feel to know that you lived through the largest nuclear disaster in recorded history?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fking?context=5)|I never thought of it until recently... I grew up with it and never thought it was something special...
[Were you granted special permission to go into only your apartment?  If anyone else comes as a tourist, they can only walk around outside and look in the windows? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9frxuw?context=5)|Well, some touristic guides allows people to walk around as they wish, but it is considered dangerous and prohibited. In 2011 I didnt have a problem entering any buildings, but in 2012 they were rather strict. Also, I went as a journalist, so not with a group.
[After the accident did you suffer any type of radiation poisoning?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fr7tx?context=5)|I didn't. But many friends of my father, who worked that night did.. they also died.
[1\) Have you been encouraged to regularly seek out medical observation?  2\) Are you compensated by any governmental body in order to receive this observation/treatment no matter where you relocate in the world?  3\) Seeing as you were a baby when the catastrophe occurred, how would you describe your connection(s\) to Pripyat, returning after so many years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fr0hg?context=5)|1) I was encourage to do the observations, yes. I do those know once in a year in Germany too, but just for myself 2)I am compensated, but it is really nothing. I receive approx. 25$ a month. my mom though get's a discount on her apartment bills back in Ukraine 3) I didnt think about my connection to Pripyat for a long time. I didnt think it was something special, because I grew up with it and it was just a part of my history. But after my father died and after I moved abroad, I actually realize that my life changed drastically and everything I do know is a result of what happened back then.

[Id love to read it.. except i have to apparently pay for it... no thanks.. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cdy6q/iama_28year_old_photographer_who_at_the_age_of_1/c9fs3g2?context=5)|Really? it was free before... Here is the uneditet text from my computer On April 27th, 1986 I, aged 1 year and 3 months, was evacuated together with my mother from the town of Prypyat, USSR, population 49,400, average age of the inhabitants – 26 years old. Now, 25 years later and being 26 years old myself, I revisited the town of my early childhood. I would lie if I say that being a baby at the time of the Chernobyl Nuclear Accident, I remember anything of Prypyat. I don’t remember anything, but coming back after all those years to a place, which literally changed my life was not easy. I came back not for the pictures of broken dolls or abandoned schools. I didn’t take photos of Soviet relics, which are so popular with amateur photographers and tourists from all over the world. Nevertheless, when we drove into the jungle, which once was the main street – named after Lenin of course, I was hit by a way of nostalgia – nostalgia for the things, which never happened to me here. Lenin street 17, apartment 24 – number 24 would chase me throughout life. All apartments in Prypyat was burglarised and it is hard to imagine life in these empty walls. Not only valuables, but also waterpipes, powersockets and floorcloth were stolen by crooks, who would then sell radioactive goods on fleamarkets to people, who wouldnt even know what are they buying. My flat was not an exception – only peaces of broken furniture, old wallpaper (horrible flower design, by the way), 2 kopiykas (which my father left for me to pick up one day) and an old picture on the floor.  The photo is of me and my mom in this very room 25 years ago. It was a favourite of my father, who was an amateur photographer – he even mentioned it on a roll of the negative, which I found afterwards in Kiev. This was a reason for him to leave it 10 years ago, hanging on the wall of what was once our living room– as a memory of happy times, which these abandoned walls once saw. It might sound cheesy, but for me, this symbolic gesture is very meaningful, since my father, Constantin Rudya, died 5 years ago. He dedicated his life to Chernobyl, working as a scientific director at an International Chernobyl Center. He spent a lot of time in Chernobyl, collaborating with scientists from Germany, France, USA and Japan. He was exposed to the radiation frequently, revisiting the sarcophagus of the 4th block on a regular basis. He died of cancer in Fabruary 2006  at the age of 47 and before that I never thought about Chernobyl as the most influential thing, which happened to my family.  I don’t want to say that my life after his death was full of grief and sorrow – on the contrary, loosing him pushed me to do things, which I would never be brave enough to do if he stayed alive. Studying abroad, becoming a photographer, taking any chance to travel – all of that I did with one thought – would he be proud of me and did I do enough to become as great as he was? Sometimes I even regret of not being talented in physics, since I could never follow his steps.  My father had a lot of Japanese friends, and I can only imagine, how supportive he would be of them due to the current events in Fukushima. In 1986 he was barely 28 and worked as an operator on the 2d block of the Chernobyl power Plant. He worked there also on the night of the accident and 1,5 years after the catastrophe.  I found old films from Prypyat dated 1983-1986 in my fathers archive – he and his co-workers and friends – playing tennis, having fun on the beach of the Prypyat river, celebrating someone’s birthday in the dormitory. Some of these people, including my dad, are no more alive and all is left of them are memories and these old photographs. We also visited Chornobyl once together – my father was consulting the National Geographic channel team from London while they were filming one of the programs on the Chornobyl catastrophe. We visited our flat that time too – when we were leaving, he left a fresh newspaper in the mailbox of the apartment number 24, our apartment. He said, that once we would come here together with my mom. But we never did. I still hope that once my mother will come here with me though. If she does come, she will find an old photograph of me and her, 2 kopecks and a photo of my dad, smiling, pinned to the wall. I left is there as a memory. Exclusion zone is revisited by many tourists and journalists every year. It became a place of attraction, some kind of extreme adventure. I try to imagine how it would be if the accident never happened (even though, according to the construction imperfection of the station itself, the accident was destined to happen sooner or later. This is why many stations of a similar design were stopped for awhile to remove the problem before it caused more trouble, all over the Soviet Union at that times, according to Alexey Breus, who was an operator on the 4th block of the plant and my fathers good friend). So I try to visualize supermarkets and casinos on the streets of Prypyat. Light banners and nightclubs. Agitation posters of political candidates. The city existed no more than 16 years before the accident (it was built specifically for the workers of what supposed to be the biggest Nuclear Power Plant in Europe). Now, being stuck in the 1980s it remains its Soviet self, trapped in the nature, which, unlike people, was not afraid of radiation. We are used to see pictures of Chernobyl and Prypyat, which recall some sort of a horror dream, with the post-apocalyptic hollows of the broken windows and frightening remains of the human presence in a form of left toys, old books and broken beds. But it is not the impression of the exclusion zone, which I have got. Silent and mysterious beauty of the surrounding landscape is overwhelming. Wild forest, full of animals, beautiful sky and a calm river, which flows silently through the territory, which wont change much in the next hundreds of years. And it is not the broken windows and abandoned buildings, which scared me, but the feeling of a great change, which happened in the lives of so many people. At least 49 400 Prypyat inhabitants I am aware of. My life is no soap opera and everything, which happened to me in the past, might not be as spectacular and heartbreaking as a Hollywood film production scenario. It is also hard to speculate about things, which happened in the past and which I can no more influence.  But coming to Prypyat after all these years made me review my life again and analyze things from a different perspective. I lived in Kiev since I was 2, went to Germany for the first time at the age of 9 with the Kids of Chornobyl exchange programme and learned the language probably because of that. I graduated from two universities and finally ended up back in Germany, this time following my dream.  I wonder what would happen if in 1986 nothing had gone wrong? Would I have gone to a kindergarten and then local school? Would I have kayaked with my dad on the river Uzh and Prypyat? Would I have my graduation ball in the Energetic restaurant and meet the dawn with a view of the Chornobyl Nuclear power plant? Would I have grown up a small town girl, met my first love here, got married and had 2 kids by the age of 26 with their grandfather still alive? I guess, I would never know.

I have been monitoring indeed.com, monster.com, and linkedin.com, and have gotten a couple of leads, but not much has come of them yet.  I am looking for 2 things in particular:

1. What are good websites or resources for finding internships or jobs in the field?  I see quite a few postings for experienced examiners, but rarely for internship or entry level.

2. Does anyone need an intern?  I have experience with a variety of tools, including Backtrack, Helix, TSK/Autopsy, Reg Ripper, FTK, PRTK, FTK Imager, EnCase, and MPE+.  I have my ACE and AME certs, I passed phase I of the EeCE and am working on phase II, and I will hopefully get my CEH next fall and spring.  I live in Minnesota, but am willing to travel for an internship.  Leave me a message and I can send you my cover letter and resume.

Negatives: very stressful for me and them; need make sure to live in apt where animals are okay; I will be incredibly busy and probably won't be able to give them as much attention as my boyfriend would back at home

2. Leave them in my house with my boyfriend and let him care for them
Negatives: they won't see me for months (with the rabbits thinking I've abandoned them); I will miss them terribly

Like the title says, I'm currently less than a year away from completing a Bachelor's in Computer Science, but I'm also a software testing intern at a major tech company.

I tend to strongly doubt my own programming ability, but from what I'm seeing, I really shouldn't be.  In one of my CS classes, we had ungraded practice assignments, and the professor pointed out that I was the only person in the class that finished them all, and that I had clean code.

At my internship, it was originally not intended to be a coding position.  I'm working for a team developing a driver, and originally I was only supposed to be testing things, making debugging logs, and looking through the source code to potentially find fixes.  I ended up fixing a minor bug that's plagued us for months, and found the cause (though not a fix) of a major bug that's been bothering us since I discovered it a couple months ago.

I've written code that can read Minecraft worlds and exports them to a ray-tracer for high-quality renders.

My supervisor asked me to write some code to extract status data from the driver we are developing and display it in a UI.  My supervisor was impressed that I pulled it off in only a few hours, and is now asking me to expand on it and create an API that the other engineers can use for performing automated testing.

And yet...I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing.  I doubt myself.

A friend of mine said its the [Dunning-Kruger Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect).

Has anyone else dealt with this?  Does the feeling go away?"

The Lutz teens who make up MBL Trio, last year’s Rockus Maximus winners, are still at it, despite Michael Lindo’s move to Boston, where he now attends Berklee College of Music.

“The band and I continue to perform together when I come down for breaks or if we have a really important gig,” Lindo wrote in an email. “We just finished playing a few shows one at the Market on 7th in Ybor, The State Theatre in St. Petersburg and we played the First Night in St. Pete New Years event.”

The band, which includes Michael’s brother, Lorenzo Lindo, and Ben Kennett, both Steinbrenner High seniors, is also finishing up its new E.P. (extended play)

That should be done soon, Lindo said. “Then we will release a single while we finalize post-production.” 

The guys all have backgrounds in blues and jazz, but said they don’t subscribe to a particular genre when writing their music.

“It’s refreshing,” Lindo said in a previous interview. “We have a blues influence that you don’t hear on the radio every day.”

The studio time at Morrissound Studios that MBL Trio won was used to record a few songs for the new E.P., Lindo said. 

“It was great working with them and we learned a lot from the experience in how we produce our music and made a few friends there. One of the interns we worked with there actually goes to Berklee, so we've been able to become good friends,” Lindo said.

The Pasco Library System's Rockus Maximus XVI is coming up in March. As a past winner, Lindo said there are plenty of reasons local bands should get involved that go beyond the cash and recording time.

“Rockus Maximus was such a great experience for us,” Lindo said. “We met so many awesome bands through Rockus Maximus that we continue play shows with today.”

The band also got video and photos from the events that they shared with their fans, he said.

“The prize money was great and allowed us to buy some new gear, but the friends we made through the competition was the best thing we gained from the experience.”

It’s not just about winning, though that’s the ultimate goal. Lindo said there’s more to it than that. For bands considering the competition, he offers this advice.

“Put your best foot forward trying to put on the best show possible and to take advantage of the opportunities it opens up.”

The boss is my fraternity brother, the pay is ehh, hours are flexible (40 hours a week, 8 hours a day, whatever 8 hours you want between 6 am and 8pm).

In terms of my career it'd help me mounds to have the big pharma company on my resume, but I'm going to be miserable, and I'm scared that by not accepting an offer if I get one, that it will ruin my future chances of working with them after I graduate, but I still don't know if I'm even going to get an offer and now I'm stuck on what to do -___-"

Currently I live on a metropolitan campus and don't have a need for one, but next summer I'm planning on participating in an internship program that might require me to move out of state for the duration of the summer. That being said, I HAVE to have some sort of reliable transportation to get to and from my job.

The question I'm trying to answer from your feedback is this: am I being a whiny bitch for lamenting the fact that my parents refuse to pay for my own personal car and won't even allow me to ""borrow"" theirs for the summer or is it essential for young adults with career starting opportunities to have access to a vehicle?

I have had jobs waiting tables, stock room work, internships, and temp jobs. None have lasted more than six months. However I do have a lot of people who own businesses that are willing to be references. They are willing to let me say I worked for them. As for the internships, they don't care if I lie either. So I plan to stretch out the dates I worked for them. 

So my question is this: Can I get caught somehow through a background check? What do employers verify through background checks? What companies do they use to carry them out, and what methods do they use? What types of jobs don't do extensive checks? I was figuring non-profits don't have the money to do background checks that go too far into a person's financial history. 

Also keep in mind I am not interested in some moral busybody coming into my thread and telling me how wrong it is. The only thing that I care about at this point is survival. Survival at any cost. Employers won't hire me because of my employment history, so I feel I have no choice but to lie.

Today I receive an email from him with the detailed description about the tasks, turns out the 300 word speech is part of an 800 word event plan he wants me to do alongside a 1500 word research project, which would take me a good couple of days of work because I have university work to do as well.

I didn't really know where to post this as I just need some advice. To start, I'm a sophomore studying CS in one of the top5. The classes are going 'ok' and I just got an on-campus software development internship (some of you may say it's lame to intern at a uni - and it might be as there were no technical questions during the interview - but this is the only position I got for this summer). All other places either outright rejected me because of my GPA (2.95/4.0) or because of the lack of experience.       

The thing is that I like programming and I even thought (still think) that I like theoretical CS. I'm taking an algorithms class this semester and I just got my midterm exam grade back: I did so poorly compared to everyone else in class (my 32% vs mean 65%). Failures like this make me question my decision to study CS. Last semester, I got a C+ in data structures (I think this was purely because I underestimated the exams and did not study enough; I got all A/A+'s on the projects and I worked alone on those). I also seem to somewhat struggle to keep up with everyone else in my CS classes and can never score above the mean on any tests. I know I'm not the brightest kid out there but the amount of studying I do does not translate into good grades. It is also understood that the program is very competitive but because of that it's very hard for me to judge my performance as a CS student. I really hoped to get my GPA up this semester and everything was going relatively smoothly until I failed that algorithms exam. Granted that this exams is 15% of the final grade and there will be a final exam (30%), I can still save my grade but I will have to create a miracle.     

This summer, though, since I'm staying on campus and will have plenty of free time, my plan is to work on improving my programming skills, a side project, and learn something new as well. I would hate to give up like this and believe I still can do well in CS.

How does this whole situation seem to you, am I in the right field? ...or I am just beating a dead horse?      

**tl;dr bad grades, no experience, am I in the right field?**"

I was thinking this shade of [gray]( https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.svpply.com/large/2606724.jpg?1364610425) because of how hot it gets in D.C. and because I’ll be spending a fair amount of time outside. I got a black suit for a really good sale at JC Penny a while ago, and I got lucky in a thrift finding a decent Navy blazer for $5. I think that gray would help give me the most versatility.


My budget for the suit has been reduced since sequestration pretty much cut the funding for my internship. I also have to save my money to buy some other pieces like ties and shoes. I don’t really want to ask my family to help pay for the suit because they are already making sacrifices to even make this internship possible. I was hoping that I wouldn’t have to pay more than $200 for the 2-piece and tailoring. I’d really appreciate some recommendations on where to go with this budget. Would JC Penny be the best, or somewhere else like Macy’s? Are there any good places online?


For the style, I don’t have any serious convictions. I was thinking notch lapels since my other suit has peak, and I just want to mix it up a little. I want to say I’d like double venting, but would the single vent look better? I don’t know what else to say other than I would like the suit to be fairly slim. Am I missing anything?


If this helps, I’m 5’10” (178cm) and 165lbs (75kg).

Lastly, I want to get a pair of brown shoes. I had to get a cheap pair of black shoes from Target. Those black ones will probably last another 8 months and they look decent; so they aren't a priority for replacing. I don’t want to go anywhere over $100 for the shoes. I want to maximize my money for these shoes, and I’d like them to be fairly versatile between formal and casual. In addition to the type of shoe, could you guys recommend a good place to buy the shoes? Are online places like Zappos any good?


Thanks for all your help guys! I’ve just been a lurker here, but MFA has taught me a ton, and I really appreciate all of you that have been kind enough to help teach other people.

The professor was told he needed to pass more students, but upon studying previous histograms, he decided the only way to control the amount of students passing was using a curve (and not just lowing the grade cutoffs.)

So, now exactly 50% of the students in the class will get a c- or better. That means making others do poorly will improve my grade.

One of my classmates is banned from a certain mall in our city for stealing. He was told if he enters their property, the police (not mall security) will be called.

There was also an internship fair going on there a few days ago. Our professor said that anyone who goes to it and scores an interview will receive extra credit (keep in mind that someone else getting extra credit = my grade dropping.) That may seem like a weird way to get extra credit, but this is a Freshman level class, and the professor really likes to help out the Freshman.

How can I get him to understand where I'm coming from?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1codm5/boyfriend_26_not_understandingencouraging_about/,"My boyfriend and I have been together for nearly 6 years. I am a senior in college with one semester left, he is working a union job he plans to work at forever. He made the permanant decision to settle down in the state we grew up in and also bought a house. I resent him for making me choose between him and job opportunities (if they even exist) upon graduation. He wants to provide for us and that's fantastic but I dragged myself out of the worst depressive episode of my life following flunking out of school. I'm about to graduate with honors and for the first time in my life I've been excited to go after a career I'd enjoy. 


We've been through a fairly traumatic loss of friends after living with them and they turned into entirely different people. Neither of us socializes with other people much anymore but I'll occasionally go out with friends from my part time job. Just providing this information because I wanted to illustrate that we are a little too dependent on one another for company- he wants nothing outside of hanging out with me.


While I don't need an internship for my degree program I have little experience in my field and was fortunate to snag a paid internship about 2 hours away from home. It was not originally my first choice but I'm still able to study what I wanted to and I made the compromise after he made me feel terrible for ""wanting to leave him"". I also have a trip out of the country for school coming up that will last 11 days. This summer will be the longest amount of time we won't have seen one another. 


I've been making an extra effort to drive the hour to see him at least once a week because the semester is coming to a close. I'm nervous enough about this entire thing (I've never been more than 1 hr away from home and I've never lived in dorms) but he makes me feel terrible about it. I've been putting my school work on the back burner for the past month and it has finally caught up to me. The other day we had plans for me to come out and see him but he canceled and went into work on his day off (his choice). I told him originally I would come out the next day to visit instead but realized it wasn't feasible later on and told him so (I couldn't get to his place until 9 pm and he had to leave for work at 4 am- then I'd have to spend the time and gas to drive home to get to class for the next day). 


I can't adjust my plans every day or I know I realistically won't get all of my work done. He made me feel terrible for it, despite the fact that HE was the one to cancel our pre-arranged plans. I even went out to see him three times last week because I feel bad about going away. He goes into work on his days off when we have plans and even if i do come out he just plays games because its his day off. When I tried talking to him about he he thought switching days to come see him was an ""even exchange"" and somehow I should have gotten all of my work done the day he canceled on me. He doesn't seem to understand I've put him first all semester and now it's coming back to bite me. 


If he can't support me what am I supposed to do? I don't think I could ever get him to move and I've already made that mental choice not to if we're going to stay together. If I can't get him to support me through this one summer away is that a good indicator of what my life would be like with him? How can I get him to understand how important this experience is, especially if I need to compete for a job in such a small area of the country?


TL;DR: boyfriend and I have a somewhat unhealthy codependent relationship (he more than I). He expects me to continue to put my work on the back burner to come see him after he cancels our plans, but if I can't I'm a terrible person. He is not supportive about my summer internship and about finding my dream job upon graduation. I feel trapped and am constantly guilt tripped."

I asked for a half dozen nuggets.
'We don't have half dozen nuggets,' said the
teenager at the counter.
'You don't?' I replied.
'We only have six, nine, or twelve,' was the reply.
'So I can't order a half dozen nuggets, but I can order six?'
'That's right.'
So I shook my head and ordered six McNuggets

I was checking out at the local Wal-Mart with just a few items and the lady behind me put her things on the belt close to mine. I picked up one of those 'dividers' that they keep by the cash register and placed it between our things so they wouldn't get mixed. 
After the girl had scanned all of my items, she picked up the
'divider', looking it all over for the bar code so she could scan it.
Not finding the bar code, she said to me, 'Do you know how much this is?'
I said to her 'I've changed my mind; I don't think I'll buy that today.'
She said 'OK,' and I paid her for the things and left.
She had no clue to what had just happened.

'Hmmm, I don't know. Do you have an alarm, too?' I asked.
'No, just this remote thingy,' she answered,
handing it and the car keys to me. As I
took the key and manually unlocked the door, I
replied, 'Why don't you drive over there and

So, my ladyfriend is leaving town for an internship and I won't be ""getting any"" for the next five and a half weeks, which is pretty problematic for my No Fap. The last time I masturbated during a dry spell, I ended up bombarding my brain with porn, and ""Death Gripping"" three times a day. The result is that when I finally got back with a woman I wasn't able to get it all the way on, and I responded sexually more strongly to handjobs than to actual intercourse, making it hard for me to maintain an erection during PIV sex and taking a lot of enjoyment out of it. I was able to fix this by doing No Fap last summer (it cured my anorgasmia/delayed ejaculation). Anyway, this time I'm considering using a fleshlight or some similar sex toy that I can set up and thrust against to maintain myself responding sexually to hands-off stimulation and avoiding the death grip that messed with me before. I don't see it as compatible with a true No Fap regiment. I think that as long as I don't over-use it and I don't watch porn while I do it, I should be able to avoid crashing back into my old delayed ejaculation problems by not conditioning myself to respond sexually to my hands/death grip and instead conditioning myself to respond to a sensation and motion extremely similar to one experienced during vaginal sex. All opinions are welcome.

TL;DR: Used to have delayed ejaculation problems caused by conditioning myself to respond sexually only to my own hands. Wondering about experimenting with male sex toys to see if that doesn't cause the same problems."

The TLDR and question I'd like to know is at the end.**

About a year ago I was in a slump. I was attending a state college with a mechanical engineering program with a decent reputation. I was at the time, 3 years in. I had no job and I was essentially living off of my parents. 

I was taking Thermodynamics, Fluid Mechanics and Strengths of Materials, but I was having one hell of a job doing any good in Thermo and Fluids. I had teachers who did not teach towards my learning style, and I had no drive, no goal, no ambition toward a dream job. Laying blame is a waste of time and effort, you learn the most from your mistakes. Long story short, I decided I needed a break from engineering. I felt useless because of my job situation and my freeloading. I decided to make a change. I returned home and began an accelerated program (an AAS in one year) at my local community college geared towards the more practical side of engineering (Millwright). The greatest decision I ever made up to this point. I got a job in warehouse/retail for the summer before the program started, and continued into December. I then was accepted for an internship that had me working as a mechanic intern in mining.

The internship is wrapping up, the work isn't making me happy but I enjoyed the experience it offered me. I know so much more than I did when I was working on just the theoretical side of things. 

I am now interested and applying for the electrician-version of this degree, also an AAS. Following this, I plan on getting a BAS in Instrumentation that builds off of this electrical degree.

I am now interested in and have the ambition for my engineering degree and I will return to it at the conclusion of this education.

**Here's my question:** Should I return to the state college after a 3 year hiatus as community college (after earning 3 degrees) and complete my BS in ME, or should I just apply for graduate school into a mechanical, electrical, or civil engineering program? (Haven't decided which yet as I'm interested in all three, now).

I am leaning heavily towards the graduate program as it would give me a step forward on my degree. The problem with this route is that I don't remember much from my engineering classes and I'm not sure how well I'd do in these graduate courses, or how well I'd do on the FE exam/equivalent thereof.  

Perspective from fellow engineering students as well as professionals would be greatly appreciated.

I have always dreamed of spending a season at a ski area. I graduate from university in May, and I think that my only realistic opportunity for spending a winter at a ski area would be next season.

My tentative plan is to get a computer science internship this summer, save up, see if I can stretch it out until October, and then move out to a ski town and find a job there that would allow me to ski for a sizable chunk of the winter. During the winter, I would also spend some time looking for more permanent work in an area that would permit me to continue skiing on the weekends.

Before I commit to this plan, I would like a little input from any of you that have experience or knowledge about ski-town living. Specifically:

* Is this plan completely unrealistic? Should I focus on seeking permanent work in a place like Nor Cal or the PNW and resign to being a weekend-warrior?
* If the plan feasible, what kind of jobs should I look for? I've heard good things about working in snowmaking. I've also heard that it's better to work off of the mountain, though.

In New Jersey, a recent graduate works under a veterinarian’s license. However, that vet is not required to be present when the intern is working, or to personally supervise him or her. 

When we take our pets to the hospital, we should be able to trust the people caring for them are experienced professionals. That's why I've written to every animal-friendly legislator and started a petition on Change.org to restrict the responsibilities of recent graduates and require experienced veterinarians to supervise them—in person. It would also require hospitals be transparent and honest about exactly who treats the animals left in their care.
 
Eighteen months ago, I lost my incredibly loved and irreplaceable collie, Jack. He died in Red Bank Veterinary Hospital as the result of being left overnight in the CCU under the unsupervised care of an inexperienced intern. It was only after Jack died that I learned the sole medical provider “caring” for him had just graduated two months earlier and had only been working as a ""veterinarian"" for less than two weeks. In fact, she had not even passed the state exam or received a license from the state.
If you love dogs and/or cats please help by signing  ""Jack's Law"" petition at:

Trying my luck over here as well.

I'm trying to scout out a subletter for my room from early/mid-May to mid-July. Move-in date could probably be flexible (and pro-rated), but I have finals until the 9th so I need a few days to get my shit together. Then I'm moving to Baltimore for the summer for an internship, so I'll definitely be out by the end of that weekend.

Two of my roommates will also be looking for subletters so if you want to come as a group, that'd be cool too.

A little about the house:

It's old and has tons of charm, at Diamond and Gratz! It's three stories and a full basement with a ton of storage. Full laundry room, free (not coin operated) use of washer, dryer, and utility sink and a little back yard with a grill. Other roommates that aren't subletting are 2 ladies, but we've lived with dudes before so it wouldn't particularly matter.

Room will be unfurnished, but has three awesome closets including one walk-in. I can leave a bookshelf or two if you need them. It is the biggest room in the house located on the 3rd floor and will fit even up to a King sized bed. You'd be sharing the abnormally spacious bathroom with one other (very considerate) person. If you're a guy and prefer not to share a bathroom with a girl we can work that out- there are two bathrooms on the 2nd floor so we can switch it up.

Rent is $480/month plus utilities (maybe around $60-70). Rent (and utilities) would be prorated for May and July-- rent being roughly $240 each for May and July and utilities dependent on the bill. I would prefer a security deposit of $240 but wouldn't cash that check unless there was a problem.


I can get you some pictures if you want to see it, or feel free to come by for a visit and check it out. And let me know if you have any questions at all or want to figure out move-in dates."

However, with my mother in charge, I feel the need to change the idea, to point out what’s wrong with it.  This, in turn, causes her to get angry at me both for rejecting her ideas and for acting like a terrible employee.  I can’t change my behavior, though.  Sometimes, her ideas have merit.  Sometimes, her ideas are totally out of touch with reality.  They could only work in a magical land of sunshine and rainbows where business models run in a completely different manner."

I was out at a fancy function last night, the kind where all the men wear suits and all of the women wear dresses kind of event.

At first it was a meet and greet with the fellas, but it quickly dissolves from a civilized affair into its true form: past prime women on or off the carousel, desperately looking for a man, with no game and looks fading fast. Women approaching men left and right, and doing a horrible job of it.

**First woman** - was discussing something or other with a friend and I get tapped on the shoulder (approached from behind. Bad game). I turn around. I see two young 30 something women, makeup plastered on. ""Are you Jim?"" one says. ""No... Nope, not Jim, sorry"" I say. They're looking at me still. They continue ""Oh because we thought you were Jim"". They're trying to open me, but what kind of line is that? And why are women opening? Because no men are opening them. There are better options out there. Still, I am not opposed to a little game. They ask ""how is your night going? I'm Jen"". Jen is drunk. She's hot, for an older broad. She spills her drink on me almost immediately. ""OMG I'm SO SORRY"" She starts touching my chest. I'm unamused. ""You can make it up to me with a kiss I guess"". We kiss. She says she wants to go get another drink. I'm almost in disbelief, the last thing this woman needs is another drink. Her other friend leaves, and I go with this girl to the bar. I kino along the way, get a good feel for this girls body. Its pretty tight. She tried to DHV the whole time. Brings our a business card, she's a Human Resources Director for some businesses in town. I don't care. But this is her best game. We walk towards the dance floor. A big black guy comes over and they exchange kisses and lots of kino and sly glances and whispers. They're quite obviously fucking. He leaves, she looks at me ""what??"" I say ""not much"" she's pretty into kinoing me at this point, I'm looking for another set, or my friends or something. Enter another guy,  same deal, kiss kiss sly glances real close. He comes over to shake my hand, hard eye contact and really tries crushing my hand during the handshake. He clearly doesn't want me f-closing a chick in his harem. I look at this drunk mess trying to grind me, I think about how awful it would be to knock her up and how its not really worth it to pursue any further. I tell her to enjoy dancing but I'm gonna jet. I leave.

**Second group of women** - The night is advances and a bro and I are chatting. The night is coming closer to an end and we're discussing our sets that evening. I see a group of women scheming in my peripheral vision. They come over and open us. More girls opening, and not very well. They say hi and then stop. I'm sorta waiting for them to say something, but of course they have nothing. No game. Thats my job as a man. I'm a little bored at this point, but whatever, I'll entertain. I touch the hottest girl's elbow and lean in 'so how's your night going'. She starts playing with her hair and rattling on about her night. She's late 20's with a literature degree and is working an unpaid internship. She starts talking about inequality in society. Oh god. Her less attractive (read: not attractive) friend jumps in at a moment of silence and asks me if I wanna come to a big party. I say ""yeah I love big parties"" she goes ""Its not really big, just me and my cousin.. There will be like 4 people there. So how should we do this? Wanna arranage it through facebook or something?"". This girl is clearly wanting the D. So is the other one. They're independant-educated-women.jpg (read: past prime, poor, and fading looks). I don't want any of these women to know my full name or have access to my facebook so I do my traditional number close. ""Why don't you just put your number in my phone and I'll call you sometime..."" She's extatic, first girl who was actually kind of beautiful is sad that her friend got the number. She puts her number in my phone, I say thanks, I gotta go now though, find my friends and stuff. Bye!"" I leave.

I go to my bros. Tell them I'm leaving. I walk out, throw the business card in the trash and delete the number from my phone. An SUV is at a stop light by the crosswalk. The man in the passenger seat says ""Hey, the driver here thinks you're sexually attractive!"" - I'm not surprised by this, I deadlift pretty frequently and know how to dress myself. Its a woman. A woman driving some beta around. WTF.jpg.

So yeah, I go home and since I didn't find anything spectacular at the function, I go home and bang my young 22 year old woman. She's pretty hot and feminine. Good enough.

Women who have to open men are fishing from a small pond. They aren't youthful and attractive enough to have men falling all over eachother for them anymore but they still want as much male attention as they can get. They are failures as women. They will have to settle for some super beta, because seriously, they *are* competing with young women who are willing to trade some of their best years for that provision that all women naturally seek.

If you could only see the looks on these women's faces. It was that desperate ""I want you I want your attention I want to seduce you but I don't know how its never been this hard before"" kind of look. That look that men have before they learn that they need game to win in today's sexual market place.

These older women are absolutely pathetic.

""But zionController, women don't hit their sexual peak until they're 35!!""  Laugh my fucking ass off they do.

(x-post from r/self),Moustachio3d,nfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1cr11b/how_do_i_start_a_career_in_coaching_american/,"Ultimately I would like to end up at either the NCAA or NFL level, but I'm unsure of what my first step should be to get into the coaching field.

I graduated from college with a B.S. in psychology 10 years ago, and have worked mainly in retail and tech support ever since. I have a small amount of coaching experience with Pop Warner and flag football from before I graduated, but I haven't had an actual paid position anywhere. I essentially need to start from scratch.

I see three different paths to try: get certified to teach and start at the high school level, apply for internships at college and professional programs, or go back to school in a sports related major. There are benefits and drawbacks to each path, and I can only choose one to start.

My main concern with starting at the high school level is being able to transition to a higher level once I've gained experience. Do college coaches hire people from the high school ranks? If so, how much experience is typical?

If I apply for internships, what kind of qualifications will be necessary? How often do coaches bring in people with basically no experience to work on a staff? How would I make myself stand out from the other people applying for similar positions?

If I go back to school, what should I major in? AFAIK there aren't any classes to take for coaching. Are there classes, volunteer credits, or extracurricular activites that could give me the opportunity to work with the football team and coaching staff?

Is there another avenue that I'm missing? I would definitely be interested in learning about other options to get into the coaching field.

I'm tired of working jobs where the only thing I look forward to is going home everyday; I want to do something that makes me look forward to going into work. I love football and have such a passion for it, but my passion alone won't be enough to get me my dream career. Help me Reddit, you're my only hope!

TL;DR: I have no coaching experience, I want to know how to become a football coach. Suggestions?

Thanks to everyone that took the time to read my long post!

I think I have finally found one now but there's a problem. 

Here's a little background. He has been working on this startup for months already and I feel it may already be well established. He quit his job one year ago and has been working on this ever since (he's the only technical co-founder + one part-time co-founder who is on the user acquisition/marketing side). I'm still in school and I'm supposed to be a co-founder based on the talks I had with him. The problem I am facing is that I am unsure how this is going to play out. He clearly spent a lot of time and effort and risked a lot to build his mvp which was released 3 weeks ago. The other founder is about to pay for office space to motivate his unpaid interns (he has about 5 unpaid interns thus far).  Currently he has like 300 users and it's growing. 

The problem in the back of my head is that I'm not sure what the common steps a person needs to do to join an existing startup with a person they don't know very well (trust has not been established yet). Should there be an equity contract/agreement made? How much should I take (he has offered split 33/33/33 amongst all three of us)? How can I call myself a ""co-founder"" if I am coming this late to the startup? Is it normal for people to come in this late and be made equal partners?

I've been used to the idea of two-three people working together from the start. I've never thought I would be joining an existing startup so I'm not sure what to do. I really like the co-founder and I've clicked with him extensively on an intimate level. I'm just not sure how to go about joining this startup in a normalized manner.

Meanwhile I started freelancing, moved to graphic design, and now I'm basically back at square one. 
Given I'm not considering my previous work experience particularly rewarding or valuable enough to show in a portfolio, I was starting to evaluate the opportunity to spend the summer as an intern for a design studio somewhere in Europe, specifically  in or near London (mainly for available lodging and language convenience).




From what I've found most of the open positions are available to students and generally locally targeted, So I was wondering if anybody has a previous experience with some european internship programme to get in touch with such companies?




By the way, I'm already quite aware that right now the opportunities are very dim. I'm not a student anymore, the market is quite saturated, and I've taken in account that I will probably won't get paid fair or get paid at all. 
I'm most interested in knowing previous experiences if other redditors took part in such programmes and if they can pinpoint me in some specific direction.

My laptop is really old and I know there's no way it can handle the things I'll be needing from it, so I thought it would be a good idea to invest in a new one. I was looking at a refurbished samsung series 9 I found for 600 bucks, but I'd really like any suggestions so I can make an informed purchase. It would be great if I could keep it around 5-800 bucks and I'm willing to buy a refurbished or used one. Thanks!

Site is currently hosted and operated from [BigCommerce.com](http://www.bigcommerce.com/) and I want to stay with something my semi-computer literate mother wont struggle with maintaining

**So things I am considering:** 

* Make Almighty Google happier
* Revamp the visuals
* Increase Time per Visit/Page
* Make the general flow of the website better
* New logo/banner (I made the current one for her in one sitting and it could be much better)
* There are many things I want to help her with such as labeling/inventory management and more but this post is about her website. That being said I still would welcome any comments suggestions.
* I am open to other hosting or services ideas (But as the complexity increases so do the number of daily phone calls from her asking how to fix things) 




**Background**

This summer I am doing a internship (required by my university to graduate) and I decided my mothers business was a decent choice. The thought process for this decision was/is she desperately needs some technical help and if her business does well then my family also does. That being said if I know a real IT company would be a better career decision. Also I have two decent internships under my belt in unrelated fields. (still justifying not going out and finding a ""real"" internship)

So... she recently switched her site (which she started on Homestead a decade ago) to BigCommerce and after looking at their service for a hour or two I honestly don't know the capabilities of this E-commerce site.

A few years ago attempted to redo the whole site in XHTML with CSS sheets and the scope got out of control with the number of pages she had at the time.
I am still open to this option but I would want to reduce her number of total pages.


**My personal capabilities** for html development... (I am a Computer Information System major. I regret not taking Computer Sciences but after unsuccessfully trying Finance and Banking it was my best choice in our college of business)

* Mostly Self Taught/Hobbyist (why I chose the major)
* Can backwards engineer CSS and HTML based templates
* Photoshop hobbyist
* Core VB knowledge
* Odds and ends of most IT related fields
* Competent enough to figure out anything I apply myself too. And am using this as a learning experience. 
* I am limited in my advertising by the nature of the product. FDA and USDA regulations apply but I will not get into that now.
* Also our payments are all through PayPal
* That's about it, I can answer any other questions in comments.




**There are a million things I have probably neglected to mention feel free to ask in comments**

So as the title says I am 22 year old male graduate student.  I also just started working a full-time seasonal job.  A little bit about myself.. I am a laid back and easy to get along with person.  I'm a little on the quiet side but still like to have fun, too.  I enjoy music, watching movies, good tv, good beer, hiking, and video games.  I don't have any pets, but I love animals so if you have pets that's fine.  I'm looking to find other grad students or professionals in their 20s who want to search together for an apartment for May/June, or have an opening in their apartment for May/June.  My budget is somewhat low, I don't want to pay more than $650/month for rent (maybe a little more if heat is included).  I am doing an internship next year that is near the Mass Ave. Station, so I'd prefer to live somewhere near the orange line (Jamaica Plain, East Somerville/Winter Hill, Malden).  I also wouldn't mind living near the red line anywhere between Davis and Savin Hill.  Brighton would be an option, too (as long as it's near the T).  Let me know if you'd like to get together to search for an apartment or if you have an opening that suits me, thanks!"

He also said he wouldn't sign the NDAA.  Congress made slight edits to it--but, notably, did not fix the section he said was unconstitutional--before he signed it anyways.

Yes, of course, I realize it was a military budget and he can't line item veto. But when you have a President who will sign something after declaring it unconstitutional and threatening to veto, his threatening to veto something else loses some credibility.

Also, keep in mind that the last President who served at least half a term and used his veto power less than Obama has was Millard Fillmore.  And he left office 160 years ago.

We need to think of the Senate as our last real line of defense on CISPA. I'd encourage everyone to contact their senators, and to urge everyone they know to do the same. Pro-CISPA lobbyists are pumping a ton of money into this (140 times more, in fact, than is the anti-CISPA crew) and they have the ears of our senators. Now is the time to draw a line in the sand and let our senators know that if they pass CISPA, we will work to boot them from office by campaigning/volunteering for and voting for their challengers the next time they're up for re-election.

***Protip***

I interned in DC for one of the senators from my home state during the summer after my junior year of college.  One of my tasks each morning was to prepare an internal document for online distribution with that day's key news articles in both national and the state's local newspapers.  The document regularly contained letters to the editor from the state newspapers that mentioned my senator by name, so that everyone in the office could know what his constituents were saying about him publicly.  

My impression is that, at the time, this was pretty standard procedure.  I also made paper copies that I then distributed to the Senator and 15-20 key members of his staff.  

Emails to the senator, on the other hand, typically only got a few sets of eyes on them.  We'd receive them; then the interns would sort them by category; and then the senator's staff member who worked on the pertinent topic would read them and reply with a form letter on the topic or, if not form letter had yet been written and the issue was important enough or getting enough attention from constituents, the staff person responsible for that topic would write a new form letter (I helped write a few of these), the letter would be vetted by staff, and then sent out to constituents.

The reason I'm going into this level of detail in describing the processes for constituent engagement is to show that, unless things have changed significantly over the last few years, writing a letter to the editor at your local newspaper and mentioning your senators ***BY NAME*** is the best way to get their attention.  But remember to call them too."

I recently graduated with a science degree from a major US university (not Ivy league or anything, but a better public university).  I did a reasonable number of internships, worked part time at various jobs, and graduated with an okay GPA.  In short, I feel like I devoted a pretty reasonable, average amount of time to resume-building stuff.

And since I graduated I just have not seen this problem with the job market that everyone is talking about.  I have my dream full-time job and a decent part-time job on the side.  Although I'm going to grad school next year, I feel like I could expect to make a six figure income within 5-10 years if I wanted to pursue work instead.  So I don't really see what all the fuss is about from where I'm sitting, but the unemployment statistics seem to make it clear that my experience is not typical.

So I'm wondering- why, at this moment, can't you find the job you want?"

I'm going to be a freshman undergrad in the fall and I'm planning on going into computer science (I'm going into psychology, but I'm going to try to change majors; yes I'm aware that it's hard to do). I'd like to stress that I actually do like working with computers and that I'm not just going into this field for money or pressure from parents.

Anyways, there are so many options when it comes to computer science, but I just don't know how to get there. Obviously I have to work hard in school, but I'd like to get some advice from those who has gone through it all already.

I guess the questions are: What should I do while I'm at college/out of college? Should I double major in something? What should be my minor? Computer science + computer engineering?

I really enjoy working on projects, so I'm hoping to work on computer programming, graphic design, etc. I also live in the Silicon Valley so all the big companies are around. My friend's mom works at Intel and said she could help me get an internship if I needed one."
1cqb3t,388,2013-04-20,"In which the student wants to work IT, but it isn't fair that she must field strip the computer",dennisthetiger,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1cqb3t/in_which_the_student_wants_to_work_it_but_it_isnt/,"So for some background on this, I had this come to me during my hoary days in college.  Which ended all of one month ago. 

OK, this story is actually from about a year ago.

One of my course requirements were an unpaid graded internship in our school's tech lab.  This is vastly different from the actual computer lab, because in this tech lab, you are doing everything as high up as learning to administrate AD, Linux, etc., all the way to the low levels of getting your hands dirty and attacking dust bunnies with canned air - or building ethernet cables, if you have time to hold up the wall.  Pretty much any lower-level Microsoft or basic CompTIA certification you can find at the lower levels were covered in this department.

So one fine day, we're coming up to the end of last year's spring session.  Students are coming in, going through, studying up for their finals for the class that covers the first level A+ stuff.  Then there's this one girl.  She comes in, and she's looking like she's going to work on Saturday, at her job at a retail department store cosmetics counter.  Not too gaudy, she looks OK.

She goes up to a very good friend of mine, sits down, and takes out the paper for her now overdue first assessment - for all intents, field strip a kit computer.  You build a computer from basic components, minus the case, and you are timed on reassembly.  You must then (in no particular order) boot into DOS from a floppy disk, make the CD drive recognizable, create and format a small partition, boot from said new partition, and have it ready to be interacted with in some fashion.

So my friend walks up to her, they sit down, and the student basically tells her, ""so, you're going to do this for me, right?""

Um, no.

Later in the day, I see her struggling.  It's about 12:30 PM at this time, so I go up, and see what's going on. 

We go through a few steps, and I give her a few pointers on what she needs to do.  She hunt-and-pecks at the keyboard as she types in the commands.  She starts playing with it, starts to get somewhere, and I'm recognizing something: she is not cut out for this industry.  She may have the smarts, but she's not demonstrating it, and she isn't showing any of the drive to learn the field.  I'm not liking this, so I ask, ""So, why do you want to go into IT?""

She explains to me that it fascinates her, and she wants to get away from her job at $department_store, where she works the cosmetics counter.  (Pinned it.)

We get to the point where It Is Time.  The moment of truth has arrived - she must now successfully do these things.  We cannot help her at this point.  I shift gears from being the nice intern to being the authoritarian. 

Now, the conditions are this: one must have all of the components, except for the CPU and fan assembly, removed from the board.  One can put them in strategic locations, but they must be removed from the board.  So I tell her as much.

She removed the floppy cable.

""No, all of it.""

It was 13:00 at this point, and she was starting to be concerned she would be late for her 14:30 shift at work.  $department_store is a fifteen minutes' drive from our location.

She unplugs one of the PATA cables.

""No, *all of it*"", I emphasize.  

""But I don't have time!""

""You have an hour before you need to depart for work, you have plenty of time.  It won't take you 45 minutes to do this if you follow my instructions.""

She looks at me, this odd, rather weak smile of desperation on her face, and announces to me, ""It's not fair!""

I looked at her.  It was all I could do.  I knew, at this point, that she was going to fail the course.

I so wanted to say to her the following: ""Look.  This is a required assignment for all of your class.  I had to do this, and succeeded.  Almost all of your class had to do this.  If you have any intention of passing this class, you have to do it as well.  This is, indeed, 100% fair and just.  If you do not do this, you *will* fail.""

But, I didn't have the heart.  I don't like making women cry on purpose - it's rather ungentlemanly.

I found out later that she did, indeed, fail, and passed on a poor report to the instructor on Rate My Professor.

I sometimes wonder what became of her - doubly so because, if I ever happen by $department_store, it's not for the cosmetics counter.  Ever.

TL;DR: Assessment?  I don't have to do an assessment!  I'm pretty!  It's NOT FAIR!"

1cq7wa,10,2013-04-20,Carrion breath,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1cq7wa/carrion_breath/,"I'm a Canadian on a J-1 internship visa, living in Florida. I've been living the American life, whatever that means, since last September, and I should be back home two weeks from now.

For a little bit of background, having walked around a lot, I noticed that the streets of Florida, or at least around Orlando, are literally filled with dead animals. On a particularly bad day I was walking to the nearby grocery store, I could see a dead bird, a dead rat, and the occasional dead cat. I found this somewhat creepy because, as I remember them, the streets of the Montreal suburbs are considerably cleaner, as far as dead things are concerned. Still, I got used to it, and I don't really pay heed anymore.

One of the many things I need to get better at is punctuality. So last Tuesday morning, when I woke up 15 minutes before the time I should be at work, you'll understand that I didn't spend too much time tying my shoelaces; but as I was racing to my nice rental car, I stepped on something that really didn't feel right. I stopped for an instant, looking back, and I realized that it was a dead squirrel. The poor thing was lying on its belly and was missing a leg. Its head was lying in a small pool of black sticky stuff. Disgusted, I wiped my shoe in the grass, stepped into my car and mentally woke up to what I would have to do at work today. When I came back home, the rodent was gone, probably taken by a stray cat or something.

The next day, I did my best to wake up earlier. I got ready; shaved and took a shower; my toothbrush had a funny taste that I couldn't quite recognize. As I walked to my car, this time, I noticed a big dead bird on the sidewalk. I'm not too good with bird names, but I know this one is a black bird that seems to live around the small lakes. I approached it with morbid curiosity and realized that it had been considerably mutilated. In fact, all that remained was the wings, the shoulders where they connect, the neck and the head. A colony of ants was apparently salvaging the remains. Disgusted again, I went to work, had a bad day, and came back home without noticing what happened to it. Later this evening, my roommate told me to be careful with the windows, because it had rained that day and I forgot to close the bathroom window when I left for work that morning.

The next day, I wasn't feeling too well. The handle of my toothbrush was a little sticky, and my gum bled more than usual. The taste of blood was particularly bad, and it looked like I was doing a mouth ulcer. Good thing that I had an appointment with the dentist the next day.

And sure enough, when I got out, there was a dead racoon on the lawn, next to a tree. But this dead racoon was something else. In fact, it was more half a racoon. There was a thick black liquid coming out of its gaping abdomen and the lower part of its jaw was missing. And God, the stench. I was already not so well, but with that I thought I was going to throw up. Just like the other dead animals, I left it there and expected nature to do its work.

I didn't get any better during the day. It's like the stench followed me. My coworkers tried to avoid me, and the few of them who really had to interact with me offered me a gum. That mouth ulcer was getting discernibly worse during the day, such that at the end of it I was having trouble closing my mouth completely without it hurting.

I came home early because a bad headache struck. I went to the bathroom to get a Tylenol tab, but when I opened the door, I really didn't expect what I saw: there was a naked, hirsute, completely white man, brushing his teeth in front of the mirror. As I interrupted him, he turned his semi-bald head around. His eyes were wide open, and a black liquid was drooling out of his mouth with my toothbrush (MY toothbrush!) inside. He saw me, and his jaw dropped so wide I bet he could have fit my head in it; he had sharp and seemingly rotten shark-like teeth, two rows of them.

After two seconds returning my surprised look, his expression changed to a grotesque grin and he let out a little girl laugh. Always looking directly at me, he let the toothbrush on the side of the sink, crouched, and put his finger in front of his mouth, and said ""shhhhhh"". He then slowly scuttled towards the wall with the window, never dropping the stare, and, I fucking swear, climbed the wall like he was a spider, his head always facing me; at this point, the back of his head was touching his hairy back in the most inhuman contortion. He went through the open window, squeezing his monstrous body through like a mouse, always staring at me and grinning; he stopped there for about three seconds, taking a final look at me, and dropped down.

I fell on my knees, short-breathed, shaking in awe and dripping with cold sweat. I puked on the floor at the thought he had been using my toothbrush. My mouth hurt like shit and I think some blood came out too.

As I'm writing now, my lower lip is numb and my thoughts are a little cloudy. I think I'm drooling, but I hope not, because it's not the right color. My breath stinks like dead animals. Good thing I have this dentist appointment tomorrow."

A couple days later I got a call from the focus group company, saying that their client wanted my contact information; I was a bit confused but said yes, thinking that maybe they want me to test their software out some more or something.

I was hoping to pick your brains for some advice on how to beef up my application prior to applying for MPH programs. I'm not in a hurry, but I'd like to at least begin the application process in the next 2-3 years. My situation, however, seems unusual in comparison to most of the inquiries I see posted from aspiring MPH candidates, and frankly I'm not sure where to begin. A little background:

I went to a smallish private university in the mid-Atlantic where I majored in Literature with a Cinema Studies concentration. I absolutely loved my course of study, despite having to constantly defend it to the ""if you major in anything other than a STEM field, you're wasting your time and money"" crowd. I didn't have any clear career goals entering college, and I intended to explore some of my areas of interest (health policy and advocacy, journalism, arts administration) through internships.

Unfortunately, early in my sophomore year, my parents ended up in something of a financial crisis, the result of which was that I needed a paying job to stay at my alma mater. I ended up taking a lot of late afternoon and evening classes and working 30-40 hours a week. 

I still managed to graduate with honors, but unlike my peers, who had the financial support to take on several unpaid internships, my professional experience was all in retail operations management - not a career I intended to pursue.

It's been a year since graduation, and I'm still plugging away as a retail manager. After doing a lot of reading and talking to folks in the field (my parents are administrators specializing in rehabilitative care, so both they and their colleagues have been great resources), I'm confident that I want to pursue an MPH. But frankly, I'm not sure what the best course of action is to ensure that my application is competitive; I have no academic or professional experience to speak of.

I've been looking at idealist.org for some entry-level jobs at health-focused nonprofits, which I think could be a good start - even if it's just as a receptionist, at least I'd have some exposure to the field to reference on my applications. Is there anything else I you can recommend for someone in my situation?

With my job, I'm learning that everyone wants you to work for free. They never expected a 19 year old intern to do as well as I have shown them. I think I'm very good at what I do. I wasn't even expecting to work for them. I initially Went in for an interview to sell  ice cream at stores for 11$ an hour. During my interview they liked me so much they have me this current position. At work I purposely don't do work because then they will expect more and more. I could do a lot more for them but I feel like my hard work is overseen. I don't think they value me enough. In the past 2 months I've gotten events for them for 15,000 people, and I'm consistently doing impressive work. But they dont show me enough appreciation, and as soon as I'm done doing one thing I'm already being told to do something else. Just this weekend they told me to do a delivery which took an hour just to deliver 3 boxes of ice cream to someone's house. Clearly they do not value my time. I'm very good at what I do, but they never want me to be proud because they don't want to admit I go far beyond their expectations. I do about half the work I am able to do because I don't think they deserve to see me at my full potential.

I feel like dad never listens to me, and is just interested in dropping the argument. I try and tell him a problem but he's so quick to say ""okay I'm wrong"". It doesn't matter if he's wrong I just want him to listen. I try so hard to have conversations with him but his responses are very abrupt and doesn't leave room to make conversation, he just says what he thinks I want to hear.

Mom I don't have anything wrong with you or dad when I say I hate being home. I just really feel trapped with all the messy things. I cannot be physically or mentally at ease. 

I'm sorry I haven't been spending time at home, even for a few years, I think we have a lot of catching up to do.

I read a funny conversation online today asking parents what the weirdest thing they've seen their kids do. Also another one asking what the weirdest thing they've found in their kids room. What's your answer?

I also want to know what you write in your journal. Mom what are your hobbies and what do you love to see and do? I feel like I need more hobbies or else ill be sad

Thank you for being ever so forgiving, as always. I tried to not fight today, I don't know if you could see that or not.

I had a really mature conversation with my friend recently that reflects how far I've come in terms of how I view the world. I think I'm growing up with a very positive outlook.

Her: Life is hard
Me: that's what I always say
Her: It's true. The more I'm alive the more I'm just so done 
Me: it's not so bad
Her: Not usually. But I'm just very tired and I'm still so young. This society is too fast paced to keep up with. It's too twisted to deserve being kept up with 
Me: Idk girl I feel like we don't have much to complain about
Her:But everything is just so damn complicated.  Humanity had to go and give everyone these unrealistically high expectations and make life really expensive to live if you want to do good things like travel and eat well 
Me: Trust me I used to say the same shit but you gain perspective. we are in NYC, you go to one of the best schools in the country, you got to travel recently, you're given all the food and resources you want and you're free to explore one of the best places in the world. I know that we're young but everyone went through the same thing which is one of the many things to look forward to with age. we have so much freedom compared to the rest of the world. people may have dumb perspectives and biased judgement on who deserves to be at the top of the hierarchy, I know. but even at the bottom were luckier than most parts of the world. I used to complain a lot too before I realized how blessed I am. I realized I should change how I see the world bc there's no point in complaining about things you can't change
Her: Cause having to put so much effort into living is draining  Like obviously hunting for food and surviving is draining too, but it's more natural. But I'm conflicted because I do like the pursuit of knowledge and art and things that modern convention have allowed us to pursue. 
Me: No one is forcing you to do anything you pursue learning art and whatever you like BECAUSE you like it. If you think you're putting in all this effort and you're not enjoying it then maybe you need to pick a different path. I work as hard as possible  learning all I can about psychology and I lose sleep all the time but in the long run I really enjoy working hard at something. It kind of sounds like you're just complaining for the sake of complaining which is what i did for like my whole life and what a lot of people do

I'm sorry I don't make enough time to talk and spend quality time with the only Two people that deserve it. I waste all my emotion on people that don't care nearly as much about me as I care about them and not even 10% of how much I know you love me. I realized its easier for me to blame you and get mad at you for things that are my fault. For instance, I get mad at you for not talking to me when it's actually my fault for not being home and always in my room. When I feel bad for you driving me at 2 am you can notice that I get mad and make you feel bad. I thought a lot about my actions and realized it is a mental defense mechanism. I make you feel bad to make you think you owe me a ride. Because I'm mad, you driving me will make me not be mad. How could I be so evil and selfish? Mom I'm so sorry for being a bad daughter"

1cpxw3,1,2013-04-19,Any Advice for a Part-time Student?,[deleted],LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/1cpxw3/any_advice_for_a_parttime_student/,"I'd like to grab some advice on being a part-time student. Maybe it's all boils down to poor time management on my part, but your comments, questions, success stories, etc. are appreciated. 

#1 I just received another email from my career services about legal jobs and internships. I'd love to get me one of those, however, I work full time and can barely keep up with taking four classes during the semester. Classes are at night M-Thur., sometimes Fridays. The weekends usually entail studying or the once a month part-time job. I've been told internships are essential. Are there other options? FYI, my career services center is crap.

#2 How the hell do you fight the burnout? I'm two years in and it's draining. I feel sad that during the school breaks (spring, winter, few weeks before summer school) I go to work and it feels like vacation. 

#3 Work - School balance. I've split my energies between the two and neither shows a superb end product. It's adequate on both sides, but I excel on neither side. I'm hoping to keep the work schedule at bay in the no more than 45 hours/week limit. I'm also pretty committed to graduate in 3.5 years. How much does it hurt me in the long run to be middle of the pack at work and school?

Background if it helps: High cost of living area (census' median income is 70k), no scholarships but also no debt, government employer (jd preferred position), age late 20s, no social life, no idea of a practice area, TTTTTT."

Site is currently hosted and operated from [BigCommerce.com](http://www.bigcommerce.com/) and I want to finish with something my semi computer literate mother wont struggle with maintaining

**So things I am considering:** 

* Make google search results happier
* Revamp the visuals
* Increase Time per Visit/Page
* Make the general flow of the website better
* New logo/banner (I made the current one for her in one sitting and it could be much better)
* There are many things I want to help her with such as labeling/inventory management and more but this post is about her website. That being said I still would welcome any comments suggestions.
* I am open to other hosting or services ideas (But as the complexity increases so do the number of daily phone calls from her asking how to fix things) 




**Background**

This summer I am doing a internship (required by my university to graduate) and I decided my mothers business was a decent choice. The thought process for this decision was/is she desperately needs some technical help and if her business does well then my family also does. That being said if I know a real IT company would be a better career decision. Also I have two decent internships under my belt in unrelated fields. (still justifying not going out and finding a ""real"" internship)

So... she recently switched her site (which she started on Homestead a decade ago) to BigCommerce and after looking at their service for a hour or two I honestly don't know the capabilities of this E-commerce site.

A few years ago attempted to redo the whole site in XHTML with CSS sheets and the scope got out of control with the number of pages she had at the time.
I am still open to this option but I would want to reduce her number of total pages.


**My personal capabilities** for html development... (I am a Computer Information System major. I regret not taking Computer Sciences but after unsuccessfully trying Finance and Banking it was my best choice in our college of business)

* Mostly Self Taught/Hobbyist (why I chose the major)
* Can backwards engineer CSS and HTML based templates
* Photoshop hobbyist
* Competent enough to figure out anything I apply myself too. And am using this as a learning experience. 
* That's about it, I can answer any other questions in comments.
* I am also limited by the nature of the product. FDA and USDA regulations apply but I will not go into that.
* Also our payments are all through PayPal




**There are a million things I have probably neglected to mention feel free to ask in comments**

Got an amazing internship and desperately need a change.,spezie,FancyFollicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/FancyFollicles/comments/1cpriz/looking_for_advice_got_an_amazing_internship_and/,"I've been putting off getting my hair cut again because I had really mixed feelings the last time I got it done, but I've found a salon that seems to really listen and I'd like to get it cut before I leave for a really awesome internship in a glycobiology research lab.

The last time I got it done was a really drastic change. [Before](http://i.imgur.com/R0H4Gop.jpg) and [After](http://i.imgur.com/j8nAv7u.jpg) and I had a lot of anxiety about it. I loved the length but it was all very angular and sharp lines, it looked unnatural to me.

I'm looking for something still short but a little messier this time. I'd like to keep the same sort of swept bangs and I'm not 100% convinced I could rock anything too too short, but I'm open to suggestions.

At the moment it's just at my shoulders and the color is somewhere inbetween those two."
1cpqud,1,2013-04-19,I'm just a big ball of confused and upset.,Qwenie,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1cpqud/im_just_a_big_ball_of_confused_and_upset/,"I'm a generally happy person most of the time. But lately, I've been feeling more and more sad and alone and I'm really sick of it. The problem is, I can't just pin it down to one thing that I can fix, it's a lot of stuff, and I can't really control all of it. 

The stuff that I can't control would be my family life. First off, my parents have always had a lot of problems that they tried to hide from me for a really long time. But then when I was in middle school my mom started telling me about how she wanted to leave my dad. She told me that the only reason she was still with him was because of me. Obviously, that didn't make me feel too good about myself. Then after a year of college, my dad told me he didn't know how much longer he could take being with my mom. That's all fine and dandy. If they don't want to be together anymore, that's on them. I don't even live at home most of the year anyway because of college, so I honestly don't care what they do. The problem is that they are still together, and every time they get the chance, they tell me how much they hate it. Also, two years ago I found out that my dad might not be my biological dad and that that might be why he doesn't really help with college. So there's that. 

And college. I'm currently a sophomore in college studying something that I thought I loved, but have since grown indifferent towards. That indifference is hurting my grades, which is lowing my chances of getting scholarships that I desperately need to put myself through school all on my own. I've thought about changing my major, but I have no idea what I would change it to, because I've yet to find something that interests me more than what I'm currently doing. 

For a while I thought about joining the military. Just to take a break from this and get away from this godawful shit hole midwestern state and get a little bit of much needed structure in my life. I feel so scatter brained and at the time it seemed like a good idea. It still does. But my mother told me she'd be disappointed in me if I did that. Neither of my parents went to college, so they want me to because they want me to be better off than them. She also just didn't like the idea of her ""little girl"" shipping off in the military. 

I want to travel, but I have no money. I want to study abroad, but I can't because I just signed a lease for a house for August and I can't just bail on my housemates like that. I wanted to study or intern in either Europe or Australia over the summer, but my parents talked me out of it, told me I can't. Basically, I've passed up a lot of opportunities because my parents told me not to take them. 

Also, I'm really, really lonely. I have my core group of friends, and I love them to death, but there's just some things I can't tell them. We have a friend that tells us pretty much everything, and they complain because she does. I'm scared if I went to them they'd complain about me, too. I've been single for almost a year now after a three year relationship with a guy that I thought I was gonna marry. In hindsight, I'm so glad that I'm not with him anymore because he was an asshole and I'm also just not in a place where I'm ready to get married. I'm happier without him, but lately I've been wanting what comes along with a relationship, but with the understanding that I want to commit, but that I need to work on myself first and foremost. Lately I've been seeing this guy, and it's been nice, but I just don't know how I feel about it. I'm 19 and he's 25, so it's a six year difference. He graduated from my university last year and was in the army before that. He's nice and all, but I almost feel like the only reason it's been working is because it's convenient. And I think that's how it is on his end, too. He even told me that when we started talking he didn't particularly care if I liked him or not. So I feel like it's just convenient that I do, and that's why we're together. But last night he brought up how his little sister's boyfriend proposed and how that upsets him because she'll be getting married before him. It seems like he wants to do that soon and that's just not my thing right now. I really, really want to get married one day, but now is just not that time. I need to travel and figure out what I'm doing with life first. The age difference is the main thing and one of the only things that bothers me about him, but I think it might be enough to be a problem. When my parents asked how old he was they kinda freaked out. Got off the phone super fast after I told them, like they just didn't want to talk anymore. That kinda adds to the problem with the age. 

Long story short, I've got a lot going on and I just don't know how to deal with it anymore. 

TL;DR: My parents complain to me about their marriage, but won't do anything about it, I'm not happy with school that I can't even afford, my parents dictate my decisions and I don't know how to change it, and I have boy problems. "

1cpp0y,0,2013-04-19,Can't find an accounting job,accountingta,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1cpp0y/cant_find_an_accounting_job/,"I've made several mistakes in my academic career.  I didn't do an internship.  I didn't join Beta Alpha Psi.  I didn't apply for many jobs while I was in school.  I completed an undergraduate accounting degree with a mediocre GPA at a flagship state school.  The same school somehow accepted me into their Masters of Accounting program even with a mediocre GPA and an average GMAT score.  I then completed the Masters program with the same mediocre GPA as undergrad.  I didn't apply for Big4 internships or many jobs because I felt so inferior to my classmates and for several other reasons.

Anyway, I've been busy applying for accounting jobs.  I barely graduated from the Masters program with a passable GPA anyway.  That was a big problem during my time in the program - I didn't feel confident enough to apply many places because I wasn't even sure if I would be allowed to continue in my Masters program or graduate, but I did somehow.  

I would like to have an audit position, but at this point, I would do anything.  There are so many negatives working against me:  no experience in anything, no internship in accounting, and older than average for an entry level position.  I have been on two interviews since I've graduated.  One was through a connection and at the end of the interview they said they weren't hiring now, but the interviewer might as well have said that they were never going to hire me.  My other interview was three weeks ago, so I have given up on that too.  My parents have paid for Becker and I've been slacking off studying for the CPA exam.  My parents paid for me to take one section, but I haven't even scheduled the date yet.  There are so many better and more qualified candidates out there that I doubt I'll get a job anytime soon.  Things seem pretty hopeless now."

Some background on me:

* Last summer I interned at Pegasystems in Cambridge, MA, and this summer, I will have interned at Microsoft in their research location.

* During my Junior year of high school, I lived in Zaragoza, Spain. For that reason, I have a decent working ability in Spanish.

* I'm experienced in C/C++, and after this summer I'll have a good grasp of the .NET framework. 

So, if anyone knows anyone in the software scene in Chile, I'd love to get in touch!

Hi               :
 
After we talked on Wednesday night, I felt kind of heavy hearted and was really praying about your situation.  ""Out of the blue,"" which is usually a good sign to me that this idea came from God rather than my own head, I was reminded of what we had learned about ""alignment"" when we all took the Cleansing Streams classes several years ago.
 
Remember the diagrams which showed we need to walk out our lives like this:
 
SPIRIT
 
SOUL  (mind, will &amp;amp; emotions)
 
BODY
 
This alignment is important because only when our spirit is leading our life can we connect with God's Spirit and be led by Him.  It also showed a half circle or ""umbrella"" of God's covering which we walk under when we are letting our spirit be the ""line leader"" and our soul and body submitting to our spirit.
 
Anyways, I felt like God was showing  me that you have been living your life this past year in a total opposite alignment:
 
BODY:   Your physical and social drives leading the way.
 
SOUL:     Your studies
 
SPIRIT:   Prayer kicks in when all else fails
 
 
I really believe Law School is part of God's plan for your life, but I think it is time to re-align yourself to be led by Him.  My verse of the day this morning was 2 Corinthians 1:9-10  ""We were crushed and overwhelmed beyond our ability to endure and we thought we would never live through it . . . But as a result, we stopped relying on ourselves and learned to rely only on God.""  Kind of sounds like where you are at with trying to find an internship for next summer, right?

1ctq9r,1,2013-04-21,End of my rope,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1ctq9r/end_of_my_rope/,"::sigh:: as the title of this says, I have reached the end of my rope. I need to just write and talk to someone because I am completely lost with my life right now and I don't know what to do. I am 26 years old and I feel like my life is at a standstill. The past year was the roughest year of my life as I had to make a life changing move to a place where I don't really know anyone. I made this move because at the the time it seemed logical and being with a SO it meant that it was something for the future. Things didn't quite go as planned and now I am working a job that hardly pays the bills and I struggle every month to make end meet. Unfortunately to make ends meet it means that I have to rely on credit cards that are already to the end of their limit. I couldn't finish college because of this move and since I could never get any financial aid my parents could no longer afford it. The reason to my non-existent financial aid is because of my citizenship status. I don't want to talk to much about that but know that I am a legal resident of the US. anyway, my dreams are to work at a TV Station. I am was going for a degree in computer graphics and then changed it to animation. I have a huge passion for it but recent events have led me to practice my skills and I feel stuck in a rut. Life has taken its toll on me this and last year. I just wish someone would be able to tell me how to keep going and how to get out of this situation. argh nothing of this probably makes any sense but I just need to talk. I'm desperate to get my life back on track but where I am right now I can see that I will not be getting anywhere anytime soon. My job does nothing for me in the sense of wage. I am looking for a second job but my odd hours make it so hard to do so. Maybe that's why banks like to give odd hours, so their employees cant just be stuck with them. Idk, I should be grateful that I at least have a job but it's just not cutting it. I want to move back home where my family is but I cant even do that. I have no money to do any of the things I want. I would love to get started in a career with design but everywhere I look it's either I need a bachelor's degree or I need 3-4 years experience. WHY?? If I'm applying to an entry level job why do I need 3-4 years experience?? that makes no sense. Maybe it's just me but I just cant seem to make anything work. I'm sick of needing food, I'm sick of watching others do what they love, even though I am happy for them, I am just so sick of everything. I was with this SO of mine for seven years and then she left without any reason as to why and then acts as if I owe her something. WTF kind of bullshit is that? seriously you left why keep bothering me? It's her fault im in such a shitty situation seeing as when she left I couldn't pay for rent and everything else. I love it when she asks ""so you're blaming me?"" NO IM BLAMING SANTA CLAUS! you know what though, it is my fault for letting myself get in this mess. I should've always been careful and not given so much. As I said before I just need to talk and if someone could just guide me and help me get my shit together. My credit is almost non existent so I fear applying for a new job and get denied because of it. I probably will not be able to get a new apt until 10 years form now. I will never own a house. Why haven't I spoken to my parents? well because right now my dad is the only one working but every time I've asked for help I get that shitty line ""that's life and you'll have to figure it out"" or ""I don't have any money right now"". I don't blame them but I wish I could just get more then just that. I wish I could have someone just sit with me and tell me that it gets better. That I just need to do this this and that to get back on track. I dont need reddit gold, I dont need karma I just need guidance. If You work in a TV Station or anything related with design please tell me how you got there. Yes I know Internships go a long way but with my job and with my pay that is not an option."

(mother is successful business woman)",[deleted],atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1cto9m/what_does_ratheism_thinkdelusional_mother/,"Hi               :
 
After we talked on Wednesday night, I felt kind of heavy hearted and was really praying about your situation.  ""Out of the blue,"" which is usually a good sign to me that this idea came from God rather than my own head, I was reminded of what we had learned about ""alignment"" when we all took the Cleansing Streams classes several years ago.
 
Remember the diagrams which showed we need to walk out our lives like this:
 
SPIRIT
 
SOUL  (mind, will &amp; emotions)
 
BODY
 
This alignment is important because only when our spirit is leading our life can we connect with God's Spirit and be led by Him.  It also showed a half circle or ""umbrella"" of God's covering which we walk under when we are letting our spirit be the ""line leader"" and our soul and body submitting to our spirit.
 
Anyways, I felt like God was showing  me that you have been living your life this past year in a total opposite alignment:
 
BODY:   Your physical and social drives leading the way.
 
SOUL:     Your studies
 
SPIRIT:   Prayer kicks in when all else fails
 
 
I really believe Law School is part of God's plan for your life, but I think it is time to re-align yourself to be led by Him.  My verse of the day this morning was 2 Corinthians 1:9-10  ""We were crushed and overwhelmed beyond our ability to endure and we thought we would never live through it . . . But as a result, we stopped relying on ourselves and learned to rely only on God.""  Kind of sounds like where you are at with trying to find an internship for next summer, right?
 
You said you were planning to spend the next two weeks working full time on sending out resumes, etc.  That's great, but I really want to encourage you to make the first priority of each day a time to talk to God and listen for his direction.

* Get master degree in Business Information Systems, BA or similar

* Start working at a prestigious international company (chance to transfer to the US[?])

* Independence and learning how to live on my own
* Better social opportunities? (i'm curious about this one)

**Cons**

* It costs money. I live in Edmonton and if I were to live with 3 other roommates it could be around $500/month (someone confirm this). I'm going to make at least $16,000 over the summer from an internship so...
* Mom won't be around to make me delicious food and clean up after me haha.

These two things have caused me to get a little jumpy/rusty when it comes to meeting and getting to know new people, so I'm looking for chances to practice being charming and clever bar/coffee/meal/adventure company.


**So what are you all about?**
In case you haven't noticed already, I am occasionally given to rambling aimlessly and burrying the lede, as it were, especially when I'm talking about things near and dear to my heart, like myself. I mean, before I give you the information you're asking for I need to give you its context, and all the qualifications on how I know what I know so mistakes can be spotted... Sometimes it can take me four or five sentences to even get to the information I meant to tell you! If I've decided to be ""humorously"" self-aware and exaggerate this tendency, well, then may god have mercy on your soul.


**I still have no idea what you're all about...**
Right! I've been living in the cities for about 4.5 years, first for undergrad and now for a dual degree Graduate and Law school program. I don't know precisely what I will be doing after this, but I'm 75% certain it will be in this area and 90% certain it will involve providing services to people and families near the poverty line. I do as much volunteer work through the law school as is physically possible for me (and sometimes more than that), because helping single mothers get divorce paperwork filled out on a guy who left years ago so they can get onto a public benefit program, or helping people get their criminal records expunged so they can get employment, or giving people copies the statutes and forms they need to get a court to force their landlord to turn the damn heat up, or etc. is pretty much my favorite thing ever. Bike rides, live music, rock climbing, reading, video games, and occasional partying/hijinks with friends are all vying for second place.

**So what's your biggest flaw?** I'm ADHD as all hell, so active listening can be a real challenge for me, and I can generally be a bit hyperactive and overwhelming if I don't keep a handle on myself. Also, I tend to over-commit my time, so I'm late to things or have to cancel them with short-notice more often than I'd like.

**What about sexy-times?** I'd probably also be willing to help you out if you're just looking for an FWB or someone to trade pics with. I'm really here to get more first date/talking to new women practice, but I feel like I have to offer since I know there's a shortage of guys out there who are looking for anything like that :P

**I'm shallow, what do you look like?**I'm narcissistic, so I don't mind telling you! I'm quite short (5'4"") and slender bordering on scrawny (between 110-120), with a dense but closely groomed brown beard and medium short brown hair that's usually going a minimum of 3 different directions at the same time and smelling somewhere in between coffee, cigarettes, spicy food, and printer ink. There's a fight for the soul of my closet right now between a stereotypical late 90's stoner/slacker and one of those maddeningly sanctimonious young professionals from the 00's, so depending on how far you catch me away from laundry day you'll be getting either collared shirts or poorly fitting hoody sweaters.

**What's a good story about yourself you could tell me?** On the 1st day of an unpaid internship in the juvenile division of the Department of Corrections I helped get a kid into state funded counseling instead of being sent a hundred miles away to a locked facility.

**What's a bad story about yourself you could tell me?** The 1st time I ever received head I ended up having to jump out a second story window and outrun angry frat-bros. 

**Alright, *if* I reply, do you expect me to answer all these same questions?** Nope, I expect you to do whatever you want. I'd like someone who is at least willing to consider meeting in IRL, but I'll read anything interesting and reply to everything I can find the time for. I'm willing to exchange pictures as long as there's a good faith effort to be reciprocal.

**What's it mean if I sent you a message a while ago and you still haven't replied?** Probably that there's a mound of work I'm stuck underneath at the moment. Sometimes I need to disappear off of reddit for 2 or 3 weeks at a time, so please don't take it personally if I can't get back to you promptly."

There's a fight for the soul of my closet right now between a stereotypical late 90's stoner/slacker and one of those maddeningly sanctimonious young professionals from the 00's, so depending on how far you catch me away from laundry day you'll be getting either collared shirts or poorly fitting hoody sweaters.

**What's a good story about yourself you could tell me?** On the 1st day of an unpaid internship in the juvenile division of the Department of Corrections I helped get a kid into state funded counseling instead of being sent a hundred miles away to a locked facility.

**What's a bad story about yourself you could tell me?** The 1st time I ever received head I ended up having to jump out a second story window and outrun angry frat-bros. 

**Alright, *if* I reply, do you expect me to answer all these same questions?** Nope, I expect you to do whatever you want. I'd like someone who is at least willing to consider meeting in IRL, but I'll read anything interesting and reply to everything I can find the time for. I'm willing to exchange pictures as long as there's a good faith effort to be reciprocal.

**What's it mean if I sent you a message a while ago and you still haven't replied?** Probably that there's a mound of work I'm stuck underneath at the moment. Sometimes I need to disappear off of reddit for 2 or 3 weeks at a time, so please don't take it personally if I can't get back to you promptly."

My dating history has been horrible. I have been used, taken advantage of and even raped by a ""friend"". I was in a really bad place and felt horribly worthless after that. I compensated by acting like I was fine. No, I acted like I was invincible. I slept with anyone, went clubbing, got hit on quite easily (I've been told I am pretty), the works. Literally the only reason I stopped was because I had an STD scare.

Alright, I'm fine on my own, I will focus on school. That was my mentality. And for a while I was ok. It was hard (the ""friend"" is in my very small program and i see him daily while the rest of my year thinks I am a huge slut rather than the truth of what he did, somehow he came out to be the victim) but I was ok, had amazing grades and a few close friends to keep me going. 

This is where the story starts.

You see there was this guy a year above me who was also very focused on school. He is a perfectionist and very hardworking, something that I find very attractive. (Most, if not all the guys I have seen so far have been lazy and don't know where they are going... last time I hear one of them was caught up in a pyramid scheme.)

Anyways, this guy (who literally looks like enrique iglesias) is a year above me and I needed a textbook. I've always been intrigued by him  and we often spoke and hung out so I though nothing of it when he suggested I walk with him to go to get the book at his place. He lived close to the school and I needed the book for the next day.

One thing led to another and we end up hooking up. He was really sweet but I was so damaged I knew nothing could come of it. Alright story's over right? Nope.

We end up spending more time together, sharing ideas and stories, generally getting to know each other. Somewhere in there I realize I want to be a better person and that he makes me want to be better. Not that he fixes me. This is important. But that I want to make myself better for him. I slowly eliminate my vices, of which there were many, and begin standing up for myself to my parents ( my relationship with them is complicated and while I love them and would do anything for them, they are horrible people to me, I should be moving out soon) and start being a person that I am proud to be. Got an internship in my field of study, I am much more confident, and while I am still learning I know I am on a much better path. 

All the while I am still hanging out with this guy. Which turns into seeing him, which turns into him saying we are dating. We fully support each other, help one another, and are real with each other (babe, you are obsessing, that's a stupid idea don't do that, hey that project turned out amazing!)

I have come to realization that I love this guy and would do anything for him. I finally work up the nerve to tell him and he feels that same *happy dance*

Here's the thing, he graduates this year and was only in the country for school. He is moving back and will be far away and needs to set up his life. I still have a year of school but want to be with him. Plus my student loans are cripplingly scary. 

I want a LDR but know that its not a permanent solution. He wants me to visit as much as possible. 

the kicker? He's not sure if he can be exclusive with me so far away. His needs, he feels, will make him unfaithful and while he said he wants to try, wants to make sure we stay friends if it doesn't work. THIS CRUSHED ME. 

If he loves me how can it be that hard to go without for a year until I finish school and then we decide if I move with him? How can that even be a concern? What the hell happened to wanting to be with just one person? 

I honestly don't know how this is going to turn out. Am I being too demanding? the thought of him with another woman absolutely destroys me. Advice or thoughts?

Last week while we were distracted by the events in Boston and West, TX the House of Representatives betrayed us and passed HR 624: The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (aka CISPA).  This bill is the successor to last years SOPA and PIPA bills.

I urge everyone that reads this to call their Senator. CISPA needs to be shut down in the senate! Knowing what to do when you call is of vital importance.  First off when you call you aren't going to talk to the senator personally. One of their secretary's aides or interns will answer. Tell them you want to speak with Mr./Ms. So an' So. They will tell you that the senator is in a meeting right now. Tell them that you are calling in regards to HR 624. Or, the Cyber Intelligence Sharing Protection Act. Say you know that your house representative voted (Yea) (you can verify your congressman's vote here: http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/113-2013/h117) and you demand that the senator vote (NAY!). 

They will say they will pass the word along to the senator. This is now the important part, ask them if they need your phone number because you expect a call back. They will say they have it, and probably read it out to you. Tell them if you don't receive a call back from the senator you WILL be calling them back. Then give your address, so that they will know you live in state. 

Finally follow through with the call back.  If you do not here a call back within 24 hours call back and repeat, pointing out that you are calling back because you did not receive the callback you requested.

For my friends in Texas here is our senators information.  Calling the DC office is preferred as that is their main line of communication.

Looking at the sheet makes me sick, makes me hate the person that I am, the way I grew up, the position I am in, the pressure that suffocates me. I was never a smart person and I do try hard but circumstances never allow me to do what I wanted, from tragedies problems in my household I should have dropped the courses but reasoning with myself saying ""you'll just neeed to try harder for the final"" never happens.

First off, let me say that I have wanted this pregnancy for about 4 years, and have done a tremendous amount to prepare. My SO and I have been married 11.5 years, I have a stable job, and we are very happily married. That all said, I am absolutely freaking out right now because of the state of our finances. SO is in school getting his master's degree, and while he has a part-time job (""internship"") that brings in about $1000 a month, we are living outside our means as it is. We have accumulated significant credit card debt- when I took my current job after graduating from school, we owed $25,000 with our two cards. My SO decided that, since he was going back to school, we would pay down our CC debt by taking out student loans for him. So now, we have traded copious CC debt for copious student loan debt (how much, I don't know as he kind of won't tell me). Oh yeah, still have $12000 in CC debt. We have an underwater mortgage (not terribly underwater, probably only $10,000, but still), but at least we own both our cars outright.

I have set up budgets in the past, but neither of us seem to be able to abide by them. And while I know that we share the blame for our predicament, there is a growing part of me that really resents some of the actions of my SO when it comes to money. He never knows how much we have in checking. He knows I set up a budget, but when I tell him he can't get something because we can't afford it, he gets incredibly defensive. I feel like I have really taken on the bulk of the financial responsibility, but clearly this isn't working at all. So now I am trying to figure out how we are going to afford our baby arriving in October. Our parents (both sides) are incredibly generous and willing to pitch in for just about anything, but a big part of me just wants to scream ""I REFUSE TO LET YOU BAIL US OUT AGAIN, I'M FREAKIN' 33 YEARS OLD"". There is no way I am letting our parents finance things for us just because we aren't responsible enough to actually live within our means.

I think that the bulk of this rant can really come down to that- I feel like I have been incredibly irresponsible the past 8 years or so with our finances. And now that my SO has finally come on board with the idea of raising a family, I am realizing how much this will impact our future AND our baby's future... and I am freaking out. And, of course, when I freak out about one thing I freak out about lots of things. Like how long it has been since I cleaned (like really cleaned). Our house is disgusting, I often wonder what someone would think of me if they came by unannounced. Our poor cat is out of his wet cat food and has been for 3 days. He has dry food, but have either my SO or I actually gone the 1.5 miles to the store to get him the food he really enjoys eating? No! How am I supposed to care for a baby when I can't even take care of my cat?

Add to this a general lack of friends of any sort within 500 miles, and you will see why I am sitting on my bed crying. I just feel so overwhelmed with feelings of failure and irresponsibility, and I just don't have anyone who will listen. I don't even know if I need anyone to tell me what to do. I feel like I need a swift kick in the ass, someone to tell me to just buck up and start being an adult. And maybe just as importantly, someone to do the same to my SO. Cuz I feel like he stopped listening to me about these things because it never, ever changes.

So yeah, that's my rant. Wish I felt better..."

I'm just about to enter the job arena and am very fearful that I may not have any valuable skill to offer a company. My code quality isn't always great and there are so many areas I can improve. 

I predominantly program in Python and Javascript, but I've worked to some level with just about every commonly used web dev language in the book. I can pick up any language I need to, but I fear my lack of ""expert"" knowledge in PHP or Java might hurt me. 

To keep this short I'll just list some unique skills/traits I have and if you could give me some direction as to what type of web jobs I should be applying for (internships, entry-levels, etc) or just where you think I fall in general, I would really greatly appreciate it. 

* Bachelors in Business/IT and Associates in Web Development
* I've made a few open-source projects on my Github http://www.github.com/abeisgreat
* I've built a few tiny web applications like http://www.2Dizzle.com, http://www.query2json.com, http://www.tawx.tv
* I'm one of the youngest graduates of my university ever, finishing up my bachelors in May at age 18.
* I have little work experience, when I was 15 I interned at a school district helping with computer support and networking and when I was 16 I got a full time student-worker job at my university as a ""web developer assistant"" which was mostly writing HTML/JS for their existing pages.
* When I was 17 I created one of my largest web applications, a book exchange software for students at my university and a few months later I sold the exclusive rights to the software to a small start-up focused on education software.
* In my hobby projects I've worked a lot with different front-end tools like Sass, Less, Haml, and Coffeescript and I also know a lot of jQuery, Backbone, Underscore, and Knockout.

I've been living on my own for two years and I've been living off the savings from my previous work and sale of my book exchange, plus help from my parents as I finish school, I'm really fearful I won't be able to find work and I'm running out of time to learn new skills before I'll have to start bringing in money. 

Although more of a side-note, I currently live and attend school in Milwaukee, but I'm looking to move to Madison in the summer, so if anyone has specific advice about valuable skills to have for that job climate, I'd really appreciate it as well.

Thanks so much :)

1cs57b,2,2013-04-20,[22m] What does that even mean?,dajinn,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1cs57b/22m_what_does_that_even_mean/,"I[22m] was dating a teacher intern from work. She is [27f](of course). We went on 2 dates, and we both had a nice time. After each date she would text saying she had a nice time and that she looks forward to hearing from me. Things were just going way too slow for me though. She could basically only hang out every other weekend since she teaches + works at a dance studio practically every day and is constantly performing.

I always gave her space and stuff though, didn't bug her at work and rarely(and I do mean rarely)texted her since I could see that she was really stressed from her obligations. I got her flowers a few times, though.

Anyway, I got brave and asked her if she preferred that our dating be exclusive. Her response was ""No, truth be told, I am not looking for a serious relationship right now"". Like honestly I didn't have any expectations that we would be bf/gf after one date but I thought that with the way things were going that it would eventually end up there. I just don't like to be played when I could be keeping my options open so that's why I even asked her to know if I could pursue other avenues. By being ""played"" I mean not really having any kind of talk about what the dating is and if we could still see other people, I guess. I am cool with being exclusive but it needs to be in the air.

So what does her response even mean, aside from itself literally? If you weren't why would you even be going on a date with a guy and kissing and being physically affectionate. She is rather spiritual so I would not say she is just looking for adult fun. We went dutch at dinner too since she offered so she didn't go out with me just to get free dinner. And I know that if you're stressed with work a relationship might not be a good idea. But again why bother? Is it to seek a sort of confirmation bias? Sigh."

**2,326** cubers for **3 years!**

A drunk, a single mom, and her child walk into a bar. The mom points out the drunk.  
""Don't end mixed up like him,"" she says to her kid, ""once you're like that, there's no coming back!"".

Sobering up is a lot like a puzzle: you start out with a given arrangement of objects (be it an alcohol addicted mind, jigsaw pieces, or words), and you have to array them into a specific pattern to 'solve' the puzzle. You start out mixed up--a drunk, and then end up solved--a functioning member of society.

[The comic.](http://i.imgur.com/kTuJc.jpg)

In 1974, Ernő Rubik created the best selling puzzle ever made. This toy, the Rubik's Cube (formerly the ""Magic Cube""), sold hundreds of millions of copies worldwide. The end goal, the ""sobered up version"", is to get all of the sides of this 6-sided cube into uniform colors. The challenge presented by this puzzle is simple, but incredibly difficult to the uninitiated. The ability to solve a Rubik's cube (sober up the drunk) has become a trope in pop culture--many [movies](http://i.imgur.com/q3R9DQg.jpg) use this skill to establish a highly intelligent character.

It was not surprising that this bestselling, intelligence-proving puzzle garnered a massive following throughout the world. Major competitions to see who could solve it the fastest were quickly made a reality. The first Rubik's competition was held in 1981, followed by the creation of the WCA (World Cube Association), which lead to numerous other competitions as a result. To this day, the speedsolving community is small but strong. A large portion of the speedsolving community is consolidated on their forum, [speedsolving.com](http://speedsolving.com).

In the crossover between [reddit.com](http://reddit.com) and [speedsolving.com](http://speedsolving.com), however, lies a small niche subreddit, /r/Cubers.

&gt;## What content do you like to see on /r/Cubers? What is your favorite post?

&gt;&gt; **kpattycakes** Personally I like to see higher level strategy discussions. There are some ridiculously fast cubers on this subreddit and getting their input is always nice. Although it wasn't on /r/Cubers, my favorite post is definitely Feliks Zemdeg's AMA. Kid is a beast!

&gt;&gt; **Nova11** I like seeing posts on r/cubers of people's success stories, whether it's someone getting a sub-30 solve, or someone finishing the first two layers of a cube. I also enjoy the posts where people have received random acts of kindness, like when somebody receives a cube in the mail, after posting a comment saying ""I really want a Zhanchi, but I don't have enough money."". Also, I don't really have a favorite post.

&gt;&gt; **jrockIMSA08** My favorite posts are the success stories of people getting faster, however I have to give a shout out to ChraneD and his crazy sick 3d printed cube which made the front page, and while not technically on r/cubers it was cross-posted, and I think that sort of thing makes people see our crazy hobby in an awesome light.

&gt;## When and why did you start speedcubing?

&gt;&gt; **Ilyanep** I got into speedcubing in high school (I attended the same one as my co-moderators Klarkshroder and JrockIMSA08) when Rubik's Cubes became something of a fad around my school. Being a high school student, I wanted to be involved in the cool new thing (I remember begging my parents to buy me a Rubik's Cube, since I didn't really know much better; definitely had to lube and resticker it not much after, but there were kids at my school who were like cube accessory dealers). Being the sort of person who's into things like math, CS, and physics, it definitely stuck with me.

&gt;&gt; **kpattycakes** Well, my story is slightly more depressing than everybody else's here. I got into speedcubing because it was the summer after my girlfriend of 4 years and I had broken up (2011). I was back in my home town working an engineering internship I couldn't stand. None of my close friends were in town and well... I was majorly depressed. I saw an old Rubik's cube I had from when I was a kid sitting in my drawer and decided ""screw it, I'm gonna do something instead of being mopey"". I looked up Lars Petrus's tutorial on how to solve a Rubik's cube, and the rest is history.

&gt;&gt; **Nova11** I started speedcubing on Halloween last year; I picked up a cube, determined to finally solve it. I spent the night at a friends house, and after 6 hours of solid reading and following instructions, I finished my first ever solve. I progressed extremely quickly, and was sub 2 minutes from memory within a week or 2.

&gt;&gt; **jrockIMSA08** Like Ilyanep says, we (Klarshroder + us two) knew each other from high school. I remember Klarkshroder teaching me to cube when he was done with work and I was procrastinating.

&gt;## What do you like about speedcubing?

&gt;&gt; **kpattycakes** Ever since I was a young kid I noticed that I was not a competitive person. I didn't like team sports, and felt no need to be ""the best"" at any of the clubs I was involved in (band and drama). My hobbies now consist mostly of activites in which I purely compete against myself (powerlifting and speedcubing).

&gt;&gt; **Nova11** What I love about speedcubing is the feeling it gives you. I've always loved puzzles, but this was the one I could never get. I still remember that feeling of ""WHAT?! I JUST SOLVED A RUBIKS CUBE? MOM, COME HERE!!!"" and that's why I stuck with it, progressing within the hobby (sport?) of cubing continued to make me feel exhilarated.

&gt;&gt; **jrockIMSA08** Cubing to me is a really friendly competition. You aren't competing against the other people as much as you are competing against the puzzle. So you get a really great community around it.

&gt;&gt; **Ilyanep** I've never really gotten quite as into speedcubing as everyone else in the sub (and to be honest, my solve times are awful), but I like the competition-with-self aspect of it. It's also why I enjoy Starcraft so much!

&gt;## Besides the normal 3x3 Rubik's cube, are there any other puzzles you partake in? (Jigsaw, word, 'megaminx', etc)

&gt;&gt; **jrockIMSA08** I have a megaminx and teraminx, but don't really play with them much.

&gt;&gt; **Ilyanep** I'm actually a bigger fan of playing with other puzzles and trying to figure them out. I've probably cheated more than figured out on my own on the 3x3, but I own nxn cubes for n \in {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, a Square-1, and a fairly poorly constructed Sudoku Cube. This isn't to say I've had the time to sit down and figure them out, but I've taken the approach of trying to figure them out on my own with these.

&gt;&gt; **Nova11** I own a decent-sized collection, and I'd have to say my favorites are 5x5, 2x2, and 7x7.

&gt;&gt; **kpattycakes** I have a decent collection going... maybe 15 or so puzzles, but I only solve 2x2-4x4 for speed. My most fun puzzle is the Lan-Lan Mastermorphix. It's solves just like a 3x3 but it looks so cool when it's scrambled!

&gt;## How has the experience of moderating /r/Cubers been? Subreddit history?

&gt;&gt; **Nova11** I've had a great time being a mod of r/cubers. I haven't been active for a while, but it's been a good time.

&gt;&gt; **kpattycakes** Good. As jrockIMSA08 said, we've had some rogue posters that we've had to ban, but nothing major. We're currently looking in to how to deal with all the ""look at my new best time!"" posts, but I think we'll have a good solution soon. It feels a little odd getting to the point of popularity where you have to make these decisions, but I'm glad I'm a part of it with the other mods. They all seem like level headed dudes who just like to cube.

&gt;&gt; **Ilyanep** Klarkshroder, JrockIMSA08 and I founded the subreddit over a summer when we noticed that there wasn't already a subreddit for people who liked geometric puzzles and were extremely surprised by this fact. We didn't do too much advertising, and figured it'd become one of those subreddits that was just obscure and not too active. Like six months later, I took a look and noticed that we suddenly had several hundred subscribers. That was both awesome and a WTF moment at the same time. There was also the part where I never really expected to have to perform very many moderator-style duties and here I was suddenly watching over a fair amount of content. Fortunately, the other mods (especially JrockIMSA08 at first) have picked up a lot of my slack (like here).

&gt;&gt;The subreddit kept growing, which was pretty great. Suddenly, there were calls for ""Why isn't Nova11 a moderator?!"" and since Nova11 was fairly active in the community (running competitions and other stuff like that), we decided to make him a moderator. He's been very helpful. The story for how kpattycakes became a mod is very similar, but happened a few months later.

&gt;&gt;Right now, we're hitting the point where we can't really have no rules at all, so the mods have been trying to come up with some ways to keep order (we've started a weekly questions thread, and are trying to make a weekly bragging thread so that we don't have 50% of the front page be cube collection and personal best times posts, for example). It's bizarre because I've seen several subreddits undergo this transition, but never been part of having to make it.

&gt;&gt;I hope to keep growing and getting awesome content! It is very nice to see all the activity in the cubing community, since I never looked into it outside of my high school and now my college.

&gt;&gt; **jrockIMSA08** It's been pretty easy, overzealous spam filter, and a couple spammers we banned pretty quickly. But because we've just sort of grown organically I think we've avoided the worst of it so far."

I'm a recent college graduate, who after ~6 months of underemployment, has landed a fun job relevant to my degree.

Thanks to a bunch of scholarships (which I can thank reddit and fastweb for helping me find), 2 jobs, an internship, and a cheap state school, I have a degree with zero student loans. 

Between my two jobs now, I earn ~$3,500 per month after taxes. My expenses are very minimal (rent + gas + car ins + food ) leaving me with around $2,000, so I really want to start saving aggressively. That being said, here's what I need to know:

- I need a Roth IRA. FAQ says Vanguard is a great resource. Anything else I should know that isn't covered in the FAQ? Or maybe an idiot's guide to starting one...

- I need to establish some credit. What card does a guy like me get? FAQ says a secured card, but I'd really like to avoid separating myself from those bucks... Plus I had a brief car loan, so I do have some shred of credit (CreditKarma says 656? I did a FAQ-suggested softpull from Experian and didn't see a single number on it...)

- My current business doesn't have a 401(k) deal, but I have an old one from my high-school job with some money in it. What should I do with it?

- What are some bad habits/investments/scammish things to avoid? I want to join a gym, but so many have such sketchy reviews and crazy contracts...

Thanks for your help!

*EDIT* Following IAmDanimal's advice, I did more research about rolling over my stagnant 401(k) to a Roth IRA. Looks like the 401(k), managed by J.P.Morgan, can be rolled into a ""Tax Deferred IRA"" automagically online, but if I call them weekdays during business hours, they'll do a Roth IRA.

It drives my scientific curiosity and my love for my school work, it is my motivation. Last semester was the first semester that I was eligible to apply for an internship so I searched for any opening I could find and applied for a total of 11 positions all around the US. I was so excited I made plans to spend this current semester working at a COOP but then one by one the emails came back with either ""You were not selected"" or ""You were not among the 'Who may apply?'"" and as they came in I became more and more depressed, until there was no joy left in my day. I resentfully applied to approximately 20 other positions with other companies, only to be completely ignored. I entered into this semester completely shattered, with no direction. I have only recently come to realize the extent the damage, and I am trying to rekindle my motivation so I can feel like I am working towards something. I am thinking about changing my major to something more suited to NASA,  I want to know if I am on the wrong path or if I should stick with it.

SRS really should have a relationship based subreddit!  Anyway, the following may be a bit long.

  I have been when my current boyfriend for 3 years.  We are both 21 and he is graduating college soon with a job already lined up in computer science.  I have to take an extra semester with a Zoology degree and I don't know what to do but I like birds.  Currently, one of my main issues is that I have no financial help from anyone but my bf and I just lost my lab job because my supervisor left and i'm currently having a hard time trying to find a paid internship.  I'm in debt because of my hospital bills--I was hospitalized for pancreatitis in december and now i'm sure it's chronic because I have random bouts of pain.  I eat healthy and exercise so no one knows what it is.  I do know that my stress levels, anxiety, and depression makes it a ton worse.  Lately, I have been pretty sad.  I usually have dysthymia coupled with anxiety but lately it's been getting worse.  My boyfriend is incredibly socially inept, and has no friends besides me.   Even though i'm his only friend, I feel that most of the time he really doesn't care about the things that I am really passionate about.  I have changed dramatically these past three years and have gained lots of new interest including my extreme passion with birds, feminism, and environmentalism.  He hasn't changed at all, and spends 90% of his time playing GW2, which is a great game but I rarely have time to play video games anymore.  I used to play with him before my video card died on my desktop.  I really don't have that much interest in playing anymore though.  The main think i'm interested in is birds and nature.  I'm really passionate about nature and I want to be as self-sufficient as possible.  My boyfriend comes from a rich, catholic, Italian family and grew up in the city. (I am quite the opposite) I have talked to him a lot about what I wish to do in the future.  Today at the grocery store I told him to get some organic apples and he comes back with regular apples.  I ask him why he didn't get organic, and he said it ""didn't matter"".  This really hurt me, because it tells me that he hasn't been listening to anything I've been saying.  The title quote refers to something said a couple months ago during a fight with one of his friends (see my previous post quoting his shitlord friend).  I always think of this quote when i'm upset even if he apologized for it later.




   I think about the future a lot, and I don't want to be a housewife, which he considers to be a full-time job.  I see his mom, who had to quit her job as a chemical engineer, who discovered a new technique and had it patented, to raise four kids.  Honestly, I think i'd be happier doing research with birds and adopting parrots instead of having kids.  I've gone to couples counseling and I still go to my own counseling but I'm just not happy.  The problem is that I have no money, and if it wasn't for my boyfriend I wouldn't be able to eat.  I can barely pay my half of the rent.  In terms of my family, my little sister is going through cancer so my mother relies on government support in order to support herself and my sister.  My step-father is in jail because I spoke up about my 8 years of sexual/mental/physical abuse me and my step-sister suffered.  My biological father is wealthy, but is about as much help as a rotten cabbage.  Whenever I tell my friends, they pretty much agree that my life sucks.  I see that, but it doesn't really help me.  I'm not sure what to do anymore."

About a month ago my girlfriend broke up with me. It was my first full relationship. Since then we have managed to leave everything on good terms and stop contacting each other to help us both move on.

However, we live around the corner from each other... I walk past her house every time I leave or come back to my house. It is so painful to know sometimes that she is right inside as I walk past.

In a week I will be going back to my hometown for a summer internship. She is graduating [I graduate in Dec.] and will be probably moving to a new city for a job she offered sometime this summer (it is a research position and they are waited to hear back and see if they will have the funding to pay her, it seems promising).

Assuming they get the funding and she takes the job we will no longer be living in the same city and will possibly never see each other again. Although the city she is going to has been my top choice to move to after college for a while, there is an alternative route to my life that I may take which will potentially ensure that we never see each other again. 

The last time I saw her was last Sunday morning, that was when I told her we should stop contacting each other. In a weeks time I may never see her again. The idea that this person I love, the first person I fell in love with, is never going to even be in my line of sight terrifies me. I have no idea how to handle this.

Thanks for the advice all, I appreciate it."

I accepted an invitation to serve as an economic development position with the Peace Corps in Paraguay in late May 2013. I graduated from BU with an economics major statistics minor in December 2011 and have been working in real estate and operating an internet start up in Boston. From September 2012-December 2012, I taught math in Ghana. I have been to Africa before to volunteer, and I really enjoy it. I returned to Boston in early March to work until I left....until I met the most amazing girl I have ever met. Now trust me, I have been with a lot of women in my 23 years of life, so I know how to distinguish the good girls from the bad ones. I have been with my new girl ever since I got to Boston (I know not that long), but I have never fallen in love this quickly. We are completely mentally and physically connected (we have a lot of the greatest, passionate sex I have ever had), we work together, yet I have honestly never been this connected to someone. She is also gorgeous, I can be myself around, we love all the same things (food, music, relaxation activities) and I miss her every second she isn't with me. 

There lies my huge problem. The Peace Corps is a 27 month commitment and we have already discussed this topic a couple times, yet I always say we will discuss it later. I have done a long distance relationship in the past, and it didn't work, yet that girl was also crazy and this girl isn't. I have thought a couple times of bagging the Peace Corps and continuing to work/live in Boston, however I have wanted to do the Peace Corps for years. I have planned to travel throughout South America next year on a couple month journey and she really wants to visit me, but I don't know whether to trust my feelings (I am completely in love) or the other half of my brain that says this relationship is too premature to give up on something I have wanted to do for years. Another part of me says that leaving her could be the stupidest thing I have ever done. My career options aren't fucked either. I had a lot of finance internships in college (was suppose to go into banking but ended up in real estate), have created a couple businesses (my internet startup is doing well), and have volunteered throughout the world. WHAT DO I DO????? If I lose this girl (no girl I have ever been with comes close to comparing), I will regret it the rest of my life. "

I am getting married this October. The wedding planning has been going great (because my mom has done ALL the planning). Anyway, a couple months ago my maid of honor got engaged, and she asked me to be her maid of honor. We had a talk before they got engaged about me being the maid of honor, and I told her that I have a job internship this summer for 3 months out of state and that I will be moving in the winter out of state. She seemed upset about this, and I told her if I was the maid of honor I couldn't really help with the planning cause I won't be here, but I would do my best from a different state. I also told her that I COMPLETELY understood if she wanted someone else that would be around to be the maid of honor. She asked me to be the maid of honor anyway. So she is getting married June of 2014. So today she has been texting me about how she suddenly realized I won't be able to help her plan and she is very upset with me. I told her we talked about this months ago, and that once again if she wanted to have a different maid of honor that I wouldn't be upset. She said no, that she still wants me to be the maid of honor, BUT SHE KEPT TEXTING ABOUT HOW BAD OF A MAID OF HONOR I AM BEING/WILL BE... She was also complaining about how she has done SO MUCH for my wedding and that it's ""not fair"" that I can't do much for her's. All she has done is go with me to pick the place and helped pick the bridesmaid dresses. I went with her to pick her place!!! and the bridesmaid dresses won't be bought for a long time (I mean the wedding is over a year away). I have done everything she has asked of me. I just don't understand.


It is getting to the point I don't want to be the maid of honor because she is making me feel bad. :( Does anyone understand her point of view? What do I do in this situation? What do I say?

1cw63f,11,2013-04-22,Undergrad seeking advice/knowledge,eggdrum,Physics,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/1cw63f/undergrad_seeking_adviceknowledge/,"Hello r/Physics! I figure this is as good as place as any to seek some advice in the crazy world of physics.

I am a sophomore, undergrad Physics major at a not-so-great ranked university in Chicago, IL. I currently have a 3.75 GPA. I have an Interdisciplinary Concentration which means I am carrying out a minor in a field that could go along with Physics. My minor is Sound Design for Digital Cinema because I love sound and this gives me an outlet for not only creative work but also to become familiar with sound equipment and software.

I will be starting my first research experience this coming summer. I'm researching how embodied learning experiences affect the understanding of physical phenomena for introductory physics students. It's pretty basic, but it's something at least.

I come to r/physics because I have no idea if I'm in the right place and if I should be doing something else. I was lucky enough to get lots of scholarships to this University. Should I look into possibly transferring schools? I do have a strong foundation of connections here in Chicago and I have an awesome internship at a local music venue doing band hospitality.

Also, is there a good resource for researching grad schools? I know some of the big name schools, but I have no idea if I can get into those. I also have no idea what concentration of physics I'm drawn to. I really like sound. I think astronomy is fascinating, but my school offers little in this area. Where can I learn more about these concentrations?

Thinking more into the future, I think I would like to do research. I know a lot of people say many physics majors go into finance, but that sounds like the worst thing ever. The laboratory at Gran Sasso in Italy sounds amazing to me because the research there sounds interesting and I've taken classes in Latin and Italian.

Thanks for any replies!"

Let's see how this goes.,[deleted],stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1cw3kl/day_one_lets_see_how_this_goes/,"Got drunk for the first time 20 years ago.  I was in 7th grade and was staying up late to finish making a poster or some dumb thing for school. Folks had gone to bed, so I opened up their liquor cabinet.  Pulled out a handle of Cuervo Gold and a shot glass and started taking shots.  After about 5-6, I was having the time of my life.  Since then it's been pretty much non-stop. I've gotten several DUIs, which was the motivation I needed to go back to school.

I moved home with my folks, enrolled in college, and am set to graduate with a BS in computer science next fall.  Last weekend was my 32nd birthday, and I have decided that I need to make a change.  During the past two years that I've been away at college, there hasn't been a single night when I didn't drink.

I was recently offered a summer internship as a computer programmer, but the day after I signed and returned the offer letter, I got a notice to provide consent to a background check.  Still waiting to hear back as to whether my past record will cause the company to rescind the offer.

Not ready to request a badge here just yet, as it would be height of shame to have to message the mods tomorrow and tell them to reset it.

Just going to take it one day at a time and see what happens."

1cw31r,5,2013-04-22,[Texas] The Michael Sword Test results.,EWNightmare13,AssassinOrder,https://www.reddit.com/r/AssassinOrder/comments/1cw31r/texas_the_michael_sword_test_results/,"I've spent the past few days running tests on the sword. I've actually come up with some interesting results.

The most noticeable change the sword underwent was its weight. It went from 8lbs (3.62Kg for our EU brothers) to 2lbs (.91Kg). Basically from something that would be almost impossible to use in battle to something that could be used on a regular basis without wearing out the wielder too quickly. How a 4ft sword can way 8lbs to begin with is strange. Being that heavy and that small is surprising to say the least.

The second change is its strength. The sword seems to be unbreakable, holding myself and two SR&amp;D interns on the blade with nothing to support us. I'm not going to push it any farther, seeing that I don't want to risk actually losing it.

The third change it overtook was, well surprising to say the least, and far beyond anything we are capable of these days. There is a powerful alternating current that resonates at extremely high frequencies surging through it at all times. This means that it can loosen the atomic bonds between atoms. Basically it makes it so that it can cut through almost anything. I was able to cut through a car with one swing. The metal was glowing red, almost as though it had been cut with a plasma cutter, and the cut was straight all the way through, even where the blade couldn't reach. After some testing on ballistic gel, however, I have concluded that it has no extra effects against skin. 

Fourth, I have been puzzled by what Minerva said, about my enemy's blood healing my wounds. I finally figured out what this means. Basically, by wounding another person, with the sword, it channels their ""life force"" so to speak, into me and heals the wielder's wounds an equal amount to the damage done to the victim. I am not proud of how I discovered this, but the SR&amp;D is a dangerous place. (There were no fatalities)

Finally, another accident, but this one not as bad. It seems only certain people are able to actually pick up the sword. I once asked an intern to hand it to me, and he could only struggle as he attempted to remove it from the table, whereas another handed to me as simply as a pencil. I'm not sure what criteria it uses to decide who can and cannot use it.

All in all, this sword was a great find for us.

On another note, it seams my friend Reaper as found my lab, but has taken no action other than leaving notes. They're all the same as the one I found at the orphanage, but it's very unsettling."

A resume can be provided to the proper email address.  I would love to work in any gallery/museum environment where I would get to actively engage with the art/artists/the public.  However, anyone in need of an all-around usable and worthwhile employee, I'd love to hear from you as well.  Please message me Via PM with your email so I can send you my resume.

I have extensive research capabilities, references available from the Museum and Gallery field, am extremely hard working, and self-motivated.  I work well with others as part of a team, but also work well by myself.  My paid work history includes clerical work, managerial experience, and a lot of customer service positions, so I would work well in virtually any role.

As an intern for my university's small gallery, I have been a founding member of a now-annual project highlighting art by artists with disabilities; once as part of an overseeing council, and once as the project head.  I have also researched, identified, and cataloged a large collection of Billy Graham era rock and roll posters, as well as been project head for multiple smaller-scale exhibitions around campus over the course of two years.

I''ll just start with a bit of background. I'm 25. In college I did a few internships in Software testing. After college I worked in a startup as a Business Analyst for 2 years which did not really take off. The plan was to do an MBA after that, but i'm not entirely sure if I want to do that, and I'm not ready to spend hundreds and thousands of dollars on something I'm not sure about. 

For the past few weeks I have been dabbling in Rails whenever I get the time. I have some programming experience and always had an interest in it and I really want to make a career out of it. But I'm unsure if this is the right move. I graduated almost 3 years ago so I feel I'm 3 years too late to the party, plus I wonder if this career option will get too congested with youngsters since there are all these free courses online and if there's any career growth in it a few years down the line? 

But for the meantime. I'm thinking of brushing up on my java skills, finishing this small web app that i'm making on rails and host it online, and maybe make an ios app also and start applying for jobs. Also, I'm moving to the US next months so i'll have 3 months of sitting around to do before I get an employment permit. I'll be based in the tri-state area. What are some other things I can do to increase my job prospects.

Help?,ceb2011,finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1cvrl8/so_i_have_managed_to_land_a_summer_analyst/,"How this happened I will never know. I have a theoretical macroeconomics and political science background, am about to finish my Master's degree in June and applied for a finance internship 'for laughs'. 

I passed the online test and CV screening, and had a telephone interview which had some technical elements. I managed to reply about half of the questions asked (keep in mind most of the concepts I was asked about I had learned the day before) and stammered my way through more general 'direction of the market' questions. 

I thought I had performed poorly (and the feedback session with the interviewer confirmed this), however I got a call a few weeks later about a final round of interview, also on the phone (office is in Switzerland, I am in UK). I prepared as best as I could for these, howere I did not get A SINGLE finance or market related question in six interviews with 12 different bank employees. All were personal and motivational questions, which I can manage quite well, and I got an offer the next week. 

About the position: it is a specialised office that requires a certain level of cultural fluency that I have, however it is by no means difficcult to find people with this profile both in EU and America. 

So, two questions: 

How / why did this happen? 

How can I prepare? What to expect? What to read or know beforehand?

I live in Hong Kong (I'm European) and hold a master degree in economics and have about 6 years of work experience doing economics and finance (in Europe). However, I'm trying to change career and go into programming/software development, and I am currently doing a bachelor in computing at a university in Hong Kong.

It seems like this subreddit has a lot of advice coming from the US job market, but I was wondering if anyone has experience from the Hong Kong job market for people wanting to break into software development/programming here?  
Are Hong Kong employers looking for the same things as employers in the US? I'm thinking about having an internship on the CV, personal projects or participation in open source projects? or are they more focused on the degree? (or something else?).

Also, due to my situation, where I already hold one degree (my economics degree) and have work experience, would it be possible to begin applying for jobs (and getting one) before finishing my bachelor in computing? My bachelor study is a distance learning course (but they have TA sessions on weekends and evenings), so I could easily continue studying while having a job."

[SPOILERS]",[deleted],Bones,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bones/comments/1cvirc/this_show_took_a_few_wrong_turns_and_it_really/,"I know that it's not just me who feels this way, but this show has really taken a few wrong turns this season. I mean, the writing is super predictable, and I kind of feel like the acting has degraded (Bones' lines are so forced, and lack much conviction anymore.) - ""Yes. The Hyoid bone looks as if it were damaged. Line. The killer... must be strong. Line.""

One of the bigger issues, to me, was that at the end of season 7 when Bones took off on the run, they didn't extend that properly. She just ended up coming back during the beginning of season 8 when they could have drawn out the suspense by keeping her on the run during this season.


Another issue that I have is that they didn't do much with Zack's story. I mean... yes, we all know that in real life the actor was dealing with some personal issues (bi-polar) - but I just feel like they could have brought him back and done more with him in the mental hospital. He really was one of the most interesting characters throughout the entire series, and instead of replacing him properly with a different unique character, they bring in a dozen new interns with their own stories. That's alright, but it just didn't replace Zack. 

**Dancing episode** - The show really looked like it was about to jump the shark with that ""So you think you can dance"" episode, with the judges making a cameo appearance this season. That really broke the 4th wall for me. 

**Pelant** - They brought in this character who was such a interesting aspect to the show, yet they haven't shown him for like 8-9 episodes by now. The suspense it completely gone for me. We're back to each episode being fairly easy to break-down - it's always the first or 2nd person that they interview who ends up being the killer. 

**Bones/Booth Love story** - That aspect of this show pissed me off more than anything. We had an extremely lengthy build-up to their romance, and then it just ""happens"". No dating... not much passion. She just ends up pregnant and that's how they wrote her real-life pregnancy into the story.

Overall, the show is still entertaining, but I feel like I've seen it all before, and nothing much changes. They reuse the same formula over and over again, without much attempt at ""breaking the mold"" so to speak. The story-arch's are rare and far-in-between now. I will continue to watch, but I'm not as enthusiastic about this show as I was even up until last season. There's something really... ***lazy***... about this season. So much so that it makes me wonder how much time it's got left. "

I do I stop myself from hurting us?,lovedenial,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1cvber/my_f24_low_self_esteem_prevents_me_from_feeling/,"My boyfriend (M25) and I (F24) are in the healthiest relationship I've witnessed/experienced in the real world. We consider our relationship to be that of best friends, business partners, and lovers. We've been dating for ~1.5 years in Oregon but will be 'cementing' our partnership by moving to Massachusetts for a fantastic job offer he just received. We're moving now because I'm about to finish an internship and have no professional commitments afterwards, making this a very flexible time for me. 

I am scared about leaving my life in Portland but I am *100% confident* that this is the person I want to spend the rest of my life with. He feels the same way. However, I find it difficult to accept that he does love me and, thus, sometimes I feel like I'm waiting for him to change his mind about me and regret bringing me with him. He has given me absolutely no reason to think this way. He's actually a very affectionate, loving person. However, he expresses his romantic love more through buying me an occasional gift and cuddling than saying the sorts of future-tense stuff that I (think I) need to hear in order to 'know.' Verbalizing his feelings is *very* difficult for him. When I prompt him to say such things, it feels forced and scripted (duh). When he tries to remember on his own it feels forced (lacking visible emotion). Even his ""I love you"" sounds hollow to me most of the time. I'm insane.

I also have extremely low self esteem which I hide very well from other people. I am always shocked when people like me (I often find out I've made a friend after I've hung out with them for a few months. I just assume that they're killing time with me) and, furthermore, when they do I create scenarios to discredit their affection (*oh, she only thinks that she likes me because she's new in town, and is desperate for someone to hang out with, and I listen to her problems. she can't actually like me. that would be impossible!*) 

It hurts my boyfriend's feelings that I can't feel his love and it hurts me because on 80% of the occasions we hang out I spend a portion of time looking for hints of 'true' affection or some newly acquired distaste for me. 

This is illogical and it's not fair to my boyfriend nor myself. Therapy is not a financially viable option.
Any suggestions on any of this?

**TLDR: I don't LIKE myself and, thus, can't believe that my boyfriend LOVES me. My skepticism hurts both of us- how do I stop being insane?**"

I am not worried about the test and interviews as much and I am about my lack of experience hours.

I am a college student with a lot of big name journalism television shows I've worked at under my belt (specifically interned at TMZ, the local news station which is second in the nation for covering news, and another entertainment website.) However, in my search for internships this summer, I've also tacked on my resume that Women's Studies is my second major. I thought it would add some variety and show how dedicated I am that I would even have TWO majors in college. But I've noticed ever since I've done that, I have been receiving a very low amount of replies. Before, employers would see my resume and jump at the thought of hiring me as an intern because of how many internships I've done.

Has anyone with a Women's studies major experienced this? Or am I just going crazy? 

My cover letter and resume are exactly the same, just a difference of adding the major.
Just wanted to say I love this sub reddit and it's my first time posting to it. :)"

Not sure if this is the best subreddit to post this on and I would welcome any suggestions for a better place. 

I will be in Frankfurt for a 6-week internship starting at the end of May. The internship provides a small living stipend, but I am responsible for arranging housing during the stay. I am a B2 speaker under the CEFR, and I have lived in Hamburg and Stuttgart for abroad programs in the past, so the experience is not ""new."" I am still carrying around student debt so looking to do this reasonably (cheaper). Wondering if anyone here would have advice for someone in a situation like this. 

I have looked at WG gesucht and some of the other online websites. If anyone has used these extensively or has some general advice, it would be greatly appreciated (i.e. what is best to include when contacting, how to go about asking for shorter lease, ext.)

Are there some other sites or services that people here have used in the past? I would prefer to live with German roommates and my limit rent per month is around 600 euro. I have stayed in the Studenwerks in the past, and enjoyed it. Airbnb is also a site I have used, but I don't think that it makes sense for 6 weeks? I have used it for a weekend or week only. 

Only I think you have to be studying or a student when one stays there?

Any helpful advice appreciated. Vielen Dank!  "

My roommates helped me write up a Mahnung to send to my former boss (the head of the GmbH that closed down), and to the main company (an AG, if it matters). I am sending it out tomorrow (Einschreiben).

My problem is, I'd like to tell a couple of them, but quite frankly I'm scared. One of the guys I would peg as the type that is a homophobe, but wouldn't be an asshole about it, just treat me differently. A couple of them are really religious and I have felt judged through prior conversations and they didn't even know. 

I'm usually a very open person, but I don't fit the stereotypical gay description, so I've never really had to endure the hate from people.

Planning on getting the Surface Pro.

Background: Surface is being used to program, Android development mostly, along with playing simple/stupid games, Quake Live.  I understand it does not support Quake Live, but I plan on hopefully dual booting with Ubuntu and getting it to work there maybe?  Ultimately, this is a laptop replacement for an internship that's too far to bring my desktop. 

Some questions:

Type cover vs. Touch cover?  For programming, from what I've read online, I read touch would work best/is more accurate.

Programming.  Is it easy?  Can I do Android development?  Eclipse, not ideaJ.

Would it be smarter to get a real laptop, rather than a Surface?  I figured a Surface would work best as I get the mobility (I'm skating to/from work) and has enough productivity, that I can actually do my own thing on it.  But their may be an alternative that might be better?

That's really about it.  Any insight is appreciated =)."

Questions|Answers

[A bit more technical stuff: - Any tips on making the drums stand out in the mix? Where do your drum hits usually peak (in terms of frequencies\)? Tips on making snare tails (reverb\) be heard in electronic music? - Any tips on making a mix sound full without using too many tracks / sounding muddy? - Any tips on stereo placement? - What is one thing in engineering you wish you had known far earlier?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ctitw/my_dad_is_an_audio_engineer_who_has_worked_with/c9jujpl?context=5)|The right amount of compression is key to making drums stand out but it's important to make up the EQ after you compress it. Also, treat the sub-frequencies of the kick drum as a separate sound.
 |My kick drums typically peak at ~50Hz but also as far up as 1k.
 |Linear reverb is very useful.
 |Unfortunately, the only way to really do that is with top-of-the-line equipment and good microphone technique.
 |Stereo placement is really dependent on the situation; tends to be a more case-by-case situation.
 |I wish I had known how to use compression better back when I first started. Knowing how to compress properly and intuitively is key.  
[Thanks a lot for your answer. Since you talk about the importance of compression, what are your thoughts on the loudness war?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ctitw/my_dad_is_an_audio_engineer_who_has_worked_with/c9juurn?context=5)|Since I haven't done that much work lately but I can say I was surprised how loud ""American Idiot"" by Green Day was when it first came out and that was the first album that I really thought was unnecessarily loud. I guess the real question is... Why?
[What were 50 and jay like in person? What kind of crazy things have you seen in the studio? Drugs? Women?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ctitw/my_dad_is_an_audio_engineer_who_has_worked_with/c9jth7o?context=5)|Not as much as you would think. Jay-Z and 50 were not womanizers, drinking, taking drugs, etc. I feel like the stories you here are pretty exaggerated for the most part.
 |As to what they were like. 50 cent was one of the funniest people to work with; even more so than Will Smith. Jay-Z was more down to business but not harsher per-se.
 |While working for Nas there was this whole Nas v. Jay-Z thing going on. They would be going back at each other whether it be albums, concerts, or press releases. I really got to know Jay once Nas and Jay were patching things up while recording some songs together.
[Any artist you worked with that were a real pain in the ass?  And any artist/group you wish you could have worked with but never got the chance?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ctitw/my_dad_is_an_audio_engineer_who_has_worked_with/c9jtr1o?context=5)|Wu Tang Clan, I actually ended up getting into a fight with one of them  and ended with the police getting involved. I don't even remember how it got started but at some point it became clear that the producer who was one of the members of Wu Tang Clan was upset at me for something, so the discussion started becoming more heated. I started to notice that one of them was blocking the door and another was blocking me from getting up out of my chair. Fortunately my assistant was outside and came inside and I managed to tell him to call the police. I ended up having to run through this guy to try and get away, and hid away in the office while we waited for the police. They were all gone by the time the police got there.
 |Tl;dr got into confrontation with Wu Tang Clan member, called the police, Wu Tang Clan got lost  And I would have most definitely wanted to work with the Foo Fighters.
[Which artist truly amazed you with their voice? Were you ever disappointed? Do you ever work unsigned artists to help them break through?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ctitw/my_dad_is_an_audio_engineer_who_has_worked_with/c9jtoup?context=5)|Michael Jackson for sure. You know, on records you have so many chances on records to get things right, but I never truly appreciated his voice until I heard him in person. 
 |I would prefer not to disclose specific names of people I was disappointed with but you would be surprised. 
 |Yes.
[Do you approve Auto-Tune?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ctitw/my_dad_is_an_audio_engineer_who_has_worked_with/c9ju3c1?context=5)|Auto-Tune is essentially a tool that separates the pros from the amateurs. If you know how to sing you don't use it, if you don't, you do. It's more of a branding tool than anything. 
[Are there any albums in history that you would consider great but the sound mixing ruined them?  Edit: grammar (it was poor\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ctitw/my_dad_is_an_audio_engineer_who_has_worked_with/c9jux1r?context=5)|Any Rolling Stones Record, some of the first Black Sabbath records, the first Metallica record, and some of the earliest Eminem records.
[What was it like working on the Jimi Hendrix, Live at the Fillmore East? How did you deal with the source audio? Did you work with the original tapes/reels or get some sort of digital copy from the estate. Also, whats the difference working on a past recording vs an in studio artist?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ctitw/my_dad_is_an_audio_engineer_who_has_worked_with/c9jxm6m?context=5)|It was a lot of fun and interesting to hear that kind of stuff. The audio either came to us transferred or came transferred we never really used the original tapes. It's a lot more straight-forward and seamless process to work on a past recording and makes for a much quieter day.
[Lots of great stuff on the credits page, was there ever something you worked on that was good but never saw the light because of record execs/artists?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ctitw/my_dad_is_an_audio_engineer_who_has_worked_with/c9jxm6m?context=5)|And absolutely. Many of the songs I worked on with MJ never saw the light of day and there is *a lot* of stuff by Nas that is tucked away that may or may not surface one day ;)
[How did you get such a great opportunity to work with Michael? What year(s\) did you work with him and on what song(s\)? What was he like in person? Where were you when you found out he'd passed away, and what was your reaction? X.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ctitw/my_dad_is_an_audio_engineer_who_has_worked_with/c9juuou?context=5)|I had a relationship with The Hit Factory and they booked him and called me for it. I worked with him in '99 on about 12 songs that I can't really remember which songs made it on the album and which ones did not. He was a very soft-spoken and kind person. I was surprised when he passed away, but I didn't really know him *that* well and it's not like I had a personal relationship with him so his passing didn't phase me too much.
[Do you think artists truly realize how much of a difference you guys make? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ctitw/my_dad_is_an_audio_engineer_who_has_worked_with/c9jwcht?context=5)|Maybe a few...
[Ether or takeover?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ctitw/my_dad_is_an_audio_engineer_who_has_worked_with/c9jus7y?context=5)|Ether.
[How powerful is Logic Pro?  Is it, by itself, good enough to make radio quality songs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ctitw/my_dad_is_an_audio_engineer_who_has_worked_with/c9jw5p8?context=5)|Yes absolutely. 
[Can you name a few great artists that most people probably haven't heard of, but that deserve more credit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ctitw/my_dad_is_an_audio_engineer_who_has_worked_with/c9jv9id?context=5)|There was this kid I worked with called Chris Norris. I doubt anyone would have heard of him but he was incredibly talented; would have been nice if something happened to him. I also think David Banner is underrated.
[Who is your personal favorite artist to work with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ctitw/my_dad_is_an_audio_engineer_who_has_worked_with/c9jvjey?context=5)|Mob Deep. I used to like their stuff a lot.
[How has the proliferation of home studios and the ability for artists to make content of passable quality affected your craft? Also, where should one start if they're interested in learning how to properly mix tracks?  Edit: Also, any tips for getting internships at studios? Edit: spelling.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ctitw/my_dad_is_an_audio_engineer_who_has_worked_with/c9jvfj2?context=5)|Well, I'm not in the business anymore haha and the best way to get started is by finding someone who knows what they are doing--a mentor if you will.
[Did you ever stop Will Smith mid-song and say 'how about you just focus on the acting thing?'](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ctitw/my_dad_is_an_audio_engineer_who_has_worked_with/c9jurgm?context=5)|Haha not a Will Smith fan? I didn't think he was that bad, but he was definitely different. 
[Who was the easiest artist for you to work with? Who was your favorite?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ctitw/my_dad_is_an_audio_engineer_who_has_worked_with/c9jveaj?context=5)|Nas for both. When I first got started, I worked with the producer Mark James, who brought in several artists that I really enjoyed working with despite everything being broken because we were working out of a b-rate studio at the time. (Same place Queen Latifah got her start)
[Who are your favorite albums to listen to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ctitw/my_dad_is_an_audio_engineer_who_has_worked_with/c9jvpeq?context=5)|I like the latest Foo Fighters album, the latest Bush record, and I of course still like listening to a good Pink Floyd album.

[What did you do to become a audio engineer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ctitw/my_dad_is_an_audio_engineer_who_has_worked_with/c9jv6ni?context=5)|I played with electronic toys my whole life essentially. I played with a lot of trains when I was younger as well.
[So were you mainly recording and mix engineering for the people you work with? What sort of studio setup do you use? A preference of digital or analogue desk?  *edit I also endorse the Jen Lopez's butt question.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ctitw/my_dad_is_an_audio_engineer_who_has_worked_with/c9jxp35?context=5)|I like working with a combination of both actually. Digital editing / recording as well as analogue mixing.
[Thanks for answering, as a hopeful followup do you have a dream desk/brand preference? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ctitw/my_dad_is_an_audio_engineer_who_has_worked_with/c9jy3eq?context=5)|These days I prefer to work on a SSL 9000J.
[Favorite mic?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ctitw/my_dad_is_an_audio_engineer_who_has_worked_with/c9juzfg?context=5)|For what?
[Just in general.  I realize you use different mics for different instruments/voices but what's your favorite all purpose go-to mic?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ctitw/my_dad_is_an_audio_engineer_who_has_worked_with/c9jv6z6?context=5)|Either a U87 or a 414.

[Which particular set of headphones does he prefer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ctitw/my_dad_is_an_audio_engineer_who_has_worked_with/c9jy93m?context=5)|I've gotten used to the old AKG 141s and like those.
[I have a great deal of friends claiming they can tell digital from analog. I'm a musician myself but i most definitely can't pick up the difference, at least for sampling levels available on cd.  First I think most of these friends are full of shit, and second i do not however exclude the possibility of a few hearing better than i do and pick up a difference. Would you agree with my first assertion, and how do you feel about my second?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ctitw/my_dad_is_an_audio_engineer_who_has_worked_with/c9k0b2y?context=5)|Yes I can absolutely tell the difference. The analogue have a rounder / warmer feel to them while digital has a harder edge to it. While I can't be certain, I think this is attributed to digital equipment only being designed to work within the confines of the human ear while analogue is more imperfect in that sense so the audio doesn't just cut off.

* I spent this weekend in the South of England, where I went walking around the historic city of Winchester and saw the actual, honest-to-god round table. [Here's a picture I took of it](https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/415330_10151331984027109_632138203_o.jpg). 

* When I flew back, I'm like 95% I'm pretty sure I saw [the guy who plays Stewart Pearson in The Thick Of It](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awZZYctmYfU) in the arrivals part of terminal three in Manchester Airport.
 
* I have two interview-type-things for work this week. One for an internship at a local startup, and another for a bit of freelance work. Which is cool, because I'm a student and I've been looking for something fun to do over the summer. 

* I've never felt quite as connected to, and in love with my girlfriend as I do right now. Seriously, I love her to bits and we're going great. Which is awesome. 

* I've got a pot of coffee on the brew, and I'm going to watch Evil Dead tonight at a local arthouse cinema. I'm pretty excited about that. 

So, yeah. Life is good. What's awesome for you right now? 

EDIT: One other thing!

* For the past two months, I've been learning the piano. I finally learned my [first song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwuLm1HPpSY). Currently working on my [second one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSfbb2apkkY)."

I've been accepted by both New York University and Carnegie Mellon University, both great schools but I'm having difficulty on deciding between the two.  I'm trying to narrow things down to several categories: Education, Social Life, Finance, and Future (such as internships and career opportunities).  With NYU, I have been accepted by the Computer Science program in CAS, though I might plan on transferring to the Tisch school of the arts (Film/Television is something I really enjoy).  I enjoy the city life, living an hour away in New Jersey, but I acknowledge that costs are high.  With Carnegie Mellon, I have been accepted into the Information Systems program, a combination of business and computer science. This field was suggested by a friend, but I don't know too much about it.  CMU has a good arts program as well, so I might dabble in their.  In terms of financial aid, my parents and I will still need to pay around and over $50,000, though CMU has offered more financial aid so that it is $5000 cheaper than NYU.  Still, NYU was my dream school in Junior year and still resonates within me.

I don't know a lot of people in NYU, so I was hoping on getting a current student's perspective and opinion.  I need to enroll within the next week, so please help!  Thanks!"

   I'm a senior in college, graduating with a degree in creative writing, and have been applying to advertising internships all semester. 

There is one agency in particular that I'm interested in particular. I applied way back in February. They conduct their interviews through April and the first week of May. All I've heard from them is a confirmation that they received my materials. A friend of mine who works at the agency also reached out to the creative recruiter to put in a good word. 

I don't have a huge portfolio because I didn't do an advertising portfolio program but I have had two full time internships, and am graduating in good academic standing. 

Any advice about how to reach out to the recruiters without pissing them off?"

It was not by choice as I am probably going to be drug tested for my engineering internship that I got. (cause you know, smoking weed makes you lazy and shit right?) I have been an avid smoker for the past 3-4 years but have only been blazing heavily for like 2 years. I am on my 24 day bud free and was wondering about the stuff being in my system. I know weed is really hard to get into your system from second hand smoke, it has to be shotgunned or extremely hot boxed from uninhaled blunt smoke/other uninhaled smoke. But the thing is my roommate still blazes heavily around me and I was wondering if there is any possibility my body might get it because I have been smoking for so long. I know that its still in my system as of right now and I am probably over reacting but this internship is pretty important to me.

I came to you guys cause I use to visit /r/trees religiously and really miss you guys. Now I really need your expert opinion. My drug test probably won't be for another 2-3 weeks but I am really wondering if my roommate blazing has ruined my streak? Thanks for any response!

I've got clear goals, a lot of passion, a direction I'm heading in.

I recently got my first article published (as an undergad! I was so proud!). It was something I slaved away on for WEEKS. And no one seems to care that it happened. 

I have a 3.8 GPA, three majors, and I've basically given up my life this past year to focus on school. I have no job, no money, and have pretty much isolated myself. All I think about is art, my future in museums, and who in my class will surpass me. I've held several internships, attended conferences, and nothing I do ever seems to be enough in the museum/art world.

Then my computer broke. Then my car broke. I have credit card debt. I can barely pay my rent (parents still help me, I'm a loser, I know). I dumped my boyfriend, and still have feelings for an older ex-boyfriend, who just wants to fuck me. I had to turn down an overseas internship this summer because of money. I have nothing. 

My history of anxiety makes me stressed all the time. I take herbals, have pillow-sprays, relaxation techniques, but the stressors just won't leave.

I'm failing at everything I wanted to do, and costing my divorced parents a shit ton of money while I'm at it. I hate being this financial burden, making them pay for my car repairs, a new computer, my rent...because I just can't. 

I used to feel so above everyone in my intelligence, drive, confidence, looks. Now, I've stopped eating (5'4, 101 right now), dropped my cockiness down way low, and books have become my best friends. This is not how I want to live. 

What if I sold the car, sold the computer, all the nice clothing I've collected, wrote letters to those I love and just checked out? People would be sad, but at this point--not many. I've become so isolated I've lost most of the people I used to care about. I'm a failure, and I'm faking happy every day at school. This isn't how I want to live, and I think every day at night, ""I don't want to live like this, so what if I just didn't anymore?"""

Sorry!

We've been dating for about three months. Though we originally thought we couldn't get too serious because we would be in different places (him moving, me traveling), things have changed, and we know that we'll at least be in the same place until the end of the summer. 

Because I didn't originally think we were going to be serious, I didn't worry about telling him all the intimate details of my life. However, now I feel as if I'm hiding part of myself from him. We've said that we love each other, and I've never felt this strongly about anyone before. I just can't help but feel that I'm being dishonest.

The issue(s): I'm embarrassed to talk about my past. From the outside, I would say I appear fairly put-together. I was super involved in high school, 4.0, scholarships to college, etc. Here in college, I'm involved in a few organizations I feel strongly about, do well in my classes, have internships and research experience, all that jazz. 

BUT: in high school, I struggled with self-injury on and off for four years. I was somewhat suicidal, though I never attempted it. In college, I gained an eating disorder, which has also been on and off. I haven't struggled with it since last semester, and I am trying to be healthier in both my habits and my mindset. Last semester I was also somewhat sexually promiscuous; while I am not sure if this fits here, I personally view it as another form of self-destruction (not for everyone, but for me specifically, as my reasons were less than healthy). Finally, I am clinically diagnosed OCD, though I would say that it does not interfere in my life that much.

This all sounds horrible, and quite frankly I feel ashamed when I think about telling him this. He is an amazing person, and I don't think he would judge me for it; however, he seems extremely well-adjusted and normal, for lack of a better word, and I am worried that he would A. not understand and B. think of me differently.

With him, I am fun and silly and sweet. And it's not an act--with him I am my best self, the person I want to be all the time. I don't think it's wrapped up solely with him, either; if we were to break up, I would be heartbroken, but I don't think I would return to my previous habits. I've stopped thinking of myself as crazy. I want to be healthy, not just for him but for myself.

Part of me is insistent that I need to tell him these things, because they were such a big part of my life. However, another part of me doesn't even feel like that person anymore. I don't want to do those things, and I honestly feel like I've changed. How do I express that the way I acted and the things I did are no longer a part of me? I don't want to scare him away, but at the same time I can't handle being dishonest when he's such a good person.

**TL;DR Dating three months, I had a slew of issues in the past (SI, ED, OCD) that no longer define me. I feel dishonest keeping them from him. How do I express that those issues are no longer a part of me?**

1cuhc4,1,2013-04-22,The Black Lantern,Arkeic,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1cuhc4/the_black_lantern/,"Before you read this, I have to say that I have been keeping this terrible event locked up in a part of my brain, afraid to reveal anything because I am worried that I will have to get even more involved than I already have been. I have been wanting to tell someone, anyone, of what happened that night, but my friends would only call me crazy or deem it a wild ghost story, and I certainly don't want this coming back to haunt me if I get a call from the Oklahoma authorities wanting to interrogate me, because I know they'll probably accuse me for the unexplainable crime.


There's a small town in Oklahoma that's quite secluded from the rest of the world. I was visiting my great aunt two summers ago, in boring old Oklahoma with its plains and clump of forests, just because she was a lonely old neurosurgeon and I really wanted to get into psychology. It was a peaceful little town in the middle of nowhere, with probably 300-400 inhabitants, maybe a little more now. My aunt's house is on the outskirts of the town, near a farmer's market and gas station. There's a couple of smaller houses half a mile away from my aunt's, and on the other side of her house is a large forest.


First day there I was bored out of my mind. As a California kid from Los Angeles I am around technology 24/7 and live in the suburbs. My aunt had an old Macintosh and there was very little to watch on TV. She hauled some textbooks of medical psychology and general anatomy onto my lap and expected me to be entertained for weeks. She was wrong; I needed to go out. At least she didn't make me talk to crazies like I had to for my internship in LA; I feel like I myself go insane sometimes just being in that institution.


Now, there's a curfew in that little town. I didn't know why people would even bother staying out; there's nothing to do there. The curfew is strictly upheld; nobody can be outside after 11 p.m. because there is the common belief that there are unseen monsters who attack oblivious wanderers and maim them until you can't tell who the person is anymore by their corpse. I thought it was some fucked up way of making sure kids wouldn't go out at night and cause trouble. I really thought so.


This kid, let's call him Mark--he believed none of the stories. He said he'd been out at night all the time and had never seen anything weird even once. Mark lived in one of the houses next to my aunt's, and a week after I had settled in, he visited because news spreads fast in such a small town, especially about city people. He wanted to know how it was like in Los Angeles, how school was there, if the girls were pretty, stuff like that. I liked him a lot; his face always lighted up when he talked about stuff. There was something off about him actually...he had these pale green eyes that just made him look so...dead. You know how when you're in class and you turn and look at your friend and he is obviously not paying attention at all and just staring off into the distance? Mark's eyes was like that even when he WAS smiling. There was just something unnerving about his stare. Anyways, one afternoon he came over and asked if I wanted to join him in the woods. I asked him, ""Why?"" and he said, come on ill show you that everyone in this town is just full of cowshit. ""Are there really monsters out there in the forest?"" I asked, and he said, if you come with me youll see that there isnt. I didn't want to look like a pussy, so I consented.


It was around 12:40 am when Mark popped up next to my window. He did it so silently and had his face there for a good few minutes until I turned to my right from my desk and was almost scared shitless. He told me to climb out from there, and so I did. We walked down the middle of the paved road for a good ten minutes in absolute silence. Mark held a rusty black lantern that shone brightly and lighted the way for us. I guess he was as scared as me. Or maybe not, I don't know. We reached the foot of the forest and walked down the road within it for a few minutes. It was so eerily quiet--I'm getting shivers right now just thinking about it--there were no crickets, no wind blowing, and definitely no cars or people at all. I could only hear my own footsteps clopping on the dry pavement as we walked on. 

Suddenly, Mark stopped and turned to me with a big smile on his face. lets go in there, he said, pointing into the dark trees at the side of the road. ""Are you serious?!"" I whispered fiercely. ""It's not safe! We'll get lost!"" He looked at me with those dead, dead green eyes and shook his head. fine ill go by myself and show you that theres nothing in there, he said. He turned and started walking into the woods slowly, the light of the lantern bobbing up and down in the absolute darkness. I could see the trees within with the light of the lantern. ""Come back!"" I remember yelling. ""Let's go back!"" Mark didn't respond. The light grew smaller and smaller as he walked farther and farther away. I stared at it for so long, the world became a tiny faded yellow light bobbing in the absolutely black void. Then the light stopped. It was so, so still, like something was holding it in place. I stared at it for probably a whole minute, and it didn't move the entire time. Then all of a sudden the light shook left and right, faster and faster, until it was whizzing left and right so quickly that it looked like it was bouncing between trees in a straight line at an incredibly fast rate. Then I heard the screaming. It was like someone had tried to kill a pig with a single swing of a cleaver, but the blade had only embedded itself in the neck of the pig, and it was screaming to be killed as blood filled its throat and the shrill screams became gargled cries. Mark's screams sounded so inhuman that I seriously pissed my pants a little. I was trembling so hard as I watched the light fly up impossibly forty or fifty feet into the air and slam back down onto the ground. Then all was silent. I stood there shivering for a couple minutes, so afraid to even move. I kept thinking I saw some dark outlines of shapes moving through the trees, but it was probably just my imagination. 

Then all of a sudden a figure silently walked past my right from behind. It was a sheriff. I have no idea how he got there; there was no car. I couldn't see his face; he was a head taller than me and wore a sheriff uniform. In his right hand he held a revolver. I didn't see his face, and never got to. He said nothing and walked silently into the woods. He never made a single sound. Believing in a false sense of security with the silent sheriff, I tentatively walked into the woods, a few steps behind him. He never looked back at me and just kept walking straight towards the light, his hands limp at his sides. We neared the light, and I saw what truly horrified me, seen something that I will never be able to erase from my memory. On the ground lay Mark--his limbs had been torn off of him and lay askew, scattered in different directions. Blood caked his clothes and formed a pool underneath him. The trunks were shiny with Mark's bright red blood. His eyes, his eyes were wide open as his dead pale green pupils bore into my soul. He breathed heavily and his bloodied mouth was agape with agony and fear. Out of the corner of my eye I saw the sheriff, who was still not facing me, slowly raise his revolver and point it at Mark. Mark didn't seem to see him, almost like the sheriff was never there; his dead eyes were locked onto mine. Then I watched as his face collapsed under the force of the bullet that was fired, crushing his thin nose and causing his entire face to cave in in a bloodied mess. Still his pale green eyes stared at mine, unmoving. I ran. I ran and ran and I kept looking back, thinking something was chasing me. There wasn't anything.

Sometimes I dream that I am in the dark forest, with Mark, and that I grab hold of him and I hack off his limbs with an axe and smile as he screams in agony and stares at me with those dead green eyes. Then I shoot him in between those eyes of his with a silver revolver and every time, I wake up shaking.


Turns out there was no sheriff who knew about anything at the town's police station. They never found Mark's body. They found his mangled arms and legs, and a bloodied, black lantern. "

The only problem is I have not been able to find a job at all.. I partly blame myself because I kind of slacked throughout college, didn't really have internships and only worked 2 summers in IT. To put a cherry on top the two supervisors I had are no longer where I worked so I don't really have any solid references.

Over the past year I've sent out hundreds of resumes and have done a total of eight interviews, none have landed me a position. I'm starting to panic now because companies will not hire if they see someone out of the work force for so long, especially now with all the new graduates I'm going to be absolutely FUCKED.

I was thinking about Grad school, but my undergrad GPA was only a 2.8, so I've screwed myself on that end as well.  Not only that, but the deadline for admissions to most decent ones for fall semester have already passed.

Everyday I wake up just feeling exhausted--exhausted from doing nothing. I see all my friends around me starting their careers, moving out of their houses, enjoying their youth in NYC... and I'm stuck, stuck at home with my parents without a job. Sending application after application and facing rejection after rejection. I've never been so miserable and jaded in my entire life.

 I just don't know what to do anymore. I've done revision after revision of resumes, experimented with different cover letters, exhausted all my networks, gone to career fairs, used my university's careerlink.. and nothing. Every day that passes by the chances of me landing a job decrease.. I need something to do, but no one gives me the chance.  The ones that want to give me a chance are all unpaid ""coffee boy"" internships with no valuable knowledge learned. Can anyone steer me in the right direction? because right now I'm absolutely lost. 

I should add that I have a strong interest in politics/helping others, if that's of any help. "

Contact information is in a separate one inch margin on the left. All line spacing is 1.15, except for bullets which are 1.5. Font is all Georgia, except for Consolas at the bottom for reference notation. If I have no references or they are out dated, should I exclude them?

The above is all you need to offer formatting advice. If you'd also like to help me with content, keep reading below:


I graduate with a BFA in May and have very little experience. I am unsure of what to use for content in putting myself forward. I'm rather ambiguous and verbose, so I'm having trouble with concrete and concise. 

For the most part, I am a jack of trades and not a master of anything specific. Kind of a disadvantage! For example, I am confident in my ability to analyze and research any topic, particularly in the form of electronic search, and feel I can pick up new technologies or methods quickly: but I will never be a solid replacement for a programmer or specialist. 

On the resume above, you'll see my experience listed as a resource center assistant. I was responsible for attending History classes and documenting the content of the course, which I then processed into study guides by analyzing and isolating the important information, formatting this information (including digital imagery), then providing finished product for printing. 

You'll also see I included volunteer experience. I use ""volunteer"" very loosely. Maybe ""other"" is a better term? 
I've been responsible for maintaining and running digital communities (ranging 20~ people to 120~). This involved several years of both game development in the form of graphics and scripting, but also in administration and people management. This involved a lot of PR work, adjudicating several disputes and working with plans and numbers that directly influenced the participants experience. 

Unfortunately, I don't know what kind of a job I should be looking for as a result, or how to sell myself to them :( 

For now, I figure I will tailor a stand-in resume for a position as a weekend product specialist for a pet food company. I've done enough research regarding this to be able to explain things such as the lack of amylase in a cats saliva being the main reason why choosing a food with less carbs is a healthier choice. This particular company's food is not perfect, but they are fairly decent. Problem is, what on Earth do I fill in the resume with? 

I'm also not sure a part time weekend sales job is an appropriate thing for me to be seeking. There are internships I could pursue, including some with bursaries, and I should probably be looking for something more field related. I AM interested in feline nutrition, however, so it is partially relevant to my interests. Plus, it's a decently paying weekend solution.  Thoughts?

This is the [[description of the position]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UA9iV5klwRQxRShHSkTYUKcZCnuGBETB5U_VXkoByrQ/edit?usp=sharing). Based on the little you know, how would you suggest I tailor my current template for this position?

Anyway's, we have standup meetings every morning before taking our lunch break, and this was when I realized how fucked up my coworkers were. Side note: when we go to lunch everyone sort of goes together and carpools down to the local diner or restaurant. So on my second day we were having a standup meeting as usual, I had just finished my part and  **Erica's** turn was next. She went through a brief rundown of her project, and mentioned she was having a problem with a specific bug in the software she was designing. Anyway, in response to this, **douchtits** made some obscure reference to the **Unicorny** and the rest of the coworkers erupted into laughter for a good 15 - 30 seconds. I did not understand the reference at the time, but a **Unicorny** is slang in software terms is a feature that is so obscure that it might as well not exist. Well, after **douchtits** said this, she just sorta gave him a a shy small fake smile and while the rest of the group laughed, except for me and her because I did not know what it meant and her for reasons I will get to later.

So after I the meeting I asked what that reference was about, and her filled me in on what it meant. Still curious, I asked about how it applied to this situation. He then proceeded to explain that **Erica** ""says she was raped a few years ago and can't remember it because she was drugged"". Basically, from the impression I got, this moronic tard thought that since she could not remember the actual rape, she was lying about the whole thing and the whole department shared his opinion. The **Unicorny** reference was rape joke about her saying that since she could not remember the rape, she probably imagined the whole thing. I was shocked and so angry when I realized this, but I just smiled and went to lunch with the rest of the guys, thinking that this must be some kind of bad joke. Over lunch I prodded my coworkers over the ""joke"" and realized that this was indeed NOT a joke, this was real and that they actually believed what they were saying.

Its been a week now and I have been taking lunch on my own now instead of with the rest of the department. I have also noticed that **Erica** eats in her car. She buys food from the gas station across the street and drives back to our parking lot to eat it. I am right next to a window on the second floor and I have noticed this ever since I got here. It just seems so sad watching her do it, its obvious she does it because she needs alone-time from the crap that goes on around here.  I want to approach her in some way and let her know that I'm not a misogynistic asshole , but I don't know how and there is never any time and she finishes an hour before me.  Maybe I'm not using the right words, but I want to try to be her friend and maybe in some way comfort her. I feel really bad about this whole situation.  I can't afford to quit this job, I have been jobless for 2 years up till now and this was my only offer. I am also sure that she is in a similar situation to me financially, who would keep a job with abuse like this???  I hate this place, but it pays the bills and college debt, and I am very short on money. If there were any other solution I would quit instantly, but sadly there isn't one I can think of. I don't want to approach her in the office, because its right in the middle of the horde of douchbags.  I just don't know what to do here, is it a bad idea to go to her while she is eating in her car? What should I say to her??

I know that I'm a spineless coward for not doing something about this or saying something, but I have just never been in this situation before and don't know what to do. I'm a relatively quiet guy, I don't have many friends and I've never been in high tension situation like this. Any advice at all would be appreciated.


BTW I'm also a guy in my mid twenties.
Hope this was legible, I rarely write for long periods of time like this."

/u/MojoSavage and the [Top Post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/15qf0e/can_a_group_of_ksp_fans_but_an_inexperienced/) inspired me late last night to organize a way for us to do this over the internet.


&gt;**Reddit Space Race**
&gt;
&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt;Mission Statement:
&gt;
&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________
&gt;
&gt;The Reddit Space Program (RSP) will take the minds and hearts of /r/KerbalSpaceProgram and put them to work on building a single save file to rule all save files. Together we will grasp the stars in our collective fist of power and reign over our dominion.

&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt;Predicted Milestones:

&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt;1. Orbit and reentry of Kerbal.

&gt;2. Orbit of Mun and return to Kerbal

&gt;3. Land on the Mun and return to Kerbal

&gt;4. Launch the official RSP Kerbal Orbital Station (OS) and additional parts as required.

&gt;5. Construct KSP Mun OS, synchronous orbit

&gt;6. KSP Mun Surface Station (SS) directly below KSP Mun OS.

&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt; Jobs:

&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt; *Submit photos/videos of your exploits for reference.*

&gt; Pilot: You'll be piloting all space craft from first person controls. If you can stream smoothly, that would be amazing. Good personalities are welcome here.

&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt; Engineers: 

&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt;You'll be responsible for collaborating on rocket, ship, and construction designs. You get the pilots into the air in one piece.

&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt; Mechanics:
 
&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt;This can go one or two ways. If you're a modder, and you can make parts to the engineer's designs, that's good. You can have a new job title. If not, we need people to build these projects so that our Kerbalnauts don't rapidly disassemble along with the ships.

&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt; Mission Control:

&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt; * Flight Commander: Maintain order and control over the flight. Makes all final decisions during missions.

&gt; * Flight Intern: Working under the Commander you will be responsible for ensuring that things go smoothly. You will fill in the gaps as needed, and if not, get the coffee and hold the white board.

&gt; * Flight Officer: You'll plot the course and monitor all progress.

&gt; * Petty Flight Officer: Working under the Flight Officer you'll be responsible for assisting with all duties. Primarily monitoring flight data and reporting to the Flight Officer.

&gt; * Communications Officer: You'll be responsible for maintaining communications with our pilot.

&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt;How will this work?

&gt;___________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt; The rules are simple. The entire crew will be on Teamspeak. The pilot will be in the cockpit channel. Everyone else in Mission Control. Using the multiplayer mod Mission Control can monitor the flight progress, trajectory, and vitals of the pilot's ship.

&gt;Using this, the pilot will be locked into first person during the entire fligt using cockpit controls only, unless on a spacewalk or surfacewalk.

&gt;Mission Control will separately monitor the flight and discuss the changes. Flight Commander will make decisions and Communications Officer will relay them to the pilot quickly and clearly. 

&gt; Upon completion of each successful mission we will release a file containing the saves and mods needed to use it. This way all players can play in our world with each upgrade."

1cu2tc,22,2013-04-21,Internships are required!,Demosthenes3,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1cu2tc/internships_are_required/,"I see a lot of engineering students and recent graduates asking for career advice.  It usually goes something like this “I have a decent GPA, no internships/co-ops, and no contacts.  Why can’t I find a job?”  Well its simple…it’s because you and didn’t get any work experience in the four years you were at college!  Class vs. real work is very different.  


Engineering is a very competitive field and internships/co-ops are required.  Required!  Think of it as another credit you have to fulfill (which at some schools is actually the case).  When I graduated a few years ago, I had completed 5 internships and 1 co-op.  At every interview, I talked about my work experience and the different ways I applied my class work to my job.  Not only will you make around $20/hr and earn valuable beer money- maybe you will figure out what you want to do in life.  The internship I had after my sophomore year lead me to the job I am doing now.  I figured out what niche I wanted to follow and took applicable classes.  
Now I know it’s hard to get your foot in the door initially.  I’ve been there and been incredibly frustrated but you have to realize opportunity is everywhere and stick with it.  I got my first internship at a small but major player in the defense field from some random guy my dad met at the gym.  I worked out a few times with my dad, met this guy (who it turned out was the CEO) and asked him for an internship.  If you have already graduated and have no work experience, reframe your class projects and work like it was a job.  Stress working as part of a team to achieve a goal, how you got to that goal, and what the positive outcomes were.  One summer as a hobby, I rebuilt an arcade system from the ground up and donated it to charity.  When asked about troubleshooting skills, I talked about how I determined which components on the Ms. Pacman board had failed and how I got it working again.  


After you break in the club it becomes a lot easier.  I get contacted every week now, out of the blue, from big name companies wanting me to interview with them.   
 

TL/DR- Get an internship stupid!

     ""Dear Googler,

My name is pinkcadillac28.  I go to school at The University of Pennsylvania with my boyfriend named boyfriend.  

Boyfriend was a summer intern at Google two summers ago, and he is a huge fan of all things Google. 

A few weeks ago Boyfriend made a submission to the If I Had Glass contest, and was disappointed to find he was not selected to be a Glass Explorer.  Beyond his submission to the contest, he has been talking my ear off for the past few months about all of the exciting things Google Glass would bring, and the amazing ideas he had for it.  

He was so incredibly excited about the project, and I hated to see him so disappointed in not being able to participate in something he so strongly desired. I know he is someone who would appreciate being a Glass Explorer more than anybody I, or you, probably know.

Now I know there are many people out there just like Boyfriend, but I believe that Boyfriend does not only love Google for its products, he also is incredibly passionate about the company where it is now, and where it will be in the future, and he hopes to one day play a part in that.  

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help make Boyfriend's dream come true.  His birthday is in Month and I was hoping to work some kind of miracle for him :)

My recruiters do not seem to know much about basic at Ft Benning, or really much about anything that I am doing (officer, MI). I am the first officer my recruiting office has gotten past the Officer review-interview Board thing in 2+ yrs so they have not been particularly helpful.

Brief description of myself:

I scored very very well on the ASVAB and my line scores were good enough for literally every MOS the Army has. I have a BA in international affairs (along with one minor in psychology and another in history) from a major private university. I have interned at government offices at both the state and federal level. I have traveled extensively with family, pre-college student groups, and college study abroad programs.

I have pretty much always wanted a job within the intelligence community, I hunted (but never landed) internships with the alphabet soup that makes up said community. After graduating without ever actually dipping my toes in that pool, I did some research and had some informational interviews which led me to believe that the military is a good first step to getting into the intelligence field.

So here I am two weeks out, reading forums and websites from all over the internets and harassing my recruiters for information, and I still have concerns to be addressed.

I have been told not to bring really anything to basic, and will have limited telecommunication access, so how frequently can I send and receive letters? And what if anything SHOULD I bring/have sent that might make the time easier (I hear compression socks or stockings can improve the blister/foot situation any truth to this?)?

I have been told not to advertise in BCT that I am going OCS, to prevent separating myself from the other enlisted, or drawing undue attention to myself. 
How serious is this concern? Should I really be worried about being ""picked on"" for going OCS? Who if anyone should I tell to ensure I am afforded opportunities for leadership?

At BCT what will I get to play with? It sounds as though I will be qualified on the M16, what about the M9? Will I get an opportunity to handle the M24 or M249? Will I get any ""free time"" to spend on the range?

Once I do get to OCS it seems as though I will be competing for the MOS I want. As of right now, I want MI, the officers which conducted the interview claim I would be a perfect intelligence officer, and recommended such on their greenlight papers.
What can I do to improve my chances of landing the MOS I want?

And is there anyone out there that knows anything about converting from Military to Civilian intelligence? It sounds as though it happens pretty frequently, but I have not heard directly from anyone that actually did it. 

Those are my primary concerns, I welcome any other advice or tips that might make the experience a little easier/more fun."

I got my BS in CS from an midwest tech school. I'm also an international student in the States. Since my graduation, I have had no luck landing a job. Only two on-site visits that lead to nowhere, one for a QA position another for an IT position which I ran away. 

I've rushed through my college to finish it quick. I took shit load of classes every semester, even though it hurt my GPA pretty badly. I had no breaks during the summers to take 4 classes (technically not possible). And I've graduated early, with a degree. (with no internships experience, I didn't even apply to any) 

Don't get me wrong I love computer science, I can code within my skills. However, in college we learned Java and did a lot of things with Java. I'm quite good with Java, probably intermediate abilities. We learned SQL, Python, Haskell, Objective-C, Assembly but only to a certain extend. Not close to call myself  ""good"" at using them professionally. Lately I've been trying to tailor my skills to match most of these job requirements. I'm currently learning Javascript/HTML5 and C#, and I feel like my diploma and all the years of studying has been for no good reason. 

It's getting hard to find entry level jobs, especially in San Francisco area where I'm planning to live. Am I doing something wrong here? 
Should I move to the area first and then find a job through meetups and networking? 
Any advice is helpful, thanks!

I'm open to it being a more-than-friends thing, but it doesn't have to be.


Below is a bit about me, and a bit of what I'm looking for but don't let it hamper you--I'm always up to meet new people. If you're interested just message me. If you want a photo of me, just ask. Can't wait to hear from you!


**About Me:**


* I'm a Political Science/International Affairs Major. If I was better at math I'd have gone into physics or biology; I have a reading interest in those fields--so scientists please apply!

 
* I'm always up for a show or to just chill with some music. I listen to mostly indie (Franz Ferdinand, the Wombats, Regina Spektor) but also have a recent interest in nujazz, electroswing, and their older components. I also listen to rap/hiphop (I grew up in the Bronx).



* I was friends with a lot of theater kids in HS, so I'm always up for a show or movie.


* I'm pretty blunt, and can have a ribald sense of humour--but I do have wit when I feel like it.


* I like to cook and make drinks! (I turn 21 pretty much the moment I move back)


* I'm equally happy staying in and hanging out as I am going out on an adventure--fun is what you make of where you are with the people you are with!


* Bastion is my favourite game.


* I work out pretty often; I'm not Adonis but I do take care of myself.


**About You:**


* Are open and thus enjoy sharing your interests and ideas.


* Passion for quality.


* Don't need every detail of a plan fleshed out, but do plan a bit.


* Take care of yourself and wouldn't mind being a gym buddy.


* Whatever your thing is, you have no problem talking about it until you have lost me completely"

&gt;be me

&gt;livin and workin in a far off place for the semester with about 50 other people from across the country, all of us interns

&gt; none of us know each other prior to this semester, but, naturally, we're all looking to have a good time on the weekends

&gt; couple of people have parties at their apartments now and then, and some of them get pretty wild

&gt; one night, everyone is drinking, dancing and having a good time when we hear her boisterous laugh coming from down the hall

&gt;blinds are quivering, beer bottles clinking together 

&gt; it's *her*

&gt; [mfw](http://media.tumblr.com/70152e12818724194226aa524e980fd0/tumblr_inline_mkyt4jmcNE1qz4rgp.gif) she slams the door open

&gt; in walks the inebriated, amorphous behemoth with a bottle of red wine

&gt; said creature is about 5'5/350 lbs and too white to look at directly without damaging your retinas  

&gt; stifled groans fill the air as everyone tries to figure out who invited her, but to no avail

Fast forward to the end of the night

&gt;hamplanet has finished about a bottle and a half of wine and also downed several shots of vodka

&gt; she starts looking kinda queasy and has broken out in a cold sweat

&gt; accidentally kicks over the trash can and can no longer walk around without leaning up against the wall

&gt; nope.jpeg

&gt; next thing we know, she is leaning up against the bay window attempting to sit on the ledge that's maybe 5 inches wide

&gt; shirt has come untucked, exposing rolls on rolls on rolls rippling like a flag on the 4th of July

&gt; she is reaching back trying to steady herself and has almost pulled the blinds off of the wall when her roommate reluctantly volunteers to take her home

&gt; we all breathe a sigh of relief

&gt; but not so fast, the leviathan is gagging and leaning her head back, attempting not to puke everywhere

&gt; it takes a group of 4 people to help her across the room and in the direction of the bathroom

&gt; party returns to normal as everyone assumes she safely made it to the bathroom

&gt; jk

&gt; one of the guys who lives in the apartment comes back into the kitchen yelling about how the creature broke his bedroom door

&gt; she fell into his door and snapped it right off of the fucking hinges

&gt; [mfw](http://media.tumblr.com/3244a43c3b5dca96452602b55dd18dba/tumblr_inline_mjni4rDR7K1qz4rgp.gif) I survey the trail of devastation she has left throughout this godforsaken apartment

&gt; her roommate eventually gets her home and puts her to bed, but the things we have seen that night cannot be unseen, and the stench of her puke cannot be unsmelled

&gt; plus that poor kid's bedroom door was still laying out in the hallway

&gt; hamplanet was okay, but this was only one of several weekends when she showed up to parties uninvited and broke all sorts of things

TL;DR hamplanet shows up to party, gets belligerently drunk, throws up, and breaks a door.

I applied to a company in FL, that I recently had an internship with, to 2 part time jobs. One works with research and the other is a vacation planner. I passed the web-based interview, the 2nd interview, and thought I was going to have a phone interview next with a real person, but turns out that I have to go in person. The dates they gave me are on this Thursday (two days from now) or in the last week of April. The problem you might ask? I live in the Northeast US. I can't fly down that quick, and I'm not sure if I can schedule the interviews for later dates in May. I've been searching forums with this company to see if rescheduling can happen. No luck yet.

So that's my current situation. I guess my question relies in the realm of if anyone else has applied or jobs out of state/across the country, how did the process go and has anyone been in a situation like this? At this point, it's hard to come across a job in my state and I'll literally take any part time/full time job that isn't a scam/prostitution. Maybe moving across country for a PT job is a bad idea, but it's for a really good company.

I've been on a job hunt since I graduated last May and landed the internship in August. I have future goals to go back to school next Fall if I do not find a reputable job in the next year. 

Any advice is helpful and appreciated!"

The University (Alabama, about a month before the big drug bust) actually dropped my case due to insufficient evidence. I was on top of the world when two weeks later February 1st I was greeted at my dorm by 3 cops and was arrested and tried by the city of Tuscaloosa. I have been going through a diversion program since then and have not smoked and have done everything I was supposed to and paid off all of my owed money. Essentially all I have left through the program is to take a drug test once a month until August. Recently however I found out I was accepted for an internship in Philadelphia (I love about 45 min outside the city). This is a huge opportunity not only for my career and some much needed experience, but to also prove to my family and close ones that although I have made mistakes, there is nothing that will stop me from always working to be the best I can be. The problem is I cannot accept the internship unless I have the certificate saying I completed the diversion program. My lawyer told me that while it doesn't happen all that often, it is not unheard of for the judge to let people in the program off early for special circumstances. My lawyer and I will be going infront of the Judge sometime next week to see if he'll allow me to end the program early. This is the part that I feel gives me an advantage, my corrections officer is mid twenties and a great guy and he likes me and has said that he will write a letter saying that he supports letting me off early and that he feels the program has helped me and essentially done what it has supposed to. On top of that I have a letter from the women that taught the court mandated class I had to complete this month saying that she also supports it. A teacher of mine (criminal justice, a former lawyer) wrote a similar letter as well and I just found out that the RA that originally busted me will be writing one as well saying that I have been in good standing with the dorm and she feels I have learned my lesson. Now I dont have my hopes up because the judge has no personal affiliation with me and he wont gain anything by letting me off early, but do any of you think that I have any chance or am I just going to get laughed at and turned away?


Tl;DR I'm supposed to be on probation until August but was accepted for an internship that I cannot participate in unless I am released from probation early. I have a lawyer, and letters from my corrections officer, court referral class teacher, a teacher at my University and from the RA that originally busted me all saying they feel I have learned my lesson and should be released early in order to pursue the huge opportunity before me.

Since there seems to be a lack of jobs in Boston in trade publishing, I'd like to go back to school and to travel. I would like to get a masters in either publishing or children's literature somewhere in the UK or Ireland. Can anyone recommend good programs?

My criteria would be:

Affordable: I graduated undergrad '11 so I am still a slave to loans (lots of debt!)

Not for beginners: I went to Emerson College which was pricey but did give me a good over view of the basics of publishing as well as internships in publishing. So if it is a publishing program, I'd want one that goes more indepth or has a particular focus.

Good source for jobs: It would be ideal if I could get a job in the UK after/during my graduate studies. If the grad program has a good track record for helping students get work visas and jobs, that would make my dreams come true!

Central location: AKA, I will not have a car and would need to get around only by public transportation.

Please let me know if you guys have any ideas! Any help is greatly appreciated. Travel + publishing = dream come true. (cross posted to studyabroad)

I'm currently doing a programming internship.  I'm doing an 8 month internship with them and I just finished the first four months.  They liked my presence and work ethic from the get-go, and are willing to give me a full time job at the end of my internship, regardless if I choose to finish my degree.  They're proposing to me $80,000/year.

Would it be feasible to drop out of school to take this job?  I'm in my third year of university, and it was my first internship.  I loved every minute of it, but at the same time I know that there are stories about people not escalating in salary and that their lack of degree is to blame.  I feel like if I take it, I should drop out of school because it seems like it would be too much to have on my plate and one of the two would suffer from taking both at the same time.  If any of you guys did have a full time programming job and took school on the side, how was it?  Manageable?  Too much?

Thank you in advance for your guys' insight, I really appreciate it."

Sunday we spent at the Geargia Aquarium (which is a great aquarium, but I get bored with that sort of stuff and annoyed by so many people - everything had crowds around it) and then spent the rest of the day in Little Five Points - Got coffee at Java Lords, shopped at Rag-O-Rama, grabbed a beer at The Porter Beer Bar, and then ate at The Vortex.

At the BLS we've drawn up an **inquiry letter** for you guys to tell you what we're about:

http://www.thelibertyhq.org/SFLInquiry.pdf

The gist of it is as follows:

- **Campus outreach** – partnering with on-the-ground activists spreading the ideas of liberty on their campuses. This includes providing them with further education in economics and philosophy, as well as working with them to organize seminars, events, and discussion groups. Since knowledge is local, we seek to mirror the structure of Students for Liberty, which provides support for activists while allowing them wide berth in deciding what activities are most suited to their campuses.

- **Easy online access to libertarian ideas** – there has been much scholarship done in the tradition of classical liberalism in the world. Unfortunately, many of the critical essays  and conclusions have not made their way into Bulgarian form; even when they exist,  they are not accessible to the general public and to students specifically. We seek to  create an online portal for libertarian ideas in Bulgarian to make the principles of liberty clear, concise, and publicly available.

I'll be running this fundraiser on libertarian forums for a few days. **Our overall goal is $3000-$4000**, but for now I've set the goal target to $1200 so that we don't end up falling short of the amount and not getting any of the money.

What I ask is that you **find it in your heart to give up a few beers and donate to the cause**. We'd love donations around $10-$20 (or more!), but it would be wonderful even if you can donate just $5.

**Here is the link to donate**:

https://givethegiftofliberty.org/student-needs/view/135

Donations are made through the Students For Liberty organization and are tax-deductible. Your info is safe with SFL.

We're looking into setting up a Bitcoin wallet if you guys prefer using that (though, for practical purposes, the BLS prefers the fiat donation at this time).

If you've ever found any posts of mine useful or if you've used LibertyHQ (http://thelibertyhq.org/thelibertyhq.org/learn/index.php?listID=5), I'd appreciate a donation!! :D

At the end of the project, we will be writing a report up for you guys on our progress."

I started a dog training internship in January at a wonderful local shelter that has their own training and behavior center, and it really inspired me to turn training into my career. I find the concepts come easily to me, and I find it to be a very gratifying use of my time (especially in the shelter environment).

I would just like to know more about having a career as a trainer. I'm hoping to eventually get a job at the shelter I'm interning with because I love the current staff and I agree with their positive training methods. Are there any trainers that have worked in/with a shelter? I'm assuming you might make a smaller salary in a shelter situation than a small business. I do not believe I would be able to start my own business right away, but eventually when my husband I have a significant amount of money saved up, it might be a possibility. I'd love to hear any details about owning your own training facility as well. Does anyone teach just specialty classes?

I know KPA goes over some business aspects in their course, but I'd love to hear from you guys as well. 

Any other advice for a green trainer would be wonderful as well. I plan on using my new skills to work with dogs in the rescues and shelters I volunteer with at the very least, but I am hoping I can turn this into a successful career for myself. "

At Tempe Main there are four day care facilities on campus that facilitate the needs of student parents.  http://www.asu.edu/studentaffairs/reslife/family/oncampus.htm  Granted Tempe campus is large, but can we at least get one?  There was a childcare facility on campus for more than 15 years!  There was actually a rally in 2008 to protest the closing of the old one.   http://www.azcentral.com/community/glendale/articles/2008/04/15/20080415gl-protest0415-ON.html   Students would not be the only ones benefiting from a childcare center on campus.  Faculty have kids too and this would be convenient to them as well.  Also, where better to get an education than a University?  Particularly a University that has a great Teachers college!  Students taking early education classes would be available for internships right here on campus! The children would get a huge advantage of learning right here with students teaching and learning right alongside of them.   The lack of options available to students as well as faculty and their children are the reasons we took some steps to raise awareness of no child care at West Campus.  We designed a home web page http://childcare4west.jimdo.com/  and also a Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/pages/Child-Care-at-West/170351986450734?ref=tn_tnmn .  This did not technically go as planned as most of the likes we got on our Facebook page were my friends, most not going to West Campus.  We also went to the USG and had them print out our designed flyers so we could post them around campus.  I also went around asking students if they were parents and handed out maybe five out of the 30 or so I asked.  It was also very disheartening to see our flyers not on the bulletin boards the following day.  I did talk with the new student body president for next semester.  His name is Howard Waldie IV and he was actually on the same page and already has plans on bringing up this issue with the student body.  I told him about the websites and let him know that if he needs anything to let me know because I will be here my senior year.  Also in an attempt to not going out without a fight **I will be bringing my children to campus with me today.** I plan on having my children present with me **today on the Fletcher Lawn from 11-Noon** promoting this cause to bring childcare to West Campus.  I am going to have them holding up homemade picket signs and I am hope they will help me get signatures to help this. I will personally give them to Waldie to get the ball rolling as well as maintain the websites for him and continue fighting the good fight so future students can get the benefits of having a child care center right here on West campus!"

Would I just tell them I prefer to code in Java or do I just spend whatever time I have to try and learn C++ fluently? (EDIT: I have learned C as well, does that help any?)

Please and thank you for any help!

EDIT: General Consensus: Aw poop. I don't know why I didn't put C++ in my ""Familiar with"" section instead. Sigh. Sorry, I know I screwed up."

1cy55j,2,2013-04-23,Gap Year in Taiwan! Is it feasible financially and what are the opportunities available?,rowdowntown,taiwan,https://www.reddit.com/r/taiwan/comments/1cy55j/gap_year_in_taiwan_is_it_feasible_financially_and/,"Hi r/taiwan. As the title suggests, I'm interested in taking a gap year in Taiwan, and basically just getting in touch with the culture there.

Some background info:
I'm currently a third year Law student (4 year degree) studying in an Australian university. The reason why I'm feeling like taking a gap year is because I've been feeling pretty bummed and jaded about life and uni/law thus far. I'm Chinese, native speaker and perfectly fluent in both Mandarin and English. I can speak reasonable TaiYu? I'm actually interested in Taiwan because as a kid, I spent a year there (parents were career diplomats). 

So the issue I face currently is that,
1. as a un-graduated uni student, what job opportunities are there for me in Taiwan?
2. with regards to teaching english, are there any specific qualifications I must undertake before being able to teach?
3. what is the culture with regards to internships in the legal industry, and how do I go about applying for them?
4. cost of living (rent, food, entertainment)

Thanks alot for helping me! :)"

I'm open to it being a more-than-friends thing, but it doesn't have to be.


Below is a bit about me, and a bit of what I'm looking for but don't let it hamper you--I'm always up to meet new people. If you're interested just message me. If you want a photo of me, just ask. Can't wait to hear from you!

**About Me:**

* I'm a Political Science/International Affairs Major. If I was better at math I'd have gone into physics or biology; I have a reading interest in those fields--so scientists please apply!

* I'm always up for a show or to just chill with some music. I listen to mostly indie (Franz Ferdinand, the Wombats, Regina Spektor) but also have a recent interest in nujazz, electroswing, and their older components. I also listen to rap/hiphop (I grew up in the Bronx).

* I was friends with a lot of theater kids in HS, so I'm always up for a show or movie.

* I'm pretty blunt, and can have a ribald sense of humour--but I do have wit when I feel like it.

* I like to cook and make drinks! (I turn 21 pretty much the moment I move back)

* I'm equally happy staying in and hanging out as I am going out on an adventure--fun is what you make of where you are with the people you are with!

* Bastion is my favourite game.

* I work out pretty often; I'm not Adonis but I do take care of myself.

**About You:**

* Are open and thus enjoy sharing your interests and ideas.

* Passion for quality.

* Don't need every detail of a plan fleshed out, but do plan a bit.

* Take care of yourself and wouldn't mind being a gym buddy.

* Whatever your thing is, you have no problem talking about it until you have lost me completely."

This weekend I'm going to a symposium.training for my internship and I will be presenting a new a compain that will revolve around gathering a good amount of volunteers for future 4/20's in the area. Whether people generalize towards stoners or not the fact that a group of people gathered solely for the purpose of smoking and then left a mess will inevitably lead people to inaccurate conclusions. It is up to us to change those conclusions and the condition of our park. Since earth day is so close to 4/20 we have contacted other eco-friendly organizations around the city and organizations at other bay area universities. The symposium is this weekend and anything realistic enough to execute by my team and leaders can go! So if you have any ideas of how we can improve this from an environmental standpoint I'd be happy to discuss this and maybe create something great and efficient for next year.

1cxiha,9,2013-04-23,"Weight loss, pregnant wife",Andrew_Squared,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1cxiha/weight_loss_pregnant_wife/,"I'm here looking for advice on how to deal with this situation, and I'm including a bit of preamble to provide understanding. I'll put a TL;DR at the bottom.

My wife and I have always been bigger people, and struggle with weight regularly. When my wife was pregnant with our first daugther, I balooned up to 265 lbs (6'0""), and my wife put on far more weight than she should have. It got to the point where she was pre-eclampsic, and the doctors decided to enduce to put a halt to it (was about a week early, so no biggie - daughter is perfectly healthy). 

At the start of January, my wife and I started trying to get pregnant, and by February we were. Ths time around, I was down to 245 when we started, and my wife's starting weight at conception is 40 lbs less than conception the first time around. She'd been awesome, and knocking off the weight - I'd been supportive but not joining in. Also around the start of January I began a new job (internship), and my senior year of my B.S., and decided that I'd start working on losing weight after getting settled into the first week of class. I'm now at 223 lbs, and have been getting commented regularly from people and friends about it. I even got called a ""skinny-minny"" by the Pastor's wife, which for me, is a total mind-scramble.

The issue I'm dealing with, is that my wife, at 13 weeks, is starting to show. She's happy for me, but she's dealing with all the things that pregnant women deal with. Including some self-concious issues about size, and the contrast of my weight-loss to her gain. I try to reassure, and affirm her that her gain so far is completely natural and healthy, but it doesn't seem to put her at ease.

So, for the TL;DR: does anyone have suggestions on how to help a 13-week pregnant woman not get disheartened in the face of a spouses weight loss?"

I will go to China to study for a year next year. I'm very excited, however first I must choose between studying at Nanjing Daxue or Xiamen Da. 

I understand Xiamen is a far prettier and pleasant city with a lot less pollution. However Nanjing has a stronger economy and a larger business sector according to my reading... and ultimately I want to be able to find work and internships while I'm out there. In addition to this Nanjing's proximity to Shanghai offers itself as a big plus.

Am I overlooking Xiamen's business sector? Are there lots of opportunities there too? 

If you have any experiences of the two cities please tell me about them!"

A week ago my 22end birthday passed and even for being young I have not even done simple things people my age have done. I'm not depressed. I don't want to feel better, I want something to change. when I look objectively at my life it's just really bad, and yet I can't see my life improving.

I had a pretty bad childhood and grew up as a latch key kid with little support(I was an immigrant and my parents were usually busy), my childhood was filled with bullying and not fitting in due different background which caused some serious lack of self esteem, confidence issues, and inferiority complexes.

I'm currently not depressed at all but the state of my life has really been stagnate for the past few years. My life is generally tedious and uninteresting, yet I feel I'm not in any position to change anything about it. I want to get out of this but I feel like there's dead ends everywhere and it causes this immense feeling of extreme frustration and feeling of being trapped.

I graduated HS 4 years ago now and I've been attending a small boring community college. I didn't feel passionate about anything and couldn't figure out what I wanted to do which caused some serious time wasting and bad grades. The place was packed and I often couldn't get any classes I needed which wasted a lot of time. I began taking classes I didn't need so I could acquire priority in registration. During my time at community college I often had extreme bouts of negative emotions, felt depressed, extremely lonely, bored, directionless. I withdrew from a lot of classes and this screwed me over. I had nothing to strive for, no goal, I was going through the motions, and began to have issues sleeping and started having awful grades, this kept going down in spiral. The campus was often empty, drab, and no one was around. There were no clubs. I just wanted to get out and I could not. I'm socially proficient, yet despite all attempts I found it extremely difficult to make friends at community college(due to the nature of the place).

I spent the two years or so slowly improving myself even more, talking to people, dressing better, going to the gym every so often, but not much changed in my life. I still have only 3 friends and no social network to speak of. My weekends are spent at home, yet I highly dislike being at home all the time, I often feel VERY alone and VERY lonely. I did finally just recently find a girl and we went on a date, went well. I do look good on the outside and people often assume some very positive things about me(That I'm cool, have friends and that I'm intelligent and get good grades and have my life together), but the reality is I'm a failure. I often feel very odd when people compliment something positive about me.

Compared to many people I am incredibly underdeveloped life experience/success wise for my age, yet at the same time I have the potential but no conducive environment for it. I'm not around anyone successful, I'm not around anyone my age who's doing something fun, or interesting, I don't have a group, there's no one for me to ""network"" off of. I'd love to get into a niche, or meet some person who's doing something interesting, or be in a place where something is happening. I'm still in the same town I was when I graduated, surrounded the same people, and experiencing the same things. I hate my life everyday. I have potential and but I'm not in the right places and around the right people............I'm just here......stuck.

 Most people my age are living it up, having so much fun with their lives, yet I'm stuck here and experienced none of it. Fuck I haven't even gone to a real party yet, and I just recently got my first kiss. I'm so behind compared to the way people seem to generally view me, and it's really annoying. My lack of life experience makes me extremely frustrated. I'm wasting away my 20s and some of the best time of my life, where I have the time, youth, and energy. 

 In the last six months I finally settled on something for a major. I need about one more year till I transfer, at the same time that many of my peers are GRADUATING and getting internships and jobs and getting paid well. This is something that causes me a lot of turmoil. I eats me up inside. I know it's not a race but I personally WANT to finish already, I can't bear being in the same situation any longer. I so badly want my life to ""start"" and I keep feeling like my life hasn't ""started"" yet. It's like big puzzle piece and I want the puzzle to finish but the goddamn fucking pieces aren't coming together and I can't make them together because they're just not there so I have to waste more of my life. A lot of those four years of life were completely wasted, I try not to dwell on the past but I'm still not going anywhere. I just wanted to get out of this place and I can't, I have to wait about one more year, then after that there's at least 2 more years when I transfer. This makes a total of approximately six years to get my degree. Now let's just hope I even get a chance to get a job....that's another story.

My parents are very old and sick, and I'm from a lower poor class. They're very demanding and negative about me, and I admit I have many short comings. I need to step up and I always needed to but I never did and wasn't able to, and I let them down. 

I feel trapped in my situation, I'm trapped in school, I'm trapped in my lacking social life, I'm trapped by my lack of money, I'm trapped at home. I want my life to start already, I want the rocket to launch but I feel grounded, stuck in the dull black tar pit of my life. My personality is one that seeks novelty, yet my life is extremely monotonous. After four years and seemingly no feeling of ""moving forward"" anywhere school has become a chore. I have a constant feeling of ""frustration"" like I'm stuck, trapped, at a stand still, like I'm trying to run but I'm bound. The ennui of life is bearing down on me and I feel like there's no novelty or purpose to my life. It feels like I'm in life's stream swimming in a pool of molasses. 

tl;dr

-I'm 22 now

-only 3 friends, no social life.

-no money, poor, parents sick, very old

-4 years wasted at community college, still not done, feel trapped in my situation

1cxby5,57,2013-04-23,Thanks to lurking r/personalfinance and r/frugal this is my financial plan (Tips for any of you youngies),Insaneswatage,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1cxby5/thanks_to_lurking_rpersonalfinance_and_rfrugal/,"So i'll start off by saying im 18 easy with the cash and well...wealthy to a certain extent.

I work 40 hours a week for school/internship? basically school requires us to work 1800 hours in our 4 year education at a company.

I pay all the bills i have myself. (Insurance,phone,gym,clothes,sports)

My income:

I have the small amount of money i get from the school working at a company (185 euros a month)

I work at a restaurant as a dishwasher. I dont really enjoy working more than once a week because its a boring job. But yet i do work 2/3 times per week at the restaurant from 6PM till 11PM/1AM.



I started my own small business at marktplaats which is like craigslist.
I build PC's for cash assist people at their home with building PC's or problems with their tablets/pc's/router etc. All the money i earn with this is cash.



So now how i divide my funds and will keep dividing it like this.

I took my moms big ol' wallet.(Multiple compartments)
Put in each compartment a note of what i want. (Tech,Hobby's,furniture,going out,luxuries)

Then i put all of my cash leftovers,earnings and tippings in there in the compartment of what i want.

With my bank account im saving up for a drivers license and a new pc.




Income for the bank account are. pocket money, Study finance ring, Care allowance,wages(work and internship).

The bills for gym,insurance,phone get depriaciated automatically. Then every month i put my leftover money on my savings account.

Thank you reddit and i hope this helps someone or gives someone an idea.


Edit: Things i did to save cash (Bringing bread and fruit to work, buying less small crappy things i don't really need and the biggest one of all taking 3 days before doing a big purchase to make up my mind about really needing it!)

Also protip: I keep 50 Euros on my bank account for emergency situations. For being stranded with the bike or having to take the Bus/Cab home. Not planning on using it unless i am in a dire situation."
1cxb0j,1,2013-04-23,"Upset about Simcity and/or 2.0, Here are 5 things you can do about it.",[deleted],SimCity,https://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1cxb0j/upset_about_simcity_andor_20_here_are_5_things/,"*I'm sure I'm gonna get down voted for this, but remember, I'm not saying you shouldn't be angry/upset, I'm just saying move on and try something new*

I'm really tired of seeing the simcity Reddit hatecircle that has developed.  I understand what you guys feel, Simcity's launch was a disaster, cities keep getting deleted because of online only DRM, and there are still major game breaking bugs over a month after launch.  I was lucky enough to get refunded through a glitch on their end (customer support said the game had an offline mode available before launch, obviously it didn't so I was misled) but as someone who's been misled by companies, I can feel losing 60-80 bucks on something that you expected to be finished.  But I'm also tired of seeing people whine on this forum without actually doing anything about it.

So here are a couple things you can do to take your mind off the game and/or doing something to prevent EA from doing this again.

1.  Demand action on electronic consumer rights and refunds for defective purchases from your representatives.

We have several layers of representation in this country, but the ones who can effect this are your federal and state representatives.  Write to them telling your stories of woes and demand investigations into EA by the CFPB (consumer financial protection bureau) or by congress for monopolistic practices.  They're there to serve you, and if they don't then vote for the guy who will.  If you're rep doesn't know whats wrong, then he can't take actions against it (and EA also makes it illegal for you too sue them, tell your rep to limitus test that law too)  The president doesn't have very much power to take action on his end, but if enough people write to their representatives bitching about the same thing, someone will bring it up in a committee and we might see something happen from the top down.  Try your state reps too, unless they're Jerry Hill [D-CA/leg], Kevin Mullin [D-CA/leg], or Jackie Speier [D-CA13/fed] (who represent EA's HQ district in the California Congress), they'll probably be more likely to listen, especially if your a primary voter in their party.

[http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/](congressmen)
[http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm](senators)
[http://thomas.loc.gov/home/state-legislatures.html](state congresses)

tell them what your upset about, most of them have a website and they're there to represent you.

2.  Write a letter to EA 

Why a letter, because it cost's them money to reply to you.  Stamps aren't free, nor is the person who has to read your letter.  Assuming it takes 5 minutes for some ~~slave labor~~ unpaid interns, you're still using someone's time and energy (the supervisor most likely).  That costs them money, lets say your letter costs them 5 minutes to have someone read it, print a canned response, stuff it in an envelope, and stamp it back to you, that's still 5 minutes of their time you've burnt, lets say 50 cents + envelope, paper, stamp is about a buck.  You just wasted a dollar (or more) of EA's time by bitching about their game.  That's both satisfying and enjoyable to know.  Plus, you'll be helping our beleaguered postal service, its really a win win for you and a lose lose for them.

Bitch about whatever, you want, Always online DRM, Forced Multiplayer, lack of refunds, binding arbitration, origin, being called homophobes as a response to winning (losing?) WCIA 2013 (again), its your letter, let your heart out.  Don't do anything stupid though, like write them death threats or put white powder in their letters, your complaining, not trying to terrorize them (its also a federal felony punishable by jail time and fines)

Here's their address

Electronic Arts
209 Redwood Shores Parkway
Redwood City, CA 94065
(this is their corporate headquarters, so address it to Complaints, Customer Service, Lucy Bradshaw, etc)

oh, and in your letter, don't forget to mention

3.  Actually Boycott EA

Many of us have said this at one point or another, but never actually followed through with it.  I said this after buying spore in 2009, then ended up buying another copy (accidentally) and another copy on steam (when I lost both the CD copies).  In addition to several other less than exciting titles (red alert 3, command and conquer 4, Medal of Honor) This time, follow through with it.  Tell them you're really pissed about the launch, and tired of being treated like a mat.  demand an offline mode, or inform them you're never purchasing another EA game until they clean up their act.

They probably won't care, but hey, you just wasted $1 of their time, write a few if your want.  If they don't respond, it just makes them look bad, then you can go back to #1.

and while your waiting for your responses...

4.  Try a new game (preferably from an independent studio)

some of us wished for a hail mary with Civitas (I did, which in hindsight was misguided and stupid) but there are other fun games to fill the void while they fix Simcity (or while you wait for a response).  Here are a couple good ones

* [Tropico 4](http://store.steampowered.com/app/57690/?snr=1_7_15__13) **30**
Tropico 4 is a bit like Simcity Societies (shudder) except with a political theme too it.  You're a Fidel Castro like character who's taken over a sandbox island in the Caribbean.  There are islands with missions, and Sandbox Islands where you do as you want.  its as beautiful as Simcity (which is surprising seeing as the engine was built in 2009) and plays really smoothly on almost any computer.  [/r/tropico](http://www.reddit.com/r/tropico/)

*  [Civilization](http://store.steampowered.com/app/8930/?snr=1_7_15__13) **30**base **50**w/ expansions
This game is a little odd on this list, as it's a strategy, not a sim game, but its a good way too lose track of time.  Its often called the most [addicting](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLqW7G8797U) game ever made, and it really shows.  You pick a civilization and grow, fight, and try to take over the planet, which is randomly generated or based on the real world.  Its also got a huge mod database, with everything from ingame editors to new units to [a Game of Thrones mod](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=128722076) and a loyal fanbase.  yea, its not an idie developer, but its an awesome game.  [r/civ](reddit.com/r/civ)

*  [Prison Architect](http://store.steampowered.com/app/233450/?snr=1_7_15__13) **30**
**THIS GAME IS IN ALPHA**
An odd little game, but fun nonetheless.  You build and manage your own cartoon prison, but with a shockingly deep insight into the failures of our (the US) prison system.  Its full of bugs, but its also being actively updated, [they even have croud-sourcing if you'd like to see yourself in the game and write a bio](http://www.introversion.co.uk/prisonarchitect/).  Its fun, distracting, frustrating, and at times quite sad, but they also have forums for you to complain on (and have people listen to you!).  [r/prisonarchitect](http://www.reddit.com/r/prisonarchitect/)

*  [Cities in Motion 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/225420/?snr=1_7_15__13) **20**
You've probably seen a couple screenshots posted on the r/simcity forum of people (myself included) showing off their [multilayer bridges](http://i.imgur.com/c3ksOAX.jpg).  In this, your a corporate type trying to build a city's public transportation system using buses, subways, trolleybusses, trams, and boats.  Its more of a traffic management Sim, but its got a complicated but usable map editor that lets you terraform and lay down roads.  A city develops accordingly, but you have no control really over whats there or why its there, nor over city services.  It's fun, and its a good distraction from simcity's traffic issues, especially since you can actually do something about them in CiM2.  [/r/CIM](http://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesInMotion/

* [OpenTTD](http://www.openttd.org/en/) **free**
Another Traffic Simulator, open TTD is based on software from the 90's that has been kept alive by a team as dedicated to it as the Simcity Community is to SC4.  It's a lot of fun, and has a huge number of mods that make a modded game even better.  Its also free, so there's no loss from trying it, and if you don't like it, just delete it.

*I left out SC4 because it's supporting EA and everyone here most likely has it, not that it's not a good game*

5.  Find another reddit to occupy your time

We're all passionate lovers of Simcity here, but everyone has other interests.  You'd be surprised what you can find out there, try hitting the random button and going on a journey.  [Find something you love and visit them once in a while](http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3u1wqg/).  Life's too short to spend in a blind rage about a video game that didn't meet your expectations.

The WGN-TV hijacking occured during The Nine O'clock News,  though this was quickly resolved by the station's engineers. Here's the [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj1mUk04_ho) and transcription of the WTTW event:

&gt;""Looks like it's got blood prints on it!""

&gt;(The scene then cuts away to ""Max"" leaning to his right with his pants pulled down, exposing his left buttock.

&gt;""They're coming to get me!""

&gt;""Bend over, bitch.""

&gt;(The girl pretends to spank the top of his rear end with the flyswatter while he moans and screams.)

&gt;""Oh, do it!""

&gt;(More screams from ""Max."")

The intruders would have required commercial grade equipment as well as a sophisticated knowledge of microwave and broadcasting technology. Many have suspected University of Chicago or Columbia College students of being behind the video piracy -- perhaps an unhappy broadcast engineering student who was an intern with WGN-TV.

I started in an unpaid internship after my graduation, because I had no other choice that wouldn't lead me to a dead end job when I had no experience. 

I worked 60-70 hours a week, sometimes I would go to work on weekends with 1 days notice, sometimes I work until the morning, get 4 hours of sleep, come back for another 12 hours day. I moved to a place where I know no one, I sacrificed my social life, and I literally have an hour or two to my own everyday.

I took every opportunity to learn new software, new skills; took every criticism like it's a god given gift to point out my weakness and make me a better person; I stayed around office to the morning to help out my team, even if it's not my project.

And my friends would ask me, in their comfortable, dead end jobs, ""hey, have you got paid yet?"" And I would joke with them about it, I would joke about myself. But deep inside it only made me want to work harder.

I dreamed of a day I can pay my own rent, pay for my gf's dinner because I can afford it, buy things and not feel guilty about spending money from my parents.

After about half a year later, they hired me, with very low pay, but even more pressure and more hours. I once worked through three weekends, work until midnight on every single day. I would get yelled at by my boss for two hours, and as soon as I get out from his office, I put a smile on my face. 

Because everyone likes someone who smiles.

All of these, everything only made me stronger, made me want it more, and made me motivated. When I finally started job hunting again, I was drowning in interviews, i got call backs from more than 30% of my applications. And finally, I got an offer today with a large corporation doing a job in my field. 

At first I was surprised, and then it just felt like validation, validation for every fucking bit of hard work I put into it, every fucking 24 hours work day, every yelling I took and worked through.

And then they come and say I'm lucky.

No, I'm not fucking lucky. I want to tell the world, I deserve every interview, every offer I get, because I WORKED MY ASS OFF for it.

When you are out drinking, I'm working; when you are dating your girlfriend, I'm working; before you go to sleep, I'm working; after you wake up, I'm still fucking working.

And I'm going to keep improve and learn. Because I know, for a fact, that hard work pays off."

An occasional lurker of this subreddit coming to you guys with my current situation because I'm not sure who else to ask (my premed advisor's appointments are booked through the end of this week).  As a senior graduating at the end of next month, I am very *very* lucky to have secured two job offers and I am a finalist for the Fulbright English Teaching Assistantship (not the research grant).  Now, my decision for the job offers is due at the end of the week and I have no idea what to choose.

**Background**

- Asian female... does this matter?  I don't know.

- good MCAT (36)

- good GPA studying hard science at a top 20 uni (4.0 in the past two years, but 3.7 overall)

- good ECs (shadowing, meaningful clinical volunteering for two organizations)

- good research (basic science: 2 years, senior thesis and two posters, no pubs but acknowledged in a paper; clinical: .5 year research internship at hospital for clinical trial pt enrollment, other: abstract and manuscript author and poster presenter for a free clinic's innovative model of blahblahblah)

- unsure about LORs at the moment - nervous about this.

- not really distinguished in my hobbies (no awards in music, dance, writing, etc.)

**Job offers:**

- *(50-75% chance of receiving) Fulbright English Teaching Assistantship in Southeast Asia*

I am scared about this because I will have a lot of responsibility (to independently teach multiple(!) English classes) and I know international flights are pretty expensive during med school interviews.  Seems like it would be fun, and man - I would love to say that I was a Fulbright scholar.

- *National Institutes of Health Postbacc IRTA (full-time, stipend)*

I don't know how I landed this job because it requires Matlab (I have *basic* experience), I don't like coding, and I don't know anything about radiology.  But they liked me.  The stipend is modest ($29k) to live in Wash DC, but... other than the programming-all-day part, I don't see any glaring problems and the previous IRTA said research mentorship was excellent at this lab!

- *top 5 academic med center lab tech (50% paid position -- what does this even mean?)*

Research topic is interesting to me and directly related to my undergrad research.  Responsibilities in basic science *and* clinical settings, which is great!  i will be in the same coast/state as my family for the first time in 4 years, and I would really love to work in this location because it will look good for my in-state medical school interviews.

We brokeup because I casually mentioned I would, in the very rare case that my friend needed me to, help him pass a drug test for an 8 week internship at an insurance company. She flipped out and basically started saying how that showed things about my character that would reflect on me for the rest of my life, that I was a liar for helping him lie etc etc.  I calmly pointed out that A. There was 0 risk of anything and B. Nobody was being harmed.  I pointed out her violations of her schools academic honesty code that did indeed harm other students but that seemed to just make her more mad.  She was basically transferring her dislike of marijuana (which she has never tried) to the situation. 

This went on for a day and a half.  It got to the point today where it stopped being any sort of amusing that she was freaking out about it and I said she needed to either drop it (as we had both said everything we had to say) or decide it was something very important to her and I would not fly to see her as planned this week.  She, being terrible at dealing with emotions and adversity, decided to try to pretend and be tough and told me 'please don't come' (to which she later said she really didn't mean it, uhh lol).

I cancelled my flight, told her that was it, and wished her good luck on finals.  3 years of dating (1.5 of it long distance) down the tubes because I hypothetically would help a good friend pass a drug test.  There was a gut wrenching moment today when I realized that if things like this are such big deals and she cannot handle them that the idea of spending my entire life with her sounded like hell.

Naturally, my hair is wavy and VERY thick (like [this](http://www.shop4prom.com/photogallery/gallery/HAIR_TYPE/Wavy/rb-long-wavy-hair.jpg), but thicker). The top layer(s) of my hair are in pretty decent shape (not too oily, not too dry, not very frizzy), but the under-layers are really dry and broken. I normally just get long layers and a long side-bang, but I'm really tired of it. It's boring and it (clearly) does nothing to flatter my face. I'd like to find a cut that flatters my natural waves, but also makes styling it easier (I straighten my hair almost daily and it's driving me nuts, I need to learn how to style waves/curls). I have two weddings to go to this summer, and I'll be starting my internship so I suppose I'm looking for a more age-appropriate, polished haircut (I don't look like it, but I'm actually 22). I think my face is pretty round and I have a full-blown five-head, so I think bangs are a necessity - but clearly, my side-bangs aren't doing the trick. I'm hesitant to do a blunt bang. I think I should make note that I won't have a whole lot of time for styling once my internship starts as I'll be working anywhere between 60-80 hours a week between that and another job. 

It's a second priority, but I think color would be fun. I have to keep it professional for the aforementioned reasons. In 2007-08 I had [blonde highlights](https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc1/199447_1003140081876_1035_n.jpg) that got re-touched once every 4 weeks because my hair grows like wildfire. After a while, the highlights just turned into a blonde top-layer (I'm not sure why, but the streaks just kept getting chunkier) and I went to a [dark brown](https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/227832_1053669465079_5947_n.jpg). Again, the upkeep got too costly and I just let it grow back out to my natural, red/brown color. I was thinking caramel highlights would look good, I'm looking for color dimension that natural dirty blondes seem to have, but for brown/red hair.

So here's the story: flunked undergrad. Twice. Went back to school and barely graduated, with a 2.65 GPA. A lot of Fs and Ws. (Just wasn't mature enough for college, I guess, and crappy work ethic and attendance in classes.) My science classes weren't great - consistent Cs. Then I went to grad school, which I somehow managed to get into by the miracle of my GRE scores. Did much better this time around, 3.66 and got 2 years of research out of it.

I haven't taken the MCAT yet, but I do intend on studying my ass off before I do. I'm generally a pretty good standardized test taker, so I'm not TOO worried about it. 

How do med schools look upon non-traditional students like me? Do I even have a chance with my academic background, or should I just pursue a life of research instead?"

I came to this company internationally, and the processes for everything are completely different, and I was/am completely clueless as to how to go about doing things.

This department put me in the wrong tax class, so I'm paying 6 times more tax than I need to. They allowed me to have private health insurance, which is not allowed for my pay bracket. And, they've screwed up my salary more times than I care to list, resulting me in needing to survive in a foreign country on half of an intern's wage some months. The health cover screw-up cost me over a thousand euros, too.

Today, I got 5 forms for tax and health cover that HR neglected to tell me about until I called them asking why I wasn't covered for a recent doctor's appointment. I thought it was time for me to get my revenge hat on, so I filled out these forms wrong. Not so wrong that it's obvious, but wrong enough such that the information will get rejected. Over. And over. And over.

My plan is that they will either come back to me to get the information, or they will neglect to inform me that I am covered, giving me more ammunition when it comes time for me to file my complaint at the end of my contract. From experience, that latter is much more likely.

I'm not screwing myself over at all; I've learnt to live poor, and I'm still covered by my home insurance."

I was even incompetent at my old internship. taking plasma from tubes. What a joke. I have no skills. I've atrophied. I feel the light change, the loss of spark, loss of drive, a thirst for knowledge that has weakened, I abhorred my lack of ambition. I am loosing my zest for life. I have a small circle of acquaintances. I fear they no longer respect me. Too injured for my hobbies. I lay, wasting time.

Basically, I've with this girl for 6 months, but have done an internship for the last 3.5 months. I flew to see her three times and she flew to see me once. When I got back, it was in time for her 21st birthday, and I got drunk and acted like a jerk because I was being jealous of her being happy with her other friends. 

She says that she doesn't want to be with me because I am jealous and possessive, while that may be true, it has been greatly exacerbated by me spending so much time apart from her. She says that being together alone, with her family, and with certain friends she is very happy. She also says that being with certain friends who she knows I don't like feels uncomfortable. She also feels that I am keeping her from going and hanging out with her other friends because of my possessive behavior. 

This has all been within the last 36 hours. I genuinely love this girl and am willing to do whatever I need to do. I have scheduled a counseling session at my university to start to try to change my possessive ways. For now, she says that she doesn't know if she loves me and that too much damage could've already been done. She has agreed to wait 2-3 weeks due to her uncertainty. 

At that time I plan on asking her on a date to see what happens. My question: should I try to ignore her during this period, give her an occasional text (she agreed to text me every couple days to let me know she's doing ok), or just try to move on? 

I love her and am willing to do anything to keep her and to improve myself as a person through counseling.

TL;DR what should I do after being put on the hook for 2-3 weeks?

EDIT: I'm fully aware of my mistakes and I know that I'm reaping what I have sown. I'm prepared to go through months of counseling to fix my deep seeded issues if I have to. Commenters are right: if I truly love her I will wait."

Long rant, sorry

I’m in Canada so smoking in the winter sucks: Cold, wet, strong winds, having to get dressed up and take your gloves off to toke. Too many reasons and excuses to not go out to smoke. 
Problem is summer is quite to opposite. Warm, you finally want to spend time outside. Everybody is toking up or having a good time. This is what I associate with smoking. For me going out on my friends boat, having some beers and rolling up. its what I study every semester to hope I can go out and do. 

I haven’t toked since January, and for the past couple days, possibly because of my adhd I’ve been looking up nonstop day and night what vape to get and where it’s the cheapest… obsessively. 

Yet every time I’ve tried to make an order something has gone wrong. (Though it’s for the best) 
Being out bided, random losses of connection, out of stock, 3 power outages, losing my credit card, ect even after all that i made a purchase (mflb on eBay) a couple days later I look closely at the pic after and see… they spelled the slogan wrong, there’s an I missing in the word with… definitely a fake.. I contact him, says he can’t confirm it’s a fake or not, but that I could send it back.(if I get an mflb I want the life time warranty) Anyways if the unit is a fake I don’t want it. So pretty much I’ll send it back, no vape for me.

Just its sometime seems like I have a guardian angel that makes thing happen so that I don’t mess up. Probably just coincidence, anyways it seems that everything is telling me I shouldn’t start smoking again. 

Then my gf confronted me this morning that, she really didn’t want me smoking again all summer. We had a week together during my winter break where we had the house to ourselves for a whole week. Yet I bought a half Oz and was high the whole time. She doesn’t smoke but still put up with me just laughing by myself on the couch. 

Well we had all these plans to go snowboarding and maybe rent cottage, lots of fun things we could go out and do. She kept proposing stuff yet I would, say later or I don’t feel like it. (yup, I’m a real lame person) Yet because of pot I ended up staying on my couch smoking 5 j’s a day or more and we did nothing…sound familiar? 
Anyways I have an opportunity to maybe get an internship at a big company “bombardier” which would be really awesome. If they were to test me right now I would pass all drug tests. The experience would be great. 

Yes I still want to smoke knowing it will mess up everything for me. This part of me sucks! 

Tl:dr; everything in life is telling me to not start smoking again, and I have every reason not to yet,  I still want to!

My name is Mark, and i am currently a third year communication and multimedia design student, and i am an aspiring 3D artist.
starting from september 2013 i will have my first internship.

One thing that concerns me is that i dont have a significant portfolio for showing off my art. My current portfolio website is http://cargocollective.com/markbakker/.

I dont really have much to put on my portfolio, because i have been very busy on other (not 3d related) semesters.
I am currently working on a short movie called [Sleeper Agent](https://www.facebook.com/QuicksandProductionsOfficial) with six other students. 
I am the 3D artist in this group, but all the objects that i have are heavy Work in progress, and im not sure if i should put this on my portfolio. 

What i'm hoping for is that any of you can give me some pointers towards a better 3D art portfolio, your help is very much appreciated!

1d0q0k,3,2013-04-24,Pressure from a Third Party Recruiter,firetruck7755,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1d0q0k/pressure_from_a_third_party_recruiter/,"So I received a call yesterday from a third party recruiter and he told me about a position that he was looking to fill.  After talking to him about my background he thought that I would be a really good fit for the position and he wanted to submit my information to the company, however he needed to do a reference check first.

While I have a list of references, he specifically wanted to speak with a reference from my past internship. I had previously attempted to get in contact with my direct supervisor from my internship however, either his contact information changed or he no longer works at the company.  After I spent some time this morning attempting to find my old supervisors email address I sent him an email this morning asking if he would be willing to serve as a reference for me and to confirm his preferred contact information.  

I haven't heard back from him yet and this recruiter has already called me twice this morning wanting to know when I would get the references to him.  I haven't had much time to devote to getting in contact with my old supervisor since I am still in school and have been busy with classes/school work.  I also don't want to bother my past supervisor too much.

This recruiter has been putting a lot of pressure on me to get a reference list to him fast.  He seemed to think there was a high likely hood of having an onsite interview with the company and wants to expedite the process.  I really don't know how seriously to take this guy, the opportunity seems promising but I know how many of those recruiters are paid off commission and can be high pressure/overly optimistic."

I'm at University and we have a sandwich internship year where we're expected to go out into the world and find relative employment for 1 year. It's not compulsory, but it's one of the reasons I chose this University course, and I'd like to do it. Unlike a lot of my classmates I really want to do my internship abroad. Despite this, I've been applying to a number of local companies along with companies abroad to keep my options open.

This week I had an interview with one of these companies and I was called back later that day with an offer from them. They wanted a decision from me by the end of the day. It wasn't my #1 choice for an internship, and I felt that my hand had been called, so I declined in favor of continuing my search for something I really want. The company was nice, and the people I met there were friendly, but I didn't want to settle for something I wasn't 100% sure about.

People have told me that I shouldn't be picky with internships, and some people won't end up finding one. I know this, but it wasn't what I want -- I just didn't want to stay in my city for this internship. I'm young and may not have another chance like this. It was a hard decision to make but I hope it'll pay off. I'll be really upset if I cannot find a placement and had turned down my only offer, it'll mean I have to continue my studies, and I'll be one year ahead of my classmates. 

Later this week, I have a promising interview with a company I'm more interested in. I hope I get it, but I'm still scared. Leaving my friends, family, going to a foreign country etc. It's a huge change.

I've been hearing a lot of ""a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"". I just hope everything will work out.

Thanks.

I'm a rising senior at a liberal arts school with no ad program, but I can really see myself working in advertising. As of right now, I have experience as a social media intern as well as editing experience for a publication. I need to decide very soon if I am going to do this Creative Circus program or take an offer for an editorial internship. The Circus program would help me decide for certain if I want to work in a creative career and the specific track I would want to take if I did. It seems like a fun chance to learn a lot, network, meet cool people and potentially bolster my resume. It also might be enough to get me a good internship without having to go to a 2-year ad school. What do you think of this opportunity? I know it has a good reputation, but would everyone working in advertising recognize The Creative Circus, and would it put me ahead for an internship if you were hiring interns and saw this summer program/workshop on my resume?

My other option is to do an editorial internship at a publication that's pretty cool and legit, in a city I love with my boyfriend and my friends. If I don't work end up working in advertising I'll want to do something with editing, although I feel like I'll eventually end up wanting to work on the copywriting side of advertising. At the moment, I'm not sure if getting an internship is more or less valuable than taking advertising-specific courses at a school that's only well known within a niche community. An editorial internship still wouldn't look bad for employers in the ad industry, but if I do decide I want to work an editing job, I might feel like I'm behind without an internship this summer, and I'd have a hard time explaining The Creative Circus to people who aren't already familiar. Would the creative circus workshop help me for anything other than advertising? Or maybe it's such a good opportunity regardless that I shouldn't pass it up?

Thanks so much in advance for any insight!"

How’s everyone doing on this fine day!

I go to a small school in New York called St Thomas Aquinas College , or STAC.  I am enrolled in a dual-degree program here that then goes to Manhattan College.  I would be leaving here with a BS in Mathematics and BS Chemical Engineering.  I’d say right now I’m in good standings with my grades and should be fine getting into the program at Manhattan at the end of my years here.

Here are the classes i need to complete at St Thomas Aquinas College 

http://www.stac.edu/schools/as/pdf/Engineering Mechanical with Manhattan College 9-12.pdf
plus
Organic Chemistry ½
Quantitative Analysis 
Physical Chemistry

Once Completed there I have to take the actual Chem Engineering / general engineering courses at Manhattan College that are listed on this form. Seemingly mostly the junior/senior year of their colleges four-year program.

http://catalog.manhattan.edu/undergraduate/engineering/chemeng/#1

**- Would you object/add to the classes I have at STAC considering I’m kind of creating a makeshift major at STAC?**(has been done twice before by my advisor, because we technically don’t have a dual degree program for ChmE)

Im freaking out about internships and such because I feel I don’t have the actual  education to start into them now with just my regular physics/math/chem classes.  I don’t have the most competent of programming teachers here either sadly nor an actual variety of programs to get my hands on so I don’t have that either!  I have friends at larger schools with co-ops and actual engineering classes; I don’t feel qualified.  I’ve also given a look to some , the criteria to get in can get a bit extreme 
I’d say!

**-Would you say there are places that will bring in those without the greatest of education level ( any ideas where?) or should I wait for the time in Manhattan college where id have the Engineering classes under my belt?**

**-Would You say the BS in Mathematics will really have much of a difference in my chances to get a job?**

Few Other Questions
**-Classes most important to retain their teachings?

**-Do you learn most of your tasks and jobs on the job or are you required to know your job and do it day 1?**(obviously there pre-req but I’m saying job specifc)

**-Anyone know much about the reputation of Manhattan College’s Engineering program I only hear good things but who knows ?**

**-Just a general consensus of what I should be ready to face once I actually am in those ChmE classes**

I used to be an everyday smoker until 2 weeks ago, but then I smoked on 4/20 and I smoked last night (4/23) because I was too stressed with school.

The problem is that I am trying to secure an internship over the summer and I must be prepared for the possibility of a drug test. I did some research and there are these sites that claim to have the best drug passing kit ([This one caught my attention](http://www.testclear.com/Powdered-Urine-Kit-P13C5.aspx)), but then I keep reading in other places that they can all be detected.



* Is there any way to flush out myself in 2 weeks? It might be 3 weeks before I get tested but I'd like to clear myself out ASAP or find a sure way of passing for peace of mind.





I'd appreciate some insight into my problem and in case you're wondering, I don't regret smoking. I feel refreshed today and ready to study. But I intend to stop from now on."

I will be moving to Indianapolis from Connecticut in mid-May to begin a new job and to return to school part-time at IUPUI. I already have a list of around 30 places I've found, of which 10 I've contacted. I'm reaching out to you guys for some recommendations on places to look at and not to look at. Obviously my search is a risky one since I won't be able to see the apartment in person before I move in. 

Here is some criteria I'm trying to match: 

* 1 bedroom for ~$500 a month, though I'm willing to pays as much as $575. Apartment should have kitchen appliances (though I'm finding this is the norm).
* A 15-20 minute drive (no more than 25-30) from downtown, where I'll be working at and going to school.
* I'd like to stay on the west or north side within the 465 loop, though I'm not opposed to the south. I actually lived in Indy from last August to December for an internship and lived by the Speedway, and really liked that area. 
*  I'd like to stay away from the sketchy/unsafe parts of town. From what I gather, the northeast part of town is the sketchiest, but someone please correct me if I'm wrong. 

I've been using apartmentratings.com to read reviews, but some more feedback would be great! Also, if you have recommendations on other apartment search engines to use, that would be cool. Thanks so much!

I can see that the obvious professional choice would be GT honors, but I'm a bit disillusioned with GT because I lived in GA for several years and know too many people that go there. But I fell in love with California.

From what I gather, the pros and cons would be like this:

UCLA:
+ California
+ Well-balanced
+ School spirit (I want to take pride in my alma mater) 
+ National/international prestige (I'm planning on working internationally post-graduation)
+ Will learn to fend for myself because I have to fight for good positions and good grades (But this may go for GT as well?)
- Too big (I don't mind the sheer number so much as class registration nightmares and competition for research opportunities and internships)
- Decent but definitely not as good as GT for engineering
- No 4+1 BS/MS program

GT:
+ Honors (small classes, priority registration, Challenge Fund)
+ Bomb ass engineering school (facilities, opportunities, study abroad programs for engineers, internships, job placement, etc.)
+ 5yr BS/MS program
- Social life -- or lack thereof (I feel like this could hinder my personal growth during the peak of my youth?)
- Honors may hand me things on a platter? (I feel like I'm way overestimating the impact of getting honors though)
- Not much prestige outside of engineering (I might want to go into social sciences)

1d079r,6,2013-04-24,Longshot: Any site developers around here feel like donating a bit of their time to a good cause?,[deleted],capetown,https://www.reddit.com/r/capetown/comments/1d079r/longshot_any_site_developers_around_here_feel/,"Hi Capetown,

We are a small company (it's actually just me...) that is trying to provide logistics services to smallhold farmers in developing countries using SMS and web technology. You can see more about what we do [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Africa/comments/1blbc6/good_evening_africa_weve_developed_a_new_site_to/). We really believe that a few basic tools could help drastically change the economic situation of farmers in developing and transitioning countries (matchmaking services, price info, communication tools, etc).

We've got a lot of great feedback from people now that we're not so scared to show off our system. To put it succinctly, our idea feels validated, but our execution is weak. And now to put it bluntly - we have a list of problems to address and are a bit too cashstrapped to move this forward as we need.

So if you're a programmer and could donate a bit of time to a side project I could offer the following:

1) Free beer or drink or your choice to meet with me and plead my case in person to have you help move us forward.

2) The opportunity to join a serious project that could have a tangible impact on the wallets of those that could really use some cashflow (I'm referring to smallhold farmers, not myself).

3) Vague promises of payments for when cash does come in (First charge on income or financing if you can't feel comfortable working on this without the possibility of payment, or whatever you would be open to negotiating - I completely understand).

4) An opportunity to learn a lot about what goes on in a sector you might not be familiar with but you would be able to add to your portfolio later on. This sector (ITC4D) is becoming increasingly important in the world and I don't doubt it will open some doors for you later on in life.

So if you think this would be something you could donate a few hours to, please let me know. I know programmers and webdesigners already do so much pro-bono or free internships to get to a decent paycheck in life so it comes off a bit pandering asking such a thing, but all I can say is that it's a project you would feel good about working on, and at a bare minimum if you're willing to consider it, I'll grab you a beer to meet with me and discuss it further.

Sorry - I'll be off for a few hours and won't be checking this again until later tonight in case I'm late in replying to you.

Thanks,
Anthony

1d01nx,0,2013-04-24,I was molested by my teacher. (I apologize for the length in advance.),[deleted],LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/1d01nx/i_was_molested_by_my_teacher_i_apologize_for_the/,"(I am a female, and I was 20 when this happened. At the time, I had never been drunk, had never smoked, or gotten high. I also had and still have emetophobia, an irrational fear of vomit.) I am an art student, and I go to a private institution, across the country from where I was born. I have no family and few friends here, so I get homesick from time to time.

The teacher-student dynamic at my school is very different from academic schools, and even some other art schools. The way the classes are structured makes it so that teachers and students develop close, but still professional, relationships:
1. The class sizes are relatively small, about 15-17 students
2. Classes, whether studio or lecture, are 3 hours long (some classes are 5-6 hours long)
3. We talk about ourselves and our work in group and individual meetings, so we ALL learn about each other

There is one particular teacher at my school, who is very popular. He has a very good reputation, and has a very likable personality. I admired him immediately when I first met him 3 years ago. I later learned that it was not unusual for him to invite students (both male and female, although it was usually males) to his studio. He would have jam sessions and drawing sessions, and although he was kind to all of his students, he only invited a select few.

The next year (last year), I took my most important class with him. We had many one-on-one talks about my work, and about my professional future. Over the course of the year, I began to think of him as a father figure since I was away from home and family, he always gave me support and guidance when I needed it. He also had a daughter my age, the same year and in the same school I was. Towards the end of the year, we became Facebook friends (as he was with most of his students,) and had short Facebook chats regularly, none of them personal. The school year ended and summer vacation started. I usually flew back home for vacations, but I found an internship, so I stayed where I was. 

He invited me over to see his book collection, which I had seen photos of on Facebook. I was elated that I was one of the few people he had deemed worthy to spend time outside of class with. After a bit of persuasion on his part, I agreed. I met him at his studio late in the evening, around 8 or 9 PM. It started innocently enough, with a beer for each of us, and a review of the school year. (As innocent as supplying alcohol to a minor can be, anyway.) One beer turned into two, and then beer turned into shots of whiskey. I said no to the whiskey. He wouldn't take no for an answer.

I took the shot. He offered me a cigarette. I said no. I never saw the appeal, although many of my friends do it. I have no problem with it, but I had no interest in smoking. He put the cigarette in my hand and told me to inhale while he lit. My resistance caused him to have to light the cigarette more than once, but it eventually lit. He never took ""no"" as ""no,"" just that I needed more pushing.

Another shot. More talking. Another shot. More talking. Another shot. Then he brought the weed out. Again, I said no. He shoved the pipe in my mouth. Drowsy and dizzy, I still said no. Didn't matter. Put the pipe in my mouth again and lit it. Another shot. Another hit. Four more shots, with one hit between each one. From the first beer to the 9th shot, only 2 or 3 hours had passed. I felt okay until the 8th shot. The 9th one did me in. I felt sick, and because of my phobia, I felt afraid. I got out of my chair and collapsed on his couch. The room wouldn't stop shifting. I thought to myself that I would NOT be sick, not here, not now, not ever. I thought if I told myself mentally enough times that it wouldn't happen. I just had to concentrate.

He asked me if I was going to be sick. I said no, and that my emetophobia has prevented me from vomiting since I was 5. He asked if I was going to be sick again. Yes. I was. He led me to the restroom. I barely coughed up anything, too afraid. He asked me if I was okay. I managed to kick him out of the restroom. He left. I checked my phone. It was well after midnight, almost one in the morning. I threw up silently over the course of two hours. Traumatized. He eventually came back to fetch me. I was exhausted.

He helped me off of the floor, I collapsed on the same couch, since it was the first thing I could lay down on. It only seated one, so I lay in the seat with my head on one of the armrests, my legs over the other. He told me that I looked uncomfortable, and that I was free to use his bed. Like I did all evening, I said no. He tugged at my arm and told me his bed would be more relaxing for me. I yanked my arm away from him and told him to leave me alone. He pulled me up forcefully, all 125 pounds of me, and threw me towards his bed. 

I collapsed again, this time on the outside edge of his bed. Even though there was nothing left in my stomach, it hurt very badly, and I still felt quite nauseous. I rolled over on the side and held my stomach in the fetal position. He pushed me to the inside edge of his bed, against the wall and bookshelves. He climbed into bed next to me. He asked me if I was alright. I told him I was not, that my stomach hurt.

And then he touched me. He started rubbing my stomach. 

""What the hell are you doing?!""

""It'll make you feel better, I promise.""

""NO, DON'T TOUCH ME.""

I threw his hand off of my body. Silence. He reached over and started rubbing my stomach, this time his hand was lower than his first attempt, but just barely. 

""I'm serious. You better stop.""

Again, I threw his hand off of me. Silence. My labored breathing. My spinning brain. He reached for me again, below my jeans, my pubic area. 

""I swear to God, you better stop.""

""But why? It feels so cute down there.""

""You're sick! Don't touch me! You have a daughter my age! You're old enough to be my father!""

""But, I'm not your father.""

""That doesn't make it okay! I'm telling you to stop! PLEASE.""

He touched me again, this time going for my breasts. I moved his hands yet again, telling him to stop. He wouldn't. His hands roamed my upper body, I kept moving his hands off of me.

I focused on clearing my head, to get the room to stop rolling around me, to sit up straight. It was around 4:00 AM that I was able to sit up without falling over. By 4:15, I was able to stand. I put on my shoes, and I left. I walked all the way back to my place, crying. 

It's been almost one year since this happened, and after lurking here for a very long time, I decided it was time to talk about what happened. I realize my situation is not that heavy, in that nothing serious happened, but I am sheltered, and I trusted him. I looked up to him. I am in no way over it, but I have been trying, and I thought posting it here would be a good start.

I'm sorry for the long (and slow/boring) read. If you managed to read all the way through, I really, truly thank you. It took a very long time of debating with myself whether or not to post my story.

1d00bl,2,2013-04-24,I feel like I have Borderline Personality Disorder.. (venting),thatonegirlt,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1d00bl/i_feel_like_i_have_borderline_personality/,"Firstly, I see the rules on the subreddit. I'm not asking for a diagnosis, that was just my thoughts and what I felt like naming this.

Secondly, I haven't done anything like this before. I typically write on a little private blog that I vent on, but I don't know, I just thought I would give this a try and see what comes of it.

Thirdly, for context I am a 4th year college student.

So anyway... back to the point at hand. I don't know where to start. I feel like I have been ""out-logic-ing"" my sadness for a while now. I mentally decide that I am fine, that this will pass, and that these emotions are not serious. I have a friend with bipolar disorder, and I used to talk with her about it. She would explain to me how she sometimes could tell when she was sad because of something truly saddening, or when her brain chemistry was causing irrational sadness. Basically, I feel like a lot of the time I pretty much have my brain stfu, go about my day, and get over things.

But I haven't been able to do that. In fact, I don't think that ever even worked. I have random break downs, like right now, where I just need to be completely unproductive, cry for a while, and listen to music. Or harm myself in some way or the other. Which is odd, because I don't cut or things like that, no, I'm much more likely to bash my head against a wall, punch some concrete, or bite a hole in my tongue. Yes, I know that it's bad. That's more of a built up anger though I suppose, rather than sadness. I don't try to do it, it just happens, not really a conscious choice. Yeah, I'm just all over the place with this post.

Anyway again.. so right now I have a shit ton of work to do. Like seriously, I need to be awake in basically 4 hours, I have homework that's due tomorrow but instead I'm sitting here typing this ridiculously long post that no one will care about,  I'm sure. I don't know, I just feel like my life is going no where. I just was offered a summer internship, I'm a computer engineering major, I have a few solid friends, supportive parents... but I feel like I'm going no where. I feel like I am going to fail it all. I haven't taken proper notes this entire semester. I know how important my classes are but I can't bring myself to really care, until I'm (mentally) beating myself up for being such a terrible student and having to try/stress so hard to cram before tests. I'm financially responsible, saving a good portion of money here and there, but then I go and spend like $300 on Kickstarter in an hour.. I just feel like I look at myself from an outside view and just have no idea wtf is my problem. 

I have a loving boyfriend of almost two years, who I really don't know how my emotions are on that. I know the relationship isn't going anywhere, but eh. Dunno. Sometimes we are great, sometimes it's terrible. I just think I am too apathetic to try anymore. In anything. But then I get pissed at myself and by then it's too late. I am digging myself deeper and deeper into this self-hatred hole. I am having this breakdowns more frequently. I used to have a few a year, then one a few months, now I feel like I'm closer to having one at least once a month. I just don't know. I guess that it doesn't help that I have my issues all over the place.  I don't know what else to say."

I was living in Prague for a little over a year, where I met lots of friends, dated a tall beautiful German woman, drank lots of delicious beer, became a regular at a local bar, cut up, talked trash and watched hokej with locals in said bar, traveled the Czech Republic, developed a disregard for Sparta sports, flirted with beautiful Czech women at Letna, scored excellent grades in my two semesters there, and a multitude of other experiences...

I'm compiling my application to send to University of Belgrade for masters study. I have an affinity for this place and I have never even been. With certainty, and contingent on acceptance, I should be there for the next Summer semester.

I have minimal attachments. My vehicle will be sold and my auto insurance dropped. A little bit of student loans but those will be in deferment. No lady friends, etc. etc.

I'm curious how can I make some small monies? just enough to pay the rent each month in whatever modest hole I can find to reside in. I live the Bohemian lifestyle by default, although I make good money currently, adding a MA to my repertoire is optimal and would help me advance my career interests. I am 23 years old. I finish my B.S. in Global Politics in August.

I have work experience, an internship, and one year of experience abroad under my belt. I understand this is a broad question, but some human feedback would be great instead of reading tourist trap sites and youtube videos."

I'm currently doing an internship for a branding agency, and one of my tasks was to create a user database with custom information whenever someone registers. 

So as you know, a stock wordpress install only asks a user for the basic info like name, email, etc.

I'm using a plugin called Profile Builder Pro, which allows you to add custom fields for users. So now with this plugin, whenever a user registers, it asks them for the basic info along with their address, business name, account number, etc.

Now my main goal for this is to have a custom order form where the some of the fields already have the user's information entered already as default. For example, once they enter their address when they register, whenever they go to the order form, its automatically entered already. 

Ok so here is my problem. 

Contact Form 7 allows you do enter default field information from the user's account, but right now it's only working with their name and email. The custom fields that were created with Profile Builder Pro have custom ""meta keys"" that i assigned for them. For some reason i just can get those custom fields to show up in the form's default values. 

One custom field for example: Account Number (the meta key is acct-num). 

If anyone can help me out with this it would be awesome! I could PayPal you some mula!

I need to decide very soon if I am going to do this Creative Circus program or take an offer for an editorial internship. The Circus program would help me decide for certain if I want to work in a creative career and the specific track I would want to take if I did. It seems like a fun chance to learn a lot, network, meet cool people and potentially bolster my resume. It also might be enough to get me a good internship without having to go to a 2-year ad school. What do you think of this opportunity? I know it has a good reputation, but would everyone working in advertising recognize The Creative Circus, and would it put me ahead for an internship if you were hiring interns and saw this summer program/workshop on my resume?


My other option is to do an editorial internship at a publication that's pretty cool and legit, in a city I love with my boyfriend and my friends. If I don't work in advertising I'll want to do something with editing, although I feel like I'll eventually end up wanting to work on the copywriting side of advertising. At the moment, I'm not sure if getting an internship is more or less valuable than taking advertising-specific courses at a school that's only well known within a niche community. An editorial internship still wouldn't look bad for employers in the ad industry, but if I do decide I want to work an editing job, I might feel like I'm behind without an internship this summer.  Would the creative circus workshop help me for anything other than advertising? Or maybe it's such a good opportunity regardless that I shouldn't pass it up?

I am about to be 19 on the 5th of May. I do not have a job despite me applying for many jobs, and I am still in high school. I used to go to a charter high school. I decided to leave because in the program there is a thing called Walkabout at Senior year in which students go do 2 internships for 8 weeks each or one big Walkabout. Now I didn't have enough credits to do it so I ended up being stuck as a second year junior which I did not like. So I enrolled in an online school hoping to achieve graduation with 2 semesters worth of classes but it hasn't worked out. The school year is almost up... I would get my GED but I am not sure it is the right decision.. I also don't have the 40 dollars to do it.. I know I could pass easily, but I don't have the money. 


And on the side I got held back in Kindergarten for issues with anger, that's why I'm 19 and in high school.
Any help is nice, thank you. "

I think this could be facilitated if I was able to get a job with a tech company that is based in or has offices in the country/city where I want to be. From what I understand, having a job will make it easier to gain a visa to that country (through a work permit or similar).

In particular, I'm looking for tech companies that would (obviously) hire ECE grads. I will have an internship with the NSA by graduation and have a decent GPA (3.6 at the moment, I expect a 3.7 in a year), so I think I have decent odds of employment. I would like to do something in semiconductors or communications, but I'm pretty flexible at this point, not having really settled into any niche yet.

As far geography, the countries I'm looking at are Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland, Estonia, or further south like Germany or France. Pretty huge range, I think, I just need ideas of specific companies to pursue. Also, any thoughts on whether or not this is a bad idea or not would be cool. Thanks!

P.S.: Only company I could think of is Nokia, but the outlook there doesn't seem too great!"

Advice on boundaries?,thr0wx,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1cz7qh/my_f19_boyfriend_m22_and_his_ex_f21_are/,"I [F20] have been dating my [M22] boyfriend for about five months now. He dated his previous girlfriend for two years and she was his first everything. Because they lived on the same dorm floor both years and had the same major, classes and friends, they basically lived and worked together their entire first half of college. They started talking again a couple weeks ago when they helped each other on homework for their extremely difficult senior capstone class. After that they started scheduling study dates for their upcoming test.

That's a lot of memories and good reason to be friends, but I can't help but feel insecure. We're long distance this quarter because I took an internship 2 hours away. Their relationship ended and scarred him because she cheated on him repeatedly toward the end with her current bf, and I know she's helped another guy cheat. I don't think they would physically cheat (I'm independently somewhat friends with her), but I'm concerned he might accidentally emotionally cheat. Over the weekend I looked over his shoulder while he was texting her and read texts telling her about how he was so stressed from their upcoming midterm and a fight with his parents that he broke down in the library. He never told me about a fight and it hurt me to read her messages calming him down, but I didn't say anything because I didn't want to stress him more before his midterm.

I really like him but this is my first serious relationship and I want don't want to be overly demanding. Is it appropriate, after his tests, to explain why those texts hurt me and to ask to read the rest of his other texts to her? To ask that he not study with her at her place or at his? To text me when they are together? What would your boundaries be? For people with SOs who are friends with ex-es, how do you deal with insecurity?

**tl;dr** long distance bf and his super serious ex are resuming their friendship. What are reasonable boundaries and how can I stop feeling insecure/needy?"

So I found myself in a very fortunate/unfortunate situation. I was lucky enough to land an interview at an A-list agency. The unfortunate part is that it was in the analytics department despite initially applying to their strategy internship. I have a very ""humble"" understanding of data and analytic tools. I use them on a regular basis but I am no expert nor can I truly carry a conversation in such a technical field.

She had me take my things from her house and leave, but said that she is still in love with me. Is there anything I can do to get a second chance? Should I seek counseling or psychiatric help?

Any advice or perspective you could give me would be helpful.",[deleted],finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1d4a4c/help_me_rfinance_i_need_career_advice_any_advice/,"Hi /r/Finance, I'm in a bit of a quandary and I was hoping I could poll the audience for some career advice.  I know that there is /r/financialcareers, but it moves very slowly.  I thought I would get more responses here.

Basically, I spent my entire early career chasing a job in the public sector, and when I finally got it, I found that I hated it.  The work is boring and completely unsatisfying, with absolutely no challenge.  I spend most days bored to tears, even when I'm busy.  I've decided that I want out of this career path and into the private sector.

Because of my background, I'm not sure if a career switch like this is possible or if I would need to take some classes/go back to school.  Basically, I have a Master's degree in an area studies field (think part Political Science, part language and history) from University of Chicago and an undergrad political science background from a top 20 school.

I'm interested in finance because I see it as a challenge, somewhere that a person who is motivated and smart can do well and be recognized for doing well.  I've had far too many experiences working in the public sector where I felt like I did good work and was either chastised or ignored.  Meanwhile, I read stories about people in Finance being given massive bonuses at the end of the year and think to myself “why am I not doing that?”

My skillset is similar to a data analyst.  I spend a lot of time in Business Objects pulling reports and data and then analyzing them in Excel for trends.  I generate a lot of statistics for my agency and do quality assurance work on reports that contractors put into the system.  I really like using data to prove my point.  My quant skills are not exceedingly strong, but I understand a lot more than I can replicate.  I feel like I'm a very strong researcher.

I dug through Chicago's alumni directory and emailed about two dozen alumni listed as working in finance this same question, and I only got two responses.  One said it was definitely possible to work my way into finance with my background, provided I could prove I had strong math skills.  The other said no, it probably wasn't possible without an MBA.

I'd appreciate any advice people could offer.  I don't know if this is worth pursuing by applying for internships or if I should study up.  It's a big shift in my entire perception of myself and my life, so it's hard for me to judge my value."

We could do it with less!"". While other directors are fighting tooth and nail for funding, my director is telling people that ""we couldn't possibly lose any more people in technology but we are willing to do what we can to help out the school district, even if we don't get more funding or our funding is cut"". My section of the department being underfunded unfortunately affects the entire school district as we (3 staff members) run all 14 information systems (1100 employees and 14000 students). We handle every thing software related that isn't a desktop.

So hes retiring and we are trying to find a replacement for him. My boss puts off the process of putting up a job description on the website till about 2 weeks ago. I knew that my boss has such ill will towards the old man that he wanted to put off the hiring process as long as possible so he could tell he applicant who was hired that they didn't start till the fiscal year (2 1/2 months away) and the new hire will never meet the retiring employee. My boss believes that the retiring employee will taint the new employee as the retiring employee is a cancer to the department.

So I am on the hiring committee of 6 people (you interview all at once) and I'm pretty much known to be the technical genius of the group which many people hate me for it. We have 5 interviews.

First guy (who eventually gets the job) that interviews has the BEST resume. Per his resume has my qualifications and better. I'm excited, I think he has knocked it out of the ballpark and he hasn't stepped up to the plate yet.

First guys interview goes horribly. He doesn't go into specifics when asked about languages and systems hes worked on. He doesn't have project management skills and prior to the interview, the HR director there says ,""I think he is brother of the owner of the company of the XXXX program we used to use"". His brother had a company and sold it, yet this guy continued to work there for a number of years. When we ask specifics he says things like ,""I worked right next to the guy who did that and assisted him"". He never spoke about taking the lead on anything, being manager of anything or being responsible for anything.

On a side note, which I didn't know at the time I could say; He had a language barrier which was the elephant in the room that everyone was addressing in the most PC manner after the interview was over and had left. I told everyone I was severely disappointed with his technical qualifications.

3 more interviews after that and they were all terrible. All people with no technical background wanting to break into IT.... by jumping immediately into a management position. Obviously, if you have passion but don't have that go to attitude to seek out education or internship or even invest personal time into technology... YOU TOO CAN HAVE A CHANCE IN TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT!!!!

Last guy was a math teacher and he sold himself **epically**. When asked if he ""trained"" anyone he chuckled and said ,""Seriously?"" and we all laughed. Everyone loved him despite his lack of technical expertise. Its the end of the day and I say ,""I wish (math teacher) had more technical expertise but the (first guy) gave no specifics for me to verify his technical expertise. The candidates are horrible and I think we should repost on an actual job posting website."" 

Keep in mind, this job was never posted on a job website, it was only posted on the school district listings of jobs. As an outside applicant, unless you KNEW about that job being posted you would never see it. My hiring manager years ago reposted the job on a well known site with a link to the school job opportunities website. Imagine trying to start a software development company by posting jobs on your refrigerator at home, how many outside applications with the actual experience and skills to do the job are going to see that job posting.

**CORRUPTION! TAX PAYER MONEY BEING ABUSED! CORRUPTION!**

My boss and most of the committee have a fucking shit fit when I say this. Since this person will work closely with me and be trained by me, some of them accuse me of **""wont play along unless you get who you want""**. 

*On a side note, I've been packing my bags for a while. In fact, I want the best candidate cause if I and the other guy leave... the third guy wont be able to pick up the pieces.*

I tell them that this is a democratic process and they can chose who they want but I'm not giving either one my stamp of approval even though I was leaning toward the math teacher. Truth is, they don't need my stamp of approval. They just wanted it in writing that I agreed. Finally since no one can decide my boss says ,""I'm hiring [first guy], end of story"". I said ,""Thats fine."" and the meeting was ajurned. 

A friend and higher up on the committee tracks me down my office a few minutes later and says I immediately blast her for not defending me and she **even** led the argument that I wasn't going to play nice unless I ""got my way"". She immediately apologizes and asks me why I was so stubborn on this guy. I explain to her that I was saying his experience was bullshit based on that single interview. He claimed to have years of experience, a CIS degree and could do all this stuff but he couldn't give ANY details on what he did and most of it he said he worked on in ""groups"" and ""assisted"". He sounds like the retarded brother of a smart guy who had a company. Lastly, I disclosed to her that his language barrier could be a problem if he doesn't have the technical aptitude to back himself up. Currently, the old man supports the position by simply communicating the needs of his users to the vendors of his application. If he doesn't have a technical background or lied about it, he wont have the communication skills that the current employee has to do the job.

She says ,""I'm changing my vote and we need to stop [My boss] from offering the position and ask for a second interview"". Now my boss has left for the day and the rest of the committee is there for the most part there. They are indifferent, they don't care as they really wont work with this person. My friend says she'll make the call to my boss to make sure he doesn't offer [First guy] as soon as he gets in. I tell her that I don't want him thinking I have her doing my bidding and that I will call my boss myself. I call my boss and say ,""We would like a second interview"". My boss loses it and says ,""I'm sick and tired of this shit from you, always trying to make a scene. You just want who YOU want. I'm not talking about this with you right now"". My boss is usually a pretty chipper guy, hes a ""yes man"" and hes such a ""yes man"" to where we lose our budget and end up working late and/or weekends.

I go home and have a normal night with my wife and child.

6:30 AM. 2 hours prior to my shift at 8:30am I recieve a phone call from my boss on my cell phone waking my wife, baby and I.

**My Boss:** ""I couldn't wait for you to get your ass into work. I'm so fn disappointed in your behavior. How dare you pull this shit! Who do you think you are? Only I'm allow to decide on ""if we reconvene"".""

**Me:** ""Woah woah, what are you talking about. [Director Friend] said she wanted to change her vote and the other guys were indifferent but she said she wanted me to get a second interview with this person.""

**My Boss:** ""OH so you are throwing her under the bus now are you? How fucking pathetic, you have no ethics!""

**Me:** ""You can ask her and she'll tell you the same thing and HOW FUCKING DARE you call me at home for a non-related emergency to talk to me this way. I'm getting dressed and coming in now and we WILL talk about this""

I'm furious. I can't believe this bullshit. I go in and hes in a room with the one of the other managers and I knock on the door. I'm pissed. I'm told to ""go away"".

I wait. When he gets out and we go to his office. 

At this point, I'm basically wanting to calm him down and I say ,""I wasn't trying to thwart your process but you can't make me sign off on something I don't agree with. If you choose [first guy], I will work with him just like I worked with [old man] and I will do my best. However, I can't sign off on him without confirmation. I will not have some one later say that I chose him if he lied about his resume""

**My boss:** ""People don't lie about this stuff on their resumes""

**Me:** ""Are you shitting me? really? People lie on their resumes all the time, the worst part about the people that lie on their resumes is they are the unskilled, inexperienced and unethical employees""

**My boss:** ""He has letters of reference stating hes great to work with a hard worker""

**Me:** ""... and none of them have specifics on the projects he worked on or state he has any of the skills outlined in the job description.""

**My boss** ""I've built this department.""

**Me:** ""You were hired after the other 2 managers were hired. [Old man] was hired by the same guy that hired the managers and I was hired by another department until I was moved over to you.""

**My boss** ""I don't know what to think..."" with the most depressed look on his face.

I swing my friends office who is a director and was on the committee and say ,""You need to contact him and let him know exactly what happened because he still thinks I tried to thwart him"".

She said she would and called me back later saying she was taking the matter up with higher ups because he apparently blasted her, called me a lier and said she was covering for her.

At this point, I was furious.

My recruiter calls me,""So that company that you interviewed with doesn't want a second interview...""

**ME: FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK**

""... they just want to make you an offer.""

**ME: FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK YEAH!!!!**

Incredible timing. Fuck work, I just walked around the office telling my bosses boss and bosses bosses boss what happened and my decision. They couldn't blame me.

This by the way isn't the first time shit has happened before.

Do I work for a maniac? I think I do, I work in the public sector and I just don't know how people get away with this shit. 

**TL;DR Too long? Don't read.**"

1d3y4g,3,2013-04-25,Urgently Need for Internship Decision,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1d3y4g/urgently_need_for_internship_decision/,"First, a little background info: I'm currently a junior at an R1 university getting a double degree in Math and CS. I didn't decide to pursue the CS major until last school year; moreover I didn't decide I wanted to go into software dev until the end of last semester. Hence I'm 8 months late to the summer internship search. I have a good GPA and I'm a math TA; previously I was a research assistant which included a bit of programming experience. As it's currently slated I should graduate next year, but I haven't had industry experience.

Yesterday I was offered a software dev internship position for the summer at a large financial* company (*they do own several tech startups however). Here's the catch: not expecting to find a position so late, I planned to take classes over the summer. If I take the position there is no way I can also take classes. If I don't take them this summer my schedule for next year will be hell to the point that it might not even be possible. Furthermore, they're only offering $11/hr full time (the recruiter made it sound like they pay every intern the same amount). I've applied to a number of local intern positions that would allow me to take classes very recently but have yet to hear anything let alone interview.

Here are my options as I see them:
1. Take the internship. Struggle through my senior year and graduate on time with some experience.
2. Take the internship. Drop some classes, take them in Fall 2014 and graduate a semester late. This would mean paying rent in a college town for a few extra months and skipped income.
3. Decline the offer. Gamble on landing a local internship or otherwise work a normal job. Take classes this summer and graduate as planned. 

What is my best option? Theoretically, if I don't get another internship, how much more difficult would it be to land a good job out of college? Is interning after graduation a worthwhile possibility? "

I'm looking at having several internship in D.C. this summer and was wondering what is generally worn in that area. 

Yes, I did read the summer guide in the sidebar. However, I often-times have to discount some of the advice given my extreme weather circumstances making my ""spring/fall"" most people's summer.

Today they are playing an 'episode' of Stern Show Shuffle that was on very recently. Sal and Richard shitting their pants, John and Jackie the intern, Norm and Artie, Darryl Hammond... this is the exact same thing they played just a few weeks ago.

So not only are they not doing a real shuffle they are actually repeating episodes they recently played. Even worse is sometimes it seems like they repeat the same few hours of shuffle throughout the day so even though you are listening to Stern Show Shuffle you're hearing the same thing you heard 12 hours ago.

I would be willing to pay my monthly subscription for Stern Show Shuffle alone, but only if it was an actual shuffle."

1d3odh,2,2013-04-25,Young White Male | Overprivileged Failure,wokeupwithaplan,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1d3odh/young_white_male_overprivileged_failure/,"I have been given every chance to succeed from a very young age. My parents have provided me with anything I've ever wanted or needed, yet I still can't seem to get off my feet. It is completely my fault. I need to change and I don't even know where to start. I have told this story in snippets to many people, picking what to tell them so that I looked like a victim. I would like to get the entire story off my chest, and admit that I am wasted potential, a coward, and a bully. Unfortunately this boils down to a very long, unedited rant. 

A little background, I quit High School at 15 in favor of staying home and playing video games for 18 hours a day. My parents supported my decision. I had mild success in a few games that led to a very small amount of recognition, which I allowed to get to my head. When I turned 18--after a very embarrassing incident with an online relationship--I realized that it was time to try to get out of the house and  get into a decent college. I went to community college for a year and finished my High School diploma there. This year is the only time in my life that I can say I performed particularly well. 

I applied to a few colleges far away from home and was accepted to all of them. I chose to attend the one that was willing to give me the biggest break on tuition. 

As soon as I got to college, the only thing that was on my mind was losing my virginity. I saw myself as being weak for being a virgin for some reason, and believed that I would be empowered if I could only convince people to have sex with me. I lost it within 2 weeks! Go team! Afterward I was completely obsessed with being in a relationship. Throughout college I found it very easy to begin relationships, but unable to hold on to them. I craved not only the attention of another person, but also their ability to legitimize or complete me. At no point did I understand how to be my own person. It was very easy for me to be the kind of person that I saw them being attracted to, allowing me to be off the hook of discovering myself. Each relationship lasted about one year each (and about 8 months longer than they should have). I held on to someone as tight as I could until they couldn't take it anymore. When it ended, I recreated myself, and moved on to the next person (usually within the span of a week). 

At the same time, my academic life was atrocious. I loved every one of my classes and felt the need to over-challenge myself. I took too many hours every semester, despite the urging of my counselor to do otherwise. Reaching my goals was not nearly as important to me as creating them. I took on tons of extra work outside of class, like journals, conferences, and other academic projects. I finished maybe a fourth of what I started. What I finished was either absolute shit, or mostly the work of others on my team. I burnt almost every bridge that I built with my work ethic, constantly making promises and deadlines that I couldn't keep (yet I still convinced people to trust me with new projects). College seemed to be a place that gave points based on perceived effort, and not a well-polished, finished product. I exploited this and graduated a semester early with a 3.6.

Directly after college I began searching for jobs in my field (as much as a humanities triple major can be called a field). The world was mine for the taking! I had a degree! After plenty of rejections, and months of unemployment (I was looking for a real job, I didn't want to be a server! And my parents were supporting me, so why not take that time to focus on the hunt!). Throughout this entire period I also had a loving girlfriend who emotionally supported me, truly believed in me and my success, and saw a future for us together (more on this later). 

After being rejected for a few career paths that I had always seen as my “calling,” I started to look at more feasible career paths, that I had recent experience in. During one summer, I had done some work tutoring/teaching underprivileged children, and I enjoyed it. I put a lot of effort into it, and I performed well with the small groups that I worked with. I entered a quick-start teaching certification program and was the happiest I have been for a long time...until that program actually started. This program was the first time I put a tremendous amount of time and effort into something and fully expected to still succeed. 

After the training period ended, I was launched into a school and I had no idea what I was doing. I was in the classroom for 4 hours, taught for 1 hour, then left for more training for another 4 hours, I went home and prepared lessons for another 3 hours. On weekends I gave myself 2-3 hours of free time, and spent the rest preparing material for my classes, practicing my lessons, and going over teaching techniques. Every class period was a disaster. I would sweat profusely, I would stutter over my words during the lesson, and I constantly felt like I was going to vomit or cry. Students took advantage of this and either did whatever they want, or push my nerves and fears as far as they could. Every technique that I had studied, practiced, and tested seemed to whirl past me while kids would throw out insults at me, get in fights, or be legitimately upset that we weren't using this time to learn. Everything seemed to move far too fast. The classroom was completely out of my control, and it was completely my fault. I was asked to leave after two and a half weeks. 

Takeaway 1: If you're in college, take every project seriously. Follow through on every promise, and be sure to do a good job. Learn how to manage your working time as efficiently as possible. Once you're in the real world no one cares how hard you worked. If you show up with a quality product, you're out.You exist to provide a service, otherwise you're useless. This may seem obvious to many, but it wasn't to me. 

Allow me to preface the next few sections with this: if you didn't think I was worthless before, allow me to prove that I am a complete scumbag. 

Throughout this period my girlfriend was completely supportive of every decision I made. She was excited that I was teaching, and understanding when it didn't work out. We had been together for almost a year at this point, and it had been a rocky one. When I graduated from college I had lost my libido, I blamed my new “less-exciting” sex life, and she blamed herself. She did everything she could to make me happy sexually, but it just wasn't working. I know now that it was my disappointment with myself, and general depression that would not allow me to perform sexually. At the time, I didn't blame her, but I didn't stop her from blaming herself. Together, we thought of ways to try to make our sex life more exciting. She would often compromise her comfort to try new things. Nothing worked, and I can only imagine the frustration she felt. This came to a head one day when I caught her masturbating in my living room. I yelled at her. I didn't care that she was masturbating in my living room, but for some reason I felt as though it was a direct insult to my manhood. At the time I felt like this was the equivalent of her telling me that I was good for absolutely nothing. I couldn't even succeed at basic biological interactions between a man and a woman. I belittled her, I cried, I said anything I could to try to embarrass her about what she had done. She went back home for the summer, but continued to love and support me. Retrospectively I've never felt worse about an action that I have taken “in the moment” in my life. 

This had all occurred before I began “teaching”, once I started working I became an insufferable ball of nerves who would lose control at his loved ones at the drop of a pin. At this point my relationship was long-distance, and once I was let go, our situation took a turn for the worse. I frustrated her to the point of tears almost every time we talked. She stopped responding to me as often, and I suggested that we take a break from talking, until she could be interested in me again. Two weeks later I met someone who seemed very interested in having me around, loved to talk to me, and was open to a sexual encounter. I called my girlfriend and broke up with her immediately. I gave her maybe five minutes on the phone. I then proceeded to have a fling with this other person. 

During this period I gained some sort of God complex. I snagged a shitty hourly job that could pay my bills, I had scored an internship at a dream job involving entry-level video game journalism (I was corresponding and writing news posts), and a bunch of people seemed willing to have casual sex with me. I felt completely on top of my shit! I even tried as hard as I could to assert a position of power over the women who were having sex with me. After all, this was my first time being outside of a committed relationship for more than a week. I boasted loudly about it at bars, to my friends, and even to any new people I met. Throughout my life I have enjoyed telling self-deprecating, and self-embarrassing stories. Now that I didn't care about the people who had sex with me, I could publicly humiliate them as well as myself. I got laughs and generally positive reactions from most of the people that I told these stories to. At no point did I consider it a problem. It was not long until this caught up with me. 

For a few months I acted like this until my ex-girlfriend came back to town. We started texting, talking, and hooking up again. I realized that I still loved her (I have since realized I may not have a proper concept of love, but instead I seem to practice entitled addiction to living human beings). She took me back, and we started to plan our future together again. Things were going great, we were finding things about each other that we never appreciated before. Our conversations was amazing, and the sex was better than anything I have had before. We seemed to finally be connecting on every level, and I had never been happier in my life. 

Remember, this is “future me” providing a retrospective. 

After an overly drunken night, I found out (by answering a text message for her) that she had been seeing someone else while we were apart. I completely lost it. I had disclosed every encounter that I had, and felt that she should have done the same. She had told me multiple times that nothing had happened while we were apart, and stuck to this story despite me finding “evidence” to the contrary. Disgusted with her, I tried to continue the relationship, but it wasn't the same as it been when we first rekindled. 

For some reason, it was at this point that I received some sort of clarity. I looked back at the way I had behaved in the last few months, the terrible way I treated those who loved me, and the way I had become a repulsive human being. I couldn't think of anything else. I got scared, and I ran. I gave two days notice at one job, told my dream job that I was having a family emergency and could no submit work for them, and told my girlfriend that I found a really great job back home and was going to pursue my future. I broke my lease, packed everything into my car and moved home. 

We broke up again later. Long distance is always hard. I blame my ex for absolutely nothing. She gave me chance after chance to prove that I could be mature, and all I did was take advantage of her kindness. I sincerely hope the next man that she is with is deserving of the title. 

Takeaway 2: Do not shit on the loved ones who consistently show that they believe in you. They are worth much more than you think they are. I don't know what else to say here. 

I've left out quite a few details—as to not identify anyone in particular—I'm sorry if this story is so long, and rough. Thank you for reading it, those of you who did. 

Fast forward to now:

I live with my parents. I spend most of my time playing video games, getting rejected from jobs, and hoping to one day create content again for a gaming website. I love to write, but the only things that have been coming out of me have been versions of this story (I realize that it boils down to a horribly written, self-pitying rant, but it's not at all indicative of what I enjoy writing). I have rewritten this story plenty of times and showed it to no one. Posting a full version of it will, hopefully, get it out of me forever, so I can move on with my life.

tl;dr 
1. I graduated college, yet developed no discernible skills because I focused on the wrong things.
2. I severely mistreat people who have nothing but love for me when I'm stressed. 
3. I want to change, but am not sure where to start."

AMA",tv_writers_assistant,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1d3mbu/i_am_a_television_writers_room_assistant_ive_seen/,"Hello Reddit! I am a writers' room assistant for a TV drama (now off the air so I'm between jobs) and am myself an aspiring television writer. I noticed there've been a number of AMAs from producer's assistants, but not many from writers' assistants, which is a very different job.

A primer: I take notes in the writers' room sessions, tone meetings, production meetings, and table reads. I keep track of every idea the writers have. I also do research and chime in when appropriate when we're ""breaking"" an episode (turning the concept into an outline). Working with the executive producer/showrunner, I've interfaced with and seen the work of pretty much every department on the show (on set, editing, sound mixing, etc.). So AMA.

I've worked on more than one show, so I have some perspective on how different shows do things (sometimes very) differently. I used to intern at film companies so I can compare/contrast there, too. 

**NOTE:** I'm saying this once up front. I will NOT tell you what shows I have worked on. DON'T bother asking. Plot details, etc., no way. The writers' room is closed off to even most people who work on a show. Top secret. Protecting secret info on the show is an important part of my job and I'm not going against that.  I can speak freely to the process, the job, and my experiences. 

I won't post proof of my work experience publicly, but the mods have it confirmed and should be posting that confirmation. 

Now that the boring stuff's out of the way, AMA that you've ever wanted to know about the writers' room, making a TV show, being an aspiring TV writer, this job, other TV jobs, the TV industry, etc.

He saw that I also had a graphic design degree and asked if I knew how to put together a book to be self published on Amazon. All it would be is assembling the book in InDesign and probably some photo touch ups. He offered me $300 and a special acknowledgement apart from the general acknowledgements. He said if that is not a fair price that we would talk, but I have no idea what ""fair"" is.

He said he got my name because I am a business major, and this was a ""marketing"" internship. The correspondence was pretty vague, although he did tell me that on average students make $8,000 over 12 weeks in the summer. He mentioned that there were informational meetings that I could attend on campus, so I told him I would try and drop in within the next few days.

After hanging up, I did a quick Google search for the company, Southwestern Advantage. It's a total fucking joke, somewhere along the lines of Vector Marketing, only you sell textbooks instead. Sure, you can make money I suppose, but you're forced to pedal reference books door to door, and are paid on commission. Thanks, but no thanks. Needless to say I did not attend any of the info sessions.

Anybody else have any experience with this sort of thing? It seems wrong to prey on college students like that. "

1d3j14,151,2013-04-25,The Hamburglar,[deleted],fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1d3j14/the_hamburglar/,"No, this is not about a girl who steals hamburgers.  We call her this because a friend of ours slept with her and she smells like them.  Here are a couple stories, the first being showing the fat logic.  The first is told from my perspective while the other is from my friend's.  This is REALLY long so I'll put a TL;DR: Fat friend has fatlogic about about being a vegan, fucks up our friendships with her, smells like cheeseburgers, and sexually takes advantage of our guy friends when they're drunk, knowing they don't want to sleep with her fat, nasty ass.

&gt;be me

&gt;having my bff's birthday party at my and his gf's (my roommate) house

&gt;the hamburglar is invited because we're all friends at that time

&gt;she's not so much round but more a large box shape

&gt;wears clothes that make it worse 

&gt;skinny jeans with major muffin top

&gt;talks about how she's vegan all the time

&gt;""but I eat cheese occasionally""

&gt;bitchthataintvegan.wut

&gt;whatever, party be awesome

Side note: I worked at a yogurt shop at the time and one of our cakes got damaged so I got to take it home for the party.  Decorated that shit to fix the damaged part.

&gt;bring out cake

&gt;sing happy birthday

&gt;hamburglar eats a slice

&gt;huh.vegan.wut

&gt;whatever, probably just treats herself occassionally

&gt;people are kinda fucked up so a few stay the night

&gt;I go to bed

&gt;I wake up and the hamburglar is still there

&gt;go to the kitchen, I'm thinking cake for breakfast

&gt;Treat yo self

&gt;Cake is GONE 

&gt;she has woken up as well

&gt;""oh, me and your bff were super drunk and ate the rest^TeeHee

&gt;""I thought you were vegan""

&gt;""Oh, I am, I just love dairy sooooo much""

&gt;""....That's not vegan""

&gt;""I'm vegan most of the time""


You can skip this part if you'd like.  Eventually she does some FUCKED UP shit and destroys the friendship.  With me, she sleeps with my FWB (he tells the next story).  Obviously we're not in a relationship but she's in my sorority and knew for a fact that I was sleeping with him.  To me, that's a little messed up.  He didn't know we were in that organization and actually felt really bad.  Said he never would have done that had he known.  Then she really fucked up my roommate/really close friend, also in my sorority.  They have the same major and my friend was nominated for a scholarship.  She was REALLY excited because she didn't receive any scholarships because even though she had a 4.0 GPA and led a shit ton of organizations in high school, she didn't get a very good SAT score.  She would drive the hamburglar to her internship three times a week because she didn't have a car, tutored her in all of her classes, and was just insanely nice to her.  She was showing her the portfolio she was making, which was really awesome and thorough, and talking about how she needed this money really bad since she was essentially paying her tuition out of pocket.  The results for the scholarship came out.  The hamburglar got it.  She hadn't told my friend she had gotten nominated and she stole all of her ideas for her own portfolio.  I had never seen my friend cry before.  She had NEVER been stabbed in the back like this.

On to the next story, told in my former FWB's perspective

&gt;be me

&gt;just got out of a toxic open relationship

&gt;very depressed

&gt;pretty desperate for a ""repeat customer"" for sex

&gt;hamburglar has had the hots for me for awhile

&gt;kinda gross but she's nice enough and I'm desperate

&gt;start having sex

&gt;realize she's not very hygienic

&gt;she sweated A LOT during sex...as in it dripped on me constantly

&gt;smells like cheeseburgers

&gt;sex wasn't great but whatever

&gt;then one night

&gt;oh the humanity

&gt;she was drooling while on top of me

&gt;a loooong string of mucus-y drool

&gt;stretching longer and longer

&gt;oh no

&gt;shit! my mouth isn't closed

&gt;too late

&gt;it feel in my mouth

&gt;almost throw up

&gt;then she lies flat on top of me like a board

&gt;legs together

&gt;omg my dick

&gt;is she going to break it?!

&gt;hurts so bad

&gt;thank God, she finished

&gt;so terrible

&gt;so many rolls

&gt;I'm never eating a cheeseburger again

Finally, the name hamburglar got her name because my former FWB stopped sleeping with her.  Started ignoring her.  One night, he had a party and she showed up uninvited.  Around 3am he's super fucked up and decides to go to bed.  She follows him and steals his blanket.  He says ""Give that back.""  She says she will if he sleeps with her.  He says no.  A lot.  Doesn't matter.  She climbs on top of him.  He gives up and just says, defeated, ""Just do what you want.""  She does and leaves.  To me, this is sexual assault.  Takes advantage of him in his sleep.  Never reported it because...the cops probably wouldn't believe it.

Fucking fat bitch.  Again, sorry this is so long.  I've been wanting to get it out of my system for awhile."
1d3irc,2,2013-04-25,Calling HR?,noodle-arm,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1d3irc/calling_hr/,"I applied for a summer internship position just under two months ago (the deadline was March 1st).

Usually I would just write it off as a rejection, but I happen to know from previous applicants that they waited around 6-8 weeks for a response. I have sent a follow up email and a friend also sent up an email around a month ago asking for an update, but neither of us have had a response.

So I was thinking of calling up, it's more difficult to ignore me that way. But I'm slightly worried that if I catch them at a bad time, they might get irritated by me for pestering them and then I've got no chance.

1d3htj,66,2013-04-25,Pre-Summer College Student FAQ,Befriendswbob,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1d3htj/presummer_college_student_faq/,"A lot of the same questions have been coming up recently from college students (probably since summer is coming), here are some common answers!   
**1. I have an offer for employment at $X, should I drop out?**   
For 99% of you: **NO** absolutely not. Your degree will be more valuable in the long run, and if/when you decide to switch companies it will be invaluable. Exceptions to this would include if you have financial hardship staying in your program **and** the salary wouldn't allow you to live and pay for school. You **can** work a full-time job and go to school, tons of people do it.   
**2. I have an offer from company X and am still waiting to hear from company Y, what should I do?**   
If you like both companies, or you would prefer Y: Tell Y you have an offer on the table, that will speed them up. You probably don't want to give them details on the offer until you know what they are planning on giving you.   
**3. My offer is $X, but I want $Y, what should I do?**   
First do research on median salaries in your area, you can use sites like [glassdoor.com](http://www.glassdoor.com) or [payscale.com](http://www.payscale.com) to figure that out. If your offer is significantly less than what you're seeing, you can probably ask for more, *typically* it seems about 10% more is ok, more than that may be pushing it. Use your best judgement.   
**4. Tips for handling recruiters:**   
Try not to tell them what you are looking for in a salary or what your previous salary was, this will usually limit you (They will press on this! Be prepared.) Another option is to provide a salary floor, ex: I'm not taking any jobs that pay less than $X. They also shouldn't need any information besides your resume, and they may conduct a short interview with you, if they ask for more than that it is probably sketchy! Use common sense and go with your gut.    
**5. Should I do this unpaid internship?**   
Almost always: **NO**, if you are in the U.S. unpaid internships are illegal. On top of that it only shows that the company doesn't value you or your work at all. Exceptions would be: If you aren't providing the company any value and are solely getting experience (then it would be legal, but it is incredibly difficult to justify this type of work in the CS field), or perhaps if your school has some sort of arrangement with local industry and unpaid internships have been normalized in your area **and** you can't find a better way of getting experience and getting paid for it!   
**6. I didn't find a summer internship, what should I do?**   
Find other avenues to keep practicing and building your skills. Open source projects, personal projects, 'pro-bono' work for student groups on campus that need tech solutions. There are a number of ways to get programming experience and build your skills that don't involve getting a paycheck from an established company. Be proactive in finding them and working them to your full advantage. Internships are still important, so start early in contacting recruiters for semester internship opportunities instead. But your world is not over if you don't get a summer internship. You just have to work harder to get that great summer experience. (thanks /u/catiebug)   
Many colleges have something going on during the summer you can help with. For example, this summer (and last summer) I'm working with my university's scientific programmers to write some analytic programs for the business school. I have friends doing research opportunities as well. Just network in your department and you're sure to find someone looking for extra help that will look good on a resume. (thanks /u/SummerInJapan)   
**7. My offer expires soon and I haven't heard back about negotiations, what should I do?**   
This is a tough situation. I would email the Recruiter to make sure it is documented. You want to make it clear that you're planning on taking the job, but you feel you'd like to discuss the compensation. Present your evidence (hopefully you have examples of others with similar backgrounds and levels of experience that received more from a similar company). Choose your wording carefully so they know that you're still considering the offer, but want to discuss this point further before you sign. If the Recruiter is not responding to your inquiries, it would not be right for the company to hold you to their deadline. (thanks again /u/catiebug !)
   
Please add anything else or criticize my answers and I'll try to keep the main post updated with feedback/new stuff! Or if you are a college student and have questions, please ask them here and I'll keep it updated with feedback!

1d3ea1,0,2013-04-25,Is College a Scam?,StriveNGrind,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1d3ea1/is_college_a_scam/,"[Strive &amp; Grind](http://strivengrind.com)

Is college a scam? This is one of biggest controversial topics facing many Americans today. Many of us are taught at an early age to get good grades, go to college, and work towards getting a high paying job. For many of us that is all we know, and that’s what we’re doing. There are valid points to be made from both sides, pro-college and anti-college. Do you think one is better than the other?

Let’s start off with points to be made for people who actually believe college is a scam. First, tuition is steadily increasing every year causing parents and students to take out more student loans, which result in more debt. I don’t know about you, but it doesn’t make sense that tuition climbs along with the increasing rate of recent graduates without a job. Second, most students switch majors during their academic career, and some more than once. The switching of majors costs even more money because additional courses have to be taken for the new major. The courses taken in the previous major was a waste of money because the credits will not go toward the student’s degree. Third, students have the pleasure of being taught by some professors who can care less where they end up post-graduation. Unfortunately, these professors are there just to collect a paycheck. Majority of students who graduate don’t know what they want to do. They just know they want to get a job respective to their degree. Professors should be there to help guide students toward specific career paths. Fourth, the two semesters of pre-requisites are just a waste of time. Because students lack interest in pre-requisite courses, their effort and attention decreases, which in turn may result in a lower cumulative GPA.  Also, the pre-requisites that require a C grade means more money wasted for students who don’t meet the C or higher requirement because they have to take the course again. How fun? Lastly, how many people do you personally know that graduated college and became waiters, waitresses, administrative assistants, receptionists, janitors, or retail associates? Talk about a horrible return on investment. How could one possibly payback that $25,000 (national average) student loan debt in a reasonable time when they’re getting paid less than $25,000 per year.

Despite the downside of college, there are great benefits. First, going to college gives young adults the opportunity to experience life away from home, explore different career options, and meet new people. Second, the variety of different organizations and clubs gives students the chance to network, find their interests, and may help them down the road with employment opportunities. Third, students may pick up important skills needed for the workplace such as communication, analytic, leadership, teamwork, and problem solving.  Fourth, there are potential internship or co-op opportunities for students that will give them hands on experience and provide them with the insight of what to expect in the workplace in their respective field(s). Fifth, one of  the best advantages of earning a college degree is having better opportunities for employment over someone without one, and the potential for a higher salary. Lastly, majority of fortune 500 companies require their employees to have a college education, especially if they plan to work in a corporate setting. Many of those fortune 500 companies have leadership development programs which are designed to accelerate early career development for high potential graduates and prepare them for future leadership roles within their organizations.

If you plan on going to college, there are a few things to keep in mind. Don’t expect to automatically get a job in your field. Check out our article on tips to landing a job before graduation [here](http://strivengrind.com/8-tips-on-how-to-land-a-job-before-graduation/). Before choosing a major, research the market demand for recent graduates with the same major and their starting salaries. Also, learn everything you possibly can about your niche or field. If there are certifications or licenses you can obtain prior to graduating, do it.  However, if you don’t plan on going to or finishing college, it is not the end of the world. You can still be successful. If you’re thinking about pursuing the world of entrepreneurship, there are many big time millionaires and billionaires who made it without a degree. The list includes Henry Ford (Ford Motor), Andrew Carnegie (Carnegie Steel), Charles Culpeper (Coca-Cola), Ray Kroc (McDonald’s), Walt Disney (Disney), Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook), Lawrence Ellison (Oracle), Steve Jobs (Apple), and Michael Dell (Dell). These are just few out of the many many big names who were high school and college dropouts, and ended up running multi-million and multi-billion dollar companies! If college is for you, great. If it’s not, that’s great too. It’s your choice. People become successful with and without it every day.

It's been a dream of mine to work at an agency in an accounts or strategy position. I know it's super hard to break into, but through a personal reference I was able to score an unpaid internship at a huge reputable agency whose work environment I think I would be well suited to. They know I'm looking to eventually be employed by them but they obviously told me no guarantees.

On the other hand, I was offered a job with 40K pay with a big international brand. The opportunities for advancement are pretty clear and a friend currently working there loves it because it's fast-paced and it's very social. There's also a possibility of transfer to one of their offices in a more exciting international city, which would be amazing.

Ad people always tell me how difficult it is to break into agency-side, if I took the paying job out of $$ needs and security, do you think I'd still have a shot a couple years down the road at an agency like this? Or should I take my lucky break and do the internship? 

In other words, do you guys at agencies see a lot of people joining from client-side? I guess I'm just looking for some perspective.

Anyways I recently graduated with an ECE that was heavily oriented in Computer Engineering and anything to do with computers. I chose this degree because when it came down to it I asked an advisor which they thought would be better for me given my likes and what I was good at. The advisor was a bit off (who would have thought) but what can you do. Since graduation I have gotten a full time job that pays nicely and I work with great people who are SUPER passionate about what they do. The only problem with that is that I realized that I'm not passionate about this stuff. It took through 4 years of college to finally realize that i should have went with a CS degree because its the only thing where i can sit for HOURS on end and not even realize the amount of time i spend. I have always had a passion for games and I love what they can do for people. I have started to code small games on my own to get some experience and i took some CS classes (electives) while in school. I have read books and I spend my free time learning about game development.

So to the real part of this post. I know that it doesn't quite matter about degrees but I was more wondering about Internships in the gamedev field. Do development companies consider already graduated kids for internships? I feel like that would be a perfect opportunity for me to develop and show that I am competent and willing to do what it takes in the industry. I have applied for some and haven't received any replies yet and some internships say specifically that they must but enrolled in a degree."

Hi, there, I'm 23, and I have a bit of a background. The first time I asked a girl out I was 16 (she said yes!), and had an on/off 3 year relationship. After the breakup, it was almost 3 years until I ""dated"" again, with a couple of one night stands and a weird fwb deal on the side in between those times. The second relationship lasted maybe 6 weeks, and I was sorta used, sorta not sure about that one still. Seriously, no idea what happened there. (That's a lie).




I am still scared at how emotionally immature, needy, clingy, and downright annoying I can be. I know I've been an absolutely amazing boyfriend, the kind that sweeps you off your feed romantically, physically delivers in an above average way, and is super thoughtful. The kind that makes you happy.

However, I can get clingy. Not like, ""I MUST SEE YOU EVERY DAY,"" clingy. It's different. It's what I would call routine clingy. We start going out, and there's a developing routine. Last time it was compulsive texting by her that got me into the routine of texting every day. Then when it stopped, I didn't really know... what to do with myself. I mean I have a life, but I was used to... the texting. Does that make sense?

Anyhow, I digress. I'm single again, and I'm wondering...

**Important Part**

How do... I date? Relationship 1 was this fluke thing that went from one ""yes"" into the typical HS sweetheart yeah right kinda deal. Relationship 2 was... well... let's just say it was fucking weird. I made a bad decision turning a long term crush into a rebound for her because of the words ""I love you"" coming out of her mouth. Don't date ex roomies... especially if you know their bf really well. Lesson learned!

But yeah... how... do I date? I mean, I hate bars. I am just getting out of college, and though I could easily afford an apartment I live with the parents. 

?? My personality type doesn't even seem to exist... but I would love to expand and date anyone.

For instance the girl today, who was at the college thingy I was at. Super cute. Obviously smart (it was a honoring thingy for academic excellence through internship... you know what nevermind but we were both there).

I walked right up to her, and asked her all about her internship, and then of course I was like... yeah...

Then she was all ""You know I'm in your class right?""

I didn't. But still we talked for a good 20 minutes. I really wanted to ask her out but... I don't know how.

I really wish she would have at least dropped ""Yeah oh my boyfriend..."" if she had one. Chances are though, she didn't think I was flirting.

I will see her obviously in class. How do I go about asking her out?

**TL;DR:** 
*Can anyone give me some tips on how to get into the dating groove? I don't really seem to attract women.
*How do I ask out a classmate? Are there protocols for girls who have boyfriends (as in, do they tell you)? How do I find out?
*How do I go about searching for a personality type that seems to keep to themselves most of the time?


Thanks...?

Heres what I have so far

*House will be 400/mo for rent, not including anything else but this is covered by a housing stipend of $1300

Where do you all think I should put the money I am going to save? I dont think its unrealistic for me to walk away with more 50% of it saved in one form or another, and I would love to know yall's perspective on where I should put it. 

I already have a checking and savings account with Wells Fargo Ive had since my parents set it up when I was very young, but id like to grow up and find my own. Any suggestions?

I dont mean for this to come across as a humble brag I would really like yalls suggestions because other than saving it I dont know what to do!"

1d2hrn,3,2013-04-25,Is it bad to ask what you can study up on before you start an internship?,norski_lab,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1d2hrn/is_it_bad_to_ask_what_you_can_study_up_on_before/,"I accepted an offer for an internship at a very fast growing software development company and I could not be more excited about starting there. The only problem is that I am nervous as to what I will actually be doing and what a regular day will usually involve. 

I'll have a week off between then end of school and the start of the internship so I was wondering if it is bad practice to email them and ask them what I can study up on while I have that time off. But, I don't want to come across as if I don't need the time off(because I do) and I also don't know if they are going to have an ""orientation"" week where I would be paid to learn those things anyways..

So is it okay to ask what I can study up on so I can be crystal clear about what I am talking about when I start or should I just wait for my first week there and go with the flow?"
1d2h1d,0,2013-04-25,"Job offer dilemma, help me out",anonaero,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1d2h1d/job_offer_dilemma_help_me_out/,"Ok, r/engineering, I would like your advice. (Company names made up to protect identities)

Currently, I work for ""AeroDyne Inc"".  I really like the place - the atmosphere is reasonably relaxed, the team I'm working with is fairly small and tightly knit, and the stuff I'm working on is stuff that I am extremely passionate about.  It's the kind of place where I could settle in for several years and start a career.

But a few weeks back, a buddy of mine called me up and said the company he works at - ""West Coast Technology"" - was looking to hire a guy with my skillset.  Now, not to name names, but it's a household name, the kind of place that ANY engineer of ANY discipline would jump to work at, were they starting a project that needed your kind of expertise.  So, fuck it, updated and polished my resume and sent it in to the recruiter at WCT.  A week later, phone interview, week after that, they flew me out, and now I have a job offer from them sitting in my lap.  It's a lot of $$$.  Sure, the cost of living is 2x as high there, but the offer more than makes up for it.

So, the dilemma is that I feel really bad about leaving my current job at AeroDyne.  I've only been here 8 months, and it's my first ""real"" job out of college - I'd been bouncing around part time jobs and glorified internships for two years after college, and they gave me my first real break.  In addition, my current project is at a critical juncture (it's going to be crunch time for a few months), and the project is also severely understaffed.  I don't want to screw over my team at AeroDyne entirely and burn the few professional bridges I have, but on the other hand, an offer to work in this particular division of WCT is a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing.

So... what would you do?  How would you handle the situation?"
1d2frm,2,2013-04-25,I just need to write some shit down.,TeraBiteZ_Corbin,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1d2frm/i_just_need_to_write_some_shit_down/,"I keep trying to write down my situation but I just keep backing them up with excuses. Fuck. 

I'm a horrible person, I'm going to fail the eight grade for the second time, I can't get my drivers license till I'm 18, and I'm fucking fat. 

And the only thing I really care about anymore; my bmx, the back wheel broke and I don't have the money to replace it, so I have to wait a month till my birthday to get new one, which leaves me sitting around like a fatass on my computer. 

Shit, the only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because of my family. When ever I get suicidal all I can think of is this time when my sister and I were watching the morning news and a kid my age wrecked a stolen car and killed himself, I think I mumbled ""I should do that"" or something similar, and she just looked at me and said ""Corbin, don't do that ever, I'd miss you too much."". As I'm writing I can't help but tear up.


I'm thinking I should just join the military or something. 


But, I also have some good things going I guess.

I'm supposed to talk to a guy about getting an internship at a computer store, maybe that can turn into something. 

I could also just power through online homeschool next school year and get my GED and go to college a year early.

I'm also starting to lose weight and not eat so much, thanks to BMXing. It just really helps me keep my head on right. That's why I've been so depressed since it broke. 

Either way, thanks for letting me rant. "

:--|:--
[What was the hiring process for your gig on The Daily Show?  Was the decision mostly in the hands of Jon Stewart, The Daily Show producers, or were Comedy Central execs involved in the process?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1d0sgq/hi_im_al_madrigal_the_daily_shows_latino/c9lrz6a?context=5)|I submitted my own piece based on a Congresswoman in Texas named Debbie Riddel who wanted to make an exemption for illegal immigrants who had domestic help jobs. Sent it in, they flew me out, read with Jon and he shook my hand and said welcome to the daily show. That plus a good 13 years of doing standup and various TV gigs. While very inclusive and open to suggestions, Jon is really the sole decision maker at the show. As he should be, his name is on it,
[*Daily Show office gets flooded with thousands of submissions*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1d0sgq/hi_im_al_madrigal_the_daily_shows_latino/c9ls9u4?context=5)|I'm sure.

We might break into the liquor cabinet but we'll keep it small.
[Hey Al. Do you think some of the pieces you guys do should be considered journalism? One thing that comes to mind is that piece on the small town that was run / owned by a corporation.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1d0sgq/hi_im_al_madrigal_the_daily_shows_latino/c9ls1zq?context=5)|For sure. Mandvi almost got arrested on that one. That's a sign that you're pushing the boundries...when homeland security shows up.
[Do you guys ever get recognized as Daily Show correspondents when out in the field? If so, do certain people refuse to talk to you because of it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1d0sgq/hi_im_al_madrigal_the_daily_shows_latino/c9ls2uj?context=5)|Absolutely @ the DNC &amp; RNC this past year. people ran to and away from us. 
[How does the daily show always find clips from years ago that make news pundits look hypocritical and stupid so quickly. Is there some sort of database?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1d0sgq/hi_im_al_madrigal_the_daily_shows_latino/c9lsbmx?context=5)|The staff here is incredible.

Have you ever wanted to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1d0sgq/hi_im_al_madrigal_the_daily_shows_latino/c9ls8xe?context=5)|YES!! But I've learned to just go with it. I was lucky enough to get the notes that Colbert gave to Rob Riggle - Staying in character might have been rule number one.

In the past separation and time have always seemed to fix the problem. After a few months of no contact, I've gone on to be good friends with people I have been obsessed with. But this time is very, very, horribly different.

For about 2 years I've been absolutely infatuated with one of my best friends at college. After I realized I had romantic feelings for her, I tried to work up the guts to ask her out. But, when I observed her spending all of her time with another guy I lost my confidence and couldn't do it. They started dating in secret, I got super depressed, lost my appetite, and lost 50lbs in a semester. After I bought all new clothes, I decided to separate myself from her like I had in the past and try again. I spent the whole summer without speaking to her and trying to move on. I even went as far as signing up for different classes than she did so I would see her as little as possible. 

We did end up having one class together, and ended up getting put together for a group project. Despite my best mental efforts, she's started flirting with me again (she's still with the guy) and I'm starting to fall back into obsession. On top of that, I just discovered that she and I were the two people selected for a very prestigious internship in my hometown, meaning we will be sharing an office over the summer. 

**tl_dr**

I have to spend the summer with a person (in a relationship) that I have a history of going crazy over. How can I cope with spending so much time with her while she is incredibly flirtatious with me? I just want to live a normal life and not be chained down by this stupid obsession. Please, any help at all would be greatly appreciated."

[457 Squat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLUAeTdcc08), Ain't nobody got time for a 259 Bench, [551 Deadlift](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NokJkB7LWAM)

Bodyweight: 161

Total: 1267

Wilks: 417

Won the 165 weight class, second in the junior division, and fourth overall. 


**Meet Prep:**

I had a full six months to train for this meet, but unfortunately did not end up training for all of that time.  At the conclusion of my [last meet](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/12ben2/meet_report_nasa_iowa_regional_2012_1228_lbs_at/), although I did not mention it, I sustained a pretty serious back injury that prevented me from doing any of the competition lifts .  Naturally I did not go see a doctor and instead decided to rehab whatever was wrong with my lower back with fish oil, pulling a sled, and reverse hypers.  It worked out well and towards the end of November I could front squat pain free upwards of 95% of my 1RM ; however I still couldn't low bar 95lbs.  Bench pressing was also a no-go, but about a month after the incident of only doing dips I started floor pressing regularly and worked my way back up to higher intensities.  That continued until about mid December and ultimately my floor press maxed out at 260 (equal to my bench max) and front squats got up to 350.

Finally in mid December I low barred 405 on a whim fairly easily but really felt it the next day and decided it wasn't meant to be yet.  Enter the high bar squat.  Despite its inherent evils, high bar squats, along with front squats, made up the majority of my training as I pushed my high bar max up to 440, just shy of my then meet PR, through mid January.  At the same time, I found I could deadlift pain free and started ramping up the intensity until I hit a [520 deficit deadlift](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brMtF9WYXp4) and a [550 deadlift](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qpe7b-lx-fQ).  At that time my back could finally handle sustained low bar squatting and competition style bench press.  

Considering how my squat had stalled prior to my injury, this go-around I decided to try out a bit of an auto-regulated block periodized training cycle for squat and bench press; deadlifts were more focused on RFD to focus on my speed off the floor to my knees which has always been lacking and used typical Westside rep schemes but without accommodating resistance which is wholly unnecessary given my strength on the lockout.  Based on how I felt that day, I would work up to a daily max (usually around 415 for squat and 235 for bench) and then do my work sets which ranged from 3-6 sets for 5-10 reps.  That may not seem like high volume for an accumulation phase, but for somebody who was used to doing singles, it was pretty freaking hard.  

That continued until about a month and a half out from competition where I then transitioned to more of an intensification cycle with a similar number of sets, but fewer reps at higher intensities to focus on pure strength and that was then followed by a transition to a realization period where I really upped the weights and hit [this sweet 465 squat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWTf0MjkCn8).  Unfortunately the final two weeks before the competition really stuck it to me with exams and lab reports and I didn't lift at all the final eight days before the meet which proved to be a detriment on competition day.  On top of that, this entire semester I've been waking up at 4:30 five days a week for my internship with the S&amp;C department, so the early mornings coupled with the late nights really did a number on me that week.  On the bright side, I was down to 160 the day of weigh ins without cutting because I didn't have time to eat.  

**Meet Day:**

Definitely felt the week lay-off I took.  Everything on my back past 315 felt twice as heavy as normal, but it started to feel better the more I warmed up.  The sweet, sweet nectar of the gods, Jack3d, also helped.  Just based on my force-velocity curve for squats, everything past a certain weight looks like the same speed despite the weight.  Thus the relatively smooth looking 457 in the video, but the 468 I called for on my third going absolutely nowhere.  

408, 457, 468(X)

Bench...meh.  Volume training really didn't seem to do anything for me and it was just a so-so day but the weights felt good.

231, 248, 259

Deadlift felt freaking awesome on warm ups.  Everything was fast and strong.  I am really used to Eleiko bars though and the Texas Deadlift Bars really tore up my hands (first world problems...).  My opener felt strong as shit but it ripped a bunch of skin off my thumbs.  I taped up for my second attempt at 551 and got to about the knees before the tape ripped.  Holy mother of god, never again.  Instantly dropped it when the tape ripped without even having time to think about what I was doing.  At that point I was pretty pissed because I knew I was good for more, but didn't want to attempt something and fail and walk away with just a 496 deadlift so I called for 551 again, packed the holes in my thumbs with chalk and pulled that son of a bitch to lockout.

496, 551(X), 551

**Thoughts Going Forward:**

It would have been the bee's knees to total 1300, but I ended up being about 11lbs short on each lift, so maybe in July.  That being said, 1267 at 165 is good enough to qualify as Candidate for Master of Sport according to the Sheiko guy, so that's pretty neat.  475 on squat and 570 on deadlift are the two big training goals of this next cycle and I do think they are attainable.  I'm not sure what the plan for bench is yet, but I'll figure something out.  Given how well my squat and deadlfit both responded to the quad work I got front squatting (something I think a lot of powerlifters are lacking, myself included), this accumulation cycle is going to feature a lot of front squats, RFE split squats, and eccentric portions to really bolster my quad strength as well as a bigger focus on hamstring strength with RDLs and GHRs due to their relative weakness to my erectors.

It's bleeding over into my clinical work.  I dread the days that I have to go and see my clients, despite really enjoying my clients and feeling like we are making progress.  I find myself hoping that people don't show for appointments, and I just don't think it should be like that.  

I also feel like I'm losing a part of myself in this process.  I focus so much on clients between clinical work and class.  I am encouraged by my site to not disclose any personal information to clients and to be as neutral as possible on issues; this is great and all, but to some degree I'm losing myself and the different perspectives I can offer to a client.

I'm graduating with a CS degree in May and have been aggressively job hunting. I have an internship in place over the summer (that I have been at since last summer) that I can leave at any time for a full-time job.

The dilemma:
I got a job offer today that isn't as quite a sweet deal as I think might come along soon (I'm interviewing with multiple places). I expect to have at least a couple offers, some more exciting than others. My rough start date for anything would be mid June(ish).


The two camps:
Some friends have suggested I accept the first offer while continuing my job hunt, bailing on the first company if a sweeter deal comes along.

This sounds unethical to me. I would rather just tell them ""I need a couple weeks to make up my mind about your offer"". However the other camp thinks that this might spur the employer to look elsewhere, and not trust me as much (stalling), making the chance of that offer less likely if I ask them to wait.


What is your advice?"

I posted a question a few weeks back about listing my shadowing experience on the application and received a few great answers (most of them suggesting that I group everything together in one slot).  However, I am still having some difficulties with this... 

I shadowed a few physicians here and there (ophthalmologist, ID internist, and soon to be Cardiologist) but I think that so far it only totals to about 20 hours.  I am planning on shadowing another internist soon and maybe another specialty if I can manage.  That alone sounds pretty minuscule and it is probably about 10% of my shadowing experience.  My other shadowing experiences occurred through my volunteer experiences...

1) About 20 physicians in a medical clinic abroad(internists, EM docs, peds, oncologist, etc. NOT in their normal setting) for about 50 hours 

2) 1 family doc and 1 N.P in a local clinic while I volunteered (hours unknown since it varied if they would allow me to go in for certain procedures and consultations)

3) Some ER docs, Radiologists, and OB/GYNS at a local hospital through my internship.  Again, my internship is not geared toward shadowing but shadowing is a reward that I get every once in awhile.  Probably totaling to 20 hours right now.

Do you guys suggest that I still try to group this all under one section or do you think I should take a sentence or two in each area to briefly mention my shadowing experience?  I am okay with taking out the ophthalmology, ID internist, and cardiology experiences if it would just be a waste to use a whole slot on this without merging everything together.

1d1rgk,15,2013-04-24,Application Developer Intern.,Mr_kitty_rules,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1d1rgk/application_developer_intern/,"Hello. It is possible that I will be receiving an application developer internship position in a company this summer. 

I'm a junior majoring in Information Technology and Management. 

The skill set for this position is: Strong fundamental knowledge of .NET, Java, Visual Studio, Oracle, SQL, SharePoint, Linux, and Microsoft Windows.

Now, I am experienced with all of those besides Oracle maybe, but my confusion comes from the job description:
*****
PPL Services has multiple computer/information technology internships available. As an ISD Application Developer intern, you will work with a team of professionals to design, develop, maintain, and support various applications that are critical to the execution of business processes within PPL subsidiaries such as PPL Services, PPL Electric Utilities, PPL EnergyPlus, and PPL Generation. 

Your responsibilities will include contributing to the functionality, reliability, and availability of computer based applications; and helping to develop partnerships by working with internal customers, vendors, consultants, as well as other Information Services personnel. As an intern within ISD you will perform a wide range of project activities that are necessary to architect solutions to real-world business problems by assisting with software development and project management related activities including estimating work, progress reporting, and task scheduling.

Application Developer interns will also be responsible for working closely with other members of ISD as well as business representatives to gather business requirements, troubleshoot technical problems, design new applications, enhance existing applications, and support the integration of both internal and externally hosted applications in order to improve business value.

*******

Sorry for the long bit of text, but does anyone have a clue as to what exact applications I will be working on in the business world? And what kind of projects and such? I've done a lot of standard applications through a few of my college courses designed for VB, but does anyone have any insight for what I'm in for pending I get this internship?"
1d1pm0,4,2013-04-24,Why Farm Sanctuary and Other Animal Advocacy Organizations are Destined to Fail Non-Humans,SinisterPrimeMinster,vegan,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1d1pm0/why_farm_sanctuary_and_other_animal_advocacy/,"I was thinking about Farm Sanctuary today. I used to be a huge fan of the organization and their work, even going so far as to intern with them for two months out in New York. I met many, many people who work at Farm Sanctuary who I greatly respect and admire so this isn't meant to be a knock against the people who work at Farm Sanctuary, this is a discussion and some thoughts I have on Farm Sanctuary as an organization, their goals and their methods.

It seems to me that Farm Sanctuary, along with a lot of non-profit organizations have a huge interest in not actually defeating animal agriculture at large. It seems that FS in many ways operates by giving people what the Catholic church at one point called ""indulgences"". Most of the donors are not vegans who are giving money to this and other animal advocacy organizations and I imagine on some level what is taking place is that these people feel bad for their use and exploitation of innocent non-humans and so they donate money to FS, PETA and other organizations to ease their conscious.

Farm Sanctuary will often argue that they are helping farm animals because of the amount of people they supposedly turn to veganism. However, I feel that this easing of consciousness that they are providing all their non-vegan donors must more than offset the very, very few people each year they help turn vegan. I mean, no one ever goes vegan for one and only one thing. A change like that is a mixture of how you are raised and your experiences throughout your life. So FS and no one else for that matter can take credit for turning anyone vegan.

I feel like what would counter this criticism of the organization would be if they pressured their donors to adopt veganism, possibly even only allowing donors to give if they are vegan. The counter to this I imagine is that FS needs money to operate and run. This is what is driving so many of my problems with this organization. This organization along with all these other animal advocacy organizations may very well want to bring about a better world for non-humans, but the one thing that will always trump bringing about that better world is keeping the organization running and making sure everyone who works there has a job and the donors have a place to donate to. At the end of the day, all these organizations will always put their own continued existence ahead of the cause of veganism and non-humans. This is why a non-profit based vegan movement is destined to fail from the start. It is unsustainable.

Lastly, I just want to mention that Farm Sanctuary is using non-humans against their consent in much the same way that Burger King or factory farms are. Obviously the animals seem to be having a better day to day life and I wouldn't argue against the fact that they are. However, these animals at FS are now what is bringing in donations from around the world to Farm Sanctuary. So instead of selling their murdered bodies for profit against the non-human's consent, now the non-human's image and story is being used to rake in tons and tons of cash to keep these organizations afloat. I see it like comparing slavery of African-Americans with blaxploitation films. We can have a discussion and a debate about how one differs from the other and maybe one is worse than the other. However, when we look at the structures of what is going on it seems that these animals have just moved from one place of exploitation to another. Animal liberation and I see it would be the day when non-human's exist for their own interests and not in service of the interest of us humans. Farm Sanctuary, PETA, HSUS and all these other organizations that I used to be in love with are not working to bring about that world. One of the feelings I didn't expect I would experience so much due to going vegan is that of betrayal. Over and over again I have been sold the same story that person x or organization y is on the side of non-humans and working towards their freedom. Yet time and time again without fail after looking into the processes and background of how said organization is functioning I am disappointed and let down by what is actually taking place. 

Please share your thoughts. I imagine not many people will agree with what I have said, but I think it is important that it be said regardless.

Thank you.

###GREG NELSON FOR SPORTS ILLUSTRATED

(1/3)

---

**PICTURE A** parking lot in a small Texas town in the early 1990s, heat curling up from the blacktop like incense from an altar, a few dozen fans watching a crew-cut assistant coach named Gregg Popovich patiently explain the rudiments of basketball. Accompanying Popovich on this annual San Antonio Spurs Caravan are a future star, Sean Elliott; a strangely coiffed center, Dwayne Schintzius; and the Spurs' mascot, called, for obvious reasons, the Coyote.

It is difficult to reconcile that man with the Popovich we know now: impatient, vibrating with energy, eager to get on with it, the Popovich whose Spurs began their 16th straight postseason appearance on Sunday with a 91-79 win over the Lakers. The late, great Schintzius's mullet alone might have prompted Popovich to start kicking cones and get in the faces of potential ticket buyers-to ""go Serbian,"" as Popovich himself describes the cyclone of anger that sometimes engulfs him. Do you hear what I'm telling you about the rocker step? Do you really want to be a season-ticket holder?

But that was a different era, before the Spurs were four-time champions, before they put up 14 straight 50-win seasons (which would be 16 if not for the labor strife of 1998-99), before they routinely sold out the 18,581-seat AT&amp;T Center, before Popovich was a two-time Coach of the Year, before he was elevated to team president as well as coach (""The buck stops with him,"" says general manager R.C. Buford) and before Pop joined Magic and Larry as one-named NBA entities.

Popovich is the sometimes snarling face of that rare Model Franchise, known for winning, consistency, brand loyalty and a penchant for keeping controversy (hell, keeping almost everything) in-house. Pop has sent forth many of his loyal flock to positions of prominence around the NBA-having been part of the Larry Brown coaching tree, Popovich now has a tree of his own-and most continue to abide at least partly by this code of omerta.

Certainly that is true of Sam Presti, who began as an intern with San Antonio and is now general manager of the Thunder, the team that knocked off the Spurs in last year's conference finals and finished two games ahead of them in the West this season. During an interview about his mentor, Presti jumped off and on the record like a guy adjusting the temperature of the shower, not because he was saying anything remotely controversial but because he didn't want Pop to think he was talking out of turn by dispensing fulsome compliments. Presti mentioned that the coach had bought a book for him recently, but after some deliberation he decided he couldn't divulge the title. ""In some way,"" says Presti, sheepish, ""I guess I'm still wearing those Spurs stripes.""

While affection for this master of mystery is hardly universal, there is a grudging respect in most quarters-including that quarter at 51st Street and Fifth Avenue in New York City. Popovich and NBA commissioner David Stern have had a couple of well-publicized battles over the coach's decision to rest key players on road trips, the last one (after Pop sent Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker home from a nationally televised TV game in Miami on Nov. 29) resulting in a $250,000 fine to the franchise. ""I have always enjoyed my personal interactions with Pop,"" says Stern. ""He brings an extraordinary worldview to the NBA.""

Parsing Stern (which, admittedly, can be treacherous), one sees intent in his choice of ""worldview."" True, a certain Belichickian atmosphere hangs over the Republic of Pop, where the Spurs consider league rules governing media access to be the most casual of suggestions and where the statement ""Tim Duncan will not be available today"" circulates on an endless loop. But one also discovers a certain charm within the Republic of Pop, stemming largely from the antic disposition of its ruler. ""I offer this with hesitation,"" says Jeff McDonald, who has been on the Spurs beat for the San Antonio Express-News for six years, ""but when you cover Pop, there's a kind of Stockholm syndrome. You start to feel affection for your captor.""

Popovich is described by all who know him well as smart, funny, compassionate and even warm. Indeed, upon revisiting with the man after a yearslong absence, it was disconcerting to be given a sincere bro-hug even as you knew he wished you were climbing on the first plane out of San Antonio International. ""If it doesn't fit the mission,"" says Hall of Fame center David Robinson, who joined the Spurs in 1989, when Popovich was one of Brown's assistants, ""Pop just doesn't care about it.""

One thing that almost never fits the mission is talking to sideline reporters during games, an NBA-mandated task for head coaches. That difficult assignment has fallen most memorably on TNT's fascinatingly coutured Craig Sager, whose give-and-take with Pop has produced much outstanding theater. ""I try to ask questions that he can't answer yes or no, "" says Sager, ""but that usually doesn't work out. 'What are your impressions of the first quarter?' I might ask, and Pop says, 'None.' Or I'll ask, 'How come you're getting outrebounded?' and he'll say, 'What do want me to do? Get rid of players during the game? Send them to the D-League?'""

On one occasion, Sager saw Pop before the game looking even more out-of-sorts than usual.  ""You look like your dog died,"" Sager said, to which Pop responded: ""Actually, that's exactly what happened."" The reporter whipped out his notebook to get details, but an alarmed Popovich stopped him. ""You mention that on the air,"" he said, ""and I'll wake up tomorrow morning with a thousand dogs on my front step.""

Still, Sager, like most people in the press, feels some level of affection for him: ""People will ask me, 'Isn't Gregg Popovich a jerk?' and I say, 'Actually, he's one of the greatest in any sport.'"" Pop knows just how far to push the jerk thing; even as he's jawing at Sager, he's liable to reach over and wipe sweat onto Sager's pocket handkerchief, which has happened on at least one occasion.

All that makes San Antonio's only major sports franchise a ""culture""-Pop Culture, if you will. ""Whenever I talk to players on other teams about certain situations,"" says Spurs guard Ginobili, ""what I end up hearing is, 'Yeah, but you're on the Spurs.' They mean, 'Okay, you'll figure it out and go on winning.'""

For 16 years now, keeping Duncan happy and healthy has been at the top of Pop's mission list. Pop and Tim: tough and steadfast, different sides of the same coin, the Auerbach and Russell of the modern NBA. Pop is one of the few subjects the Big Fundamental will talk about without looking like someone is torturing him with thumbscrews. ""Pop has always taken care of me, whether I knew it or not,"" says Duncan. ""Pop has been a mentor for me, a father figure. I know it's incredibly rare. And I know I'm lucky to have it.""

Yes, Popovich has come a long way: from the man Elliott thought was ""a typical jarhead,"" when he got a load of Pop's crew cut and his hard-charging ways on those hot afternoons in towns like Eagle Pass and Del Rio, to someone Elliott now describes as ""kind of a Renaissance man,"" his tutor on matters both cinematic and oenophilic. Back in the Caravan days, Pop and Elliott were San Antonio's version of Siskel and Ebert, debating movies on a local TV channel. While Pop recommended titles such as Francois Truffaut's 400 Blows -""He liked anything that was obscure, had subtitles and nothing happened,"" says Elliott-the player tended to go Schwarzeneggerian. ""If it had Arnold shooting a gun or somebody crashing a car,"" says Pop, ""Sean was sure to give it an A."" But as the years have rolled on, Elliott finds himself gravitating to independent films. ""Pop's influence,"" he says, shrugging his shoulders.

Pop's knowledge of wine is the best-known personal fact about him: his part ownership of the Oregon-based A to Z Wineworks, his 3,000-bottle home wine cellar, the staggering sums he has spent on wines, and the disquisitions on Brunellos and Malvasias that have fallen on deaf ears when he takes his staff out to dinner on the road, an inviolate ritual. ""I used to like all these Australians and California Cabs,"" says Elliott, ""and now I'm Old World. That's Pop again.""

His sophistication goes well beyond the grape. Popovich talks to Serbian players in their native language; reads the Russian writers Dostoyevsky, Turgenev and Lermontov (in English); has begun collecting rare first editions; counts among his friends one of the top scholars of Swedish history and politics in the U.S.; and makes his restaurant choices by, as he puts it, ""triangulating"" information in Travel + Leisure, Conde Nast Traveler, Decanter and Andrew Harper's Hideaway Report.Popovich also owns up to being a political liberal, which gives an interesting edge to conversations with his old buddies on the Air Force Academy endowment committee and with Spurs owner Peter Holt, a GOP contributor.

Oh, yes. Pop was also Larry Brown's best man."

I’m a second baccalaureate coming into engineering , I graduated about two years ago with my B.S. in biology and unfortunately did not graduate with a stellar gpa nor any work experience. I was adamant on pursuing medicine despite my low gpa, which is basically what I have spent my time with since graduating. At the beginning of this year, I applied to a handful of biology masters programs that would take my MCAT rather than the GRE. Once I saw that the M.S. programs stayed mum, although I did have a decent MCAT score, I figured my chance at med school wouldn’t be any better. I didn’t get in anywhere and decided that I need to move on and look elsewhere for my career goals. 

I’ve applied and gotten into a computer engineering program at a local college and also into an ABET electrical engineering program at another school, and I’m leaning toward electrical. I’ve always had my eye on engineering. I took calculus 1-3, diff eq, and calculus-based physics while I worked on my first degree. Only problem is that I took those classes well over three or four years ago, and I don’t feel as if I remember anything from diff eq. I’ll be taking basic programming and circuit classes this summer, and in the fall:
 
* Electromagnetic Fields
* Digital Systems
* Electronic Circuits
* Linear Circuits

How can I brush up on the fundamentals to prepare for upcoming classes? What can I expect from these upcoming classes? I know the best way to learn more in a field like engineering is to have your own projects. Are there any EE journals of some sort that have the most recent developments in the field, like Nature or Science? What's the story behind a software vs hardware direction an EE grad could take?Would it be wise to pursue an internship for a fall/spring semester? I’m not sure if the workload would be too heavy with a pt job.

1d673r,7,2013-04-26,"What do you think about reporting organizations that rely heavily on ""unpaid internships"" to the Department of Labor?",Davin900,nyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1d673r/what_do_you_think_about_reporting_organizations/,"So I'm getting pretty tired of watching so many of my friends struggle to find jobs and realize that most companies in their field are only offering ""unpaid internships"" that most of the time don't have any chance of leading to paid work.

I know that the vast majority violate federal law.

Here are the criteria for being legally exempt from minimum wage laws.

* 1. The internship, even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employer, is similar to 
training which would be given in an educational environment; 
* 2. The internship experience is for the benefit of the intern; 
* 3. The intern does not displace regular employees, but works under close supervision of existing staff; 
* 4. The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the intern; 
and on occasion its operations may actually be impeded; 
* 5. The intern is not necessarily entitled to a job at the conclusion of the internship; and 
* 6. The employer and the intern understand that the intern is not entitled to wages for the time spent in the 
internship. 

Basically, the law says that the employer should gain nothing from having an unpaid intern and that the internship should be offered purely out of altruism.

I've personally worked at organizations that used unpaid interns for up to 1/4 of their workforce, sometimes letting them run entire departments or programs. I've seen paid employees being replaced with unpaid interns. I've heard managers say ""Well, an employee will cost too much so I'll just get an unpaid intern.""

I'm getting a bit frustrated that so many positions that clearly should be paid, entry-level jobs are being filled by unpaid interns.

So what do you think? Is there any hope in calling the DoL? Would anything come of it? It seems pretty clear that these places are violating federal law."

I've visited but it was snowing and nasty so I didn't really get to see the area and campus as well as I would have liked. I'm from New Jersey and I'm a pretty laid back kid so will living in Colorado be a difficult adjustment for me? Is it easy to make friends and find a group of people that fit you? I'm not big on wild parties and such so will there be other opportunities to have fun?

I know that Boulder has a higher ranked engineering college but it comes in lower in ChemE than Delaware. How is their reputation in regards to the chemical industry and is there local industry that recruits from Boulder's program? I want to be able to do research and intern before I graduate and I'm completely ignorant on what is around the Boulder/Denver area. Also, will a Boulder degree be as well regarded outside the state of Colorado or do most students end up employed in CO?

I'm in the Honors Program at the College of Arts &amp; Sciences and I've gotten into the Presidential Scholars Program so that's a big plus.

Hello y'all,

I graduated from High School in the spring of 2012. I took all the programming courses my high school offered which as a awe inspiring one, which focused entirely on Visual Basics and used a GUI for a large part of the development.

So I took a year off to dive deeping into programming languages. I dabbled with HTML and CSS in highschool but over the year have reached a point where I'm very comfortable. I recently subscribed to CodeSchool and have dabbled with jQuery, they don't seem to offer a JavaScript course. Backend entices me more as I've never been a designer.

I plan on taking their Ruby and Ruby on Rails courses. I got accepted to UMKC (University of Kansas City Missouri) which will cost me about $10,000 a year. I got enough grants and scholarships to cover about $5,000 of that. My brother is getting out of the Navy and his GI bill will cover our housing so financially I'm pretty set.

Besides going to school, contributing to Open Source projects, and trying to get an internship, is there anything else I can do to prepare for landing jobs after college?"

When is it okay to follow-up?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1d5yis/applied_for_an_internship_now_impatiently_waiting/,"The first week of April, I sent in an application for a summer internship. I said in my cover letter that I would contact them in about two weeks. Everything I've read has told me that I'd supposed to say this, so I did. 

A week after sending it in (on the 9th), they called me to ask for my references. I emailed them to the secretary (as I was instructed to do) and proceeded to wait. Unfortunately, this made me really confused about whether I should call them the following week. I said I would, but they'd already contacted me, so I wasn't sure if it was necessary. 

I called anyway. I was told that, yes, they had received my references, but the secretary that I spoke to (the same one who asked for my references) didn't know the status of my application and her boss was out at the moment.

So now, a week and a half later, I am trying to decide if I should just assume that I didn't get it or if I should be annoying and phone them next week. I don't really want to phone them (I hate talking on the phone), but my mother is trying to tell me that that is what I'm supposed to do. I don't want to be that annoying applicant that pesters the people in charge, but I'd really just like to be told yes or no.

I suppose I'm just asking what the proper etiquette is. All I've been told is the usual ""call a week or two later"" thing."

So I've managed to get myself an internship with a reasonably new company in London. I'm from Scotland. They're small but interesting and in the Interaction design field of which I'm a student of. I'm extremely excited to do it but I don't have much money and from first looks Accommodation prices in London are the same weekly as I currently pay Monthly (250/m).

I've just been told I'll be given £500+- for the month I'll be there for accommodation and lunch and travel expenses will be covered.

I'm happy with this, I'm not looking to make money during this month only enough to live and eat. They're taking a bit of a risk with me since they were at first looking for a graduate but didn't realise I wasn't until post-interview after which they were already interested in taking me on. 

So my questions are.

1.Where can I find accommodation with that price?

2. Where can I find the above that will let me stay for just a month?

3. Has anyone had experience as an out-sider moving to London for a month to intern? I'm excited but nervous. Advice welcome. 

p.s

I know a few people may get on at me for basically doing this internship for just enough to (hopefully) cover my living expenses and in reality, I won't be getting minimum wage if I'm in 5 days a week but my summer would consist of working in a shoe shop otherwise and I can't really explain how exciting this is for me. They said they were looking to find someone to stay on after as well so I'm hoping it leads to a job after I graduate.

[story inside]",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1d5ous/how_do_i_go_about_getting/,"This is probably going to be a long, depressing story, so I will add a **TL;DR** for those who give zero fucks about a random sob story.

So I am now a junior in college with just ONE year left of school. Boy, can I not wait for that to be over - and not because I don't like school. I love school and I love to learn. The problem is my father is paying for my schooling out of pocket. He works 7 days a week, 12 hours a day as a Welder. He had told me, the last fight we got in to over my grades, that if I end up with one more B in a class that I am to pay for my own schooling. At this time I was a 3.80 with only 4 B's ever throughout my college experience. Now, after this semester is over I'm looking at 3 B+ and one B or potentially 1 A-, and 3 B+ (I have an 89.89% in a class and I just emailed my professor to see if he can round it to meet an A-). 

Breaking this to my dad is going to turn into an all out screaming war, and he's going to want my head for ""disobeying"". He firmly believes if you sit down, study and as he says ""eat, breathe, and sleep your schooling"", straight A's are a breeze. He feels as if though because he is slaving away at his job to give this family what they have, then we have to do as he wishes (in my case, give him straight A's in my schooling). My sister was going for Nursing, and had the same ultimatum, except... she had a bankroll saved up from working since she was 16 and was able to actually do that. I have had one job in my life that lasted 6 months, then I had to quit because it was robbed at gun point and I figured that it wasn't worth my life to keep working there. I now have a summer internship with a really large company, which SHOULD help me pay for one semester.

With all that being said, I go back to the title and ask you ladies and gentlemen of Reddit, how do I go about getting grants, scholarships, or loans that require no co-signing to pay for my own schooling?

To anyone who read the entire thing, I thank you - as that has been weighing on my chest for some time and I had no one to talk to about it.

**TL;DR** Dad works 7 days a week 12 hours a day, said ""No more B's or you're paying for your own schooling"", and I'm looking at all B's and B+'s this semester, need to find out how to pay for my own schooling."

I've been attending a local community college for CS for the past 2 years. For the past few months I've been interning as a software engineer at a local company and am pretty sure they're getting ready to offer me a full time salaried position (They made me a nameplate :P, and the other 2 interns that started with me were let go a month+ ago). I just got accepted into Rochester Institute of Technology's CS program as a transfer, but I'd still be considered a first year student, with about half a year done there. RIT is about 40k/year, and I've already got 30k in debt from previous college (I have a certificate degree in digital photography... aka a useless piece of paper). Their program is great though, very career oriented, even requiring 2 semesters +1 summer of co op. But I'd be coming out with somewhere between 150 and 200k in debt.

The final piece of the puzzle is my significant other. He currently works at the same company I'm interning at but really doesn't like it and wants to look for something more. He's said that if I decide to go to RIT he'd move out there with me and find a job out there. He's already got his BS so shouldn't have too much of an issue getting a job... On the other hand if I don't go to RIT *and* we don't stay at this company... I'll be following him wherever he gets a job and... I don't even know what then.. either searching and searching for a job with 6 months of experience and no relevant degree... or go back into retail (GOD NO!) while finishing up an associates at a community college wherever we end up.. And then either searching again for a relevant job, or.. be faced with this same decision and try to find a university to attend.

Honestly the place we live is pretty middle-of-nowhere and doesn't have many tech jobs.. if we lived in a more tech-oriented area I may have an easier time finding a job I'd qualify for.. but I don't really know..

Sorry for the big blob of text.. but I've got a week left to decide on RIT.. It's pretty stressful realizing you have a week to make a decision that could affect the next 4 years of your life.... well I guess the rest of my life really, with 200k worth of debt..

A LITTLE ABOUT US: 

The Custer Battlefield Museum is located in Garryowen, Montana, ""Where the Battle of the Little Big Horn Began."" The Museum is recognized as a non-profit 501(c)3 corporation, supported exclusively through private funding.  We are located on the historic site where Sitting Bull’s camp was attacked by Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer in 1876.  This year will be the 136th commemoration of the Battle. 

The Museum's mission is to educate the general public on the Western Migration Movement, American expansion, and the Battle of the Little Big Horn. This institution also collects, preserves, and exhibits original artifacts, Native American beadwork, photographs, paintings, and rare books and manuscripts related to Custer and the Battle and other frontier subjects. Extensive exhibits of Native American and 7th Cavalry artifacts include many items excavated from the Battlefield, as well as ephemera belonging to Sitting Bull, G.A. Custer, Tom Custer, Crazy Horse, Lewis &amp; Clark, and other important figures of the time.   

The Museum’s collection of more than one hundred D.F. Barry photographs has toured internationally and is now on permanent display. The Tomb of the United States Unknown Soldier, dedicated during the 50th anniversary of Custer’s massacre, is a highlight on the museum grounds and is maintained by this institution. During the 125th anniversary of the Battle of the Little Big Horn, a Peace Memorial monument was erected with life-sized busts of Sioux Chief Sitting Bull and 7th Cavalry General George Custer.  

POSITION DESCRIPTION:

Internship position with the Custer Battlefield Museum in beautiful Garryowen, Montana, May through September (exact dates are flexible). Responsibilities include assisting as Museum Staff in a variety of projects and research related to the Museum collection and displays.  Additional duties include admissions, handling cash, helping with gift shop inventory and sales, answering questions and online inquiries, and educating tourists in various aspects of the famous Battle. The Museum averages 100+ visitors daily.  Interns will also be asked to maintain historical social media sites. 

Custer Battlefield Museum is a state-approved tourist information center.  In addition to answering questions about the Battle of the Little Big Horn, the Little Big Horn Battlefield National Monument, and the Big Horn Canyon National Recreation Area, interns should be prepared to answer general questions about Eastern Montana tourist sites, Yellowstone National Park and Mount Rushmore. 

The internship is an unpaid position, 35-40 hours per week. We provide the educational training and materials, housing, food, adventure, and fun! The cost to the Museum for room and board totals $6500.00 per intern. If selected, the Museum will award a $6000.00 grant to cover the majority of these costs.  The successful applicant will be responsible to furnish the additional $500.00 towards an unforgettable historical experience.  Interns who wish to use this opportunity to receive college credits may make arrangements with the Museum Director and his/her college advisor. 

Your summer home in Montana will include a clean and comfortable room adjacent to the Museum, which is located within the exterior boundaries of the Crow Indian Reservation next to the Little Big Horn River. This is a tremendous on-site educational opportunity in the Big Sky Country of Montana!

1d5lzn,3,2013-04-26,One week to decide on the next 4 years..,FerretWithASpork,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1d5lzn/one_week_to_decide_on_the_next_4_years/,"Hey All,

Recently I got accepted to Rochester Institute of Technology's Computer Science program. When I started going to community college that was my goal, to get into RIT. But now that I have.. I don't know if I can really do it.. Money's a big part of the problem but also.. motivation. I've been at community college for 2 years now. I'm another semester or 2 away from my associates, but I already have a job as a software engineer and have made a great impression at the company.

My 2 years of community college will only transfer as about a semester at RIT. I'd still be a first year student. RIT is about 40k+/year. I've already got ~30k in debt.. and I wouldn't be getting any scholarships or anything, so I'd be doing most of that in loans.. That leaves me with 4 more years in school and coming out with ~150-200k in debt.

I learn best by doing. For a while now I've just wanted to get out of school and get into the working world.. and I've sort of done that. I started off at my job as an intern and... technically I still am but the 2 other interns that started with me have already been let go and they're basically treating me as an employee, training me in areas outside of the project I worked on for the internship, even making me a nameplate. I'm debating asking if I can get a full time salaried position (I'm hourly right now) but that would be kind of pointless/rude(?) if I'm just going to be leaving for RIT at the end of summer.

Another factor is that I've got a boyfriend (side note: I'm a guy.. to clarify). He works as a software engineer at the same place I do (that's where we met &lt;3) and he hates it and really wants to look for a better job. He's already got his bachelors and it probably wouldn't be too hard for him to find a decent job anywhere, and I mostly wouldn't mind moving away with him... but I don't know if *I* could find another job somewhere without even my associates. We'd discussed just moving somewhere else and I finish off my associates at another community college but I've finished all my core classes so I'd be either doing a full semester of shitty gen ed/liberal arts classes, or taking some extra CS courses wherever I end up and stretching it out another year or so before I get my associates.

**TL;DR:** I can't decide between 4 more years of college at a prestegious school coming out with ~200k in debt but an awesome degree and experience.. or continuing at the so-so software development job I have now and try to work my way into the industry and finish my associates on the side..

Thanks for anyone who offers any thoughts, and more so to those that braved that giant book above :P"

Part of my job description was going to both Sunday services at 8 AM and 10:30 AM. When I arrive at the church for the 8 AM service I go to the kitchenette for a cup of coffee, but all that is there is a pot of hot water. If you know me you know that I don't do well without it. What made it worse is that I was the only person who knew how to make coffee on staff besides my mentor, and I was already running late.

I appreciate having different perspectives other than my own to weigh in on this.

EDIT 2: Thank you all for your input. I know I said it in the first edit, but really, I didn't expect such a response. You are all really awesome, and I'm trying to keep up with the comments. I won't be on much longer she gets out of work soon just so you all know. I will update when I get a chance after that. Thanks again..

EDIT 3: I'm going to leave my apartment and go to my campus for now to keep updating. I don't want to be home when she gets out of work. It's about a 15 minute commute. 

**UPDATE (6:47pm local time): We talked after she got out of work. She was in tears and explained to me how bad she wants me to be there and that she needs a lot of reassurance given how bad our past has been and that every time I say I'm serious I leave when things go bad. 

I told her I want to be with her and that I want to do my best, but I can't dish out reassurance if she won't accept what I can give. Example: She wanted me to drive her somewhere just now, but wouldn't get in my car until I went over to her car and shut it off and made her get in mine. I can do that, but I told her I can't when I fear being hit, or insults are being thrown around. 

Her promise is that she won't be violent with me, she just wants reassurance. Also, as a last note she said she *cannot* handle me doing my internship. I only have until Monday and she says there is no way she can feel better about it to let me do it. She doesn't think I can be with her if I'm not living with her at this time. 

Thanks for the continued support you guys, you are all really caring individuals and I really want to extend my humble thanks for all your comments.**

Hello r/relationship_advice and thank you for looking it means a lot to me. 

My girlfriend and myself are in a really difficult situation. Our relationship has been a roller-coaster ride. We have had serious problems with sex, arguing and to an extent physical violence.

Right now where we stand is that my girlfriend feels I don't value her/her feelings/her priorities. I have a really hard time with conflict. Most people either have that fight/flight response and I have more of a ""freeze"" response. I literally shut down when an argument starts and I'm unable to think clearly or what I would do if I wasn't in that situation, or in her shoes. 
  
We have talked many times about what she values, here is a brief list of her needs

* 1) Never leave during an argument
* 2) Never go to bed if we're not ok.
* 3) Never go to bed alone. 
* 4) Doing things on my own (Not asking for her help during an argument)
* 5) Don't argue her feelings, try to make her feel better.

We also have problems with where we are in our relationship; she has been ready for a more serious commitment since at least last March, while I'm not there yet. This has been a source of conflict for a long time. She feels I haven't expressed my affection in a way that is committed or lasting. My girlfriend values material things more than I thought she did when we started dating, she is bothered that I haven't gotten her many possessions over our relationship. 

All of our problems have been building and I haven't been able to be better. Now I have an internship offer that requires me to temporarily relocate and our relationship can't handle it. I have no idea how to get past our problems because I always let her down because I can't keep to her needs. 

I love her, I don't want to lose her, she is so unhappy and so am I and I have no idea what to do. I have no idea how to get past our past problems (the violence has really stuck with me) and make her happy. I feel like a bad person because she talks a lot about how other people in her life are getting married and their boyfriends don't let them down like I do. 

I don't want to make any excuses anymore, I want to be a better person. Any advice is appreciated.

tl;dr 

Me and my girlfriend are on the verge of breaking up at the moment because of a lot of built up issues and I'm offered an internship that requires me to relocate temporarily that I have to respond to by Monday. She feels her needs aren't being met and she puts herself down if she stays with me. 

Thank you for reading, I apologize if I'm disorganized I never talk to anyone about anything so I'm not sure what to say.

1d5fsi,5,2013-04-26,Low IOE GPA,worthlesslife69,uofm,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/1d5fsi/low_ioe_gpa/,"Hey guys,

I was just wondering if you guys knew anybody who switched to IOE from a major that they hated (which caused them to have a low GPA) or someone who just has a lower GPA overall.

I was just wondering how possible is it to land an internship with a lower IOE gpa (like.. 2.7~3.3).

Just a background info... I'm ending my sophomore year as an Electrical Engineer. The whole semester, I hated doing circuits and had no interest in it. I thought I understood the concept though. Studied my ass off for the exam, completely bombed the 215 exam. 100% know that I'm not going to pass the exam, and possibly even the course. As for 270, I'm not sure how I did, but I still bombed the second midterm.

I'm not sure if this is due to a lack of interest, or because I don't study enough (even though I studied my ass off).

But if anybody could help me out, I'd appreciate it!

**TLDR; How successful are IOE majors with low GPAs?**

EDIT: Small clarification. When I entered college, I planned on doing IOE, since I always heard it was more business based. I'm not trying to switch to IOE just cus it's easier, but because it seems to be more business-like. Currently, I wish I was a business major, not an engineering major, but it's too late for that. However, I tried out Electrical Engineering, because I heard patent law programs prefer EE's over any other type of engineers. I now realize that doing EE just for a law program isn't worth it. Thanks for all your help again."

I am not in BAP (my GPA doesn't allow it) but I am however in the Student Accounting Society on campus. However because they usually do things during the day I am unable to participate in any of the events. I work full time during the week and I'm a full time student. My question is, I am going to try and get an internship of the summer and was wondering if it really matters where, or if the sheer experience is good enough for my resume. My GPA is mediocre, I hope to finish with a ~3.3 and I am nervous as hell about entering the job market. I do plan on getting a Masters and eventually my CPA license when I can. My plan was to get a job and hope that they offer to pay for it. Is that a realistic goal?

I have a friend that I went to high school with and she got her CPA license in S.Carolina and she's waiting for it to kick in here in FL. She says I'll be fine but she got all A's so that's easy for her to say.

I have been diving in the past 3 years and currently a rescue diver with about 60-70 dives under my belt.

I don't think I will ever pursue diving as a career, but I do want to take a DM course just for fun and my own knowledge improvement

However, given my corporate job, I will never be able to take 1 month off to sign up for a proper DM course with potential internship. The maximum no. of days for holiday I can take is 2 weeks. 

I have found a dive centre that can do an accelerated DM course with  minimum 8 days (up to 14 days) provided I learn all the theory before hand , there will be no internship offered. 

So for experienced divers (especially anyone of you who are DM but work in a corporate world) What's your opinion on getting a DM in such short time? Should I go for it? I can think of the pros &amp; cons below, any more to add?

Pros: personal achievement, knowledge enrichment, more confidence under water

Cons: not enough on the job training, no actually leading the dive given the short training period, not employable without proper internships (but I am not seeking diving employment anyway)

Edit: grammar
Edit 2: Thanks everyone for the responses! I think I will not rush it, but  do a potential long internship with LDS!"

I really, really want this internship. It's basically exactly what I think I want to do with my life at this point. I am looking for apartments that are closer but I am worried that I'll get stuck in a 6-12 mo. lease. I just want to be there for the summer since I have a boyfriend at home and we don't want to be long-distance for long. However I need to give the employers a 'yes' or 'no' soon and I don't know what to say.... 

Some other notes... If I decided to commute from my parents house its mostly freeway driving, but I don't really have a lot of experience with freeway driving, to be honest I avoid it as much as possible. I'm don't even like driving that much, in general. I would try to to get over it for this job though. I am still worried about the 60 minutes (45 miles) each way though, especially since its kind of a physical, outdoorsy job so I'll be really worn out at the end of the day and THEN will need to do a ton of driving. Any advice from people in similar situations would be appreciated... The people who hired me played it off like the commute was no big deal, which is confusing to me. o_0"

There's a tl;dr provided at the bottom for your convenience.

Next, a little background: next week I'll be finishing up my 3rd year at The Ohio State University.  Every summer thus far, I've worked my ass off and auditioned for The Best Damn Band In The Land, the OSU Marching Band.  And every summer thus far, I've been cut on make-the-band night.

My first year being cut, I thought to myself, ""Hey, that's ok.  Almost everyone gets cut their first year.  I'll just come back next year and I'll make it in with no problem!""  I kept positive.  I didn't let it bother me; on the contrary I was proud to say that I auditioned for that band, and that I knew by name many of the people in it.

The next year, I just got really sad after being cut.  My girlfriend made it in for her rookie year on mellophone (also a second-time auditionee), and I felt just a tad inadequate.  But still, I got over it in time because I truly felt that there wasn't anyone that got in the band than whom I was better, plus my girlfriend was in the best damn band in the land!

Last summer, however, was a different story.  I had a veteran member (my girlfriend) close to me that I could look to for advice, and that helped a lot.  I started to get a bit braver during rehearsals and actually ask my squad leaders for advice.  During tryouts, I was absolutely kicking ass.  I'd never felt that good.  But still, come make-the-band night, my name wasn't on the list.  This time I wasn't sad.  I was *angry*.  Nobody gets cut 3 years in a row, and I knew in my heart that I was better than most of the other candidates, plus I'd auditioned on as many instruments as I could (trombone, bass trombone, baritone, and mellophone).

This angry/sad feeling remained with me for the better part of the first semester of the year.  I'd joined the university athletic band as a mellophone player to help me prepare for my audition at the Bluecoats in November, so I was constantly crossing paths with members of the marching band, many of whom knew how many times I'd been cut so it was kind of awkward passing them in the halls.  I was up late at night just crying into my pillow because I still truly believed that I should have been in that band.  At football games I would refuse to cheer them on unless it was something *really* cool or if I knew my girlfriend had a specific part so I could watch her.

And then the Bluecoats audition came.  I went up to Canton with my mellophone and music, spent the weekend in a high school gym, and had a truly fantastic time.  I learned a *ton* about playing mellophone (which I'd only just picked up last summer).  But, in the end, I was not offered a callback.  But this sat ok with me since I knew I was brand new to the instrument, and I'd be coming back for one more year next fall.  When I returned, I was suddenly cured of all of my animosity toward my school's marching band.  I was able to stand tall again: I'd just auditioned for one of the best marching music organizations in the world, and was almost good enough to get in!  The rest of the semester was wonderful; I began to socialize more in the athletic band now that it was more than a tool of preparation for the Bluecoats, and since the marching band season was coming to a close, I even had my girlfriend back.

This relative euphoria lasted pretty regularly through the winter.  Occasionally I'd see a band member walking around campus and I'd give them a subtle glare, but besides that I was generally happy again, and I didn't really have to think about the band at all.

But now it's coming back to summer time again, and I'm going to have to start preparing for this year's tryouts.  I've been getting a bit antsy about it recently, but I've generally been able to keep my mind off of it, what with classwork, my job, and looking for a local internship this summer.  Unfortunately, though, these thoughts came swelling up tonight while I was studying with my girlfriend.  The conversation went something like this:

----------------------

Me: ""You still have your band uniform?  Are you supposed to?""

GF: ""No.  I think I was supposed to take it back in January or something...""

Me: ""Sounds like my mellophone.  They haven't come after me for it, so I'm keeping it - hopefully through the summer.""

GF: ""You're going to do the 3 instrument thing again?  That didn't work last time.""

Me: ""Yeah, I know.  But I really enjoy playing mellophone, plus I want to be as proficient as I can be on it when I audition for the Bluecoats this November.""

GF: ""If you want to get into the band here first, you'll have to spend all of your time marching, and not as much playing, especially if you're as solid as you say on trombone and baritone.""

Me: ""I know for a fact that I will have free time this summer regardless of whether or not I keep learning mellophone.  I can fill that with one of two things: marching practice, or time to myself.  If I fill it with marching, great!  I'll get more practice in.  If I fill it with time to myself, well I know for another fact that I wouldn't have filled my mellophone practice time with marching either.""

GF: ""But you'll need all of the marching you can get to make it in the band.  That's been your problem for these last 3 years.""

Me: ""I realize that.  But you're forgetting one thing: I like playing mellophone.  We'll start the summer off with both trombone and baritone, and we'll see what my free time looks like.  If I don't have much and I'm not marching as much as I should be, I'll drop mello and focus entirely on marching and trombone.  Until then, I'm going to practice mellophone.""

GF: ""Just remember that it didn't work last year.""

Me: ""Yes, I know.  But I'm going to do it anyway.""

-----------------------

Looking back on it, I know she's right, but simply seeing her band uniform and noticing all of the tbdbitl merchandise and memorabilia on her walls brought back all of the feelings that I'd been able to keep locked away inside for the entire semester.  I was able to spit out a sharp ""good night"" to her before leaving.  It wasn't until I got to my car that it actually hit me that I was suddenly very angry at all things marching band.  I hate being angry.  I'm normally the happiest, most optimistic person I know, and angriness really puts a damper on that.  I thought I'd gotten (mostly) over this whole thing after the Bluecoats, but apparently not.

I don't know what to do now.  I mean, I've worked long and hard enough that there's no way in hell I'm going to give up on the marching band, but I really don't know if there's a way I'll be able to make it through the summer and maintain my sanity.  I made a post in /r/angry last August the night I got cut, but didn't find out about this subreddit until only a little while ago.  I wish I'd have know then, I feel like I would have actually gotten some feedback and felt better about myself rather than just venting to my keyboard.

TL;DR: I've been cut 3 times from the OSU marching band.  I'm unbelievably angry about it now, and I don't know what to do."
1d4r3f,0,2013-04-25,I hate ironing -- but it seems like steamers aren't up to par. What's the most efficient way to keep dress shirts crisp throughout the week?,sirberus,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1d4r3f/i_hate_ironing_but_it_seems_like_steamers_arent/,"So I am new to wearing dress shirts often, but I need to get savvy about by the time my internship starts this summer. I've read all the sidebar stuff, done searches, and I still can't seem to find a definitive answer on what the most efficient option is. A bit of an overview of my options I've come across:

1. **Iron** - I suck at this. Granted, I'll get better with practice, but it is still a hassle I'd prefer to avoid to get my ironing board out and spend the time doing this a few times a week (assuming I can hang them in the closet and keep them spaced to avoid wrinkling). If I go with Ironing -- should I invest in a good iron? And what makes an iron ""good""? I've noticed a lot of people on here recommending Rowenta, but I'm not sure why. My iron at the moment is a bit old, but works -- it has a steam feature, but I don't trust it (staining), so I use a water bottle to mist.

2. **Steamers** - I wanted to believe in this so much -- and I **REALLY** hope someone will say it is possible to effectively de-wrinkle a dress shirt with a steamer, but I can't find any info on which one would be able to do this. I purchased a Rowenta DR5015 which I saw recommended on here by someone else... and while it seems to be able to get 90% of the job done, that remaining 10% of fine, slight-texture (not really wrinkles, but definitely not wrinkle-free) is too sloppy for my taste. I was looking at other steamers, like the Jiffy-2000, but even some of those reviews seem to echo the idea that it's not a replacement for ironing a dress shirt (It's also like $160 -- but I'd happily pay that amount if it would replace ironing). So are steamers overhyped? Or what am I missing? **SIDE BONUS:** Apparently steamers are good to freshen up suits? Though I need to make sure mine wouldn't be damaged by that... and I suppose that's a whole different can of worms to look into.

3. Pay to have them professionally done. Not sure on the pricing, but from various posts on here it looks like I could assume ~$10 per week, which isn't *bad* but I am more of a fan of fixed-cost investments. 

Overall -- I have a feeling that the answer is ""quit your bitching and just learn how to iron,"" and if that's how it is that's how it is -- but if there is anything I'm overlooking or anything that will save me the micro-amounts of time ironing, please let me know.

Thanks, MFA! This subreddit has been beyond helpful in my evolution."

I've applied to numerous positions for the summer and the 1 company that got back to me decided to only hire 1 intern. I honestly feel like the dumps right now because this was my opportunity to go somewhere new and work on stuff that sounded really interesting. Now, my fall back is a research fellowship that I was awarded. I'm very humbled that I was selected, but I really wanted that internship to diversify my skills and to work with others in a company environment. All the experiences that I have on my resume is research based. I plan to go to grad school, but I wanted to work in industry first after I graduate. Just looking for other perspective."

The summer before my junior year, I was accepted into a research program with a local school, where they pretty much paid me to learn web development; I made a web app for the school, nothing major though.

This summer I'll be working developing another web application, this time for UNC. I already locked a position as undergrad researcher for my senior year developing educational software. I have never had a ""real"" internship, with a company, and I am worried it will come back to bite me. Are these experiences worth anything to employers? Will my lack of internships hurt me?

**TL;DR: I am entering my Senior year without a formal internship. All I've done and will do is Undergraduate research, making web apps, games, and other software. Am I in a good position when it comes time to obtain employment?**

Edit: Just wanto to clarify ( thanks to u/TryMeNah for pointing that out) that I am aware I don't do anything close to real research, and that those positions just have fancy titles.

I knew I'd be getting a C in one class for sure, but just found out I totally blew a final in a different class. To sum things up, I'm ending this semester with two C's and two A's. Not awful, but I feel really bad. In hindsight, yeah I should have studied more.

I just feel bad and I'm scared to tell my parents. They pay my tuition and like to see me do well. I still live at home and commute to school, so they know that I'm not like partying or anything instead of studying. Actually, this semester I was going to school full time, working an internship and another job.

I have previous experience (3 years) working as a field engineer, and some short term/part time jobs more or less related to my university degree. However despite my rather colorful CV, I've had no luck so far with local UK companies and branches of global companies in the UK. Any companies you might recommend as worth giving a shot?

1d4emx,2,2013-04-25,"Changing careers from a non-Finance background into the financial sector, possible?",[deleted],FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/1d4emx/changing_careers_from_a_nonfinance_background/,"Hi /r/FinancialCareers, I was redirected here by mods in /r/Finance, and I could use any advice you'd be willing to give.

Basically, I spent my entire early career chasing a job in the public sector, and when I finally got it, I found that I hated it. The work is boring and completely unsatisfying, with absolutely no challenge. I spend most days bored to tears, even when I'm busy. I've decided that I want out of this career path and into the private sector.

Because of my background, I'm not sure if a career switch like this is possible or if I would need to take some classes/go back to school. Basically, I have a Master's degree in an area studies field (think part Political Science, part language and history) from University of Chicago and an undergrad political science background from a top 20 school.

I'm interested in finance because I see it as a challenge, somewhere that a person who is motivated and smart can do well and be recognized for doing well. I've had far too many experiences working in the public sector where I felt like I did good work and was either chastised or ignored. Meanwhile, I read stories about people in Finance being given massive bonuses at the end of the year and think to myself “why am I not doing that?”

My skillset is similar to a data analyst. I spend a lot of time in Business Objects pulling reports and data and then analyzing them in Excel for trends. I generate a lot of statistics for my agency and do quality assurance work on reports that contractors put into the system. I really like using data to prove my point. My quant skills are not exceedingly strong, but I understand a lot more than I can replicate. I feel like I'm a very strong researcher.

I dug through Chicago's alumni directory and emailed about two dozen alumni listed as working in finance this same question, and I only got two responses. One said it was definitely possible to work my way into finance with my background, provided I could prove I had strong math skills. The other said no, it probably wasn't possible without an MBA.

I'd appreciate any advice people could offer. I don't know if this is worth pursuing by applying for internships or if I should study up. It's a big shift in my entire perception of myself and my life, so it's hard for me to judge my value."

Unfortunately, you're above the 95th... I wish I had a better answer for you. 
[Ford touts the economy of the new F-150 with the EcoBoost V6 as V8 power with V6 fuel economy, but the new Silverado/Sierra V8 offers V8 power with better fuel economy than the EcoBoost V6. Were you surprised GM was able to best you that way? How are you going to respond?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cxt54/i_am_jackie_dimarco_chief_engineer_for_the_ford/c9kz52g?context=5)|EcoBoost provides the best in class combination of power, capability, and fuel economy. Plus up to 90% of the EcoBoost engine's peak torque is available from 1700 RPM to 5000 RPM. A typical V8 reaches peak torque at higher engine speeds and holds it for much smaller range.

My advice to you: keep your grades up, get involved in student projects like Formula SAE, and pursue internships to get some real world experience. These are all things I did when I was a student that helped me get my foot in the door at Ford.
[What advice do you have to help me get my foot in the door as far as working for Ford once I graduate? Any inside secrets to give me an advantage over others?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cxt54/i_am_jackie_dimarco_chief_engineer_for_the_ford/c9kzyvv?context=5)|The Ford Careers site has information about internships and our Ford College Graduates program: [Link to corporate.ford.com](http://corporate.ford.com/careers/careers-news-detail/careers-ford-college-graduate-programs?&amp;ccode=US)

Over the 100+ years of Ford, we have developed very robust processes and specifications to guide our designs. The big part of our jobs is integrating what could be competing needs, like you mentioned. We run many cross-functional design reviews to ensure we strike the best balance for our customers. 
[Member of a ford/import divided family, here. Ms. DiMarco, just curious, what was your first vehicle? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cxt54/i_am_jackie_dimarco_chief_engineer_for_the_ford/c9kznws?context=5)|Mine was my grandmother's hand-me-down 1976 Buick LeSabre -- it was yellow and we called it the Banana Boat.

[Big Ford fan here, I love my 03 F150!  Now, my question. The Raptor has been out for a few years now, why haven't GM or Chrysler come up with anything similar?  And will there be a second generation Raptor?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cxt54/i_am_jackie_dimarco_chief_engineer_for_the_ford/c9kyyao?context=5)|Glad to hear you love your F-150!

I studied engineering in college and graduated from Ohio State.  After my MS, I came up to Detroit to work in powertrain engineering at Ford.
 |Over the past 17 years at the company I've worked in several areas from design, development, and manufacturing/launch.  I was thrilled 2 years ago when I was given the opportunity to lead the F-150.
[With a degree from Ohio State, you must have been loved in Detroit. I work for GM, so your kind of the enemy.  Off the record, I love the F-150.

I've owned several F-150s in the past, but the nice thing about my job is I can take one home whenever I want. Right now I'm driving a new 2013 Fusion Titanium. 
[Awesome AMA!  As an engineer, how do you prioritize certain vehicle features over others?  For example, horsepower versus fuel economy?  Do you have outside sources tell the engineering team what the marketplace has the highest demand for?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cxt54/i_am_jackie_dimarco_chief_engineer_for_the_ford/c9l0lws?context=5)|It's a combination of things: we take tons of data from our customers and run face to face research clinics on a regular basis, we also look at external publications like JD Power, Consumer Reports, and Truck Trend. In addition, we benchmark competition, and we use a little bit of gut feeling.

[Thanks for doing this AMA. How are things with the Ford Atlas coming along? I do hope the concept and released version design does not change much. I was very impressed with the new updated look.  I had a Ford Expedition for 10 years and drove it 288,000 miles before I got a newer Ford Expedition. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cxt54/i_am_jackie_dimarco_chief_engineer_for_the_ford/c9kyyxb?context=5)|We're thrilled with the response to the Atlas concept and our product team continues to listen to the feedback from people like you. Thanks so much for being a Ford Expedition owner - I work on that one too! Hope you'll get 300,000 miles out of the new one as well. 
[Thanks for keeping Dennis Leary employed, but I have to ask: why do your commercials all pretend that the people who buy trucks are all construction workers, when in reality most truck drivers are just buying into the ""truck driver lifestyle""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cxt54/i_am_jackie_dimarco_chief_engineer_for_the_ford/c9kzevw?context=5)|We have a wide range of customers and a wide range of vehicles to meet their needs from a base XL work truck to a premium Limited offering. Although not all of our customers are construction workers, they appreciate the ""built Ford tough"" capability of the truck and the fact that it can handle anything the construction worker throws at it.
 |This gives any customer confidence that their truck has capability for personal use (towing boats, motorcycles, etc). 
[How did you get to where you are professionally? Have you worked for Ford since graduating?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cxt54/i_am_jackie_dimarco_chief_engineer_for_the_ford/c9kzj43?context=5)|I gave a little background earlier: [Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cxt54/i_am_jackie_dimarco_chief_engineer_for_the_ford/c9kzu93)

even before the bullet points were added, it should have been obvious that this was either in some type of verse or that the line breaks meant something else.  

Also, the letter diversity is way off for it to be a cryptogram or something similar.  There are no m’s n’s g’s j’s u’s  and only one or two of multiple letters.  If it is a cryptogram it is a damn good one and  not one a mere redditor like you can solve.

Did I give you any hints?  I said that I cannot tell you how short or long the puzzle is.  This should be a glaring hint to you that the puzzle most likely is not how long or short you think it is.

There are plenty of close reading type stuff that will all end up with nothing, the answer is not really in the words.  There are plenty of repeating “words” (Pxve, Xax, and sxetz) that are worth mentioning but do not lead to anything interesting.

So, what other type of puzzle is it? It has definite lines, so look at all of the standard patterns.  

* First letter of every line? Nothing
* Last letter of every line? Nothing.
* Total amount of letters in every line? Clever, but you will get large numbers that go past the total number in the alphabet, and making them wrap around doesn’t give us anything good either.
* Any type of manipulation of the past answer? Nope.
* Total number of consonants in the lines? Same problem
* Total number of vowels in the lines?  Wait a minute.  This gives you 16,1,19,19 9,20  6,15,18,23,1,18,4 all of which are lower than 27

Substitute the numbers for letters and you get the phrase “PASS IT FORWARD”
And there we go.
The key is to look for any type of pattern no matter how strange it is and don’t be mad if it leads to nothing, just find another idea and run with it.
I didn’t say it was easy.  :)


well, that most likely disappointed you as it seemed so stupid of an answer, but now you know how i think, and the next ones make sure you keep an open mind for all types of patters, even stupid ones.


**next contest**

there is a safe that you must crack, the combination must be place on a digital number pad.  experts have looked at the mechanisms and declared that the length of the combination maybe any amount of digits, either 1 or 1000, or more, also there are many different working combinations that may work.  several other people have attempted and all failed, one was even killed when he entered ""42"". strange.  the only clue is this sheet of [paper](http://i.imgur.com/P4idr3k.png)  a lowly intern found.

I don't have a car and don't really have the funds to buy one either. I checked to see how much it would cost to rent a car for 3 months and prices were pretty outrageous for a broke college student. I asked my friends and family and even the company that I am interning with for help and they all basically said that I am on my own. There has to be a cheap and easy way for someone like me to obtain a car for an internship. I would deeply appreciate any input or suggestions. Thanks. 
1d8a5q,20,2013-04-27,"Currently doing bad in University. I feel lost and defeated, what must I do this summer to improve?",lakers222,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1d8a5q/currently_doing_bad_in_university_i_feel_lost_and/,"Hello, I just finished my 2nd year in University. I am 95% positive that I have failed one or two courses last semester which would bring me to retake them this summer. I've been in this spot before where I was in probation for having a 1.9 GPA (in my University, it's in effect if you are in between 1.0 to 1.9 GPA). After retaking a failed course during summer, my GPA got back up to 2.2. However, I think this summer might be different. I think my GPA will be lower than 1.9 so I might have to retake 2 courses. I don't mind retaking them and I'm positive I can get A's on two courses that I've taken before.    

However I don't have any money to pay for those courses. My student loan only gives loans if I have 60% of the full course load in a semester so it won't be possible to get a loan from them. My sister currently has a job, and she is willing to pay for one course, asking her to pay for two would be incredibly selfish. My father is unemployed, and my mother has a salary of ~$20k a year so I can't ask them either. I don't even know if I would have to take 1 or 2 courses, but best case scenario is I don't fail anything or I only fail 1. Worst case is I failed more than one.    

I'll have to look for a part-time job this summer in McDonalds or something so I could pay for those courses. I've never had a job in my entire life, so it might take awhile for me to find one because of lack of experience.    

Obviously I've never had internships before as well. I have terrible GPA so I don't even know if I should try to look for one. The co-op program in my school has a requirement of 3.0 GPA, which is next to impossible at this point.    

I don't know what's going to happen to me after University even if I go through all this. I have many reasons and excuses as to why I am doing bad in school, but I know some of you guys have been through worse, so I am not even going to bother putting them up.    

Realisticly the highest GPA I can get is 2.5, and I probably won't even have any job experience. So what's left for me is to improve my skillset.    

I've coded in atleast 5 programming languages in my life and I made games using Dream Maker when I was in grade 8. But clearly I still have A LOT to learn as my GPA shows it.  

I'm asking for advice on what I should work on this summer aside from getting a part-time job at McDonalds. For one, I know I have to work on my Data Structures fundamentals. I've had a chance to work with an Arduino last semester, and I still have the Arduino materials so I probably will do another project this summer. What else must I do in order to be prepared from here on out?     




I have no intention of dropping or giving up on Computer Science.

That's not all though.,anabolic_man,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1d89py/im23m_dating_a_girl21f_who_recently_visited_her/,"So I've been getting close with this girl the last couple of months, but I recently moved abroad for an internship and will be back home in a few weeks (not a LDR or anything, just 2 months away). Anyway we actually really started getting intimate since I moved, talking over the phone etc, and we kind of informally initiated a gf-bf thing and that we should start seeing eachother when I get back. Kind of weird, I know.

Anyway so she used to have a relationship with this guy (her only previous bf) who she broke up with and then back on again quite a few times. Even on our first date she couldn't stop mentioning him. That was one of the reasons I stopped seeing her like two years ago. It was only recently (3 months ago) that we started seeing each other again and she really seemed to have gotten over him. We got very intimate over the phone, very personal conversations etc. Then, last week all of a sudden, one evening she doesn't say anything. Which is kinda unusual, because she always messages me on the evening. The next morning she has a pic she took at her ex's house on her facebook page. Like 8am in the morning. On weekday. Call me paranoid but I immediately assumed she spend the night at her ex's house.

I didn't ask her about this because I don't want to come off as insecure or paranoid. The funny thing is, after she had posted the pic she didn't initiate convo a whole day and a half. Which is totally abnormal considering she sent me a message around the clock the 2 months prior that.

If she did have sex with her ex, officially it wouldn't be cheating - because we're not officially in a relationship yet. Did she need the attention and I wasn't around, and that's why she went to him?

I NEVER dated a girl before who was still seeing her ex. So I'm really a noob when it comes to this. Any kind of help/comment would be helpful..thanks!"

We can't make it a full week without arguing about something and I love her to death but feel like I'm giving and giving without getting anything in return.

Whenever we discuss things about her life (work, school, etc) I will always try to enthusiastically support her.  In some cases she tends to be overly dramatic on the situation (I am definitely the optimist of the relationship) and when I offer a point she disagrees with it's greeted by this horrible look on her face and I'm then told that I have an ""agenda"" or that I'm trying to push her into doing something she doesn't want.

THis is completely untrue, and I've tried evaluating how I say things numerous times to see if I could come of more tame on the subject, but I honestly don't feel as though I'm being aggressive.  I feel as though I'm going crazy and I always get depressed when it happens because I feel as though we're supposed to be a team but I always feel like the enemy.

I'm also going to be supporting her as she is approaching a point in her life where she has to quit her job for an internship.  As it is now, the house I own costs $1,100 a month not including any utilities.  I am paying that, all utilities, and her phone bill and in return charging her $600 a month.  We both feel that is fair, and prior to that I only charged her $400 a month when she was down on her luck.  Now, as we talk about lowering her rent again, I'm being told that I tend to sway back and forth and I get the sense she is doubting me.

Again, her doubting me is horribly painful as I already feel like I'm being overly accomodating while being under appreciated.  I do admit there was a vacation we went on where I thought we were splitting up the hotel bill differently and I think it pissed her off which she is still holding on to resentment to.

Finally, just recently I admittadly pulled a dick move.  There's a female friend of mine that I had previously fooled around with years ago.  We remained friends ever sense but we have an emotional connection (completely platonic) due to being in similar lines of work and having similar interests.  I know this girl is threatening to my gf and I agreed not to let it be an element in our relationship.  Well I broke and started emailing her secretly and the gf found them.  They were from months ago and there was only a small handful, and nothing inappropriate was said in them, but I did lie to her in the fact I told her I wouldn't communicate with this person.  This has led to severe mistrust which hurts because I could never fathom cheating on her.  

I am completely lost and just overall feeling depressed.  Today is beautiful out and I asked her if we could just spend the day being happy together and working on things but she unfortunately had plans to see her mom and told me she'd ""play it by ear"" for later.  I feel nothing but coldness from her at the moment and I don't know what to do.

Am I being overly sensitive on all of this?  Or maybe I'm just clueless to my own actions that are pissing her off.   Either way I am unhappy and just want things to be normal.

TL;DR:  Relationships suck"

During one internship, I ended up using non-prescription glasses on top of my head to keep my hair back (as if I normally wore them but kept them up sometimes). 

Side note: If there are other curly / longer curly haired guys that are interested in treatment, cuts and/or products, I'd be happy to answer questions on that... maybe make an infographic – there's a shortage of curly advice. I've found it elsewhere.

1d7xgo,3,2013-04-27,My first throwaway....I need help,[deleted],bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1d7xgo/my_first_throwawayi_need_help/,"Okay,  I am in a huge state of depression.  

I have never felt inclined to write under a throwaway before, but the things that I really feel just do not belong on real account. Please note that this is just a flow of thoughts.  Things may be very scattered,  I am kind of emotional. 

**Background:**  The past semester I have been trying to maintain a positive outlook on life, though I have had mild swings throughout the semester.  The past month or so I have just been rapid cycling as the stress from school increases.  Around three weeks ago I was in the floor in almost a state of shock from the depression.  I actually hurt myself a little by hitting my head against the side of the couch,  when the depression hits the pressure in my head is really intense causing migraines.  After this period I was up, and I mean way up.  I am a designer, and the quality of my work is better than it has ever been.  Things were going really well, but I kept telling myself in private that I was going to crash.  

**The Trigger:** After this manic state where I effectively had myself believing that my work was some of the best, and I had really gotten into learning my subject, I walk into class on Thursday.  (I had applied for an internship that I really wanted a few weeks prior,  I worked most of my semester trying for this one internship.)  On Thursday I arrive at class to find out that the interviews were on that day, and mine was in 20 min.  I guess my mania kind of kicked in at that moment, I was able to run 1.5 miles to the interview location.  I arrived and thought I did okay in the interview (at the time, due to the mania), but looking back I think I looked insane.  The burst of adrenaline combined with my mania had me feeling good, like I needed to go sky diving kinda good.

**Today:**  I received an email saying that I was not accepted, though I put more effort than most into this position.  Honestly, this small part of me is totally fine with this outcome.  It gives me more free time this summer.  However,  now the depression is back.  It has came on hard,  I find myself doing my usual (weird) talking to myself thing.  I will keep saying die, die , die.  It is really becoming to much.  It is like my two sides are constantly fighting for control.  

**Feelings:** I just wish I was normal sometimes.  I wish that I could just cry, come to terms with things, and move on, but no I have to be this kid who wants to find the nearest dark corner and hide in it.  I do not see myself as suicidal, so why do I keep saying die, just end it, fuck it?  I actually had a civil discussion with myself today. I realized that maybe I do not want to die, I just want that person inside of me dead.  That nagging voice that is always there telling me how horrible I am, how bad at things I am.  (The voice that is usually confirmed through others, because my communication skills and ability to relate to others really really sucks. My ideas are sometimes right and justified down to the smallest details, but no one has the time to sit around and wait on me to figure out how to verbalize it.)  Anyway,  I decided to shave my head today in some symbolic death of the depression.  I told myself that suicide is illogical, and that I needed to get back up and move on.  I am still kind of in a state where I just want to cry.  I just want that piece of my subconscious to leave me alone.

This is like a war, that no one but my SO really knows is going on inside of my head.  He really helps me, but there is only so much he can do. 

**Medications**: If there are any questions on what I am taking to cope I will give you the run down.  I have been on lithium in my past, but I was going to the free clinic where I essentially became a number.  I was prescribed Lithium, and was on it for about a year.  I slipped up and forgot a session, this kicked me out of the system.  They told me that in order to regain my status as a patient I would have to come at 6 in the morning, to a town 2 hours away, and wait in line to re-register as a new patient.  This line usually takes around 3 hours with some terrifying people.  I have not be able to make it back.  Though the lithium was causing me nausea and headaches anyway...  Mostly because it require food for each dose, and as a college kid, I really do not have the money for much food.  I took no medication for around another year, and kept away from most stressful situations.  I even began meditating.  Now we come to today,  to cope with the stress I smoke weed.  1-2 times bowls per day, nothing major. Though it helps me be positive and stay productive.  

**TLDR:** I am really depressed, and need some help."

How to advance?",gosurobber,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1d7s2k/been_reading_books_for_3_year_met_intern_who_is_a/,"Wow, I just want to say it feels so liberating and addictive. New intern came (my age too, 24 years old), and by some stroke of luck I have PM'd him a long time ago on some forum about a PUA seminar he gives.  He found out when we exchanged numbers during lunch.

So, my first guided tour was after work, and I opened 4 girls (I do have AA, but I am quite used to interviewing people due to my job).

Of course, no #-closes but it feels fantastic to finally do it instead of keep glancing at the girl while she disappears from my life.

PUA-intern wasnt free after that, so for the past 2 days I went out myself to just approach girls having watched the lessons on SimplePickup. Previously I have been reading Mystery Method and I do agree with some concepts but it seems like alot of people are recommending a direct ""you are cute"" style. 

I approached 5 girls today (could have been a few more but I had sudden AA due to distance) and I realize I suck at conversation. I opened with ""Hi, you are cute so I had to talk to you"" but after asking their name, I just totally forget how to direct the conversation. I tried to address my shortcomings during the end of today's session but I totally screwed it up.

I opened a HB7 wearing a tube giving out fliers, and (only students do this kind of job) so after introductions I made a statement that she looked like a student on a part time job. It was true but boring as shit, and initially I wanted to talk random stuff (if you are a video game character, would you choose to have better weapons or armour?) but I forgot and straight away asked her what time she knocked off and if she wants to go on a date, which she rejected. At this point, another mistake was not staying longer to chat and I bid her farewell immediately.

Another approach today was even worse, I opened a HB6 and after introductions, I just said thanks and walked off. FAIL man, fail.

Do you guys have any tips on being good at talking random stuff? And and paths of learning progress that I can take?

TLDR; Introvert dude finally takes leap. Found it addiciting but suck at conversation. He also feels slightly horrible when blown off but all is better when he recalls seeing his own experienced friends and youtube PUA getting blown off too."

I got admitted into UIUC for CS (would have put ECE if I had done some more research beforehand, but I learned about Illinois literally the day before apps were due from a friend of mine. I hear the courses are the same anyway, any thoughts?). EECS @ Berkeley.

I would have chosen Berkeley right out of the gate if 20 of my friends from my school weren't going there (kinda want a fresh start) and if I actually liked the area around the campus (fwiw I don't like California in general either).

Financial aid is roughly the same, looking at 5k/yr subsidized loans for Berkeley and around 4.7k for UIUC.

How's engineering here as opposed to Berkeley? I keep getting opposing opinions on how good the program is. I know that it is good, but is there a significant difference as opposed to Berkeley?

Weather? When I visited it was almost freezing (in large part thanks to the wind) and the rain and thunderstorms on the way back to O'Hare was just terrible. Definitely not used to it after living in California for 17 years. However, the weather at that time might have been an outlier, so some confirmation on this would be nice.

Job prospects post-undergrad? I don't plan on going for a master's. Berkeley would naturally have an advantage here due to its location in the Bay Area. Should I be concerned about this? I plan on working as a software developer. Also, internships.

Anything to do on weekends/off days around campus and Champaign/Urbana? Berkeley is close to SF, which has tons of stuff to do (*though traffic is annoying and I don't really like the area tbh*).

How hard is it to get classes? Is this even a concern? The budget crises happening in CA are concerning, and the whole Prop 30 thing is just a band-aid, not to mention even higher sales taxes. I have no idea what the situation is here.

Social life? Diversity in student population? Don't intend to join a frat but that might change. Traditionally an introvert but that's been changing recently. Of course, being in engineering might make this question a useless one to ask xD

Also interested in mentoring a FRC team if there is one nearby.

Finally, a seemingly random question, but how good is service for Verizon and T-Mobile? Any LTE on Verizon? HSPA+ on T-Mobile? I am a very heavy data user and tether frequently (jailbroken iPhone 4 on Verizon unlimited data - will replace with a new phone - and rooted GN2 on T-Mobile prepaid $30/mo).

I don't want to go on medication, as I want to deal with my issues through gradual exposure. However, I can't solve my issues in a week. 

So my question is: is it a good idea to go the doctor and ask for some drugs to help me this once? Would I get a prescription for this? Is there medication that can be effective without making me incoherent, with no time for my body to adjust?

I am finishing my engineering degree about 1,000 miles away from my hometown. We met while I was working for a local firm and living with my family. I made it clear to her that I was not looking for anything serious. We got along really well and ended up spending a lot of time together over the summer.  

She's never really left the state, considers herself to be an aspiring artist and works full-time (for basically min. wage) as a florist. 
I've done a fair amount for my age: took 4 years off between high school and uni to work and travel.

Despite my initial hesitation, I decided to bring her with my on my end-of-summer road/hiking trip.  The trip went amazing.  I've heard the relationship advice: ""take her in the woods for a week and see what happens. that is a true test.""  Well for someone who has never camped really, she climbed some 14,000 ft peaks like a boss. 

Anyway, the day before I'm leaving town to return to school, she asks me with teary eyes if I'll wait for her (not sleep with anyone) until Xmas.   I can't say no to that face.  I try to pretend it's what I want too but I've told her it's not.  Anyway, we make it through. 

Fast forward to present and I'm about to move to a new state to start a 3 month engineering internship. She really wants to come and live with me so that we can be together physically.  I personally think that it is a bad idea for her to quit her job and move to a new place with nothing lined up.  She has bills to pay...

I like this girl a lot but I am not in love with her.  I think she's super sweet and has such innocence.  I am somewhat of a loner and like my solitude.  Assuming she can find a job, I know that we can make the summer work and that I can show her a really enjoyable time.  However, I will be leaving again (out of country) to finish the last year of my degree and I don't really want to spend another year in a distance relationship.  I really detest distance relationships... I think we should cultivate relationships with those physically present. 

Lastly, I am the center of my own universe and when I graduate, I don't really want to have to consider anyone else but myself in determining where I go and what I do (my job prospects are good). 

Should I split up with her now to avoid breaking her heart in August???
I care about her but I think she's a lot more serious than I am..."

So I am a computer engineering major and about a month and a half ago I got this amazing internship.  I can't go into detail or anything because of NDA stuff, but I can say this: It is a small startup, I feel like I am making stuff from a sci-fi movie, and it is amazing.

So anyway, I've been working there for ~1.5 months and I've been very successful.  Today they hired another Intern to work in the same area I am working in.  My boss and some of my co-workers gave the intern was given a basic overview of the system he will be designing and gave him a recommendation of parts.  My boss then told him to go research the parts in detail, look at ones offered by competitors, and to work on fleshing out the design.  

My boss asked me to go to him at the end of the day and to look over his work.  All he had done was redraw what we gave him earlier nicely on the computer.  When I asked him for details about the chips or how parts worked, he had no idea.  He did not research any other parts, how he was going to implement the software, or anything really.  I honestly have no clue what he did all day.

And that is what I told my boss.  Based off of my observations y boss fired the intern and now I feel like a dick.  


tl;dr: Told boss a new hire wasn't doing good work when asked, he was sacked, I feel like a dick."

We are from the same area and it didn't start out as a LDR, but has been for several months as she finishes college. We've known for a while that she would be going to a one-year grad program starting in the fall. It's not perfect, but it reduces the distance from ~3000 to ~300. 

Recently, she was given an opportunity for a summer internship, and she couldn't really afford to pass it up. The company is going to be shuffling her around a lot, so I can't move with her. She'll be starting school immediately after the internship ends, so it seems I won't get any time with her this summer. This has really taken a bite out of my will to fight for this thing. To clarify a few things:

-I love her more than anything, and I know she loves me.

-There are no problems between us.

-I cannot move without pressing the reset button on the last few years of my life.

The nagging thought that won't go away is that there is no place for me in her life right now. I don't want to talk to her about it, because I know this is very hard for her as well and that she would be with me if she could. I was devastated when she told me about the job, but I told her I was happy for her because I knew she had to take it. Even after her grad school, the chances seem slim that she will end up working near where I live. I am proud of her for succeeding, but it seems our lives are drifting further and further apart, and I can't help but wonder if this is the right thing to do when we might just end up wanting what we can't have for months or even years to come. Any thoughts/idea/comments/concerns are appreciated.

I have worked retail jobs since 15.  Currently i work at a bakery and I enjoy my mediocre living.  I just finished an internship at a great PR company. Bf is a stoner computer geek from a well to do family. Not to say I don't appreciate him. I adore him.  He just got his A.A. and got a job at a Microsoft data center through his brother's connections.  He works hard and is well respected.  He makes a little more than me but that's not an issue.  That is where we are. Then this happens:

I just got to second round interviews with a well reputed PR agency, but didn't get the job.  He is about to have a second interview for a HUGE promotion.  It would mean this gap in our success would grow so big.  I hate to admit it, but I am so angry.  I am happy that he is doing so well, but i keep spinning my wheels and all his goals are being given to him on a platter.  

How can I support him when I am feeling so...left behind?  I want to be successful, pay off my debt, and spoil him.  But now I barely get by and all the doors are slamming in my face.  I know I should be happy, but I'm just sad.  Thanks for reading.

1d78qd,2,2013-04-27,"We're both 18M, He's in Perth, I'm in Mankato.

Well... that's kind of what happened. He ended up messaging me on IRC, and we started talking and going from there. We can be both extremely depressing people so at first we though there's no way this is going to work. I tried to push that long-distance relationships can work, and have. I started asking questions, as he will tell you, lots of them-- so within a short period of time it felt like I was really comfortable with him. We like similar music, tv shows, and movies. He's big into gaming and geeky things, and I have always hated playing alone; I finally have someone who won't judge me when I freak out on the 2nd testing level of Portal that I can't figure out how to jump properly.

We have intentions of going into similar careers so I guess that's a huge bonus. We're both in school in a sense; he's in a traineeship (somewhat of an internship I guess), and I'm transferring out of my liberal arts college to get an Networking Services degree. I can ask him about IT stuff when I can't sleep, or talk to him when I wake up at 3am with a god awful nightmare and am unwilling to wake up my roommate. He listens to my ramblings and rantings about my incompatibility with general humans. We already share a Netflix account and he's sent me several games on steam already. (I've played one, and I've been thoroughly infuriated by it as puzzles annoy me to no end, and Portal is a puzzle-like game.) I plan to hopefully somehow return the favour of something like this. 

My birthday is coming up soon, and he has repeatedly offered to send me things. He's a very generous person and I've made sure this isn't just for me, he has said that he does this with all of his friends so it's not just a me thing. I pointed him first to the ever present amazon, but being the nerdy weirdo that I am, he settled on thinkgeek. I love some of the presents that he has hinted at so far; if that's any indication of the others, I think he is either a brilliant facebook stalker or just scarily accurate at predicting what I like as far as interests. 

While I have always continually lurked and stalked the IRC chatrooms of /r/gaymers (and their offshoots), I have never really felt like a gaymer--it feels so strange saying that word--because I've always played video games either alone or with my brother, and we don't get a long much on this playing field. 

We end up sometimes skyping for upwards of 4 hours or more. (**thank god for college internet**) and I repeatedly apologize (I don't know, minnesota nice or something) for taking up too much of his time. He asks why I apoligized and shrug because I honestly have no clue. We talk about the most random stuff, or just end up browsing reddit together and linking each other stuff we find: cute, funny, wtf, or any combination thereof. I complain a lot and can sometimes be outrageously self-deprecating. If this annoys him, he's a saint and doesn't show it in the slightest. I talk about how I want a future as an it somethingorother, with an apartment in a city where there's a decent gay community. We end up asking each other a lot of questions such as:

* Pride Parades: **Let's go**/Meh, maybe a few events/Can we stay home please
* Do you like trying new things?
* Is it fine for me to watch porn while in a relationship with you?
* Do you like camping?
* Live in the city or the country?

I like asking him questions because it lets me know the things we can do together, the things I shouldn't bring up, the things he's willing to try (or not), the things he shouldn't try with me. I told him about my past and about my experiences with other people, something you're usually supposed to stay away from (and to be fair, he started it :P) He's a really sensitive guy, who I think just wanted to find someone that shared the same interests as him. I wanted someone who was in to geeky stuff (which I'd found before) but didn't roll his eyes at me when I asked what a SATA bridge was. 

We've made an entire list of games we should play together, movies we should watch, TV series we should follow together. We're just working on how to plan everything. I'm starting to learn that is the key to almost everything. (I'm good with timezones now! Thanks google!) We've had 2 movie dates; via Netflix and a Skype voice call. I talk during movies (not in a theatre though :x) but he doesn't seem to mind it. He seems to put up with my weird ramblings and sometimes blatantly 9gag-esque meme usage. If he's annoyed he doesn't show it. As of now, I'd wish for few things to change other than the Skype notification tone to stop playing in my head at random moments, and for us to have better cam quality and reception. I like seeing his face the opportunities I've got (there hasn't been many.)

We started almost immediately to rush headlong into things, as cheesy as it sounds, it feels eerie and fun to be this close and in common with someone. I'm not sure about him, but I fully anticipate a coming storm; I'm doing to my best to avoid that, but as someone who is an aspie and has trouble reading facial expression and tonal inflections **when I can see people** it's sometimes hard to get the message across. He seems not to care much when I mess things up. 

Recently, today in fact, I had a massive self-pity attack (we all have them, admit it to yourselves) and I was rather vocal about it with him as well as several other people who were unfortunate enough to be stuck on an IRC connection with the sad sac that was me. I was pissed off about my inability to grow a beard at a typical age of my family (they typically have full facial hair by 18-19) and an article on /r/science^[?] He comforted me by listing off of some source--I didn't bother to ask--the archetypal masculine features of the human body. 

Speaking of stuff that he's put up with, I'm american, but when I get tired or excited or just plain weird, I start to have a over-the-top exaggerated BBC accent that sounds fake to probably most of the UK and most BBC america people. He put up with it and started chuckling at one point. I stopped in raw embarrassment, I mean... he was fucking laughing at me. He must've caught on to this because he apologized but just that it's just so striking. (Not his words) 

He was not open about his gay side (he's bi) before me, he said--in Skype chat I believe--that he's going to say that he's bi now... that I'm the reason. I somehow have managed to turn a ""straight"" Aussie boy into a bi guy, I honestly have no words for this. 

More on his gaymer thing, he talked me into playing World of Warcraft with him this summer when we're not working and when we can catch each other. I was extremely hesitant, not only for it's infamous reputation for being addictive and because of it's association that (I had at least) with apparently unrelated games like CoD. He said that he wants to turn me into *casual* gaymer (he's not a hardcore type, nor am I)

We've spent at least several hours going on tumblr, pintrest and /r/LadyBoners clones looking at hot guys, and then linking them in the Skype chat. We have similar yet different taste in guys. He likes girls more evenly than I do, I'm just not attracted to them the same way. We like the same kind of food and we want to learn how to cook. We share dropbox folders, one of which is--if printed--a tome of a cookbook of Moroccan/Indian/Spanish cooking. He seems up for it. 

We're not clones, although we're close enough for it to have it's ""get out of my head"" moments. We like and dislike similar IT/geek things. We disagree on things, but we can't agree on everything (it's a matter of statistics firstly.) He listens to my linguistic ramblings and useless knowledge. I like hearing about all of things that go on in his life. 

While we're not perfect; I am not, he is neither. I go to bed (nearly) every day wishing he was next to me. Cheesy as it sounds, he's in my dreams. He's in a lot of my thoughts. He has the usually cynical an nihilistic me looking at job listings to try to gauge the future (what it'll look like and such) and trying to figure out where's the geekiest gay neighbourhood we can find. He doesn't mind that I am an american who uses UK/non-US spelling, I doubt that hardly passed his mind. It's wierd that thinking the retort that I used against my parents painfully optimistic, ""there's someone for everyone"" ""Yeah, but he's across the planet and probably speaks mandarin."" 我喜爱您 (I love^? you) I understand that we're young, and this is foolish to feel this way; let us be foolish and naïve then, at least we're happy that way.

I graduated about 5 years ago from an excellent (if not very top tier) liberal arts college, with a degree only slightly better than an English major, and not in anything I want to pursue for a career.

With no other plans straight out of college, I decided to move to another state to be closer to my then-boyfriend, whom I'd been dating long-distance for two years. We lived together and dated for two more before splitting up, and in that time, I worked for a coffee shop and then more long-term as an administrative assistant for a non-profit where I was very unhappy, but at least way more employed and salaried than most other people I knew who graduated into the shitstorm that was the 2008 economy. I quit that job after a little over a year, when they decided the physical office needed to be relocated to a place that would've stuck me with a ~90 minute commute each way, and after that I never found another job in that state. I did a brief stint in massage school, which I liked, but quit half way through the program because I hated living there and the relationship didn't work out. I moved back in with my parents and decided not to finish the program because in the first state, a massage license only takes 6 months, and in the state I moved home to, it takes two years. I didn't love massage enough or think the likely earnings would be worth staying in school for that long.

I've always been a writer in one way or another, so I decided to try my hand at that, working my way up through internships and eventually landing a paid part-time position as an assistant editor for a small arts newspaper. After a year and a half, the company I was getting most of my work from (the arts paper) sort of went underwater, there were NO opportunities for growth, I was making virtually nothing, and my bosses were possibly clinically insane, so when I heard about an opportunity to be a regularly paid barista, I took it. I worked my way quickly up to supervisor, and did that mostly full time for over a year. During that time, I even got a few other freelance writing gigs on the side, some of which were for well-known tabloids and paid very well, and I got a second interview at a major tabloid, but didn't get the job. I was also doing some freelance online tutoring, which paid ok but annoyed me because the volume of work was inconsistent -- it'd be dead for weeks, and then a ton of stuff would come up EXACTLY when I had the least time to get it done -- so I can still do that part-time if I want, but I've been on hiatus for a while, still in good standing with the company.

(Also I should mention that I have always filled my resume gaps with volunteer non-profit work, so there's some experience there as well, particularly with women's health and the arts. But as far as I can tell, I love volunteering at non-profits but hate the actual experience of working at them, at least in any kind of fundraising or general administrative capacity.)

After almost 5 years of being all over the place, I finally have a full time job that pays *kind* of decently and comes with overtime and benefits, and for the time being, I really like it. The stuff I see at work is VERY interesting and not something I would ever see anywhere else, so it's going to give me a lot of material when I write my memoir someday, but my talents go completely un-utilized. A sober monkey with a clean driving record could do what I do, except when the phone rings I guess, and there is absolutely no room for growth in this field unless I get a license I don't want, to do work I don't like, for not very much of a raise.

My parents are academics, and they keep saying I should just ""get a graduate degree,"" which they would pay for, but they never say in *what* and I'm SO not keen on having them support me for the next several years while I work on that. And while I know lots of people work full time and make grad school happen, that idea scares the shit out of me, especially when it's just this vague notion of going to school for I have no idea what and I'm not that excited about it. The two options that sort of stick out in my head if I DID go to school are Journalism school, which has NO guarantees, and becoming a Physical Therapist, which would take me like 5-6 years or so.

I loved working at the coffee shop, because I loved the non-stop action, being face to face and chatting with other people all the time, and I loved being on my feet and not having to constantly worry that I'd re-gain the 30 lbs I lost after my breakup. I loved working as a journalist too, but is a graduate degree in journalism really worth anything? And if not, how else does one go about finding a decent paying job in the field? Because that's another thing, the same parents putting all this pressure on me to go back to school are also the ones who raised me with a ridiculously high standard of living which I would love to maintain for myself but really have no clue how. I hate myself for being spoiled and privileged and I want to earn my own place in the world, but I don't know what to do next, and I'm closer to 30 than 20 and I want to scream.

My big fantasy is that I work another 6 months at this job so that it's an even year, then hop on a plane to Southeast Asia, wander the world for 6-12 months on the cash I've saved up this year (I'm living at home with my parents and saving a fortune), and then either I come back and everything has magically worked itself out, or I just never come back because I found my island paradise or whatever shit. This part is also hard because leaving for that long would mean leaving behind my loving current boyfriend of 2 years, who is in about the same career shape as me, except with no money or parents to fall back on. POOR ME BOO HOO WAH MY LIFE IS SO HARD.

Please help. And please don't berate me for being a poor little rich girl, because I already know and that only makes me feel more anxious and awful about myself. Just tell me what to do to feel like my life is kind of in order? That's impossible isn't it. But I mean, just try? Please?

**TL;DR: Poor little rich girl (26yo) having a panic attack about becoming an adult. Please help.**

I have looked for the last couple of weeks and I've had a hard time finding anywhere close to viable. Any help, whether it be tips on housing, transportation, or anything that would help him would be greatly appreciated. 

Here are some points of his situation:

* Internship is in the Edenvale area of San Jose
* Bike distance &lt; 30 minutes, bus &lt;1 hr, walking &lt; 30 minutes - He won't have a car so he needs to be somewhat close to the Edenvale area
* He's ok with having roommates
* Internship start date May 21, 2013 and flying in May 13-15 and he said he'll probably be working there till December
* Contract: month to month (preferred) or 3-month
* Max rent per month: $1500 with base utilities
* Somewhat furnished would be nice, but not necessary

I realize these are pretty lofty goals when it comes to housing in that area, but he's not having any luck and it's coming down to the wire and he needs to find something as soon as possible. Hopefully since you guys know the area you may have some insight. Any info would be helpful. He may be able to live at SJSU for the summer, but will still need a place once the summer semester ends."
1d6sxu,29,2013-04-26,Where would you expect a recent CS graduate to fall in the Programmer Competency Matrix?,temp007,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1d6sxu/where_would_you_expect_a_recent_cs_graduate_to/,"I am talking about [this](http://www.indiangeek.net/wp-content/uploads/Programmer%20competency%20matrix.htm) that was linked in a recent question on this subreddit.

**Background:**

I remember reading this chart in my first and second year of CS course and being happy about seeing progress from 2^n to n^2 and in some areas even n. But I feel that I haven't progressed much since I finished my second year of the course. I have focused on AI, Machine Learning, Robotics, and theoretical CS subjects in my third year. The focus was not on good programming practices and improving those, but getting the damn things to work as they should and as well as they could in short deadlines. I am currently doing a masters completely focused on NLP and very research heavy, so there is little programming at all. I have done internships every summer and continued working throughout the year in my second and third year of my undergraduate degree. The final internship in the third year of the course was at a research focused group at university, and focus again was not on good practices but prototyping stuff and getting it to work as well as it could.

I am currently deciding between doing a PhD or going into industry. I recently had a phone interview with a big-4 company for a software engineering position. Since it went okay I might be invited to an interview. However, upon rereading this chart after two years, my heart sank. I feel borderline incompetent, scoring lower in some areas than I used to because I forgot some things as well.

Overall, I got a split of:

* 3 level 2^n
* 15 level n^2
* 5 level n

ignoring the knowledge section as it's a bit specific for positions you are applying/interviewing for.

I am now contemplating rejecting the interview all together if I am invited to avoid embarrassing myself. While I could review some of the material beforehand, I do not have the time to brush up on most of the missing pieces."

What should I do with my time off?,[deleted],compsci,https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/1dasy9/i_might_have_a_year_off_what_should_i_do_with_my/,"So I was planning on going to UVA for Fall Semester, but I got waitlisted. I thought it was pretty much guaranteed due to an agreement with my community college, but for some reason I didn't get it. I'm going to talk to an advisor on Monday and the assistant dean at UVA about this, but in the mean time I'm pondering about what I can do for the future. 

Say I do get waitlisted, and I don't get into UVA for fall. There is a two year grace period after I get my associates at my Community College, and I'm pretty sure I'm guaranteed during those two years. I will check to make sure, but I'm almost certain. 

There are some things I can do:

I can a) Wait a year, and go to UVA. This is what I'm leaning towards because I spent the last year doing it solely for this, but apparently I didn't get it. And I love the school of UVA, and it also has a good computer science program. If I do this option, what can I do during this time to increase my stock as a CS major? Should I get an internship or a job? I am planning on doing other things to help the other areas of my life(basketball and writing).

or I could go b ) and go back to George Mason. That's where I originally went to, but I really don't want to go there. I just did not enjoy my time there, and based on academic standings, UVA blows GMU out of the water. I've done a year and a half at GMU, so I'd have to do the same amount of credits at each school(UVA or GMU), but GMU would be done quicker. 

What would you recommend? "
1dasmj,2,2013-04-28,"Day ???, Ramblings, and an ex-GF story",WhenInRome20,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1dasmj/day_ramblings_and_an_exgf_story/,"I've been thinking about posting for a long time on here but decided now was best. I have been fapping since about 15 when I first discovered online porn. I am 23 now and I have gone through some major experiences the last year which really made me re-evaluate myself. Right now I am on a streak of noFap of about 6-7 months. I didnt keep track when I first started and have lost count. I am doing what some on here call ""hard-mode"" where I'm not having sex or doing any other sexual activity. I don't ever plan on relapsing, or looking at porn again. I'm sharing this because I believe it will help myself on some level and might encourage some of you to rethink if fapping is worth it.  

**What made me take on the NoFap Challenge:**

I had a girlfriend for the past 3 years and I broke it off with her last October. She was extremely beautiful and extremely smart, the type you could settle down with. Anyway, toward the end of the last year I started to have doubts in my mind. I wasn't feeling the extreme highs of joy like I had in the past with her and with the lack of happiness I started to begin doubting our relationship and if I would be ready to commit my life to another person. I think what played a major role in this feeling was porn. I strongly believe that the chemicals that used to go off in my head when I was with her were being continously faded by the use of porn. The day I broke up with her is the day that I decided porn would not control my life or be an obstacle to my happiness.

After about 2 months I started to ""reboot"" and feel those extreme high and low sensations once again. With this new found outlook I started to realize what was going on with my addiction and how much of my life it has affected. I realized that I was fapping to deal with stress and anxiety which helped in the short term but really messed with my life in the long term. I realized what a horrible mistake I had made losing this girl and right now am dealing with losing her. The good thing about this all happening is that I have learned what I need to make myself happy. I don't rely on porn or anybody else now. 

**Some of the benefits I have seen:**      

- Increase in energy
- Increase in wanting to socialize
- The feeling of just general happiness(I hadn't felt this in a very long time)
- It felt like there was this fog or something else over my emotions and thinking which I can think clearly and feel more now.
- Increased motivation
- Many others, the above are just the main ones

**Where I am now:**

I am doing considerably better in a lot of aspects in my life since starting no fap. I had just been hired for an internship, I only have one semester left to complete my degree and I feel like I have the confidence that I can accomplish anything. Working out and getting in shape has become a staple in my daily routine. As far as the ex-GF from above I'm not sure if we will ever get back together, she has taken me out of her life, but maybe we can reconcile soon.

I had just signed up for a nofap badge so I'm going to start my counter now. I will most likely stop ""hard-mode"" when I find the right person again but I'm just focusing on other parts of my life. 

**Some stuff to help others:**

- A big problem I had always had with relapsing was getting out of the first week. You have to stop the mindset of ""well I fapped yesterday so I can just start tomorrow"" STOP NOW!

- Use porn-blockers as an assistance not as starting point. Personal motivation to stop has to come first. I had uninstalled my porn-blockers so many times to get around them.
- Don't make NoFap the center of your life. Start working out, get hobbies, get out of the house. NoFap can be one goal, but make sure it isn't the only one.

- NoFap doesn't have an end. Around the 3-4 month point I had a realization that I could never go back to the old ways. This scared the crap out of me at first. Porn had been a part of my life for the past 7 years. How could I live without it? I hope you will all reach this point eventually and know that it is all worth it.

- Don't ever edge. I watch Game of Thrones, Spartacus, and rated-R movies without worrying because I am watching for the entertainment value not to fap. I figure if my main motivation of looking at something is ""the naked chicks"" then I don't need to be watching it.

Whenever I get to a year of NoFap I will give you guys an update on everything. Thanks for letting me share all of this with you guys.

In the phone call the guy said he loved her...and she told me that if the guy came to visit her during the summer that she would end up fucking him regardless of how happy we were together.
I flipped, and we agreed we should end the relationship after less than a week of officially dating. But we still hung out and were still super close.

You’ll be hustling and pushing directly with the two co-founders. Sometimes things will be awesome, and sometimes they’ll suck. We need you to bring focus to your work, a willingness to debate ideas, and most of all, you can’t be afraid.

From the very beginning you’ll be pushing code and contributing to product decisions. Since you’ll be moving fast, you have to arrive already understanding our business and our market.

Everyone does a little bit of everything, and you should be no different. You absolutely need to be a hacker, and you should also have good business acumen, a passion for tech, and a sense of design.

Unlike a typical startup hacker, you’ll have two major benefits: 1) Limited risk of failure, and 2) you’ll get paid.

1dahj8,1,2013-04-28,How screwed am I next fall?,Aerodynamics,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1dahj8/how_screwed_am_i_next_fall/,"Hey everyone,

I made an earlier post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1a37vg/when_to_follow_up_on_an_internship/) about an internship I interviewed for. Well, yesterday I was told that I did not get the position. I applied for dozens of internships and this was the only company to call me for an interview. So now I am going into Senior year with no industry experience.

How will this go over when I talk to companies about jobs in the fall? Will my resume automatically get tossed? I have a good GPA (3.7) and some work experience (Diff Eq TA) but that's about it. I have several recommendations locked down, but I am just worried about being completely ignored for having no industry experience or being talked down to in interviews because of it. The ""what can you bring to the table?"" question will eventually come up to which I have no good response. 

Sorry if I'm coming off frantic here, I'm just super stressed/depressed about this whole situation. Any advice or insights into what I can do next fall?"
1dagon,5,2013-04-28,I am just tired of everything happening around me .I feel dying right now is far better than all the troubles i am going thru right now.,[deleted],GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/1dagon/i_am_just_tired_of_everything_happening_around_me/,"This is not a throwaway account ,bcuz i fucking dont care abt anything on internet. 
I was a CS grad with good gpa and internship with my dream software company . 


2 years ago , i got into a bad accident which left me in coma for good 6 months and i took me another years to get my life back to normal. I didnt go back to work because i thought i needed some time to figure where my career was going and what i should do with my future now.

I had some good contacts and thru them i got into a XXXX  grad program. I was short of money but i got an GRA to work as a programmer on their research  and it paid for my tuition along with a modest stipend . 

If anybody thought the shit ends here ,it doesn't .   There is a phd guy where i work who knows my supervisor[Prof] pretty well. Like he goes to extreme lengths in servility , like going to Prof's office at 8 AM on birthday to give the card  or sometimes even doing someone personal errands for her. 

He always feeds wrong info to my Prof.[who is also my faculty Advisor and supervisor in research]  Like last sem  , a research involved me getting some docs from him about a survey that was carried out . I had asked this guy multiple times but he never got back.
and at end of month my prof called me and scolded me for not getting the work done .The prof was not ready to believe when i told her that i never got the docs back from him. I was about to be fired from research  but the only thing that kept me there was i had good programming skills and i was delivering software apps on time and partly because department doesn't know any developers who could develop on android or IOS .

This semester i was taking an online course and this was the first time the prof. [Lets call him fuckhead]was teaching for grads.  His method of teaching  was far from perfect and i used to criticize him in the lab with my other friends and make fun of him . This PhD guy again would relay all the info back to that prof . (Both the Dickhead prof and the phd guy knwo each other pretty well ) .I was not doing well in that class and at the end of semester the prof called me and asked me about these allegations and threatened to make my life hell and give me an F.   I had to involve my Prof. as mediator to get  prof.Dickhead to calm down and i ended up with C grade.

This guy has been sitting on his PHD proposal for an year and all he does in watch YouTube videos in lab and gets away with all these things beacuse he is good at buttering up my prof.All these incidents have left a very bad impression of me on my prof.  No matter how much hard work i do ,my prof. doesnt seem to recognize it [maybe partly because she doesn't know much about programming and effort needed to deliver an app on time] . At this point i am completely lost ,while the phd guy is smugly happy that he has destroyed my impression in eyes of my professor.

I really care a lot about my career and i really try to work hard towards it. But everywhere there seems to be somebody who should be there to undermine me and fuck me over with

I really need a perspective here.

And probably the best thing about Tec compared to schools at the US: 70,000 pesos per semester without a scholarship (roughly 7,000 dollars), compared to the enormous amount of money I have to pay per semester in schools at the US. I honestly would love to study at the US, and my parents can afford it, but 7,000 dollars per semester in one of the most prestigious schools in Latin America is very attractive.

The problem is, CS doesnt have a great salary here in Mexico, so Ill probably have to pursue my career at the US. My questions are: would companies at the US take me seriously with a degree from a school in Mexico? Is Tec de Monterrey a good choice? Are the certificates good?

1daavi,10,2013-04-28,My (22M) super-negative girlfriend (22F) is killing our relationship.,Throwaway20124,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1daavi/my_22m_supernegative_girlfriend_22f_is_killing/,"Throwaway account since she also reddits. I've been dating this girl for almost a year and it has been just amazing. She’s funny, smart, caring and we've had a great sex life. There were a few rough patches but in general we’ve been happy. This all changed a couple months ago.

We live in a college town and this is my last semester. She graduated in December and found a job in town to stay here with me. The job she found sucks but was the best she could find and despite applying all across the country she still hasn't heard anything back. After I graduate I am moving to New York City for three months for an internship and there’s a possibility that it could become a permanent position. 

My girlfriend has increasingly become more depressed and negative about everything. She hates her job, hates this town and just generally hates her life. She says that she’s stuck and that she’s sick of trying. She’s said that I’m the one good thing in her life and now I’m leaving. There have been many nights where she has broken down and cried for hours. 

Through it all I’ve been right there for her to talk to and a shoulder to cry on. I try to tell her that things are going to improve and that this is only temporary. I try to tell her that she is way better off than a lot of people just out of college and that she’s only been applying for a couple months and it hasn’t been long enough. I try to tell her that if she hates her job and this town then she should just move. It has all been no use, she calls herself a failure and says that she’s stuck here and nothing I can say helps at all. 

We’d planned to have a long distance relationship but her negativity is really draining. I’m the eternal optimist and have no idea what to do in this situation where nothing I say and no amount of encouragement makes it worse. I’ve considered breaking up with her after I graduate, but I know that if I do that she will be an absolute mess and it kills me. Part of me thinks that if she could go back to how she was before then things would be alright again, but another part of me wonders if this negativity isn’t something that will just come back out later. I really don’t know what to do here. Should I stay with her and try and make it better or should I leave her and hope for the best?

TL;DR: Girlfriend of a year has become super negative, I don't know if I should leave her"

However, I do have depression, and my fiancee would like me to enter an outpatient program at a nearby hospital to get further help with it and to see if I need to adjust my medications.  I think that it would be a good idea, but I'm terrified that having something like that on my record would prevent me from being considered fit to be a police officer, which has been a huge dream of mine for some time. I sincerely do not believe that my depression would make me unfit to be an officer... It mainly just affects my home life (arguments with my fiancee, etc).  I'm extremely high-functioning at summer jobs and internships that I've held, and I never have any issues there.  I just need some help with my home life.  However, I don't want it to damage my chances at fulfilling a major dream of mine.  If I were to enter an outpatient program and then apply for the police force once I completed it, would my chances be severely damaged?  I just really need some advice.

Edit: I am not, and have never been, suicidal. The depression stems from issues with my family and the verbal emotional abuse I suffered growing up (e.g. being treated as a financial investment and not as their child, and being verbally degraded and told I'm an embarrassment for not wanting to do exactly what my parents want me to do with my life). Again, I am an EXTREMELY high functioning individual, and I attend one of the top schools in the world (and also one of the most stressful, and I have handled it fine). I'm depressed, not unstable, and I am VERY confident that a psychological evaluation would prove that. I have devoted my life to criminal justice because it's something I believe in. I just want to make sure that, regarding this question, anyone who answers understands that I am depressed and not unstable, and I'm not going to go crazy on the job because it's something I love and believe in, and the thought of reaching this goal has helped me greatly."

Meanwhile, Harmony runs to Spike because she thinks Buffy is no ""after her"".

**SPIKE: Anything, will you?**

Joyce then collapses, smashing the plates on the floor. 

At the hospital, an intern (Ben) informs Buffy and Riley that Joyce will be fine, but the doctors aren't sure what the cause of her problems are. While this is going on, Dawn listens to Rileys heartbeat and notices that his heart is going quicker than Seabiscuit. 

Riley heads over to see a Doctor about his heart. The Doc tells him it's bad and shouldn't leave, but Riley refuses. Buffy urges Riley to stay.

We see again, the middle of Buffy and Riley's relationship starting to break down even further. 

Buffy finally convinces Riley to go to the hospital, but the Doc has gone. Just after the Doc has finished sewing up Spike's lovely head, Buffy and Riley arrive and some fighting goes down. Spike tries to bite Buffy, but he get's a really bad headache. Realising the operation was a trick and the Doctor was right in that he couldn't remove it, Spike and Harmony escape with Spike saying Buffy is the source of all the problems in his life.

Riley has the operation and Graham visits him telling Riley that he no longer has a purpose on Sunnydale anymore. 

**GRAHAM: But you know you don't belong here, right? (Keeps walking and talking although Riley has stopped walking and is staring at his back) This town? I mean, you're nothin' here.**

Buffy shows up  at Spikes crypt with a stake, and you know what? Spike has had enough too. 

[**SPIKE: Just kill me**](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lh0n58cIl71qgbabho1_500.gif) 

Even as a straight male, damn James, you're hot. 

Spike admits his love for Buffy. 

**SPIKE: God, I love you so much.**

Spike then wakes up, terrified at his realisation.

____________________________________________________________

This episode further cements the distance between Buffy and Riley at the moment. Riley no longer has a purpose, and feels inadequate to Buffy. 

This is also the last time we see the old Sunnydale High in all it's burned, crispy snake glory.

1da388,24,2013-04-28,First Internship Jitters,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1da388/first_internship_jitters/,"I start my first internship in a few weeks and I am very nervous. I feel like I am not ready for the real world, which is sad because I am a senior with a semester left of schooling. I am able to handle the projects from my classes and I also program in my free time making apps. But I still feel like I google a ton of questions and need a lot of help still.

My work will be mainly SQL and C#, I was wondering if there was something like Codeacademy I can zip through as a refresher and such. 

I also have never really had a 9-5 job. It's kind of embarrassing but I have no clue what to bring or what to expect. Do I bring a sack lunch? Do they have somewhere to keep it cold or do I make sure its ok sitting out? When I first come to the building do I call the HR lady like i did for the interviews? Just a bunch of first day jitters. 

Also my cousin has a wedding 14 hours away on a Friday and my original plans (before I got the internship) was to leave Thursday night to drive there. Is it a big no-no for interns to ask for a Friday off for something like this? Or should I just suck it up and miss the wedding for work?"

I am currently an undergrad history major in south jersey and I am interning this summer for class credit. I am currently looking at the spots many students at my university used. I am wondering what is the most professional way to ask to be apart of an internship program. 


Also does anyone have any success stories of having an internship turn to a paying job, what did you do, any suggestions to help me move towards a career path?

I might have more questions the more I talk it out. I just need help moving towards a career and know this sub-reddit seems like the best place."

So I have been somewhat lurking in and out of r/Christianity for some time now and have been blown away at how supportive this group of believers is. It's absolutely amazing how God works. So I am going to be working these next two years as an intern for a campus ministry. Would you pray for me that I would trust in God and that he would provide. I have to raise support and I'm scared to death to trust in God to bring those people into my life who will willingly give. God has an incredible plan and I'm pumped to be apart of it but I need the support of others and the kingdom God has established and that's something that's really hard for me to ask people for.

Thanks,

However, our apartments are about a mile/mile and a half apart... We want to be able to spend evenings together, but neither of us have a car and I'm not sure how safe I'll be walking home (or even how safe he'd be) at probably around 11pm at night. The way home is across a big outdoor mall. There are a lot of restaurants and I think there would probably be people there even late at night, which to me makes me think it would be safer? 

I've talked to another past intern and she said that the area we are living in is really safe. Am I taking a big risk walking half a mile or so alone at night in a fairly safe area? There is also a bus that sort of runs between our places, but it doesn't run very late at night especially on weekends and it only goes one direction (mine-&gt;his) not the other way around. 

The only other alternative is to rent a car but that would be like $2,000 for the summer and I really want to try and save what I can from what I earn during the internship. 

Please advise!"

Not having a ton of luck with Padmapper, Trulia, Zillow, CL, etc. so I thought I'd try Reddit!

Looking for a condo/townhouse/house - preferably in the Midtown-ish area (I'll be working where Peachtree hits Ponce and would love something walkable or a 15ish min or less drive). 

I'm just finishing grad school, coming in with a full-time job at a company I've worked for for a year already, and have a perfect rental history. I have a small, 9 year old Sheltie who is very well trained and friendly. My boyfriend will be living with me for the summer while he does his grad school internship, and he has a 11 year old dachshund who is crate trained and friendly. We are both considerate owners who pick up after our dogs - neither of them are chewers or pee-ers, just normal well-behaved, older pups.

We are non-smokers, quiet, clean, in our early 30's, good credit. The craziest thing we do is turn up the volume when the Game of Thrones theme plays, but that's about it. :)

I'm looking for a 1 or preferably 2br (I need an office/reading space, so a closed off den could work as well) condo or townhouse in a medium sized, safe building. I'm starting work June 16, so a mid to late May or early June move-in is best. 

***We will be in Atlanta May 3-6 looking at places***

My wishes include: hardwood floors and gas cooking are a must - a porch or sunroom, and possibly a fireplace would be nice (though I know that can be a long shot). I'm flexible with my rent range, though I'd like to stay under 1500 - depending on the place could be persuaded to increase my range with a very top max of 1750. Alarm system and off-street parking would be nice, but aren't deal breakers.

Reddit, do I ask too much? Feeling very discouraged at the moment. :(

Thanks!!

1d9tfx,1,2013-04-28,Deciding on a Major,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1d9tfx/deciding_on_a_major/,"Hey Guys, I'm kind of stuck and I need your opinion.

  Background: I was kind of lost when I came to university. Money issues were a concern (as I'm paying for college myself) and I kind of realized that I will most likely never be communicating with my immediate family for reasons I will not disclose. My main goal was to make money, what else would you expect from a kid who has  financially burdened his entire life. So I decided to go the econ route, but I hated it. It wasn't my true passion. I needed to be mentally stimulated; I needed to produce something. I decided I need to go with something I'm more interested in and get a technical major.

  I need to decide on a major, and I just thought i could use other perspectives from the guys on this subreddit. I'm an undecided rising sophomore, but I'm pretty sure I want to be a software engineer when I graduate. I have an internship this summer as one, and hopefully this will reaffirm my beliefs. The only thing is, I am fascinated by the ability to create hardware slightly and build. Tony Stark is my hero (actually), and I remember reading in the comics he had dual degree in EE and CS 
  
I go to a top 5 university for engineering/cs. We are top 5 for ECE, CS, Software Engineering (Grad, not offered undergrad, but will be within 10 years), Robotics, and Human-Computer Interaction.

  My options are:
1) ECE degree
2) CS Degree
3) Self-Defined Major in Software Engineering (Mixture of high level CS, ECE, Information Systems, and grad school Software classes) with a double Major in Robotics or HCI (preferably in Robotics).

How would you rank these options fellow Engineering students? Any cautions or general advice."
1d9lln,3,2013-04-28,Advice Needed accepted as a 3/4th year transfer HELP,iammisterfalcon,UCDavis,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCDavis/comments/1d9lln/advice_needed_accepted_as_a_34th_year_transfer/,"Currently a senior in standing roughly 9 classes away from graduating at my current university (from a neighboring 2nd tier state school) and applied to a few schools for s&amp;g's. At my current institution, I do not have to finance my education, as a matter of fact; through a few scholarships I am actually reimbursed a substantial amount of money to continue my studies as an undergraduate student. Felt like I was facing a major crisis committing to a degree I was not passionate for, as the program I intended to study (Management Information Systems) got cut here, among a number of different things. I'm also experiencing severe apathy towards schooling in general as I don't feel challenged nor committed to what I currently do here. Not only have I felt pressure from an academic standpoint... in my current internship, I have a standing full-time job offer (roughly 50K starting) after this summer as long as I graduate in the Fall (assuming at the local uni). Transferring to another university to complete my education could certainly jeopardize this offer, although the position may be offered in the Davis-Sac area.


I somehow managed to get into Davis and despite not knowing how far out this will actually put me out from my first bachelor's, I feel hesitant in diving into 5 or so quarter's worth of student loans as an out of state student (assuming 5 quarters after transferable credits). I do not have a cosigner and despite Davis so graciously offering grants worth 30% of my tuition, the prospect of taking such a substantial amount of risk makes me sick to my stomach. 


I've lived in my current city for 21 years now and failed to take the leap for college as a freshman... and got stuck wondering what if a few years back and this has slowly been eating at my sanity...


What am I looking for? A reason why I'm feeling so distressed, someone to tell me everything will be okay, someone to tell me I'm an idiot.... But realistically, if I can find a job, a roof over my head, means of financing my education (loosely looked into loans without cosigners... not sure if I'd be approved) and some security I'm willing to do this because I feel it's necessary to further my insatiable desire to succeed and sustain or give back those that I truly care for. Financial independence and assuming risk with no one to support me has been a path I've had to tread down since a young age, and I would hate to pass up another opportunity like this. It's highly unlikely I'll be accepted into the other schools I am waiting to hear back from (USC, UW, Irvine). 


Reddit, I'm at a total loss for what to do. I've confided in a number of people close to me and haven't found what I'm looking for... have been a long time lurker of about 4 years and for the first time I selfishly choose to pour my soul into a single post yearning for solace. Any insight into any of the unorganized, chaotic post above would greatly be appreciated. 

TL;DR- I'm f'd"

Not to mention this is stupid long, so don't bother wasting your time to read through it all.

I've posted here several times about my shitty situation and my psychotic sister and my piece of shit family entirely.  This one will be no different.  Here's my story.

I met a guy on reddit through r/r4r and we were just looking for penpals but it grew into something much much more than that rather quickly.  He is the love of my life and I couldn't dream of finding a better man in this world.  He loves my daughter as if she was his own, probably frequently forgetting at this point that she isn't his biologically.  And she loves him with all her heart too.  Only problem is, my daughter and I are from Texas, he's from Ireland.  So we decided to see if we could actually work as a family, living together, before going through the trouble with immigration and what not to get to stay in one country or the other permanently.  We left August 21st and returned November 1st.  Leaving him standing in Dublin airport was one of the most painful moments of my life.  Airport personnel were crying after watching our goodbyes to each other.

Then there's my family.  You'd think they'd be happy for me.  When I told them of my plans to go over to Ireland the shit hit the fan and then some.  They called me a terrible mother.  They told me I was an idiot and that I've ruined my life enough but I shouldn't put my precious baby through that as well.  They told me I was making the worst mistake of my life.  THEY EVEN TRIED TO CONVINCE ME OF GIVING UP MY PARENTAL RIGHTS AND LETTING THEM KEEP MY CHILD.  They threatened, they begged, they cried, they called me every name in the book, but they didn't change my mind.

You may be wondering about my daughters birth father at this point.  He's a piece of shit, real scum of the earth type of person.  I was locked in an abusive relationship with him my entire college experience.  I started college August '07, met him September, we were going out by October.  Everyone thinks that it's so easy to escape abuse, but it just isn't.  He had his claws in everything.  He put all kinds of spyware shit on my computer, in my email, even my school account.  He managed to gain access to my bank account.  He knew my school schedule, eventually my work schedule.  There were times when I'd look at him and think that's the last thing I'm going to see in my dying moments because one day he's going to kill me.  He raped me repeatedly.  He was verbally and mentally abusive on top of that.  He knew I was trying to leave him and I finally had some friends (even though he tried exceedingly hard to make sure I never did) that were willing to help me get away from him.  He got me ridiculously drunk (either that or he slipped something in my drink which is plausible because I usually don't forget my nights of even the most extreme drinking but I only remember very very few bits and pieces of this one) and got me pregnant on purpose.  I don't believe abortion is the right choice ever so I kept my child.  The moment I found out I was having a girl I was terrified.  I was also incredibly grateful.  It if were a boy, I never would've been able to get away from him.  I knew there was no way I could stay then.  I gave birth to a healthy baby girl April '11, graduated with a bachelors May '11 (even though he tried like hell to make me fail classes, get kicked out, or drop out of college.)  I left his ass in June.  He was completely out of our lives right after Halloween.  I never thought I'd have the strength, the courage, anything to get away from him.  But I fucking did it.

I relied on my family.  I was a new mother, with no money, no job, no real work experience.  They told me if I would just leave him I could stay with them as long as I needed, even if it was years.  I accepted.  I tried to start my career but it was a 3 hour commute round trip daily to the best job I could get and my working 50 hours/week turned into 70 and I got burnt out, quick.  I just couldn't do it.  Lo and behold, my former boss was breaking the law.  When people called my former employer to find out if I was re-hirable or if I was a bad employee etc, he not only said I was not re-hirable, he lied about me doing some really dangerous shit in a restaurant.  So no one would hire me.  I couldn't get a job above minimum wage and that wouldn't even cover gas.  My parents were trying to get me out of the house even then knowing I didn't have money.  But I had no options.

Before I could give in to my depression or drinking again, my wonderful man came along and saved me.  I was terrified of slipping back into that again, knowing what a horrible mother I would be if I did, but it was so hard to escape that pull.  I did it though, because of him and his help and support.  Those months with him were the first time in my life I ever felt safe and at ease and not worried constantly.  It was the first time I could ever really remember being truly happy, no strings attached.  I know I should be more grateful to my parents, and I really should, but if they were just better people in general I would be.  I loathe them.  If I had just met them instead of being related to them, they're the type of people I would make sure to always have an excuse ready if they ever tried to talk to me.  They're racists, assholes, sometimes sexists, and don't believe that relationships could be abusive unless you have black eyes.  They're some of the worst people I know.

I came back in November with a heavy heart but determined to make it work with me and my guy long distance and get a good job and support my kid and move out.  2 weeks later, my parents kicked me out.  I had no money and nowhere to go.  They suggested I move in with my sister in San Antonio.  Her and her 2nd husband offered me a job as nanny.  I could move in with my daughter and share a bedroom with her for free.  All I needed to do was nanny her two kids (6 and 4), take them to school, help with homework, make dinner, get them ready for bed, etc.  The nights she was home in time to look after them herself she went straight for another bottle of wine.  I also had to help look after his 2 kids (8 and 4) every other weekend.  So 5 kids by myself.  The trade off was that it'd be one weekend with all the kids, the next they'd be off with their other parents.  Not a bad deal, but still kinda sucked.

Next thing ya know, they've been married for all of 3 weeks and he wants a divorce (they'd been together 3 years).  Not only that but he's screwing around.  She breaks down saying she doesn't know what she's going to do.  Kicks him out, let's him back in, kick's him out again.  I tell her to just figure her own stuff out first then we'll get to me.  She's soo grateful.  Then it's I'll pay you $150 (hey, i'm glad she made that offer after 2 weeks of no payment).  But then it turns into (after just one week) ""I can only pay you that much if I pick up extra shifts, but if I do that it bumps me into the next tax bracket which essentially means I'm working extra but not getting any extra money, and don't forget I'm still covering ALL your bills."" (Yes, because us sleeping in one room and sharing a tiny bathroom with 2 other children is costing you so much and affecting your rent.)  So now it's ""ok I'm only going to pay you $100/week and if you don't like it you know where the door is.  This is a VERY generous offer."" (yeah, ok, sure it is you psycho.)  But I have no options.  All my money so far has gone to food.  Very little was saved up.  What I did manage to save up when I was getting 200/week went to Christmas presents for my kid and my man.  The rest goes to food and gas.  I had nothing and nowhere to go.  Parents? ""Well she's your employer work it out with her.  Oh, you talked to her about it?  Well she is being nice by not charging you rent.""

Did I forget to mention that had I not moved in, she would've lost custody of her kids to her first husband, their birth father because she can't afford daycare?  My bad.  Apparently everyone keeps forgetting that I'm helping her out as much as she's helping me out.  Then wouldn't you know it, just because she HAS to have drama in her life, she starts fucking a married doctor at work.  Next thing ya know, the bosses find out, and she gets fired.  Unfair you may say?  I disagree since she was fucking him IN THE HOSPITAL IN THE NURSE'S ON CALL ROOM.  Fucking idiot.  Oh yeah, and she has a stipulation on her nursing license.  Like I said, she's a fucking idiot.  She was without a job for a month and to be honest I thought she wouldn't be able to find another one.  I was almost hoping she wouldn't because she's ruining her kids lives.

How you may ask?  Her almost 5-year-old daughter who is in pre-k is a pathological liar and can look you in the eye and lie to your face without batting an eye.  Her almost 7-year-old son is in kindergarten.  He's a smart kid, sure.  But he's also a bully.  He's punched different kids in his class several times.  He spent the entire week before last in in-school-suspension (ISS) for throwing a chair and hitting another child with it.  One more incident and he'll be expelled from the school.  He's in fucking kindergarten!

She threatens to kick me out every 2 to 3 days, knowing I can't go back to our parents and that I have no money.  She loves the fact that she has so much power over me because she has no real power in her own life.  Her two young children are even out of her control, it's despicable.  Not only that, but they're starting to teach my 2-year-old that it's ok to hit and push.

Why not just get a job you say!  I love your thinking you dear sweet redditor.  Unfortunately, I did that.  I got hired as a server assist in a restaurant making $4/hour plus tip share part time and they were willing to work around my sisters schedule, awesome!  That was a month and ten days ago.  3 weeks ago I almost got fired.  I picked up a shift because she wasn't working, why? Because she got fired for fucking a married doctor.  I told her the day before that I picked up a shift.  I get up the next day, get ready for work, feed my kid breakfast, she's nowhere to be found.  I text her and ask where she is saying I need to leave for work.  Her response? ""you said you were off on Friday.""  Yes, then I told you that I picked up a shift for someone.  ""But I have a hair appointment at 2.""  I'm well aware, I told them I'd need to leave early but they still need me to come in for a few hours so I need you to come get her like now because I'm already going to be late.  ""well that's not my problem.""  * Cue Jackie Chan face. *  I'm fucking pissed.  I throw the f word her way, not my wisest decision but damn it I'm just sick of her bullshit.  Her revenge?  She doesn't come get my kid.  So I have to call my boss (after pissing him off the night before saying my sister was flipping out about me picking up a shift and that idk if I can cover it after all) and say well I'm gonna be late, and oh yeah my toddler is in the backseat.  I almost got fired because of her.  I went to work anyway even though they took me off the schedule for the day.  Why?  Because after she made me apologize as if I was being the unreasonable one in the situation, and take my kid to her because she couldn't be inconvenienced to drive right up the road to get her, I heard her joke to her friend that she was going to drive by the restaurant and see if my car was there to see if she actually got me fired or not.  She thought it was the funniest thing she'd heard in weeks.

I was livid.  I'm struggling, big time.  All I want to do is come home and drink but I can't do that to my kid.  Every time I feel myself slipping into depression all I want to do is cut my forearm and just feel that little bit of pain to know I'm still actually here, but I don't.  I want to so fucking bad though.

Now she's with a new guy, funnily enough, married doctor introduced them because he's friends with married doctor.  They're oh so serious now and he may even move in soon.  Phenomenal.  I don't even know his last name and now I may have to live with him.  Whatever, I usually stay in my room when I'm home anyway to avoid psycho hose beast.

Well, things kept getting messed up at work because of her.  I'm now off the schedule.  Wasn't scheduled last week, wasn't scheduled this week.  Does this mean I'm fired?  I don't know.  I also haven't gotten paid in over a month for the times I did watch her kids because after all, she didn't have a job.  Well, she started training last week and is scheduled for the first half of this week.

Here's the deal, this lease on this house is up in June.  All I've heard for months now is how it's so expensive and she can't keep living here.  She signed up to renew it.  The drawback?  She wants her dog back but they said no pets.  That didn't stop her from getting a cat.  She keeps the litterbox in the laundry room.  She changes it once a month if I'm lucky.  I told her when I moved in that I hate cats and I will never fucking take care of that thing.  I somehow managed to outgrow a childhood allergy to them but I didn't outgrow my very irritation with the animals.

My guy and I are still going as strong as we can be with how stressed we are.  All he wants to do is help but he has his own rent and bills to pay.  All I want is a full-time job, hopefully paying like $12/hour so I can actually afford an apartment, and even then I'll probably still have to get assistance to get the price of daycare knocked down.  However, I'm now no longer getting a paycheck.  You may be wondering right about now why I would say that, since after all my sister should be paying me $100/week again right?

Well, your assumption would be correct if we were discussing a sane person.  She came into my room (without knocking, minor irritation but whatever) saying that a house inspector was coming by because she asked if she would be allowed to have pets should she renew the lease.   They responded let's see the state of the house first.  Ah but most logical people see a problem don't they.  She's not supposed to have any pets already and yet there's fucking cat here.  Well the cat went into a crate that went into her jeep.  Woohoo.  Problem for her is the inspector was running late and she just HAD to leave on time to go to the parade on Friday around lunch time.  Yeah because it's not like a 4 hour affair downtown.  Plus, planning on getting there 30 minutes before it starts isn't going to do you any good.  You aren't going to be able to see shit there you retard.  But I digress.  She came in telling me (not asking, telling) that I was going to put the cat in my car because the inspector was late and they just had to leave.  I said no.  I hate cats, I hate everything about cats and I wasn't going to put that fucking thing in my car.

""It is my house and this is my room and if you want to keep living here you're going to do as I say and you're going to put that cat in your car for 15 or 20 minutes while the inspector is here.  Then once the inspector leaves, you're going to bring it back inside and let it out of the crate.""  I'm 24-years-old.  This may be ""her house"" (which isn't technically correct/true anyway but whatever), but that is my fucking car and I'm not putting that creature in my car.  She tells me that she's sick of my shit and how I treat her and her kids like crap (which I don't, I just actually discipline them instead of laughing as if them pulling each other's hair out is funny).  She goes on this long rant/tirade.  I'm just so fucking tired, I'm so exhausted at this point of all of this that I quickly grow bored to be honest.  I'm almost to the point where I'm ready to start sleeping in my car versus dealing with this bullshit day in and day out.  The only thing that keeps me from that is I can't legally do that with my daughter.  They would take her away.  What about my parents you may wonder, surely they aren't that cold, right?  Actually, they are.  I've been pondering that one all day today.  Ya see, after our blowout, and her taking my house key, I called her a psycho.  She called me a smelly, disgusting, worthless, fat cunt and told me if I wasn't out of her house within the hour she was calling the cops on me.  Fine, go ahead, you have an outstanding warrant anyway, go for it.  I called my parents.  My dad, who is actually my step-dad and I'm starting to think has never really seen me as his daughter anyway, vaguely sides with me.  My mom tells me to suck it up and take it up the ass if I have to but I'm not coming back home.  (And they wonder why I'm ok with moving to a different continent, 5,000 miles away from ""home"".)

Well, she stays for the inspection, I don't put the cat in my car and she comes and tells me that she's sick of my shit, she hates my guts, hates me being her and can't wait to be rid of me.  But since she's such a nice, generous, caring person/sister, she'll let me stay.  But there's no way she's going to continue paying me $100/week so I can keep what I can aside and as soon as I have the money ""peace out when (I) get mad at (her) for something when she hasn't done anything wrong and has never been anything but generous.  So with that being said, she's going to offer me a generous deal.  She'll continue paying me $50/week and I better be grateful for it and I better start treating her with some respect"" (pssh, as if she's earned that!).

I have no other choice but to accept.  Her freaking torments, her threatening to kick me out every other day, it's really taking it's toll.  I know it's exactly what she wants but I just don't have it in me to not let it get to me.  It kills me not knowing if I'll be able to put a roof over my daughters head this time next week.  My hair is falling out from the stress.  I gave into cutting once last week and I regret it dearly.  It was one of the worst decisions I've made in a long time, not to mention that I disappointed my man by doing so because he thought I could rely on him fully to let him know when I was in danger of going down that road again.  It's just so hard.

My parents proposed solution to this?  Get a better job and save up and move out when I can afford rent and daycare but they weren't helping out with any of it.  Yeah well that's impossible to do when the ""daycare"" I have is unreliable and my sitter actively tries to get me fired, makes a game of it in fact.  And I can't get a full time job considering the fact that if I don't watch her kids whenever the hell she decides I need to, whether she's working or not, she threatens me with saying then I better be prepared to sleep in my car tonight because she'll call someone and have the locks changed within the hour.

I'm just so tired, dear reddit.  I'm stressed, and I'm exhausted and I'm trying not to let my daughter pick up on it, but sometimes I just can't help but cry in front of her just due to the sheer hopelessness of it all.  And I'm so sick of everyone telling me what a bad mother I am.  No, I'm not.  I'm trying so fucking hard to get out of this situation but it's a black hole that just keeps sucking me in deeper.  My parents telling me I'm a bad mother for wanting to move to a country with a better education system?  Yeah, ok that makes me a bad mother.  My sister telling me I'm a bad mother because I keep my daughter in here with me to play instead of in the rest of the house where her 2 kids can try to push mine down the stairs again?   Yeah, sure, that makes me a bad mother.  My life is exhausting and I don't see a way it.

My man keeps reminding me there's a light at the end of the tunnel.  Truly, there is.  We have 2 options.  Either I wait until January/February, then my daughter and I can go over to Ireland and get an extended visa once we can prove we've been in an active relationship for 2 years (which apparently requires passport stamps).  Or, if I can manage to get the hell out of here, and keep my head above water bill-wise, I can save up just a little.  The K-1 (fiance) visa is just $240.  His dad knows the Irish ambassador who could speed up the process so instead of it taking months it'd just take weeks if not days.  First though, he has to have somewhere to come to.  Coming to this house isn't an option.  I have to get out of here anyway before something bad happens.

That's the scary part reddit.  I can feel something bad coming.  I'm trying so hard and it just doesn't matter.  Who knows, maybe I really am a bad mother after all.  It's funny though that my parents consider me the failure.  The oldest got kicked out of one of the easiest schools ever to attend, then married an NHL player, does drugs, and they both fuck around.  They've been in an unhappy marriage for a decade.  Problem is he's retired now and can't find work, and she hasn't worked in a decade.  Then there's this sister.  She was a teen mom, another college drop out of course, then just to spite her baby daddy's mom (kinda confusing, I know, sorry) she got pregnant on purpose again while they were in the middle of a custody battle.  Got married when the baby was 6 weeks old.  Got divorced less than a year later.  Why?  For sleeping with a married man of course.  Married man got divorced as well and they spent 3 unhappy years together and after 3 weeks of marriage, he cheated and left.  She has a stipulation on her nursing license which leads to her only being able to get shit jobs, because she's a fucktard.

Then there's me.  Survived an abusive relationship, got myself out of it, and managed to earn a bachelor's degree all while being pregnant then having a baby.  Did I tell you that in order to get my degree I had to complete and internship so I went back to work 5 days after giving birth?  It was a close call but I got all my hours in.  When I walked across that stage at graduation, my dean stood up and clapped for me, and I was the only one in my entire school that received that honor.

All I want is something like a bank teller job.  A simple 9-5, above minimum wage.  I want my own place to live with my daughter.  I want to save up a bit of extra money and bring my guy over here.  He's always wanted to live in another country for a while, but especially America, and here's my chance to make his dream come true.  We've already decided we want her to go through the Irish education system versus the failing one here so he has limited time to make that dream come true.  I want to make that happen for him.  I don't want much reddit.  I didn't really think it was me asking too much of life.  I just want to feel safe, secure, happy.  I'm even trying to sell some of my possessions to make this happen.  If I can sell the 3 things I have listed on craigslist, I can afford deposit and first months rent on an ok apartment.  I can apply for assistance with daycare to bring the price down but my man can help pay for that for now once I do find a job until I get my first paychecks in.  I'm so close reddit, I am.  I'm so close to pulling myself out of another black hole.

Keep your fingers crossed for me, will you?  If you actually read all of this, I commend you.  Thank you for reading through my almost incoherent ramblings.  I hope you're having a better time with life in general than I am."
1d9bbz,1,2013-04-28,School Advice,ppptwang,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1d9bbz/school_advice/,"Hey Reddit,

I have a professor this semester who has been pretty awful. After working hard on a website for this class with two other groupmates, the professor really, *really* hated it. It came as a surprise, as we had been checking in regularly to make sure we were on track in class. She belittled it to the point where one of my groupmates broke into full-on tears, and blamed the other for being 'a terrible group leader' and that 'this must be a recurring problem, why do you break apart groups like this'. Ever since, I have dreaded going to class to the point where I feel ill. 

The event that was connected with the website happened and is over. The website, at this point, was meant to serve as an archival service for all of the students whose work was part of the event.

Since the event has happened, the badgering about the website has gotten yet worst. Several things have happened, all of which have been incredibly upsetting:

1.) The head of the department sent an email to the class saying that he thought that the way the show was handled was an embarrassment to the department. It felt like a way to embarrass the students who had worked on it, as he sent it to the entire class instead of the students who he knew had worked on it.

2.) The professor has brought it up two classes ago to the entire class to say that he/she had shown the site to some ""Mediocre startups"" in the area looking for interns who had then stopped talking to her after seeing it. She had prefaced this with, ""I don't mean to make anyone feel bad but..."" and then told us that the website was so horrible that mediocre startups didn't want us to be working for them because of it.

3.) The professor has since insisted that one of my other groupmates change the website from this year's version to last year's version, meaning that it no longer serves as a website to see the work from the students in this year's event. Any student who intended to link to it as a place where potential employers can see their work will no longer be able to.

4.) The professor has since been muttering under her breath after I talk to her in class. One classmate who happened to be near her when she was muttering said that she was saying something nasty but wouldn't elaborate.

I have never had a professor and department head be so rude and hurtful. What was most aggravating about the process was that professors leading up to the event were unhelpful and even acted in ways that were counterproductive to us getting the event set up and going (I can enumerate on these as well, but as they aren't directly related to the current problem of ""What do I do now that this is over"" I will add them if they're requested). I have absolutely no idea what do to in a situation like this, and I am incredibly stressed out about getting a good grade. What makes everything that much worse: I am forced to have her as a professor next semester, as she is the only one who teaches that section of the class. Any negative actions I could take against her right now while this is still a bitter taste in my mouth could potentially backfire very negatively next semester.

Please Reddit. I have no idea what to do in a situation like this."
1d9b3m,4,2013-04-28,Question on ENVE Engineering Masters with non-Engineering undergrad,GerSlamwich,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1d9b3m/question_on_enve_engineering_masters_with/,"I have heard mixed opinions for the job outlook in regards to my current situation. I am currently going for my master's degree in environmental engineering and have 2 undergraduate degrees: biology and environmental science.  I sort of decided spur of the moment after I graduated that I hated biology; and environmental science is, well..um.. a dumbed down version of what I feel I am capable of. 

I am now in graduate school pursuing an ENVE master's degree, maintaining a 4.0, and working on a full blown thesis that has apparently more funding than the cost of my tuition will be for the duration of my time in graduate school.  I am a scholarship recipient (sponsored by local engineering firms).  Despite my lack of an engineering undergrad degree, my professors say I will be able to sit for the FE, and PE exam as long as I take it in another state i.e. Maryland (currently live in PA).  I'm sure some stipulations will apply to my situation with respect to when I am eligible to take the test after my graduation date.

I have ZERO work experience in the engineering field, but have had internships relating to biology/ environmental science.

With all of this said, should I expect to be unemployed after graduation, or have any of you seen cases similar to mine where the student ended up getting a decent job right out of school?  Also, will I be payed significantly less due to my mixture of nonengineering/ engineering degrees?

tl;dr: 2 non engineering undergrad degrees with engineering masters; will I be a hobo living on the streets?"
1d97m0,4,2013-04-28,I [21m] am falling for a girl [16f]. Is the age difference weird?,Throwaway188753,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1d97m0/i_21m_am_falling_for_a_girl_16f_is_the_age/,"So I'm 21 and I just finished College. She is a 16yo and is still in high school. My knee jerk reaction is of course 'no' but there are a few things that make me want to give this a shot. I will give an honest account of our situation and in return I want reddit's honest opinion.

    So I started  going to the gym a few months ago doing a special work-out program. We have classes and the group works out together. I met this girl (lets call her Jenny) there and we go at the same time 4-6 times a week. This is the only time either of us are free for training so we always see each other.
 
   When I first met Jenny I thought she was a few years older (than 16) so I was surprised when she told me she was 16(in Canada age of consent is 16). You may be think ""why doesn't he chase girls his own age?"" well, I do but for some reason I just can't get her out of my head. I've had my fair share of flings with girls my age but I have never been in a long serious relationship before.  

   There is just something about her that makes me put her above the rest. She doesn't post duck-faced pictures on facebook or spend all her time on tumblr like most girls her age. She is extremely driven in school and in training. Because we met at these classes I see her as a peer and an equal, unlike if I met her somewhere else I suppose. 

  Just for reference people often mistake me for being 18-19 year old, I'm not some hairy meat head.  Her mother also comes to the classes and I have become friends with her as well. We all get along very well. 

    I can tell there is some chemistry between us but don't want to jump the gun. I have spent some time thinking about why I would want to date a 16 year old as opposed to someone my age and I haven't come up with an answer. But I know she is the only girl her age that I am remotely attracted to. I once had a friend that dated an older guy when she was in high school. He was a senior and she was grade 10. He waited 2 years for her, because she felt she wasn't ready for sex. I want to be a good boyfriend like that. Before anyone assumes I just want to take advantage of Jenny I don't. We share a lot of the same interests and passions (we are both taking coaching internships at our gym). Sex is an important part of a relationship but it isn't the only component. She is a friend and I get along great with her. 

   She seems mature but that could be me seeing what I want to see. I'd really appreciate your opinion. And i know there have been similar questions on this sub but I'm looking for opinions on my situation.

tl;dr: Met a 16 year old girl and fell for her. There is chemistry and we get along great but the age gap is causing me to think twice.

There is a threshold for panic attacks where you simply have your control stripped from you. I remember the first time I ran screaming out of my class because I couldn't stand to be around people. The most degrading experience of my life.

I tried. I tried the adderal and I tried the Abillify, Ritalin, and every other nonsense they wanted to put me on. Many made me want to die, others made me want to cause my death, others just numbed my soul to reality.

Marijuana, hard on the lungs. 

Vaporizer, my lungs are pleased. Empowers me. I can go to class, take tests, be social, have friends. Grades improve, relationships flourish.

Reality sets in. One year of class left, time to get a job. Internships, oppurtunity of a lifetime through my parental connections.
Two weeks, mandatory drug test.

I will go forth, unafraid. I am worth it, I am a fully realized and intelligent entity. If the business does not want me because I take my medicine, it is not the sort of company I wish to work for! I refuse to compromise myself and surrender to the panic.

This line of thought is rejected by those who set this up, they fear being embarrassed themselves for putting a drug-contaminated applicant into the internship process, and oh look he was the most promising applicant.

I could stop. I could deal with the fear, and the pain, if only long enough to get in the system.

But I will not hide. I will not surrender my free will.

But I live in Texas. So I am alone. I am a felon, because I do not want to be afraid. I am here now, crying over my lost future.

I think I will still go. Test or not, I will present myself as I always have, honestly, with no secrets. Humiliation will follow.


We need to change it. It all started in my state from racism. We must end it with knowledge."

My boyfriend is finishing up his 3L year, studying for the bar, applying for jobs, working 3 (unpaid) internships, and overall being stretched pretty thin. Our saving grace so far in our relationship is that I went back to school this semester to pursue a masters in engineering. I would speculate that &gt;90% of our time together is studying. It's great being able to just spend that time together but we would be kidding ourselves if we think it's doing anything to develop our relationship.

Every weekend we try to have some sort of a date night, be it grabbing a drink or going to a ballet. I really appreciate and look forward to that time together.  Whenever we have our dates though he is constantly on his phone either reading articles on reddit or responding to work emails.  I have brought this up to him but he will deny it to every possible end, stating he limits phone activity when we're together. If there is one thing you learn if you date a lawyer is that you will never win a perceived argument, it's better to use your right to remain silent.

I don't feel like I'm asking for too much. I'm really only looking for one night every two weeks of completely devoted attention for 2 hours (that isn't sexy times). Everyone always says that you will feel taken for granted dating a law student since you can always be there for them but they won't be there for you.  Never realized the weight of those words until experiencing it firsthand.

I was hired as a network technician at my company about 6 months ago, it's a relatively small company that does networking, VoIP and traditional phone systems. I was hired to primarily work on Cisco gear as I have a CCNA certification.This is my first real IT job, though I did do a 3 month internship prior to this doing similar work. My background is definitely more focused on the networking side of IT.

With the companies IT manager leaving, I have been given a promotion of sorts (a raise too!). I am now responsible for administering our production servers. We have 6 Linux servers that we provide SIP service to some of our clients, both to IP PBXs and individual phones. I am familiar with the basics of Linux (using simple commands to navigate folders, copy files, start and stop services, use packages to install things), but I certainly don't feel like I know what I am doing compared to an actual Linux Administrator. These serers were set up by a third party, and I feel out of my league. 

I already know I need to learn about doing backups (Should I back up the whole drive, or just the MySQL databases??). I need to learn how to properly manage hardware, such as how do I install a new disk and mount it? Some  servers are clustered, I know there is a virtual server in this setup, but how do I manage clustering?

Does anyone have any advice for me? what tasks should I try to learn? any good resourcesI could read?



**Edit**

Thanks for all the replies everyone!

I plan on ordering a copy of *The Practice of System and Network Administration* as I have seen this book recommended frequently

Having a dev VM is obviously a great idea, but building one form scratch may not be possible. There is proprietary software running on these servers, so the company that set them up probably won't let me have access to all the source files. I will see if I am allowed to image one of the servers during a maintenance window to get a dev copy for myself.

Thanks for all the suggestions regarding backup and monitoring software, I will research the suggestions to see which ones I will want to try."

I talked to the sheriffs office about it, but they won't give me a CCW, even though I am in the military and have the proper training. Now, I want to protect myself and do own a pistol. I know technically it's illegal, but is it not safer to have it and be alive as opposed to not and be in trouble? I've checked and even though I shouldn't say ""only"" it is only a misdemeanor.

Any thoughts on the situation? I am a safe person, responsible citizen, and just want to protect myself in an area where bad things happen. Thanks! "

I get it.

What I don't get it why you feel compelled to take a bunch of parting shots and make a big fuss about how you expected this sub-reddit to be one thing and now you're angry that it's not what you wanted it to be. 

Perhaps you should go make your own sub-reddit with blackjack and hookers, that has mod-enforced rules that require at least two verified corroborating witnesses and concrete Wikipedia-sourced evidence of corporate manipulation of the upvote/downvote system. 

As you pour through the piles of data contained in the anonymous voting system, you'll be able to post link after link showing that, indeed, no corporate interest has ever tried to promote brand awareness using reddit, and even those naive amateur marketing interns who have tried have failed miserably, because it's just so easy to recognize these instances that they will immediately be buried. 

Your sub-reddit will attract only the most rigorous and studious of redditors; a purely homogeneous group of scientists and researchers devoted to the sole motivation of the pursuit of a higher truth. 

Meanwhile, all of us hail-tards will keep circle-jerking about how corporations are using reddit to promote their brands while simultaneously subverting the integrity of the voting system.

Using the brims of our tinfoil hats to shield our eyes from the harsh florescent lighting in our mothers' basements, we'll make post after post about how pictures of McDonaldstm billboards with absolutely no relevant context or humor have 4,000 upvotes and only 3 comments, two of which are /r/HailCorporate. 

Every once in a while though, some hail-tard will see the light of the outdoors, and will finally come to their senses and post some bitchy diatribe about how lame our sub-reddit is, about how they don't care about internet points, and about all of the atrocities perpetrated by the denizens of /r/HailCorporate.

The UNSUBSCRIBE button is on the sidebar. Just click it, and we'll see you around.

My resume is here: http://i.imgur.com/0LqUjvN.png

Everything in blue has been changed to either maintain anonymity and/or add context.

When I look at it, I see that it's a little verbose. I can trim it down in time. That said, what stands out? Are there any real red flags?

Occasionally I worry that I look like a job-hopper, but that is far from the truth. Three of the jobs I list are short, but they were either internships or summer jobs while I was in college from 2006-2010. If anything, my ultimate goal is to find a company culture that I can stick with for years. I would value the continuity. (There is a gap between August 2010 - November 2011 when I was working for my father in an unrelated industry. That said, I've had stable employment since November 2011, so I'm not sure that gap matters.)

This is my business resume. I do have other PA and casting experience that I didn't include for the sake of space and relevance. I came to Los Angeles almost two years ago intending to get into production, but I haven't had great luck. As such, I'm open to transitioning to a new line of work.

I'm a sharp guy who cleans up well and every employer I've ever had would give me a ringing endorsement. I'm not sure what I'm doing incorrectly, so I'd love some feedback. Please let me know if you have any questions and again, thank you so much for your time."

In my 3rd year of a 5 year Business Admin. program and I absolutely can't stand college.  I feel that I'm on course now to train how to be a slave/desk jockey.  No offense but that's not my thing.  I hate school and being told what to study.  I've had jobs from accounting internships to being a cashier and the only thing I have ever found joy in was officiating soccer matches.

I honestly don't know what to do now.  I'm paying $18,000 a year to go to a school that I hate.  On top of that, the stress is causing me a bunch of physical medical issues and I recently developed a serious allergy (autoimmune triggered) towards the common FD&amp;C food dyes in the US.  That has only put me down more-- being confined to such a strict diet sans the foods that I used to love.

I was considering moving to work or studying abroad near some friends in the UK to get away from some of the stress here.  I'd like to study, but I feel like I'd be just as lost not knowing what to do when I come back.  Working might be an option, but then again I've exhausted most of my professional references and I feel like I would be at a disadvantage if I took that path because of it.

Has anyone been in a remotely similar situation or could anyone spare some insight?

I know that if you lie enough, things will eventually seem to ""come true"", but I really don't lie as often as this post makes it seem. And when I do, weird shit happens. That and I've been plagued with odd coincidence my entire life. Here's just a few of the things that have happened.

- Lied about the winning bid amount of an ebay auction of a guitar I was selling early to keep my mom from asking/bugging me about it, winning bid was exact number I lied when the auction actually ended 4 days later. ($477) 

- Best friend moves away for good, lied to someone that they were moving back, got a call they next day from best friend saying they're moving back at the end of the month.

- Lied to dad about scoring an internship, scored an actual internship next day. 

- Lied to 3rd grade classmates that my dad was friends with a ""famous"" person, within weeks my dad met and befriended an actual ""famous"" person. 

- Told friend I was getting a new tattoo over xmas break, realized I didn't have the money for it, forgot about it, had another friend offer to buy me one as a xmas gift (on a whim, her idea), got tattoo.

- Applied for a PA job with a friend on feature film shooting in my hometown in MS (of which I now live 7 hours away from in a different state). Never heard back, figured we didn't make the cut, forgot about it. 6 months later, ended up home visting my mom, got a call from an out-of-state sound department friend looking for help on that same feature. Got hired in a higher position I originally applied for/was rejected from and got my friend hired too. This is even more remarkable by the fact the sound dept is from NYC, was hired on that feature a week into production because the former sound dept was fired. These guys had been to the South only once before (when I met them) and just happened to remember by chance that I was from Mississippi. This job ended up being a career defining one.

- Was adopted at birth (open adoption, so I knew my birth mother's name and that she was from another state). My mom and I end up moving to a suburb of Jackson, MS. Mom joins neighborhood Bunko league to meet friends her age, is sat on the first night with a woman who talked a lot about her family. It was found out that night that woman is first cousins with my birthmother and they grew up together. I had been playing with this woman's kids not even realizing they were blood relatives of mine. These were the first blood relatives of mine I'd met. 

- Lied to parents about being Key PA on a film (they hate me working in this industry, so I decided to make things sound better than they were) got promoted to Key PA the next day. 

- Stupidly told my screenwriting professor that I had a completed act of a screenplay to turn in as homework when I didn't. He told me to email it to him before lunch (10 minutes away). Thinking I was screwed, I started hastily writing a one act screenplay. Before writing the first slug line, I got a random email from a film student friend of mine I had met when we both interned on a set out of state (he goes to school out of state too) with an attachment of a compressed folder of screenwriting projects he had completed the year before with the subject line ""In case you need it..."" and the message ""Use any of them, I never turned them in. have fun!"" 

That and weird things like really wanting to hear a song or artist and realizing I don't have their CD in my car only to turn on the radio and it be playing. Or knowing I've lost something before it happens. Just the thought ""I'm going to lose this"" and then losing it within the next few days. I'm uber careful with my belongings, but this has happened to me a lot. Or a gut feeling that someone I know has died only to get a call minutes later. This has happened to me three times. 

I finally met my birthmother when I turned 16, and she told me and my birth sister that our family was ""different"" (she wouldn't elaborate past that) and I talked about the weird shit that has happened to me in the past. She only said ""I know. It happens to us too."" I don't know how much of that I believe, but strange stuff does seem to keep occurring. Is it just because I'm aware of it being weird or does this stuff happen to others too?

To make a long story short, I graduated 3 years ago with a BSc Pharmacology (2:2) from a respectable university in London but I have only recently found work (an internship)  which has something to do with my professional field (science). I have been accepted to do an MSc Pharmacology at a university starting this September, and I had applied because I was making absolutely no progress in getting a job within the scientific sector.

So my question to you Reddit, is the following...

In light of the fact that I will only have 5 months experience by september when this internship ends, would it be more beneficial for my professional career to do an MSc Pharmacology or should I just try my best to look for a job then (I'm 25 with no other scintific professional experience other than this internship by the way).

Is there anyone who can perhaps shed some light on this for me as I really need all the help I can get!

Will the Masters really give me an edge that I need or is it better for me to continue working, no matter how trivial the job at the start, for that year instead. MSc vs Work Reddit??

I hope I get an answer here since I really have exhausted myself thinking about this and I've gotten nowhere. Thanks!

I'm a 20yo white male, went to public school in a well-off town, breezed through high school, and never lived to my potential. I wanted to start this way because I'll probably be coming back to it later on.

A little while ago (may have been a couple weeks, possibly a month, I haven't been keeping track of time well lately) I had to drop out of college for the second time. I was technically only a part-time student this time, but I planned on acing my classes and having perfect evidence that I still belonged in school, that my previous academic performance was severely impeded by the fact that my world was just crashing down around me.

Let me take a step back to make things more clear. High school was a weird time for me, freshman year I got straight A's, recommended for all the AP classes, looking toward a very good GPA and plenty of extra curricular activities, exactly what colleges wanted to see. Strangely enough, this was also the year I was most bullied. I don't remember most of the details of getting bullied, like why or to what extent it happened, but I remember one of the kids in my neighborhood scared me. Like he would usually talk about shooting squirrels and blowing up CO2 canisters in his backyard, and to a straight-edge kid like me, I was worried for my own safety. Anyway, after freshman year, I didn't get any trouble from those kids, but I also had a weird revelation. Most people see straight A's and think ""that person can succeed, he has incredible potential, he's gonna go places"" but when I saw them all I could think was ""wow school is easy time to stop trying"". I got mostly B's for the rest of high school, and countless people around me asked why I didn't apply myself. I got back tests, and people around me would stare in awe. ""You got 100%? Why in the hell do you never take 2 seconds to do your homework and get an A in your classes?"" and my response was always ""I don't really care, I have better things to do"". Truth was, I didn't have better things to do. Every single time I got a progress report saying that I'm borderline failing because I don't do homework, my parents would ground me. For me, grounding basically meant no video games, because I never did much outside of school, except an occasional night at a friend's house playing Warhammer (I was an exciting guy in high school, as you can tell). The point of me telling all this is to point out that in the face of adversity, I had the potential to succeed if I just put a little effort in. But I ended up at the state university, which is basically what I wanted. My first choice of school was a state school, just 5 hours away from where I live. Parents didn't want me doing that, they knew me better than I did, they needed to be within driving distance for when something went wrong.

So I hated them for a little while (in that teenager way), usually when I had to make up a reason I had to go to our own state school (that was embarrassing for me considering my potential, especially since 2 of the people I was most often compared to are currently at MIT). Eventually I got over it, found a bunch of friends that would be going there too, and decided to make the best of it. But I never got the memo about using every ounce of potential that I had, even with something as little as keeping deadlines. Summer before freshman year, I had to fill out a form to get housing. I waited until my mom asked me about it, and by then it was a week past the last day, so I was at the mercy of the housing department at a public university. Honors housing was out of the question, I was just relieved to have a room once it was announced. I ended up in the East campus quad, which at the time meant nothing to me. I moved in, met my roommate, we were both fairly awkward so we stuck together but didn't talk much, sat in silence at a table in the corner at the dining hall. Not long after we moved in, though, a very charismatic guy introduces himself to me, asks if I wanna play frisbee with all his friends. A chance to meet people? Sign me up. As I get to know everybody, I find out that they all lived there the year before. But as time goes on, I learn even more about the history of this group. The charismatic leader, I'll call him D, was very chill in past years because he had the luxury of indulging in his love of marijuana every day (the whole dorm smelled of weed constantly, not a surprise once I found out that most of the people in the quad were basically hippies). Only issue with this was that he had switched majors, and wanted to be a police officer now, so he had to be clean. Having been kept mellow by drugs, he was starting to get very hostile. He would regularly try to wrestle with people, and over time he decided that I was the best choice of opponent. He was about 6 inches shorter than me, but was much more fit than I, and so even if I tried to resist, he would pin me easily, even violently. Unfortunately, I was very soft-spoken, and I didn't want to lose my only group of friends, so I never spoke out against his behavior to any authority figures. I just lived with it, suffered through it.

One day, what I mistook at the time to be a blessing, but learned later was just another pitfall, I met a very beautiful girl. My history with females was an interesting one; I had crushes in the past, only managed to ask one out ever, and was rejected. Still a virgin, still hadn't even as much as kissed a girl when I entered freshman year. This girl, I'll call her K, changed my life. When I first saw her, all I could think is ""wow she's really pretty, too bad she's way out of my league"". One of the friends I was with knew her from before, so we went over and started hanging out with her friends. The whole time, I couldn't stop trying to talk to her. I even attempted flirting with her the whole time, but lacking any experience with girls, I basically just tried to compliment her about every possible thing at any chance I got. At the end of the day, I went back to my room with the idea that my attempts had failed, that this was just another girl that was way too pretty to like me. However the next morning I went to my 8AM class, and came back to a note on my door from her. It said ""Hi Interns, love from K"" (D called me and my roommate his ""interns"" as we were a few of the only freshmen in the dorm). I took this opportunity to write one back to her, copying her bubble letters and rainbow color scheme, and putting it on her door that night. The next day, I found a series of hot pink post-its on my door, and although I can't remember exactly what they said, I remember they included her full name and her phone number, and this time she addressed them directly to me. So I found her on facebook, and I texted her to share my number, and I thought to myself ""what an unorthodox way of becoming friends"" because I was still too naive to understand where she wanted to go with this. In fact, we hung out one night and when we got to her room, I said good night and walked away. Not because I was playing hard to get, but because I thought we were destined to be only friends. The next night she made sure I made it into her room (she had a single), and then into her bed, and we kinda just laid there because I didn't know what came next. I innocently looked at her and asked if we were supposed to kiss, and then I leaned in and it happened. My first kiss, in the midst of having no idea where my life was headed. Less than 5 minutes later I fidgeted to readjust my...assets, if you will. She asked what was wrong, I seemed uncomfortable, I explained as my face turned bright red, and she laughed. She asked if she could see it, and who was I to tell a beautiful girl not to reach down my pants. so she goes down there to investigate, and I'm really nervous, being my first time, and all I hear is a gasp. I ask what's wrong, and she looks at me and just whispers ""it's gorgeous"". As one could imagine, this did wonders for my self esteem. She said she couldn't contain herself, and that night I lost my virginity. Same night I first kissed a girl, and all this the same night I found out we were going to be more than friends. It was pretty overwhelming. Over the next few weeks, we had an interesting relationship. She was usually busy with a ton of school work, and I was still trying to understand everything that had happened. On weekends, we played xbox together and had sex fairly regularly. Until one night, the Thursday before our week off for Thanksgiving, when I paused during sex because I heard her crying. She said she needed to be alone, and sent me back to my room with no idea what happened. The next day before she left for the week, she told me that she needed to think about everything. Being the idiot that I was, I decided not to text her while she thought about everything. Brilliant idea, don't stack the deck in your own favor, I thought I was being very mature by letting her think things through without interfering. A week later we get back to school and we talk about it. She tells me she can't handle a relationship with me, but instead of elaborating, decided to say ""we can still be friends, and maybe get back together at a later date"". This may have been in response to seeing my face, which I imagine as being puppy dog ideas to the extreme, but regardless, it gave me immense amounts of false hope. We hung out for the rest of the semester, basically nothing changed except that we no longer had sex. In fact, we hung out more when we weren't together than during the short few weeks we were.

So after winter recess, we return for another semester. I have high hopes that enough time has passed and enough stress is gone that we can finally have a relationship. First day back, I find out she had a new guy, she started talking to him at the beginning of December, about a week after we broke up. Over time, I stopped seeking her out to hang out, only hung out when she asked, because all I could think of was her boyfriend. As I saw it, he was my replacement. Eventually we stopped talking, until one day about a month later. She wanted to have lunch and catch up. Somebody had told her that I hated her and didn't want to have anything to do with her, which is why we stopped talking. I reassured her that wasn't the case, and dug deeper into this dark situation. We went back to being relatively friendly, until one day she came into the game room in our dorm building. I was there hanging out with my friend who was scheduled to work and just tended to play pool for 5 hours and get paid. She came in with one of her friends and they started playing pool. She invited me to play with them, and I obliged because my friend had started working on homework. I was much better than them at pool, so she kept trying to mess me up when it was my turn. One time she stood right in the way of my shot, so I had to put my arms around her and shoot. I didn't think anything of it at the time. Eventually her friend left, and then my friend told us he was closing but would leaving the room open because the RAs of the building were in the second half of the game room watching a movie. So she sat me down and asked if I'm okay with knowing she's dating another guy. I lied and said I was, but she could tell I wasn't. We talked for a while, until the RAs came out and said they were closing it down for the night so we had to get out. We walked back up to my room and I jokingly complained that I didn't wanna go back to my room, so she invited me to play xbox with her. This was about 11PM at this point, to give an idea of what time it was. Time flew by really fast, and next thing I knew it was 4 in the morning. She puts her controller down, looks over at me, and says ""if the RAs hadn't been in the next room, things would have gone differently down there"" and I immediately remembered the pool shot I made around her body. I couldn't focus for the next hour, and she finally sent me back to my room at 5 in the morning. I linger at her door, wishing I could do something about what she had said. When I get back to my room, I noticed she had texted me, apologizing for being a tease. I respond that I just wanted to kiss her, and asking her if I could. She responded ""...maybe"", and I was much more excited than I should have been. I jumped out of bed and made a beeline for her room, meeting her halfway. We went back to her room and she cheated on her boyfriend with me, at 5:30 in the morning. We went to the dining hall when it opened at 7, then both went to our own rooms and went to sleep. For the rest of the semester, about a month and a half if I recall correctly, we spent about 10 hours each day in the lounge of our building, on a couch in the corner, flirting while everybody else in the room tried to get homework done.

Now while all this was happening, my studies were struggling. First semester I did fine, As and Bs, but while all this crazy stuff was happening, we weren't together but spent every day like we were, I only ever went to one of my 4 classes. And it was only because a friend of mine was also in the class and wouldn't let everything that was happening get me kicked out of school. He woke me up every day for the class, did all the homework with me, even had me call the mental health department on campus and set up weekly appointments. Looking back, I see that what he tried to do was probably one of the greatest and most helpful things anybody had done for me. That semester I failed all my classes, except the one my friend made sure I kept track of. I got an A in that class.

And it went even farther downhill from here. When I went home for the summer, and my parents found out I had failed all my classes except one, they couldn't believe it. I did my best to explain the situation, but the whole thing was a fairly sensitive subject and the venom I heard in my father's voice as he asked me exactly what the fuck could have gone wrong, I couldn't bring myself to explain it all. I gave vague details, promised it wouldn't happen again. I was on academic watch, and I knew it was serious business. I found a living situation with my best friend from high school, who I hadn't really talked to much during this whole thing, but he kept me in mind when housing was an option. I was around much less toxic people, had a good working environment, and most importantly, I was across campus from K. We started the semester by hanging out once a week, catching up for a few hours, and then going on with our lives. I was getting all my work done, enjoying classes, really learning for the first time since I started school. Then I got the text. About the middle of October if memory serves, K told me that her boyfriend was planning to propose, but instead broke up with her. She spent a week at home recovering, then came back to campus and asked way more of me than was fair. But me, still holding on to ""oh we can be friends then get back together"", did everything she wanted without a second thought. I started sacrificing class time to hang out with her and keep her happy. She started getting back on her feet, but I didn't. I kept skipping class, avoiding school work, ended up with a sleep schedule that included passing out on a couch in our apartment at 4 every morning, then waking up at noon when somebody came back from class and woke me up for food. And then at the end of November, K broke the news that she had found ANOTHER new guy. By this time, there was no recovering in my classes. Over winter break I had to plead my case to the department of engineering, promise to make progress meetings throughout the semester with the dean, and meet with somebody every week to keep me on top of my work. The semester started off the same as the one before, and this time K was living at home and taking classes at the campus near where she lived, 2 hours away from the main campus. I was finally free, because it's not possible for her to keep me out of my classes from so far away, right? Sadly, that's wrong. This semester, instead of plaguing me with the weight of a breakup, asking me to be there through everything, and then finding another guy and leaving me with ""we can get back together....eventually""; instead of all that, she just flirted with me over facebook messaging. Valentine's day, she tells me she's single, and we start reminiscing about our relationship, she says she misses, blah blah blah. I say ""blah blah blah"" because I don't remember most of what it says, but it brought back the awful sleep schedule because I could never fall asleep by any means except pure exhaustion.

This time, I had already used up all my ""try again"" cards. I had lied to my adviser about what work i was getting done, I neglected to keep any appointments with the dean, and I failed most of my classes again. This was the spring semester of 2012. Summer of that year, I had to look into taking classes part-time, in an attempt to get back into school full-time. I moved my therapist from campus to one in my town, and I saw a huge difference. This therapist figured me out immediately, and she wasn't afraid to tell me the truth. She flat-out told me that I need to drop K however I can. So that summer I told her everything that went wrong in my life because of her, but being the idiot that I am, said we could stay friends as long as she doesn't flirt with me or anything. Luckily I figured it out, and within a week removed her from everything. The last thing I heard from her was the following semester, when I was part-time on the main campus, I was in class with one of her friends, who told her I was still taking classes, and she asked me about it. I ignored her, and haven't heard from her since.

Now I wish this was where my story ended. That semester (fall 2012) I had 2 part-time classes, and I had all the time to focus on them, no distractions, and because of this I excelled. Aced them both very easily. Unfortunately I missed the deadline for apply for readmission (I assumed it was between semesters, it was actually during the semester). So I signed up for more part-time classes this semester. Taking a step back one more time, over the summer I had talked to one of my good friends from high school, and found out we both enjoy League of Legends. He introduced me to an entire vent server of people who I could potentially bond with, and it seemed really fun. I balanced work and fun very well during the fall, and everybody in the group seemed to like me, it felt pretty good to have a lot of people enjoy spending time with me, and sharing something I really enjoyed.

Less than a month into the new semester, I met a girl from the group, let's call her V. She had been in the group before but she almost never talked and she was rarely on. When I first played with her, I didn't know what to expect, and I told myself that everything she said was completely sarcastic and that she didn't like me at all. The next time we played, though, she messaged me after the game asking if we had played WoW together. I hadn't played WoW, so I said no and that was that. But I was so surprised that this happened, I had to ask somebody. So I messaged my friend that brought me into the group, and he jokingly said that she doesn't know how to talk and that she must really be in love with me to message me. He would call her my girlfriend for a while whenever i freaked out to him that she was online. I was too nervous to talk to her, or to push to be friends on skype or steam or anything.

Fast forward back to this semester, less than a month in. Just a regular Friday night, I'm at home because I didn't plan to visit my friends at school that weekend. We got on vent together and she talked and talked and talked. I was so surprised, something had obviously changed since before when she was silent. She answered this fairly quickly on her own. She asked if I had ever been in love, because she had just been dumped by this guy after 3 years of dating. She was always silent on vent and rarely online because she was spending all her time with him, and he got jealous if he found out she was talking to other guys. So we start talking more and more, and I was really just there to listen to her talk through everything. I still had only experience with one girl, and it didn't really help me understand relationships at all.

This all started about 3 months ago, I think. Honestly I don't remember, time has gotten away from me. The most important part of this story is what my therapist tried to tell me. She said that I sit at my computer and wait for that little notice that said V messaged me on skype, in a way similar to people who are addicted to slot machines, pulling the lever and getting depressed until it comes back with a win, then you can't leave because of the rush of winning. At this point, I was having trouble waking up for classes, and the anxiety started to snowball to the point that missing classes and work was the reason I couldn't wake up to go to class, and that's what made me realize I had to drop out. I thought about it a lot, and I realized that every time before then, there was some thing I could do to make everything better, and regardless of whether I chose to do it, it made me feel better knowing there was a way out. It finally got to the point where I asked myself why I feel this way and the answer was ""because"". For me, a very mathematically and scientifically oriented person, it bothers me when I can't find an explanation, and it was even worse when I realized it was my own brain that was telling me I couldn't figure it out.

The last thing I did about V was tell her we couldn't talk as much as before (instead of just cutting it off completely like my therapist suggested). That lasted about a week, and it has gotten to the point where this past weekend I spent upwards of 20 hours on private skype calls with her while we play Tera. I made excuses all weekend as to why I didn't want to interact with any of my other friends.
To make things even worse, a ton of the people on our vent server come to me for advice, or just for somebody to vent to, and they all think I have my life together. People who I lie to on a daily basis about my life, my education, everything, they trust me with their issues, secrets, and value my opinion and my time. While all this is happening, I have been lying to my therapist about talking to V; I told my therapist that I cut all ties with her.

I am already planning to get into a program that is more rigorous than 1 hour of therapy a week, so this is really just to vent. I apologize if it's hard to read at some points, it took me almost 2 hours to write in total and I lost my train of thought a few times. I appreciate any responses, whether you have a question about something unclear, or you have an experience to share that I may be able to learn from."

Occasionally I worry that I look like a job-hopper, but that is far from the truth. Three of the jobs I list are short, but they were either internships or summer jobs while I was in college from 2006-2010. If anything, my ultimate goal is to find a company culture that I can stick with for years. I would value the continuity. (There is a gap between August 2010 - November 2011 when I was working for my father in an unrelated industry. That said, I've had stable employment since November 2011, so I'm not sure that gap matters.)

This is my business resume. I do have other PA and casting experience that I didn't include for the sake of space and relevance. I came to Los Angeles almost two years ago intending to get into production, but I haven't had great luck. As such, I'm open to transitioning to a new line of work.

I'm a sharp guy who cleans up well and every employer I've ever had would give me a ringing endorsement. I'm not sure what I'm doing incorrectly, so I'd love some feedback. Please let me know if you have any questions and again, thank you so much for your time."

Let's ignore how poor I'm dressing for the moment. I'm stumped. I have an idea about how to shop for clothing but no idea about what makes a ""good bag"". 

There's an employees gym in the building and I want to take advantage of that. I'd also like to carry my laptop and a thin notepad. I've looked at the sidebar and I didn't see anything that would allow me to do all three in one bag. I saw the Adidas bag for $40 which is absolutely perfect if I need to use 2 bags. I would like to spend $50-$150 on a bag, with the intention that if I'm spending more I'd like the item to last longer and work with more of my clothing. 

Like I said, I have no idea about what a ""good bag"" looks like. I start work on Wednesday, May 1st and will going shopping tomorrow to get a belt. If possible, I'd like to use online resources to see what good bags look like then try and pick one up in Calgary tomorrow.

1dcedx,1,2013-04-29,[Canada] When to switch from renting to buying?,RussetWolf,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1dcedx/canada_when_to_switch_from_renting_to_buying/,"So this question is very far in the future for me, but I'm definitely a planner and want PF's opinion on this issue both specifically and in general.

*Background Info*
I'm halfway through a 5-year bachelor's degree with a co-op (similar to internships) program which, combined with contributions from parents, is enabling me to not require student loans. When I graduate in 2015, I expect to be in a job right away with $6 000 in the bank. My expected income is between $45 000 and $60 000 gross (according to PayScale, median pay is $50 000). My partner's employment prospects are less guaranteed, but at absolute worst case, she'll be able to secure something full-time at minimum wage ($10.25/hr) so just over $17 000 gross per year. She won't have any student loan debt after graduation either. We don't carry any consumer debt and have healthy credit scores. 

We plan on staying where we are now after graduation since here or Toronto are the two main hubs of employment in my industry, and cost of living in Toronto is higher. Rent here is about $800-$1200 (without utilities) for non student accommodation and our budget is about $1350/month not including rent, utilities, or transportation. We will eventually want a car, but the local public transit system is more than enough for our needs and the town is fairly narrow so there is a good chance we could be living walking/biking distance from our places of employment. 

Housing prices are currently around $200 000 - $300 000, and we would be doing a minimum 20% down payment (my partner has sufficient savings to cover her half of that and with our expected rate of saving, my half would follow easily after a year or two). We have our eyes on a nice building downtown which has condos available both for rent (higher end of the range) and purchase (price dependent on the specific model and number of bedrooms), but we're willing to live in a less trendy spot if it makes more sense financially. The benefit of the condo though is that the condo fee covers maintenance and stuff that neither of us knows much about and the spot is very desirable - if we were to purchase a second property in the future, the condo would likely have appreciated in value and/or it would make a solid rental income. 

So, at what point does it make sense to switch from renting to buying?"

1dcd5l,4,2013-04-29,Need someone to talk to. Bipolar and in college.,down_atm,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1dcd5l/need_someone_to_talk_to_bipolar_and_in_college/,"I had posted this in r/bipolar a day or two ago,  but felt I should post in here...

Okay,  I am in a huge state of depression.  

I have never felt inclined to write under a throwaway before, but the things that I really feel just do not belong on real account. Please note that this is just a flow of thoughts.  Things may be very scattered,  I am kind of emotional. 

**Background:**  The past semester I have been trying to maintain a positive outlook on life, though I have had mild swings throughout the semester.  The past month or so I have just been rapid cycling as the stress from school increases.  Around three weeks ago I was in the floor in almost a state of shock from the depression.  I actually hurt myself a little by hitting my head against the side of the couch,  when the depression hits the pressure in my head is really intense causing migraines.  After this period I was up, and I mean way up.  I am a designer, and the quality of my work is better than it has ever been.  Things were going really well, but I kept telling myself in private that I was going to crash.  

**The Trigger:** After this manic state where I effectively had myself believing that my work was some of the best, and I had really gotten into learning my subject, I walk into class on Thursday.  (I had applied for an internship that I really wanted a few weeks prior,  I worked most of my semester trying for this one internship.)  On Thursday I arrive at class to find out that the interviews were on that day, and mine was in 20 min.  I guess my mania kind of kicked in at that moment, I was able to run 1.5 miles to the interview location.  I arrived and thought I did okay in the interview (at the time, due to the mania), but looking back I think I looked insane.  The burst of adrenaline combined with my mania had me feeling good, like I needed to go sky diving kinda good.

**Today:**  I received an email saying that I was not accepted, though I put more effort than most into this position.  Honestly, this small part of me is totally fine with this outcome.  It gives me more free time this summer.  However,  now the depression is back.  It has came on hard,  I find myself doing my usual (weird) talking to myself thing.  I will keep saying die, die , die.  It is really becoming to much.  It is like my two sides are constantly fighting for control.  

**Feelings:** I just wish I was normal sometimes.  I wish that I could just cry, come to terms with things, and move on, but no I have to be this kid who wants to find the nearest dark corner and hide in it.  I do not see myself as suicidal, so why do I keep saying die, just end it, fuck it?  I actually had a civil discussion with myself today. I realized that maybe I do not want to die, I just want that person inside of me dead.  That nagging voice that is always there telling me how horrible I am, how bad at things I am.  (The voice that is usually confirmed through others, because my communication skills and ability to relate to others really really sucks. My ideas are sometimes right and justified down to the smallest details, but no one has the time to sit around and wait on me to figure out how to verbalize it.)  Anyway,  I decided to shave my head today in some symbolic death of the depression.  I told myself that suicide is illogical, and that I needed to get back up and move on.  I am still kind of in a state where I just want to cry.  I just want that piece of my subconscious to leave me alone.

This is like a war, that no one but my SO really knows is going on inside of my head.  He really helps me, but there is only so much he can do. 

**Medications**: If there are any questions on what I am taking to cope I will give you the run down.  I have been on lithium in my past, but I was going to the free clinic where I essentially became a number.  I was prescribed Lithium, and was on it for about a year.  I slipped up and forgot a session, this kicked me out of the system.  They told me that in order to regain my status as a patient I would have to come at 6 in the morning, to a town 2 hours away, and wait in line to re-register as a new patient.  This line usually takes around 3 hours with some terrifying people.  I have not be able to make it back.  Though the lithium was causing me nausea and headaches anyway...  Mostly because it require food for each dose, and as a college kid, I really do not have the money for much food.  I took no medication for around another year, and kept away from most stressful situations.  I even began meditating.  Now we come to today,  to cope with the stress I smoke weed.  1-2 times bowls per day, nothing major. Though it helps me be positive and stay productive.  

**TLDR:** I am really depressed, and need some help."

It was my first encounter with the dreaded, tech-impaired **users**. 

The most frequent customer at the IT department was and older lady, in her low 60's perhaps. I was warned early on to question everything she asked for, because most of it was just nonsense. My first encounter proved the warning to be justified.

She came down to the basement where me and the two veterans sat, and told us about her friends, and how they had internet for their laptops.

""So I was wondering if you could put internet on this."" she said, and reached into her purse. She pulled up a floppy. 
I don't think I have ever bit my lip that hard.



The next time she came down her friends had impressed her yet again, but this time with a portable harddrive. She wanted us to remove her harddrive so she could bring it home with her. IT-veteran#1 tried to patiently explain to her that she would have a hard time plugging in the harddrive at home.

She later wanted me to come to her house and fix her computer, but IT-veteran#1 wasn't comfortable letting me go there alone, so we suggested that she could bring it in and I'd do it at the office. Unfortunately she wasn't too happy about having to pull out and then reconnect the cables, so that never happened either.

At the time I was shocked, but I have since come to realize that we are all oblivious in some or several areas of knowledge, and might ask equally stupid questions in some other field. At least she was fairly friendly."

Born and raised in Canada ; currently living in France ; I have both French and Canadian citizenship. Never applied for a visa in my life, so feeling a little overwhelmed, especially with the clock ticking!

Not a student, don't have a bachelors degree or any of that jazz. However, I am a (french) certified early childhood educator assistant as well as certified environmental and outdoor educator. 


Why am I going?
I'm going to join forces with my (french) SO who is going there for his last year of university. I've found an organization who is willing to welcome me for an internship, but an unpaid one. I would really like to do this internship, since the project is right up my alley, and the experience would be beneficial to my career as an EO educator.


The obstacles :
American visas are very specific and it is difficult to be able to talk to anyone to gain some clarity (hence why I am turning to you all lovely folks!). I would like to have a working visa in order to have a part-time job while working on my internship. Trouble is, is that not only is it hard to find a job whilst overseas, but also that if I get in on my internship, I don't have the legal right to work elsewhere. Which is problematic, since I'm not getting paid for my internship and rent, groceries and bills don't pay themselves.


Some questions :
As a Canadian, I can stay as a tourist for 3 months/90 days. Is it crazy to think to ask for a working visa if I find a job during those 3 months?

How long are visa waiting times for generally?

Does anyone have any experience out staying this 3 month period? What happens?

Any other words of advice, words of encouragement, etc.?


Thanks a bunch in advance!

Then i decided, that this job wasn't inspiring at all in the long term, i wanted to be part of big projects, the reason BTW i had to accept the previous job, is because i came fresh of college broke and needed to support my family. So i applied to Virginia Tech, i got accepted for a master program in the same field.

Right around the same time, i had mitigating family cirumstances that i had to be aborad ""France"" for a period of time...

- One year left of an MA in journalism (done with the classes, only the thesis remains)
- BA in marketing
- Work experience: One year as a full-time teacher after my BA, plus a bunch of different extracurricular activities while studying.
- Currently doing an internship as part of my masters degree

I'm from Europe but the internship is in the Philippines. My employer is a very well-renowned company, but not really relevant to my education, and work is slow and kind of boring. The pay is symbolic (but enough to survive on due to the relatively low living costs here). I don't really have much of a social life either, but life is okay I guess. I was just offered an extension of my internship and I am clueless what to do. 

Apart from the year of teaching I've been studying ever since high school. Tried different stuff and changed disciplines a couple of times, hence my age. I'm turning 27 this year, so I'm not really among the youngest anymore. I consider these to be my options:

- Accept the extended internship and stay here for another half a year.
- Go back home, try to find a more interesting/relevant part-time job

For my summer break I have two options: 1) take intensive mandarin language courses over the summer, or 2) take a paid internship at a homeland security consulting firm in D.C. 

On the surface it look like an easy choice, but here's why its not. 

My focus in graduate school is on international security and asian studies - specifically China. It is my hope (crosses fingers) that when I graduate in a year I can get a job with the US State Department as an Asian policy analyst. I've had numerous professors tell me that Chinese language skills are held as a premium within the State Department and the Intelligence Community. So that's one big + for the language program. I'd be developing a very important skill that I can build on during the school year w/ additional mandarin classes.

The internship at the consulting firm would help me break into the DC network (since DC is very much a relationship-based town). This will obviously help me down the line when I am looking for jobs. Plus, having a security consulting firm on the resume never hurt anybody. On the downside, this firm has a mostly domestic border-security focus; its only international focus is on latin america, not asia. I'm not interested in border security exactly. Plus I wouldn't be developing any new skills, nor would I get any security clearance. 

I've been going back and forth on this for the past week, talking to any knowledgable people I know. The basic gist of my problem is this: 

What will help me in my career the most (w/ an eye towards the State Department)? Will it be the network (which *could* enable me to break into DC and then move laterally to State at a later time) or the language skills (which would add significant points to my application at State, assuming they're hiring in a year).

So I was hired for a position back in February with their understanding that I would not be able to begin work until after I graduate from college. I haven't smoked in 4 months because of the possibilities of getting randomly tested at an internship that I had. Anyways, I start work about 3 weeks from now and have recently got my new hires package with all the information (I'm assuming) about my company and their policies in it. There is a policy about a Drug-free workplace where they mention that all drug-use is prohibited while working. They state that the policy only applies whenever anyone is representing the company, i.e. all working hours. It discusses Searches, Consequences, and all that jazz, but there is no mention of a drug-screening (pre-employment or post-employment) or anything regarding to drug tests.

So I have a couple questions: 

- If they do not mention anything about tests or random screenings, does it mean they will not do them/cannot do them because it has not been stated before hand? 

- Should I contact my HR representative and discuss the drug policy with them about whether or not a I need to complete a drug-screening test before my first workday?

- Also, I need to mention that I am contracted through my hiring company to another company. Does that mean I follow my primary company as well as the other companies policies? Like even though my primary does not mention drug-tests/may not do one, am I obligated to follow the secondary company if they ask for a drug-screening?

- I'm from WA state. What are the laws surrounding pre/post-employment drug testing?

I then thought it's now or never, and proceeded to tell them that I don't believe in what JWs teach anymore, and that's why I haven't been going out in field service as often.

Now, my dad is known for his bad temper, but he surprisingly took this very calmly. I'm not gonna go into everything we discussed, because you know how it goes. But my dad decided to call over an elder, and that elder came with a second elder. They proceeded to say that they were shocked, because they weren't expecting this from me, but I was expecting that reaction from them, because everyone ""loved me"" in the congregation.

My dad insisted that I write a letter to resign from my MS position and then disassociate myself...but I don't know how necessary that is since they all know that I'm not going back to the kingdom hall. They're probably going to disfellowship me anyway since I'm an ""apostate"" now, so letter or no letter, the result will be the same.

To my surprise I wasn't kicked out on the spot. But I left the house and went on a bike ride, to get away from it all. Then I got the idea of calling all my family members (since only my immediate family are JWs) and told them I'm not a JW anymore and apologized for the way I treated them in the past. My grandma started crying tears of joy when I told her, and it brought tears to my eyes as well. I texted my uncle, and he actually picked me up, and I decided to spend the night at his place.

I didn't initially want to stay the night, but after hearing my dad say I'm nonexistent to him now, I decided to stay (and surprise! they haven't even called to see where I am). I'm going back in the morning since I have to go to work, but I'm probably going to pack my stuff tomorrow or the next time my uncle has a day off. And his wife is trying to get me an internship at her workplace, which is perfect since I just finished my degree.

So that's where I am right now. I'm so grateful that I have my close friends and my extended family to turn to, because I know other people have had it worse."

I need all the eyes on my resume I can get.,itsscience,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1dbj4k/engineering_student_about_to_graduate_with_no/,"Here it is, thank you very much for any and all feedback:

https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-T1iWg68FwwMWlaVS1udXh3X28/edit?usp=sharing

Last Spring I had a great internship lined up, was told to start on Monday, then had my hiring manager call me up over the weekend to tell me there had been a mistake and the position was never budgeted by the higher-ups in the company. Because I thought I had a paid internship, I never signed up for Summer classes and had no financial aid coming in, so I had to scramble to find a job outside my major to live off of. I got tunnel vision just working and then finishing school, and I never landed an internship. 

My upside is that my grades are good and my senior design project was much more of a real-world undertaking than just about any other project by students in my major, so I'm touting that. I put the skills section up top, trying to show first what I can do for the company rather than try to wow them with my accolades. Also, I included an objective statement at the behest of my friend, who went ballistic when he saw that I didn't have one and said that's a mistake that will land my resume in the trash. I see from the FAQ here that this community takes the opposite stance, though.

I've met so many wonderful people, I love my school, I'm happy with my major, and finally feel like I have some semblance of direction in my life.

But *nooooo*.

I find out that almost all of my friends, from here *and* from my last school, will be in New York this summer for really awesome internships. On top of that, I found out my ex-best friend (who I harbor a lot of hostility towards, I'll be honest) has some internship in Europe. Now I feel like a total failure. I know that I'm not, but this whole transfer process has taken so much out of me...I've had to adjust and watch as my friends configured their lives while I was just depressed and lonely. Now, everyone has fucking internships and I'll be working at an ice cream shop this summer. 

I realize that I sound really ungrateful. I'm so happy that I even *got in* to the school I go to, it's one of the top schools in the country! That makes me so proud. I'm happy that I have some source of income, however unexciting. Plus, I have a lot of really cool trips planned for this summer--London and Los Angeles! Totally cool. 

Despite all of this, I can't help but compare myself to all of my friends and feel jealous and resentful. For one, now that I'm *out* of New York, everyone moves there, *and* I just haven't found a job supplementary to my desired career field (television, which is competitive as fuck to begin with). I'm concerned that puts me at a disadvantage. Ugh, and I'm totally not looking forward to hearing about how much fun they had in NYC because I'm a bitter, angsty adolescent and I can't be happy for anyone.

I don't know. I just want to live my life on my own terms, because I do have a lot to be excited about, but I just can't seem to appreciate any of it. I'm back to wanting to cry and cut myself and listen to the Smiths all the time.

I just want to be happy but I can't for the life of me figure out how. Shit sucks, man."
1dbfcz,17,2013-04-28,Help me replace a lost and much-loved part of my fiancé's makeup kit?,themadthinker,MakeupAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/1dbfcz/help_me_replace_a_lost_and_muchloved_part_of_my/,"Hi there MUAers,

I'm reaching out in the hope that the combined encyclopedic knowledge of this subreddit could help me find what this item of makeup my fiancé lost was, or else suggest an equivalent replacement.

About a year ago, she lost one of the key components of her impromptu hitting the town gear — an under-eye application from Neutrogena. She's an intern doctor, so sometimes the opportunity to go out lands without much chance for preparation, or at the end of a long week. This thin cylinder was something she swore by, and would throw on to cool her eyes, and reduce puffiness, discoloration, and general eye-crappiness.

Here's the thing, it's not the [Neutrogena Eye Brightener](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/healthy+skin+brightening+eye+perfector+broad+spectrum+spf+25.do), but it was something similar. She says it was a similar cylinder, with a brush. But that there was no concealer in it, and that it just tightened things up, and made her eyes feel ""more awake"".

Unfortunately, we've never been able to find this mystical stuff again, so I'm reaching out in the hopes someone can point me in the right direction, so I can find her a replacement. She's not much of a makeup-user, so it might be possible that she's misremembering something about it. Or else maybe it's discontinued (it was getting a bit beat-up around the edges by the time it was lost anyway).

Does anyone have any idea what I'm talking about? If not, any recommendations for something that might work in its stead — a quick application to the eyes to reduce puffiness and generally feel cool before heading out after a long day?

Thanks everyone for all their help, and apologies for further lack of specifics and general knowledge on the makeup front.

TL;DR: Like [Neutrogena Eye Brightener](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/healthy+skin+brightening+eye+perfector+broad+spectrum+spf+25.do), but without the concealer.

I wanted to get some perspective about some stuff that's been on my mind, so here goes..

I'm currently a sophomore at a state school on track to graduate after Spring 2015. I might have the opportunity to intern this summer at a pretty small start-up that's been around for ~1 year.

However, if I forgo the internship and take a few summer classes instead, I'll be able to graduate after Fall 2014. Theoretically, I should still be able to land an internship next Summer if I decide to do this.

My concern is whether not taking this year's internship would affect salary negotiations after graduation. Would not taking this internship set me up for a potentially lower salary after graduation since I'd have less experience? Should I just do the internship this year, one next year and stay the extra semester?

**tl;dr:** Should I do just one internship and graduate early or two internships and graduate on time? Will having one internship instead of two affect me much?"

I've continued to bring up the fact that I want to be together with her, and she usually tells me she's not ready, but there's literally no difference than being in a relationship. 

We're about to be done with our finals and heading on a road trip to Los Angeles so I can start my internship in LA, and she can stay with me for a week and we can explore the city, and show her around since she's never been there. 

We're not the outgoing couple by any stretch of the imagination. We love just being with each other. Our best nights are when we are lazy in bed together, watching a movie or just listening to music. However, we do like going on adventures, but as introverts go, we like to go on nice little dates, and camp every so often. We like to explore nice scenic places, but not something that would eat up too energy.

I want to make this trip the best one possible, by going on adventures along the way and during our time in Los Angeles. However, this is the first time I've ever planned on doing something like this. Would /r/relationships help me out and help plan the best trip? (and perhaps win her over again)

I thought it was pretty much guaranteed due to an agreement with my community college, but for some reason I didn't get it. I'm going to talk to an advisor on Monday and the assistant dean at UVA about this, but in the mean time I'm pondering about what I can do for the future. 

Say I do get waitlisted, and I don't get into UVA for fall. There is a two year grace period after I get my associates at my Community College, and I'm pretty sure I'm guaranteed during those two years. I will check to make sure, but I'm almost certain. 

There are some things I can do:

I can a) Wait a year, and go to UVA. This is what I'm leaning towards because I spent the last year doing it solely for this, but apparently I didn't get it. And I love the school of UVA, and it also has a good computer science program. If I do this option, what can I do during this time to increase my stock as a CS major? Should I get an internship or a job? I am planning on doing other things to help the other areas of my life(basketball and writing).

or I could go b ) and go back to George Mason. That's where I originally went to, but I really don't want to go there. I just did not enjoy my time there, and based on academic standings, UVA blows GMU out of the water. I've done a year and a half at GMU, so I'd have to do the same amount of credits at each school(UVA or GMU), but GMU would be done quicker.

The students were required to perform a twelve minute run; tread water and swim one length of the pool, perform slant position pull-ups (women) or chin-ups (men) and sit-ups as well as show proficiency in at least two team sports by passing skill tests.

After several years of testing students, norms were established for men and women. Guidelines were implemented that indicated any student who failed any of the tests were allowed to take and pass and activity course in the failed area, or practice on their own and repeat the tests the following quarter.

The assumption for the program was that anyone who was motivated to be a practitioner in a physical activity profession should be able to demonstrate a minimal level of physical fitness and have some proficiency in various sports skills.

We worked the same summer internship and go to the same university. He and I were like two identical souls, seriously.

 Eventually our friendship got physical. We went on several serious dates, and eventually had sex. I've dated before, but I have never been so intimate with anyone as I have been with him. But, when I brought it up, he said he wasn't ready for a relationship, and that he referred to himself as a 'lone wolf.' But maybe later. Anyway, we continued to hook up, and we have been, on and off, for the last 8 months.

But anymore, most of the time he breaks our plans, comes up with excuses, or acts like a jerk to me. I get so upset and frustrated  that sometimes I get physically sick over it. Not only is this reaction unhealthy, I want to get over him, because now I compare every new guy in my life to him. It's hard, because I definitely have feelings for him. I'd probably feel the same about him if he were 300 pounds, couldn't walk, and had a giant tumor growing out of his chest. Yeah, that bad. And it doesn't help I'm about 15 pounds above what an ideal weight for a thin girl is (This is completely accurate) so my self-esteem is low. I do take good care of myself else-wise though, and there are other interested guys.

A lot of people will probably want to suggest I drop all contact with him. But I can't just avoid him, as we travel in the same friend circle, will be working the same job again this summer, and share rides to many concerts together. He'll always be in the corners of my life if not at the center, and I can't stay away. But I don't want to stay away. But, I really /really/ do. I really need to forget about him. So I can move on and see other people. And not get so upset when he flakes.

Help please? I just want to not care about him anymore.

**TLDR;** I have everything in common with this guy, and we have a shit ton of history, but never dated. When he flakes, I freak out, get depressed, and get sick. I compare all potential new guys to him. I want to not care about him anymore. HELP."

* Company 3 - My Own LLC: Freelance Software Engineer - since Spring 2011. I still have a few clients I work with


Past employers:

* Company 4 - Open source company: Software Developer - 3 months during Winter term of freshman year at my university
* Company 5 - Social analytics company: Contract Software Engineer - 4 months after my senior year (2012) of high school; partially into my freshman year of university
* Company 6 - Government Agency: Student Worker - 3 months over the summer after my sophomore year (2010) of high school. I designed and implemented a database and API that was used by the IT department as a whole for three years before they decided to go back to using Excel spreadsheets...

Frankly, in industry I can make a little under twice as much as low rank active enlisted, so if I go through all the trouble of 6-12 months of training at low pay, I want to make sure I'm doing a reserve job that I feel I can contribute to.

1dfzt7,5,2013-04-30,I'm in a bit of a bind. Anyone near Lowden ave have an off street parking spot for sale?,[deleted],Somerville,https://www.reddit.com/r/Somerville/comments/1dfzt7/im_in_a_bit_of_a_bind_anyone_near_lowden_ave_have/,"Short story:  I want to rent off street parking from someone within half a mile mile of [Lowden ave](https://maps.google.com/?q=Lowden%20Avenue,%20Somerville,%20MA) for $100 a month through August.

Long story: I moved in with a friend in Somerville for a 6 month internship in Boston.  Nobody told me when I moved in that out of state registered cars can't get long-term on street parking permits. (I was floored when they told me that they have no options for temporary workers)  My second 21 day pass expires at the end of the week and I cannot get another.

I bought my first car 5 months ago in preparation to live here, since where I work is not on a public transportation line.  I registered my car in my home state and got insurance through my parents.  I then drove and parked in another state where my university is for 5 months with no issues.  Nobody told me that Somerville had special parking rules, and that you cannot get a long-term parking pass in this town without registering your vehicle in MA.

So I need to register my car in MA, but there are some problems.  
1) Registration and license conversion costs $225, and I just paid to register my vehicle in another state less than 6 months ago.  
2) To register in MA, you need MA insurance.  
3) My current insurance company is going to **double** my insurance cost to $240 a month get converted to MA insurance, but If I stay on my states insurance, they have no issues with me driving in MA.  
4) I cannot switch insurance companies because other insurance companies will not sell to someone who has had insurance for less than 1 year, which I have not since I just bought my car.  
5) Since I bought my car less than 6 months ago, I will have to pay sales tax a second time to MA when I register my vehicle.  Because you know, fuck me right?

Between registration, license conversion, sales tax, and my first month of new insurance, the initial loss to me is roughly $600, plus the additional monthly $120 sting via my insurance.  I literally can't afford that loss on my intern salary, and since it is only temporary, it seems insane to register my vehicle in this state.  At this point I am almost two months into my internship, with only 4 months remaining.

The deal:
I pay you $100 a month for 4 months starting as soon as possible.  I can prepay up to two months and I will throw in $50 as a deposit/bonus or whatever.  In return I get off street parking.  I do not need a garage, I do not need a gate.  I will park on your lawn if that is what you want.  I leave for work at around 7:30 and get home sometime between 6:00-8:00pm.  My hours are somewhat flexible, so I can fanangle if you need me to.  If I get hired full time when my internship ends, I may need a 5th or 6th month while I seek a more permanent solution."

1dfydx,7,2013-04-30,How should I[21F] tell the guy[23M] I've been seeing that I don't think it's wise for us to continue?,wutplz,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dfydx/how_should_i21f_tell_the_guy23m_ive_been_seeing/,"I've been seeing this guy since the first week of February this year. I met him at a party I went to, and really wasn't actively looking for a relationship when I met him. Apparently though, he had interest in me, talked to one of my friends who was also at the party, and asked if she could give him my number (I had left before he could ask me). I said sure, why not, and thus we began texting. Second week of February rolls up, we go out a few times, I don't see any reason to stop seeing him, and so throughout the semester we are basically a ""thing"". He comes to my formal, he stays over, we hold hands, I meet his brother and sister in law, basically I'm his girlfriend. 

And here's where my issues start. Until this past Saturday, we had never discussed ""us"". We didn't have a label, he never refers to me as his girlfriend (though his roommate's do, and he doesn't correct them), and I don't refer to him as my boyfriend (and I correct my friends when they refer to him as such) out of respect, since we hadn't discussed it. He is going away for the summer to another country for a research project he's been working on all summer until the end of June, and then afterward, he's going on a trip to Europe. We, in passing, talk about seeing each other in the fall semester, getting season tickets for football and going together, and he's mentioned us going to New York during the summer, since I've never been. However, I feel a little uneasy continuing this relationship type thing with him, because of his ""ex-girlfriend"". 

When I met him in February, he told me he had recently broken up with his long-distance girlfriend (~2000 miles away long distance) of 2 years, which he had met during an internship 2 years ago. I figure this means that he's *actually single*, and just toss that information aside. Later, I find out that during our spring break in March, he went to spend the week with her, where ever it is she is living (I found out before he left, his roommate's assured me that he and her were ""just friends"" and that he was ""too polite"" to say no). I don't like it, but as he had previously told me they broke up, and considering the fact that we aren't ""official"", I let it go. 

On Saturday, I met his brother and sister-in-law, and afterwards we discussed our ""relationship"". He told me that he didn't want to label anything, as he's going to be away most of the summer, which I figured was the reason anyway, and I said as much. Then, he tells me after he's done with his research project, he is going to go to Europe with this ""ex-girlfriend"" of his. He said that he was ""going to cancel it because it would be weird, but didn't because [he] found out her family would be coming, too"", which would alleviate the ""tension"". I'm not a fan of this, but, again, let it go, because he'd already bought the tickets, and additionally, he *isn't* my boyfriend, so I really have no say. 

Up until this point, this guy has been nothing but fantastic. He's nice to me, he's nice to my friends, he finds me interesting, and I him, and overall I would very much like to continue. HOWEVER. Sunday he came by, and logged into an incognito window on my computer to check his email. Fine, fine, I don't mind. We get food, catch some sleep, and he leaves early in the morning to study for his final. Last night however, I was studying for my final, and brought up a window in Chrome- with his email still logged on.

Now, don't get me wrong. I know I shouldn't have looked. It's his email, not mine, and quite frankly that is an invasion of privacy, and really, if he'd have read my email, I'd be ticked, too, even though there isn't really anything in my email for me to hide. However, I saw the ""ex-girlfriend""'s name on one of the emails, and I was curious. Why would he be getting emails from her if they're broken up? So I click on it, and she's talking about how they should get the tickets to go to Europe soon, because her parents are on her about it, yada ya, and then at the *end of the email*, she writes 

&gt;""Also, this [my name] chick sounds like a dirty pirate hooker haha :)
&gt;
&gt;Love,
&gt;[her name]

Well, THAT is certainly interesting, so I search my name in his email, which returns nothing. So I search her name. Chats and emails come up with her and him discussing their “relationship”. One comes up from about 2 weeks ago, with her saying something about having gone to this outing with this friend of hers, and then them meeting up with a married couple, so she realized this was a date, and she had to “fade this guy out”, and then she “realized something about [their] relationship”, that she would “still choose [boy I’m seeing]”, and he responds with “I’m really glad :)”. Enter multiple other messages like this, with the two of them saying “I love you”, another email with him signing off “I do still love you [girl’s name]”.  The gChats from spring break lead me to believe that they were not simply meeting up as friends, nor do I believe that he was sick during spring break like he told me he was. 

So, I realize that this needs to stop. I'm not about to play Backup Girlfriend or Temporary Girlfriend to someone who has no intentions of letting go of the girl they lied to me about not being with. I feel bad having read his emails, but on the other hand, clearly he had no intentions of telling me any of this. I guess what I'm wondering is, what do I say to him, if anything? Should I straight up tell him, yo dude, I read your email, and I'm not having any of that. You lied, goodbye. Or, should I just ice him out and not respond to any of his messages (I don't really want to do that, because I feel he should know that if he tries this with someone else, they're eventually going to find out). My first thought was to send him a text/say to him ""so I'm a dirty pirate hooker, huh?"", and see what he says, but I feel like that's slightly immature...

**TL;DR: Guy I've been seeing has lied to me about breaking up with the girl he'd been dating before me, I only found out by reading his email (which is wrong), and I am not sure what I should do/say to end this ""relationship"".**"

I've had a boob job and a nose job, yet still feel not beautiful. I feel like a butterface. Over the past semester I've gained 5 lbs and now I feel like a butterbody, too. I try to keep my weight low because I feel like if I can't have a pretty face, at least I can have a nice body, but right now I have neither. I am just feeling so self conscious and depressed over it. I'm going to work all summer and save up money to get lip injections. I hope that helps. I just hate my nose, teeth, lips, under eye circles, bad skin, forehead, and chin so much. I keep spending money to try to fix something that I feel is unfixable. Sorry that this has turned into a rant. I know it's psycological. My dad killed himself when I was a kid and that was a slap in the self esteem. In high school the lowest I weighed was 89 lbs. I'm 5'3"" and 108 lbs. I was maintaining at 103 for a while up until the past month. I was OK with that weight. I would ideally like to be 95-97 lbs. I just feel so disgusting and ugly. I've been so overwhelmed this year with everything. I left an EXTREMELY unhealthy relationship and then had to deal with him being crazy (sending me nasty texts... slashing my new bf's tires...). And you know what, this isn't anamonous, but I have to get this out my system. Last summer I was raped. It's really made it worse. I'm trying so fucking hard to have some self confidence, but I just feel like shit. I'm in a great relationship now. I'm working on getting a 4.0 for this semester. I got an internship and am having to do so much for that. I ran my first 5k. I started dating someone new. I was OK with that weight. I would ideally like to be 95-97 lbs. I just feel so disgusting and ugly. I get really depressed about it. I've had depression for years, it runs in my family, but yeah. Sometimes I just get really depressed because I will never be a 10/10 and I feel like no matter what I do in life, I will always be judged on my looks. Sorry for this rant, I'll prob delete it soon becaue this isn't a throwaway, I just needed to get this out. I just wish I was one of those pretty girls that people are just like ""wow"" when they look at them. Unfortunately, no matter how much surgery I get or how much effort I put into my look, I'll never be and I can't cope with it. qwihdfiuefhu ok rant over"

1dfrxu,1,2013-04-30,Pricing Engine Brings Big Business Marketing To Entrepreneurs,mrmikeob,smallbusiness,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1dfrxu/pricing_engine_brings_big_business_marketing_to/,"from Forbes.com:

When you’re running a small business, your primary focus is just doing your day to day work. Serving customers, making your product, etc. Usually the last thing you want to worry about is marketing, even though that’s a vital part of the process. What’s more, marketing these days is more than just a few ads in the local paper or phone book. You’ve got to market online – and there is a dizzying array of choices for marketing when you try to do that.

That’s where Pricing Engine hopes to fill the void. The company, which launched its marketing platform on Friday, aims to be a “one stop shop” for small business marketing.

“We looked at the market,” CEO Jeremy Kagan told me. “And we saw that there was plenty of stuff out there to help big companies. But they’re expensive.”
Saving Customer Service With Social Media - And A Song Alex Knapp Alex Knapp Forbes Staff

“If you’re the pizza guy down the road,” he continued. “He’s competing with Domino’s and other big chains. But they can spend millions.”

Kagan told me that when they conducted focus groups with small businesses, many of them only visited their online ads once per month or so. They would rewrite them – or have a college intern or family friend rewrite them – but they had no point of comparison to see how they were doing.

It was with this average small businessman in mind that the company approached their problem. What they created was a platform where someone can go, place ads across Google, Yahoo and Bing, and then get a simple letter grade to see how well their ads are doing. Those grades are based on anonymously comparing the data for all of Pricing Engine’s customers, so that businesses are graded in comparison to their peers. The platform also creates action lists that small businesses can follow to quickly do the marketing that they need to.

Although the platform officially launched on Friday, it’s been in beta since the summer. Before the launch, they already had over 600 customers. Most of their customers are small businesses, but they also do work with advertising resellers, who have adopted the platform for use with their clients. The data gathered so far has provided a platform that Pricing Engine hopes will grow their business.

They also already have a strong partner. XO Group Inc., parent company of the Knot, the Bump, and other similar websites has invested $1 million into Pricing Engine’s Series A funding. David Liu, the company’s CEO, will also have a seat on Pricing Engine’s board of directors. However, XO’s interest in the company is non-controlling – so Pricing Engine is free to seek out whoever they want as a customer.

Pricing Engine uses a freemium model to garner its revenue. The basic platform is free, but there are different options to upgrade at different pricing levels. So far, the company has seen a 25% conversion rate from free to paid services. Even while they were in beta, the company was earning over $10,000 a month in revenue. Not that Kagan’s satisifed with that.

“We want to be the start page for small business for internet marketing,” he said. “Our goal is to be pulling in millions per month.”"

I've got some good opportunities lined up (I've got a paid internship this summer), but last night I read an article about the 25 highest paying software dev jobs, which both inspired me and motivated me to push myself towards a greater expertise in my field.

I've thought of grad school or working for a while and then going back to school to get more degrees (like in physics and/or electrical engineering) to widen my usefulness and marketability.  How worth it would this be?  Also, what sort of extracurricular resources (preferably free) are there to grow my general knowledge?

My resume is looking a little bleak. 

Now I know I messed up, I should have done so much more while in school and am paying the price now.  I'm working at a cafe now full time while I look for work.

* (2) Take some lame-ass job for now, but start doing project on StackOverlow and GitHub so that I can, in a year or so, point to some experience and hope that gets me a job.

I'm a first year graduate student at the Academy of Art University (go Urban Knights!) currently taking my classes online while living in my home state of Connecticut.  After my first semester last year, I realized that I wanted to get even more out of my graduate studies than the online program could actually offer, which would mean moving to San Francisco to attend school on-campus.  Many of the classes I want to take are only offered on-campus, and the opportunities for networking and internships are pretty much non-existent over here on the East Coast, so I've ultimately decided to move to the city before the start of the next semester in September.  

I lived in Los Angeles for a couple of years while doing my undergraduate work, so the move itself is not that intimidating; my real problem is that I don't really have any contacts in the Bay Area, so I'm not really sure how to best go about finding a place to live, or how I should plan on travelling back and forth to school, those kinds of things.  I was wondering if any current residents might be able to point me in the right direction or give me some advice on my upcoming move (like maybe a real estate agent that specializes in apartments, whether or not I should bother bringing a car as my primary means of transportation, and so on).

Here's some quick background on myself to maybe help give you an idea of my personal situation.  I'd really like to live in the city proper and as close to the school (AAU) as possible, but I'm slowly starting to worry about the pricing situation for apartments based on my current budget, as well as info that I've seen both in this subreddit and in other places (I think sites like Trulia must be lying to me, but I can't be sure).  I don't know if that means that I'll have to look at living outside of the city limits in areas like Oakland or what that would mean for my commute to school either.  My girlfriend is going to be coming with me, but my sister had also planned on moving to attend school on-campus as well, so I had hoped to find a reasonable two bedroom place if possible, but I really don't have any idea of how likely that would be based on my aforementioned concerns.

I'm really excited to move so I can attend school on-campus next semester and see everything the city has to offer, but I'm just not sure where to start or how much of challenge it might actually be (especially considering the difficulty of finding a place from all the way over here in Connecticut).  I figure people move across the country and even to other nations all the time though, so there's gotta be some way to go about it best.

**tl;dr** - Hoping for any advice and/or tips on finding a place to live (and general city living) in San Francisco."

The gist of it is as follows:

- **Campus outreach** – partnering with on-the-ground activists spreading the ideas of liberty on their campuses.

Since knowledge is local, we seek to mirror the structure of Students for Liberty, which provides support for activists while allowing them wide berth in deciding what activities are most suited to their campuses.

- **Easy online access to libertarian ideas** – there has been much scholarship done in the tradition of classical liberalism in the world. Unfortunately, many of the critical essays  and conclusions have not made their way into Bulgarian form; even when they exist,  they are not accessible to the general public and to students specifically. We seek to  create an online portal for libertarian ideas in Bulgarian to make the principles of liberty clear, concise, and publicly available.

I met Kevin during recess in second grade when he smacked me on the back and ran away. His shoes were really cool, and eventually I convinced my mom to buy me a pair. We became best friends. It was pretty convenient that he owned a house behind mine, so I was able to spent a lot of time at his place, and he at mine. However, I was always going to his house because he had a Dreamcast and an X-Box.

I slept in the room next door to my parents, and during the summer before sixth grade, they began to argue. They were probably arguing beforehand, but now I could hear them at night – my dad complained about not enough sex and how my mother refused to get a job, even though she could work as a secretary in his practice. I don't remember my mother making any complaints. The year marched onward. I went to Eisenhower Middle School, and was bullied by the other kids - the standard fare, really.

On March 31st of sixth grade, my mother sat me and my sister down and told us through tears that dad was leaving. I remember he was packing his bags as we all were wailing. Retrospectively, it was pretty dramatic. A family made of the American Dream, torn by financial stress and an unsatisfied libido. Dad got an apartment in a nearby town with the help of my uncle, and my mother stayed in our house. I stayed more and more frequently at Kevin's house because the meals were better and his mother was a saint - I was even allowed at their Christmas dinners. I remember Kevin and his family getting weary of my presence. He had his own problems and I had mine. We never really talked about them. My mom moved out of the house to a cheaper one in town, and I saw Kevin less and less. 

I was in an engineering program in high school, which had the same 20 guys and one girl in practically all the same classes. Naturally, a whole bunch of kids became attracted to Colleen, but I was never really into it. She dated a kid in our class, Matt, and we joked around about how they were the cutest couple. I was involved in marching band, fenced for a year, and got a job at a frame shop. 

My sister and her boyfriend came home from college on spring break during my Junior year, and asked me if I knew any girls. I didn't, really. I got Colleen's number from a friend of mine, and the four of us played basketball (some weird variation of horse) until it got dark. Colleen and I started hanging out, she broke up with Matt, and we started hanging out even more. We frequented this park in town, and I remember talking to her about how I wasn't that interested in her. That quickly changed when we walked to this bench by a pond. I told myself if she sat down next to me on the bench (rather than on the opposite side) I'd kiss her. Sure enough, Colleen sat close and I kissed her. That was the start to probably one of the best summers I'd had up until that point in my life. We lost our virginity to each other at the start of September. She always talked about how winter was her least favorite season, and I promised her that it was going to be great this time around, I mean, she was with me, after all. 

I was a B or C student, and was denied from colleges like Lafayette, Lehigh, and Skidmore. Got into the college my sister went to, my safety school. I wasn't too thrilled about it at the time. My friends were going to Johns Hopkins, RPI, Harvard, you get the idea. I was never as smart as them, but Colleen and I were happy. I got a bit controlling, and she liked to drink, but beyond that we were in as much love as two high school seniors could be.
The year progressed, and we stopped communicating as much as we had before. She broke up with me on the morning of graduation day. We had a hook-up thing going on during the summer, telling ourselves we didn't have feelings for one another.

I started college determined to be different than I was in highschool. I was going to do very well in my classes, and make a whole bunch of friends. My first semester I nailed a perfect GPA, and though I struggled to be the social butterfly I aspired to be, I made some friends. I hung out with a bunch of guys who your mother would tell you to stay away from, and started using drugs and alcohol a bit. I never lost focus on my grades, which meant I didn't hang out with them as much as they did with each other, so I was often in the background of the group. I don't really remember my sophomore year that much because I was so focused in my coursework and extra-curriculars. The same thing held true for my junior year, and by this point I really didn't have that many close friends, no confidants. 

By the end of junior year, I was reaping the rewards of my hard work, and got my senior year paid for in full by the school because of an award. I was the star of the department, having completed an internship in Slovakia for oil and gas, and was about to start one in Arizona for mining. I scored the best apartment on campus, and lived with an acquaintance of mine because I knew he was alright and wouldn't be too dirty, plus I needed a second person or else I wouldn't have the apartment. I completed the mining internship over the summer, and they offered me a job for after I graduate, which I took. I got into the best exploration geology field camp in the nation. Academically, life was great, but it was countered by a lack of friends and a social life.

Colleen and I talked somewhat throughout college, but by Christmas of senior year she stopped talking to me entirely. I still thought of her pretty frequently, and wondered if she did the same. I didn't have a girlfriend throughout college, and didn't hook up much at all. I attributed this to my work schedule, but really it's because I was too selfish to make time for another person.

During my senior year I started going out to the bars, spending less time on schoolwork, and meeting more people. We would generally have a good time, and I got comfortable with a group that I fit into. I always wondered if they actually liked me. My grades weren't too hot, but that was alright.

This story is now in the present.

My professors are somewhat disappointed with how I am doing in my classes and research given my previous track record, and I am self conscious. I am not sure if they like me anymore, and it wears on me. I just want to graduate and start working at the mine. My family has pressured me this entire year to find a girlfriend before I am isolated at the mine location, but that just wasn't important to me. I often think about how much happier I would be with someone, but dispel those thoughts by saying that I would be starting a long distance relationship that would ultimately limit both parties involved. In these next two weeks, I need to write my thesis, give a side-research presentation, and perform a lead role in a play. It'll be a push, for sure, but it's manageable. 

My life has been great so far, but at times I feel guilty that I didn't do more given my opportunities. I only realized what I was capable of in college, and even still I don't think I am doing enough. This is a silly idea, since I don't have many friends because of my work ethic. Doubt seeps into my mind and tells me that the only way I got these awards, jobs, or commendations by professors is because I am the guy who sucks the least, not because I am smart. This is probably a hold-over from being dumber than my highschool buddies and comparing myself to them. I am very self conscious, and worry too much about what other people think. I don't even want to submit this because it is much longer than the other posts in this subreddit, and has much less hardship. I don't want to seem dramatic and ungrateful.

Anyway, lunch is being served at the dining hall and I want to grab a bite to eat. If you've read this far, I appreciate it. I could write more too, but I think it'd be best if I just cut it here. Retrospectively, I have given out a lot of identifying information. Oops. Send me message if you want.

She says she has a plan for her degree and internships and I don't want the same things she does. She says I show no initiative.

I had no warning of this. She said I showed no interest in going back to school, but I couldn't register yet to due my financial aid status. We had talked about our future. We had talked about plans for houses and moving in with each other. Ten days ago she got a job with me. Then she breaks up with me now that she works with me? I'm just so blind sided and broken.

I had my first and only paid job back in grade 10 at Red Rooster, the experience there wasn't exactly the best and this lasted about 2 years before I quit. I wasn't interested in working for the rest of high school (graduated at the end of 2007 anyway).

2008 was a blur for me, I think I was struggling with social anxiety issues which inhibited me from finding work, 2009 I got onto Youth Allowance for finding a job which didn't seem to work that well. In 2010 I started a course for Games Design (what I was interested in at the time) which ended in 2011, however I did partake in a 6 month quality assurance internship for an independent game studio (relevant for data entry). Still, it's a very difficult profession to find work for, so in 2012 I spent the first 6 months looking for any job without Centelink's assistance and again I was unsuccessful, couldn't even land an interview.

In the second half of 2012 I began my process for the Defence Force. Did great my YouSession and had been training heaps for the assessment session. When it came however I was made class 4, but was given the option to appeal if I could clear up some health issues (asthma mainly).

So this is where I am now, I'm getting back on Centrelink, called Newstart now and have began applying for jobs again and hoping for the best while I go through the treatment to satisfy the ADF.

Consider this the TL;DR – Can anyone provide tips on making more progress in terms of finding work? I'm pretty much looking for anything that isn't fast food. I've made my resume as neat and to the point as possible and I'm not sure what else to do."

I have just graduated from my university with a finance degree. Im from Massachusetts and I recieved my degree through a state university that isnt sought out by recruiters and only has about 8 graduates a year that take home a degree in finance. Having to work full time while pursuing my degree I was unable to take on internships during the last two years of school. Also this prevented me from hunting for a job before the semester had ended. I've had a hell of a time trying to find answers to a couple questions.

What should I be looking for as an entry level position in finance? I'm more interested in business development/project risk assessment but I don't precisely if there are positions specifically for this. What should I really be hunting for when it comes to this first finance position?

What should I expect for salary? This has been a hell of a question to try to find answers for. I find salaries ranging from 28500 (i make more at my current job as a beer guy) all the way up to 55000. Realistically what should i be bargaining for?

Keep it up!

Now, on to my main point. I am finishing up my bachelor's degree this May and have recently started applying for LEO positions in my area. I am living in MA, and have applied for various positions in the New England area and also the NYPD.

I would like to broaden my opportunities by applying to other departments around the country. I've learned that several departments, for example the LAPD, used to offer condensed hiring programs for out of state applicants. From what I understand, you would come to LA for about a week and take the written test, psych eval, PT, etc. in that time frame. It seems that high demand for LE jobs has curtailed the need for these programs. 

Do any of you fine ladies or gentlemen know of any departments that offer this kind of program? I'm not averse to doing my own research but I need your help to point me in the right direction. To clarify, I'm not looking to limit the amount time spent in the hiring process. I am looking to minimize the number of trips I will have to make to any given location. 

Here is a little background info on me, if it helps: My degree will be in business management with a minor in military leadership. I am a member of The Army National Guard with 4.5 years of service(clean record, no disciplinary actions). Besides one speeding ticket, from two years, ago my legal record is clear. Also, aside from the military and some business internships, I have limited work history. I was a lifeguard supervisor at my local community center.

Advice?,throloloaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1denkz/my_boyfriend_27m_has_an_amazing_opportunity_to/,"My boyfriend, we'll say Matt, and I live outside of the States, and have cohabited since 2011. I have a close friend from college, let's call him Ryan, who will be spending the summer completing an internship in SF, California, and he is looking for multiple people to chip in so that they can get a nicer, bigger apartment. His girlfriend is a grad student and will be living with him as well. 

Matt and Ryan met in 2010, when I was first seeing Matt. They hit it off and sometimes go drinking solo now. The girlfriend is a relatively new member of the group, and while she is quiet, she seems nice and obviously Ryan digs her. 

Matt has a job in academia, where he has the option of taking the summers off. Ryan mentioned to me he might interested in having Matt come stay with him for the summer, if he'd be interested in pitching in rent. I mentioned it to Matt, and now they are working out details.

Ryan shot me an email last night asking me what Matt is like to live with and whether there is anything he should know when convincing the girlfriend that this is a good idea. Now I feel nervous, like I'm supposed to tell them if it's not going to work out, which I think is unlikely, but there's always a chance with moving in with friends.

I feel like since it's temporary and since they already know each other pretty well, it'll probably be fine. But I wanted to ask everyone's opinion, because now I feel like the fall out would land on me if this goes wrong. (I have a tendency to be pretty pessimistic and am trying to weigh that against my natural Red Flag indicator...)

Is this a bad idea that we're all overlooking the negatives of because it would be such a huge opportunity? Does anyone else have any experience temporarily living with a couple? I already mentioned to Matt that maybe he should spend every other weekend travelling, to give them some space to be coupley and he agreed. Any other thoughts or things that should be considered before making a commitment?

TL;DR: My boyfriend [27m], my good friend from college [27m] and my good friend's girlfriend [24f] might be living together for a month and a half in San Francisco this summer. Any advice before they do so? Is this a horrible idea that I just can't see coming?"

I am a 6th year student that has been withdrawing from m last 3 semesters due to the poor grades I was getting. I am a chemical engineering major, and my gpa dropped from a 3.8 to a 3.02 my senior year (doing 5 years). I was not satisfied with the grades I was getting and decided to withdraw 2nd senior semester. From then, it just became a habbit; if i was not getting A's I withdrew over and over again. My parents and friends think I am doing a second degree, but in reality, I am trying to finish my first degree and still have about one more year left in order to finish. 

I am supposed to graduate next week with my parents thinking they are going to see me walk, and haven't had the courage to tell them. All I have been doing is sleeping for long hours and eating a lot while trying to find a job or internship for the summer. I have gained weight just this last year alone (I used to hit the gym 3/4 times a week). 
How do I tell my parents? they have such high expectations of me that sometimes I feel like the biggest failure and thought about running my car off a cliff several times when going home from college and back. 
There is much more to the stress that accumulates, but this is my main concern. Any advice to how should i approach this problem will be greatly appreciated. 

-First time Redditor seeking help. 

Update: Reddit can sometime be like counseling. Now seeking help from the university and about to go and talk to my girlfriend about this. Thanks for the advice and support everyone!

Update 2: Told my girlfriend first: She was shocked because I told her at a store. We talked after wards and told me that she was upset that I didnt tell her that I was struggling through classes, because she could've pushed me. She said she felt guilty because I always helping her and motivating her and have high expectations for her, but she doesn't do the same for me. She said that she felt proud that I am not settling for bad grades, but to make better choices and try to do things better and to internships along the way because I haven't done any. She was supportive. 

I told my brother second: He was extremely supportive. He graduated before and just wanted to get out of college and just breezed through school. He said to stay calm and that I am not a failure because I had not quit yet. I told him I want to give it another shot and do it right. He said to take my time and come back strong, that hopefully I learned a lot from it and apply it. 

My PARENTS! I told my father first, and he was really upset that I waited till the last minute to tell them. He said that a week before would have been fine. The conversations was short, but he was upset. My mom just kept asking me why I didn't tell them before. I told her I was ashamed to, and hopefully I will fix it because I was not doing so well on my last classes. 

Summary: They were supportive, but just were upset that i waited till the last minute to tell me. You were right guys, it wasn't as bad as I imagined, and life continues on. 
Currently applying to Internships like crazy =).

My backup plan has been to go to Grad school in the Fall if I don't find a job by then, which is seeming pretty likely now. I'm not only doing it to further my education, but also so that I can do a couple internships and improve my chances of finding a job after I'm done.

* SO and I have been close friends almost 2 years, and officially together for the last 14 months  
* For all but the first month we knew each other, we've been long-distance. During that time, I'd see her every 2-3 months at most. We Skype almost every day for at least an hour or two.
* In September, I am moving to be closer to her - 800 miles will go down to 80. 

BUT…  

* I have an internship in India this summer. I will be gone for 108 days. We discussed this before I went, and she agreed it would be crazy for me not to take it, so I did. But now we're worried.
* The time difference will make Skype/phone extremely challenging, due to her and my work schedules - one of us would have to stay up until 3 or 4am, most days.
* Even if we really work hard to Skype once or twice a week, it'll be a huge drop from what we're used to. Neither of us are great at email-writing, although we're both willing to try. 
* Selfishly, I don't want to feel ""tied down"" to having to make Skype appointments, or meet email quotas (x per week). I want to be able to take full advantage of this opportunity and not feel like I'm missing out because of her, because I know it'll breed resentment and be bad for us. But at the end of the day, I'll do whatever I need to for this to work - I don't want to lose her, more than anything.
* We've discussed maybe ""taking a break"" and she says she's fine with it, although seems a little hurt by the idea. It's probably also a selfish idea - we both love each other tremendously, but it'll be harder for her than me, as she'll be at home living normal life minus me, while I'll have lots of exciting adventures to distract me from how much I miss her. I'd only want to take a break to lower expectations on me re: keeping in touch, which seems rather mean. If we took a break, in practice, neither of us would be with anyone else during that break.

I just finished my 2nd year of BBA at WLU in Ontario with an expected GPA of 3.8-3.9/4 and I cant seem to get a summer job anywhere in Finance. All of my friends have accounting or finance jobs through their parents who work at these firms but I do not have this luxury. I know that I am one of the hardest working students but I don't have any relevant office experience and can't show this legitimately except through my marks. If I don't end up with a summer internship I plan on trading a good portion of my money (6-7k) and starting my own company. I know this entails big risks, but I am willing to take them. Can anyone give me ANY advice on how to get a summer internship or use connections to help me out, any help would be greatly appreciated.

1de6tv,5,2013-04-30,Am I spreading myself too thin in school?,duckieprez,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1de6tv/am_i_spreading_myself_too_thin_in_school/,"Woah, first post on Reddit. It’s pretty unreal after a couple years of lurking. Pretty long post, just a lot of thoughts going on… 

Anyway, so looking back, I’m pretty proud of myself after surviving a rough freshmen year that included depression brought on by homesickness and social/love life issues. Now I’m just finishing up my sophomore year, and life in general is looking better. I’m double-majoring in Film and Business. I’m a member of the marching band, the Filmmaking Club on campus, and I’m about to start working as a trip leader for my school’s Outdoor Club. Most of my weekend days are taken up by some sort of school event, whether it be a football game (particularly in the fall, though we have basketball games to attend in the spring) or student film shoots that occur sporadically throughout the year. I make pretty good grades too, with around a 3.75 GPA. As an introvert, I’m fairly pleased with my social life. I hang out with friends on weekends, occasionally going to parties (around once a month). There are days when I just enjoy time to myself, just watching Netflix and playing videogames for hours on end. These are probably my favorite days, the ones that really recharge me.

I don’t find my classes particularly difficult this semester (taking 15 hours), but next semester, I’m planning on bumping it up to 18 hours on top my involvements. Even though one of the classes I’m planning on taking isn’t required at all (Intro to Computer Science), it’s something that interests me and I figured it would be useful knowledge. Career-wise, what I really want to do is to become an Animator, either for film or videogames (hence why I thought a small bit of comp sci. knowledge would be helpful). The film program I’m in at my school, however, mostly focuses on live-action filmmaking, with only one animation class offered here so far (which I took). Thus, since my school doesn’t focus on animation much at all, I have to dedicate a lot of time outside of class to practicing it in order to train myself for my future career goals.

On top of all of that, I’m worried about about my summer plans—trying to figure out summer school combined with an internship and working at home during a month off. Deciding on my future is exciting, but it’s starting to just really stress me out. Tonight while I was in the library, I was beginning to think that I was spreading myself too thin, with my double-major in Film and Business, on top of extracurricular activities (band, Outdoor Club, Filmmaking Club, which could almost be considered schoolwork), on top of summer plans, on top of career goals in animation that I have to focus on working toward outside of class, in addition to a decent social life that keeps me satisfied. Plus, as a naturally lazy introvert, this sort of busy lifestyle is not what I naturally lean toward. So I can’t tell if this is just the college experience of exploring different aspects of life, or if I am starting to spread myself too thin, with too many areas of interest and not enough focus on what I REALLY want to do after school.

She said ""No i havent had a boyfriend in a while"" almost like she wanted someone in the car to hear it.  I have only started talking to her in the last 2 months because one of my tasks relies directly on her department . My question to Reddit: Is it worth it to ""shit where I eat"" to pursue this girl?

It wasn't until my freshman year of college that I actually took programming in a formal classroom environment. C and a bit of C++ was taught and I did quite well at it since they were covering the core concepts again. 

Recently, I got an internship at a company for application development. I felt confident doing the programming required of my first-year engineering course (we later built an autonomous robot) but I am very nervous about the internship. I was browsing around and found a [Competence Matrices](http://www.indiangeek.net/wp-content/uploads/Programmer%20competency%20matrix.htm) link and that certainly didn't help my nervousness. 

To avoid the feeling of being swallowed, I have gone back to my C textbook and am currently working on the harder exercises in it. My question to you all is: 

**tl;dr:** Do you build your own classes, methods, programs that you later just use as tools from your coding toolbox? If so, would it be a good idea to start building up this toolbox by learning about each tool and then making it?

 I'm trying to make that knowledge jump from an ""advanced beginner"" to an ""intermediate"" that knows a decent amount about more complex subjects of programming--not just basic things like loops, variables, methods, etc."

I've got an internship with a company based in Boston for the Summer and I'm in need of some housing.  My checklist is as follows:

* Be within a 30-45 commute of where I will be working (which is Federal Street).  I don't have a car, but I can walk and use public transportation.
* (affordable) Grocery store nearby.
* Kitchen (&amp; fridge).  I don't need something super fancy, just a place to cook meals and store food.
* Safe &amp; quiet neighboorhood.  I don't care about the noise levels during the day, but past 11PM, I would like it to be quiet.
* I would prefer to sleep in a room with no one else.  (i.e. my own room with a bed, don't care if it's tiny, just want privacy at night)
* Internet.

So, I just started a programming internship, and I'm having trouble dealing with my manager. I work in a small office with 7 other programmers who are all male, and my manager is one of my closest friends who suggested that I apply for this job. I just started last week, but I'm having troubles dealing with him in a work environment. I understand that there is a separation between personal life and a work environment, but I feel like he is treating me differently since I am a close friend. He is really sarcastic about me towards all of the other coworkers, and it's really irritating since I have never met my other coworkers so they have this immediate negative connotation towards me. When I was first introduced to my coworkers, they asked if I was going to start working there (full-time), and my boss/friend replied that ""oh no, she's too stupid""(albeit in a joking way, but it's still really irritating when I had never met this people, and now I'm going to be working with them for x amount of hours per week). It's also really frustrating since whenever I ask him a question he makes a ""females can't code"" joke, or just gives me an answer without even hearing my question because he assumes that I have a really basic question for him. 

I know he is not normally like this to his other coworkers, and I know that he doesn't actually mean what he's saying- it's just that he's very comfortable around me that he's acting this way. I don't want to snap at him, because he is a very close friend, and I probably wouldn't have been able to get this internship otherwise since my class standing is above what they normally hire (they heavily prefer freshman/soph)

How do I approach him about this?"

I say I ""think"" because I don't really have much experience, but it sounds really cool.

Originally, I wanted an internship back home. But nothing was turning out so I decided to take this position with a professor at my school. However, I received an email yesterday pretty much guaranteeing an internship at a pharmaceutical company back home. It would probably be paid. 

There are a lot of pros and cons regarding both positions, and I don't need to go into the personal details of it. Just know that money is not an issue in this case. My main question is... which looks better if I plan on going to grad school: research or an internship? I know there are a lot of factors involved, and I still have one more summer after this one before I graduate.

1ddleo,0,2013-04-29,Koch Internship Program or Koch Summer Fellows Program?,[deleted],Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1ddleo/koch_internship_program_or_koch_summer_fellows/,"Hi, I'm a libertarian college student who's been accepted to both KIP (Koch Internship) and KSFP (Koch Summer Fellow Program).

KIP is located in DC. The institute that KIP has placed me with is a big organization and there's no doubt I'd be able to network well. Nightlife seems good and there are obviously a lot of places to visit so I'll always have something to do after work.

KSFP is supposedly more prestigious/selective and looks better on a resume. They've placed me in a think tank in a small state, so I don't know if I'll be bored there or not. I also am not sure if state-based think tanks are as vibrant/meaningful as national think tanks.

If anyone has experience with one or both of these programs, please tell me about it. I'd love to have as much input as possible before making a decision."
1ddkme,11,2013-04-29,New to the community and have some questions,flyboy10029,opencarry,https://www.reddit.com/r/opencarry/comments/1ddkme/new_to_the_community_and_have_some_questions/,"Okay, so I am 19 years old and live in a pretty sketchy part of town. I am a sheriffs intern and found out how really shitty my area is in terms of gangs, both street and motorcycles, and just the other night there was a shooting in my apartment complex. 

I would like to conceal carry, but that's not a legal option currently. I am in Alabama and the thing is, I can open carry, but once I walk in my car it's considered conceal carry. Do I just have to keep my slide open when I hop in the car or what? Anyways, I'm from an upper middle class area and look like it, just live in a not so great area as I am a college student. (CLARIFICATION - I don't intend to carry or anything on or near campus) 

Anyways, I was just wondering what your thoughts are and I do already own a handgun. Share thoughts, ideas, experience, etc. please. Thanks in advance for your help! "
