I had a week to decide if I wanted to accept it.  It is a paid job and its in the area that I want to practice in.  Its good experience. Additionally this job is in Chicago.  I accepted it because, at the time, I didn't have any other offers and thought it was unlikely that I would get another one (its VERY hard for 1L's to get jobs this summer, especially ones which pay well).  

Problem is: I just heard back from another firm in Cleveland (where I am from, and where I definitely want to live after graduating *side note: save the Cleveland bashing for some other time pls), and was invited to interview.  This other firm is also in the area I want to practice in, is larger, and much more established than the Chicago firm (Chicago firm is 3 attorneys, Cleveland firm is 30).   If I end up getting an offer from the Cleveland firm, am I being a huge dick to the Chicago guy?  I feel like there are an abundance of 1L's who still don't have jobs, so it might not be so hard for him to find a replacement.  Advice?

I love how different scientists think of different angles on this, and come up with different answers. Clearly, they hadn’t really thought about this before, so as they realize various aspects of this the answer changes.
It’s complicated! You have to think about the energy of the beam, of course, but also the energy of a given proton as it moves at 99.9999% the speed of light. But that number doesn’t mean anything if the proton doesn’t actually interact with the matter in your hand, so you have to consider the ""cross-section"" of the atoms in your hand. Think of it this way: if you shoot a gun at a target, you make a hole. But if you shoot a gun at a fishing net, it might pass right through. Most of the area of a fishing net is holes! The nuclei of atoms are very small compared to the atoms themselves, so in a sense most of you is empty space.
And there’s more. The beam of the LHC is in a small tube that’s a high-grade vacuum — getting your hand in there would be tough. And there’s a magnetic field of ferocious strength there, so I hope you don’t have any metal bits in you. And there are actually two beams going in opposite directions.
So taken in total, I’m not sure what would happen. If the total energy of the beams were dumped into your hand all at once, it would act like dropping a bomb on you. One of the scientists in the video says the total energy in the beams is 300 megajoules, which is equivalent to 75 kilograms (165 pounds) of TNT going off. That’s about 300 sticks of dynamite, if you’re curious.
Bang! Ow.
But depositing all that energy all at once may not be possible; protons are so small they may not all hit you and suddenly stop. That’s why I find the scientists’ answers so amusing. One says it would explode, but that’s because he assumes all the energy gets dumped into your hand. Another thinks nothing would happen, because the energy that actually interacts with you is small. Another thinks about the synchrotron energy produced, which is radiation emitted by the particles themselves as they circle the tube.
The point? The actual answer is hard to state with certainty until you look at everything involved! There are a lot of factors involved, making this seemingly easy question actually a bit of a puzzler.
So I propose that in a few decades, when funding is running low and the LHC’s primary objectives are met, we test this idea out. We don’t have to use an actual hand — logistics might be difficult — but I think a nice slab of rib eye might do the trick. But they better make sure a few interns are on hand to clean the LHC up afterward, just in case the whole 300 sticks of dynamite thing turns out to be the correct outcome."

I will have 24 hour access to the facilities (including pool and spa).

**Goal:** Weigh 185 Lbs by Summer

**History:** Highschool Football player, College Hockey Player. Currently still very overweight. At this point last year I was interning, living at home, and working out at a local gym as much as possible. After Summer I went back to school, and was working out pretty routinely, but fell off the wagon sometime between midterms and finals last Spring. It was hard to manage undergrad work, grad classes, and TA'ing. (What can I say, I'm a bit of a hard-worker)

**Stats:**  I am 22 years old, about 5'10"", and ~205 pounds after I move my bowels in the morning. Still trying to calculate my Body Fat % (if anyone has any good guides with a caliper I would appreciate a link) (I'm an engineer, so I have a few calipers lying around haha)


**The Workout Plan:** M-W-TH-F-SUN workout minimum (Class on Tuesday and Wednesday Nights, though the gym is open 24 hours)
Alternating between Upper Body and Lower Body workouts each . 
*Abs-* MWF.
*Cardio-* 30 minutes at a slow pace high incline (3.5-4 MPH) in the morning before work on my treadmill. 30 minutes within my target HR post-workout. 

I want to try to integrate some lap swimming into there, just to utilize the pool, but I have a feeling I will just use the sauna and hot tub to relax post workout instead.

I'm lactose intolerant, so I can barely have any milk, so I've grown accustomed to taking my coffee black. Been trying to cut it out, but I think 1 cup in the morning is prolly a good thing. I am a huge tea drinker, mostly black (regular, early grey, english breakfast), but I have a soft spot for white and green as well. I keep a box of green at my desk at work and have a cup every afternoon. I generally will have 3-4 cups of tea total per day.

I generally have a bagel for breakfast. :-/

I will be having a salad for lunch 2-3 days a week (off days from workouts most likely)

I always make sure to have at least 2 servings of vegetables with dinner, and have been doing my best to control my portions of the other food groups.

I generally switch between a Muscle Milk Lite and a homemade Whey Protein shake after workouts.

I figured I might as well explorer all avenues for looking for jobs so I figured that I would post on here as well.

I'm a sophomore dual computer science and information science student at Northeastern University in Boston, MA. Northeastern university has a cooperative education (co-op for short) program that allows their students to spend up to 3 six month sessions working full time at a company or doing research. I've started looking for my coop session, which is coming up starting in July (or June) and ending in the end of December.

My past job experience includes working at TripAdvisor LLC as an IT Intern where I participated in daily helpdesk and IT team operations including deploying new servers and laptops, setting up and trouble shooting a thin-client environment, dealing with equipment RMAs and repairs, deploying a secured HDD solution to the employees as well as whatever else the IT team assigned to me. I've also worked at Zazu, a small startup that is developing ""the smartest damn alarm clock"". You can download it and look at it on the Android Market. Finally, I've also worked at Northeastern's computer helpdesk where I was part of a team of ~40 students that provide tier 1 technical support for PCs, Macs, and Cable TV as well as created scripts and tools to aid in diagnosis and remediation of personal computers. You can see the rest of my experience [here (my resume)](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/nate/NathanHeaps_resume.pdf)

For my first coop, I'm looking for a paid position in the IT field (since that is primarily where my experience is). I don't really care where it is, it could be in Japan for all I care, as long as the pay is enough to cover the cost of living. If you think that you might have something available, please send me a PM. I can also send you a link to my current transcript on request, I have nothing to hide.

All of my other professors got their final exam grades in before New Year's. One of my professors though only submitted my grade THIS MORNING. A week ago I was asking someone who had also been in this class if he'd gotten his grade, and he said that the professor had the stack of exams on his desk still to be graded.

I mean it's fucking absurd. Not only has it been making it harder for me to properly fill out internship applications (since a lot of them want grades), if I showed up a month late to take the exam, do you think he'd let me do it? And as far as I can tell, it's not like he had a family emergency that prevented him from doing the grading, he just ""didn't get to it""--ie, he apparently decided that other work he had was more important that grading our exams. (Just another thing about grad school that makes me me miss my undergrad and my undergrad professors; my advisor almost always had grades up BEFORE they were due, oftentimes even before you'd actually be able to get your grades out of the school's computer system.)

Just like it's the students' JOB to get the homework in on time and to take the exams when we're supposed to, it's the professor's JOB to mark our exams in a timely fashion, IMO. And just like a student would be penalized for not getting an assignment in on time, I don't see why there shouldn't be some sort of compensation for a professor not getting his shit done in a timely fashion--give us all an A on the final and then figure out what everyone's grades are."

You're in a top secret Chinese genetic lab, because you've got a brother who majored in biochem and works there and you were in town, so he brought you in to show you what they've been working on: growing human tissue.

So, there you are, and this brother of yours (who you went to college with) owes you big time. See, back in college, he nearly died, because a crazy homeless man shivved him while your brother was offering him a cigarette one night as you were walking home from town.

Anyway, the homeless man shivs him in the kidney. this is a problem, because when you were a kid, he lost a kidney because he fell off a roof and onto a fence, stabbing himself in the other kidney. So your brother, being bereft of his kidneys, needs a kidney transplant.

So, you step in and donate a kidney. Surgery goes well, and your brother is OK.

Now, it's 2017, and you're in the lab. He tells you that he can give you back an artificially grown kidney, which he does. You now have both kidneys, and everything is OK.

As you're walking out, you walk past another lab, with the word ""Food"" on the door. It's in English, and curious, you ask your brother what the deal is, because there's a cafeteria at the end of the hall. Your brother tells you that it was an initiative to grow human tissue that got botched, because the intern in charge of keeping the records fucked it up, rendering the experiment fucked.

So, the Chinese lab owner, being an innovative chap, decided to continue growing the tissue to use as consumable material. Your brother says that if you want, he can get you a delicious, fresh piece of human steak by 3pm if you so choose. 

Do you eat the lab-grown piece of human steak?

Since I got back to school I have had the unfortunate problem of having Mondays and Wednesdays booked 9:00 AM - 7:15 PM with my internship (which I love) and classes. I have two hours worth of breaks in there which I make the most of by doing some meditating. Tuesdays and Thursday I just have class 11:00-12:15 but feel shitty from the prior day and cannot be productive and Fridays internship 9:00-2:00.

Anyways. The point of this isn't my schedule other than the fact that those Mondays and Wednesdays wipe me out and I feel so crappy throughout those entire days and the days following that I can't do anything. I take Ritalin to help me focus and get through my days. I spent my entire weekend alone in my apartment despite there being plenty of social opportunities. I just had awful headaches and body aches so I knew if I went out it wasn't one of those situations where I would feel better once I was out since I was actually in pain.

I have met a few nice guys lately and we will hook up but I do not have the energy to maintain a relationship so it comes to our relationship pretty much being about sex. This is fine... I just remember when I got mono a few years ago and was out for the count how nice it was to have my boyfriend at the time to lay around with me. My roommate is my best friend but she has her own busy life. I call my mom and she will give me little pep talks and remind me I don't have to be perfect and not to force myself to work so hard at school which is nice. 

I have always been so optimistic about this whole situation, but it has never been this lonely...

I don't have a car, so I get up for my first job at 4 a.m. I have to bus for awhile to get to work between 5:30 and 6. I work from 6 to 8:45 where I pretty much run to my second job a mile away where I work for 4 hours. I get back to my first job (split shifts) at 1 p.m., where I proceed to work until about 6:15 p.m. I then take an hour to bus to my third job on MWF to tutor until about 9 - 9:30. I then go to bed and start it all over.

But I hate my jobs for the most part. My main job (5:30 - 8:45, 1 - 6:15) is minimum wage, boring as shit and I feel like slave labor. I make minimum wage despite the company being incredibly profitable, and I work 40 hours a week with a college degree. It's all that is really available right now. I need it because I have so many medical bills though.

My second job is an internship. I am slave labor who doesn't get paid. It's with a pretty prestigious NGO in a competitive internship position where supposedly I learn ""valuable job skills"" and many apparently get hired from it. Instead, I get treated like an idiot (I've had someone walk through how to do things on computers like ""save a document"" about 3 times over... Despite every time telling them I know how to, and being hired because I knew how to use all the programs they used already). All those valuable skills I am supposedly learning amount to... copying a program or event flyer or something from last year, and replacing the information with the new event. I copy and paste for 4 hours a day on computers that are about 10 years old, while being treated like shit.

My third job is by far my favorite because, while I don't get paid here either, it's for a good reason. I'm a volunteer tutor for several people, including a math tutor for a girl who is basically like a little sister to me. It can be fun at times, but it's still exhausting because it takes an hour to get there plus a 30 minute walk from the bus stop.

I also recently starting breaking out in psoriasis that I didn't know I had before. I'm spending a ridiculous amount of money on medical bills (1000 so far this year!) because I don't have real insurance (I'm on my moms, which is out of pocket until about 4000 or something). None of the treatments are working and it's very stressful. They thought it was excema for awhile, and that I just ALSO had staph infections, so they gave me antibiotics... So now I have a few fungal infections as well that won't go away. I have seen the doctor about all of this, out of pocket.

I rarely get to see my fiancée, but when I do I am so tired. I never get to do anything I enjoy anymore and my entire day is boredom stacked on being-treated-like-shit boredom. I have one job because it pays just enough to break even on medical bills, I have another because it will hopefully help me get a less awful job later and my last because I want to try to do the right thing and these people are too poor to afford a real tutor.

It's just really frustrating."
fe3kv,5,2011-02-02,To Work Or To Intern...,[deleted],Design,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/fe3kv/to_work_or_to_intern/,"As I approach my final year of college, I am met with a conundrum.  Do I work at a job that isn't very creative and get paid, or get an internship where I can work creatively but not get paid. 

Currently I am working at the campus marketing department.  It is mostly design for on campus groups or the university itself.  Due to the very strict graphic guidelines the university has, the pieces I create are not portfolio worthy.  It isn't very fulfilling work, but I get a decent paycheck (for a college student).  

The other option is finding an internship with one of the few design firms or freelancers around town.  Most of them don't pay, but the work varies a lot more and there is more creative freedom.

I am also the design editor at the on campus magazine, but this doesn't take up that much time.  There is amount small work study pay for that, but not a ton.

tl;dr Do I stay at my current design job that pays, but is creatively strangling, or try to find and internship in which I might not get paid.

How to talk about it?",timeislonely,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/fdnoe/girlfriend_of_five_years_consistently_cancels/,"We're both 24 and have been together five years; I'm male. We do not live together, but our places are near; within 10 minutes (I mention this to rule out travel inconvenience).

We have a pretty decent relationship. She's my closest friend without a doubt, and the person I most easily get along with. I really love her, and I don't question if that's mutual.

I recently graduated and have been doing freelance design work from home, and am aware of the over-abundance of free time that can afford. She, on the other hand, is in her final semester which consists of a 9-5, 5-day a week internship. She's much busier than I, to be sure.

For the past 5-6 months, she has been consistently canceling plans, often with no notice. I'll talk to her during the day and she'll say she wants to come over for dinner, or go out or just ""be together."" Then, she will come home from her job and take a multiple-hour ""nap"" and either never let me know, or wait until very late to contact me.

This is frustrating since it keeps me more-or-less in ""standby."" I have loose plans to convene, so I basically have to just sit around waiting on her. If we plan dinner, I won't eat until it gets so late that I can assume she's not coming out. If we have plans to meet friends, I always show up late and only when it's clear I won't be hearing from her. She does this almost every weekday, and even on weekends when she's off. We'll plan a day trip to a nearby city, but she won't be ready until late afternoon when such a trip would be useless.

I've told her very clearly that this bothers me. She feels guilty for, as she puts it, ""letting me down."" I've been direct in telling her that I'm mature enough to handle disappointment if plans fall through, but my problem is her failure to communicate. I can deal with disappointment, but the waiting game is inconsiderate. I've gotten to the point where I feel like she has very little respect for my time.

While I expect this to happen every day, I still continue to wait on her out of consideration. To complicate things, over the past year or so, her sex drive has drastically decreased, down to the point of maybe once a month. I've addressed this and she attribute it to conflicting schedules and always being too tired by the time we might get together (this is after the lengthy nap).

I don't for a minute suspect her of infidelity. She really is going home to sleep or ""just hang out."" When we have pedestrian arguments, she commonly brings up us not being married as a sore spot. I assume she's doubting my commitment to her, but I've never in any way shown anything but complete and total devotion. I have clearly articulated my desire to wait until we're both out of school and have some sort of consistent income before seriously discussing getting hitched.

How can I go about getting through to her with the depth of my frustration? I've tried the old standby of ""only use 'I' statements,"" and being very sympathetic to her work. I'm just baffled by the facepalming nature of her complaining about not seeing me as much when it is her behaviour that is causing the lack.

TL;DR: Girlfriend cancels plans almost every day to sleep and generally shows indifference to seeing me, but waxes depressed about our lack of time together. How can I talk to her about it?"

While there I lived in a cheap one bedroom hotel with a friend in the middle of downtown LA. Making my usual commute to work one morning in the lane going straight I was sitting at a red light about to cross a one way street that was going right when the car to the left of me darted into my lane as soon as the light turned green which immediately made impact to the side of my Toyota Tacoma. I pulled over the side of the road where the driver of the car (a BMW) got out with his girlfriend and apologized repeatedly while begging me not to call my insurance company. He tried offering me $300 for the damage but I immediately called the police and from there the useless California cops told me to just call my insurance company and exchange information since no one was hurt. A week goes by and I get a call from their insurance company claiming I was the one that hit him. Their insurance company (Emerald City Insurance) refused to insure the damage to my car and my insurance company knew he was at fault but couldn't cover my deductible to pay the damage. Turns out AllState ""accidentally"" paid him to fix his damaged BMW while my car continues to sit with damage on it because I can't afford the $1,000 deductible.

I have the guy's information, website, phone number. What kind of things would be a great way to get revenge on the guy that essentially hit and run?

Will an Industrial EIT make up for my lack of relevant post-graduation experience in the field?

If I take the FE in California, can I transfer my EIT to Oregon or Washington?

------------------------------------


A little background: I graduated with a BS (in 08) and MS (in 09) in Industrial &amp; System Engineering from the University of Southern California. I had a little internship experience, and came out with a decent GPA. Unfortunately, I dropped out of the spring recruiting drive (firm fairs, etc) due to a combination of general college burnout and a major life event that had me feeling shellshocked for several months. A few months after graduation, I got a job working at a small energy consulting firm doing general engineering review work through a placement company, but the firm didn't renew my contract after the first year, and my boss referred me to my current employer, where I do software-based modeling of commercial refrigeration systems (not exactly what I've been trained to do). I'm working part time as an independent contractor, and while I like the energy efficiency field in general, I want something more substantial in terms of employment.

Now, my girlfriend is about to graduate from college with a degree in Architecture, and we both want to get out of LA. We're both looking for jobs in the Bay Area &amp; Pacific NW (basically Seattle and Portland). She's a rockstar student and will land a great job... but I'm worried that I'll have trouble landing even an entry level Industrial Engineering job with 2 years of non-relevant experience.

Since I've had to restudy a lot of general engineering for my refrigeration work, I'm thinking about taking the Fundamentals of Engineering exam in April. I've also realized that if I wanted to go much further in the Energy field, I would need to get another degree in either mechanical or electrical engineering, and I don't want to be back in school just yet. As such, I want to take the FE Industrial test, and use that as leverage to get a job in the industrial engineering field. I'll have to take the test in California, but since I'm planning on moving in the summer, I'm wondering if I can transfer it to Oregon or Washington.

Is this plan feasible? Am I wasting my time/money? Have I forgotten something crucial that's going to bite me in the ass? Should I continue to ask rhetorical questions?"

Things suck. Not a little, not in my head. Measurably, with charts and graphs and pictures and arrows. Don't tell me it's not that bad, because it is. 

Stop telling me things will get better. Of course things will get better, that's not in question, the question is WHEN. It took a good 1600 years after the roman empire fell for things to ""get better"". Unless you have access to information that I don't, I don't want to hear it.

Stop offering me pop-capitalist regurgitations about starting your own business and being an entrepreneur, that requires resources that most people simply do not command any longer. Like time and money. You try being an entrepreneur with no money, while working 7 days a week just to keep your head above water. Let's see how well you do.

Stop telling me that all it takes is a little bit of creativity and a CAN DO! spirit to move on up and get your piece of the pie. It's tired bullshit, and I'm sick of hearing it. It's demonstrably false at this point.

Stop telling me about the microscopic percentage of my generation that made it to success. I don't care about them. I care about the other 99% who are just trying to live their lives. If it takes being exceptional to attain a lifestyle that's mediocre, there's a problem.

Stop acting like it's just a matter of getting a job, alright? I have a job. I have two, actually. I work 7 days a week at all hours of the day and night. Half the time I can't even remember what day it is. They both pay better than minimum wage. I'm educated, and I work hard, and have minimal debt, and you know what? I can't even afford an apartment on my own. The problem isn't budgeting, it's income.

Stop telling me to compare myself to people in even shittier parts of the world. I don't care what the standard of living is in rural Botswana. Just because other people elsewhere are living in abject filthy poverty, doesn't make my life better. I can count my blessings while damning my curses at the same time.

What you CAN do, is educate yourselves on the issues me, and others of my generation face. There are many great books out there on the subject (I recommend Generation Debt, Strapped, Falling Behind, Nickel and Dimed, and Bait and Switch). 

What you CAN do is start demanding the changes America needs to ensure some kind of future for your children, and by extension your grandchildren. Pay attention to the massive ripoff that a college education has become, pay attention to the corrupt student loan system, to the price of textbooks that have increased in cost to the point of criminality. The declining entry level jobs, the slave labor of ""internships"" that have replaced most entry level jobs. The homes that increased in cost so much that even after a national collapse of the housing market, it's still impossible to get into, the medical care that most of us have no access to, the families that we cannot have because we could never support them, the careers and good jobs that have left and will never return, and the companies that haven't increased their rate of pay in 30 years.

You want to really help? Stop trying to cheer me up and get together with your friends and demand some changes. We're all in this together, and none of us can do this alone. Thank you for your time. Best of luck to all of you."

Not sure how to deal with my situation appropriately. Let me just list the facts

•	about two years ago a beautiful intern starting working at my company. Within a few weeks I had asked her out and we began dating

•	after about four months she dumped me, no explanation, in my own mind things were great up until about a week before when she started to become more distant. 
 
•	She left once school started again. Fast forward a year. She is now work with me full time. 

•	For awhile it was a huge problem for me because I still liked her, I felt like she never really give me a chance and it was painful to see her everyday. 

•	After a couple of months things calmed down. Things were normal again, I never really said anything to her about it, and she didn’t go around speaking ill of me either

•	About two weeks ago my buddy told me that he started dating her. We met up, I asked him how he was doing. The conversation went something like

o	 “ive been spending a lot of time with April” (name changed)
o	“is this a new girl you found” – me
o	“nah, its your April”

•	At this point I just went silent. I couldn’t believe he would brag to me about being with me ex, especially one he knows I feel terrible about already. 

•	The entire day he continues with this. Saying things like “Now that I have April” or “your April has such a nice body”. 

•	I ask him not to talk about her to me, I didn’t yell, I just kindly asked. His response was “Im not going to censure myself” and pretty much told me to fuck off. 

•	I let the whole thing go. I didn’t mention it to her, but I was feeling pretty shitty about everything. 

•	A week passes; I figure my friend might have realized that I wasn’t really asking for much. I only asked that he not rub my face in it with constant chatter about his life with her. Again, no luck. It was actually more intense that the first time we hung out. So bad in fact that a mutual friend told him to cut it out. 

Do I have a right to be mad? She isn’t my girlfriend anymore, but he is going way out of his way to be an asshole about it. I wont bring it up to her, and I can tell she doesn’t mean anything mean by this, but WTF.

It's for the children!,parallel_unicorn,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/feaqa/help_reddit_im_in_a_bit_of_a_bind_and_i_need_some/,"Last semester, in addition to coaching a middle school debate team established by our professor, I also worked as an intern for the program helping out with behind-the-scenes stuff. It's a really great program which includes a bunch of underprivileged schools, and the kids get some much needed practice with research, public speaking, all that good stuff. I believe this is the program's second year, so while it's definitely taken off there's still a lot of room for improvement.

As an independent project, I wrote a guide booklet intended for the ~200 or so students in the whole league. It's meant to be entertaining as well as informative so it has a greater chance of actually being read. I want to make the format kind of like a mini-magazine with pictures, a nice layout, etc. so it doesn't just feel like worksheets or homework. If it works out, these will be given to all new debaters in upcoming years which will hopefully help the kids out and solidify the program a bit.

The content is more or less finished but the problem is, I have **no** experience with graphics/layout programs (Scribus, InDesign, and GIMP are what I've been toying with--would prefer to work with Scribus or GIMP because my InDesgn is only a trial) and I really have no idea what I signed up for when I agreed to do this. I can't seem to make the layout on the screen match what's actually being printed. 

I need to make a sort of mini-magazine (think Playbill) for an indefinite number of pages (I won't know how many until I actually start assembling it). Something like [this](http://imgur.com/5y6hI). Can someone point me to some sort of template or otherwise advise me on the best way I can accomplish this? I'm not aiming for perfection here, but I don't want it to look anything like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/fa4iq/thats_when_i_decided_this_job_wasnt_for_me_actual/). I basically just need a template that will allow me to freely drag and drop while printing correctly.

I realize there's probably a more appropriate subreddit for my query, but I'm kind of pressed for time so that's why I'm here. The booklets need to be done by next week, when the new ""season"" starts for the kids, and even after I figure out how to get it to print correctly it's still probably going to take me the entire weekend and lots of Red Bull to actually get it done in time. However I can't even get started until I get this template shit figured out. Thanks in advance for your help!

I am also familiar with MATLAB &amp; SolidWorks.

I recently left an internship fair an hour ago and there was almost hiring mechanical or aerospace engineers. I was at a career fair last month with the same result. The one person I actually had a full conversation mentioned that an ME may start off between 40-50k. That number hit me hard, that is not a lot of money whatsoever...

What really got to me was that it contradicted all the research I did before college. I remember looking at the department of labor and seeing higher numbers like here http://stats.bls.gov/oco/ocos027.htm and here http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes172141.htm

What I'm really asking is should I be worried? First about securing a job, and two about one that will pay me well? That same guy told me that you get paid on how well you sell yourself.

Also is there anywhere else I can go to get internship information, maybe one you guys know about something that would be of interest to me? I would be happy to send out my resume...

I always have regrets because my parents always wanted me to do pharmacy because its secure and starting pay is about 100k, but doesn't increase after that really...but then again i'd be happy getting that much without an increase! The reason I didnt do it is because it is more chemistry and biology heavy and I'm very much a math/physics guy.

Any input would help me soo much! Also is there anything you guys would recomend I do to improve my resume, like anything I should learn? thanks guys, i'm kind of going through a 'mid-college' crisis"

I kind of want to try out the tech company because I've never worked at a place like that before and want to give it a shot. However, I'm pretty sure I want to go into games. (Plus, I loved working at the game studio.)

My question is, how much will it hurt me if I go with the non-gaming internship? Do employers want to see that I've pretty much focused entirely on games and have the most experience possible? Will showing that some game studio wanted me to come back help me even more?

I just found this community and it seems cool.  Anyways, I'm an accounting and jazz performance major at a university and I was just wondering what I should expect when entering ""the real world"" under my circumstances.



I'm not going to be able to take an internship since I'll have been here five and a half years at that point and may need to pay a surcharge for my credits this last semester (the amount of time is because of my two unrelated majors.)  To do an internship I would need to stay a semester longer as well.  I don't have an extremely good academic record, although I have around an overall 3.0 GPA and a higher one for just my accounting courses as well as being CPA eligible.  I also have related experience job wise, although I've been working my entire way through college. The only volunteering I've been doing so far since I picked up my accounting major about a semester ago has been working jazz festivals, concerts, playing in community groups, and other music community things.  Will it be hard for me to find work when I graduate in December?  Also do you think that possible employers will frown at my music major?  It seems like all my peers in the business department scoff at me when I say I'm also a jazz performance major.



Thanks for your time guys, any information on what to expect will be greatly appreciated.

**TL;DR:**  *I'm about to graduate college as an accounting major.  I have no internship, work experience, a 3.0 GPA, and no volunteer work outside of the music department.  What are my prospects on getting hired?  Any advice for me?*

* Where and how should I approach finding a place?  Ideally I'm looking for a decent room for rent for a couple months while I stabilize and find a more permanent one-bedroom arrangement.
* Where are some of the nicer, trendier spots in the area for food, drink and just general socializing?  I'm not going to know anyone, really, so I want to be active and acclimate myself to the social scene as seamlessly as possible.

Oh damn.  I completely  forgo t that I put that as my password in the beginning of the year.  What the hell was I thinking?  It was probably the longest 20 seconds of my life before I final ly got my balls  together to stand  up and leave .  Just as I walk out the door she says, 

""In the future,  you might  want to bear in mind what kind of thing s you want keep to yours elf. ""

I was so freaking embarrassed I wanted to kill myself right  then and there .  I wanted to run the hell out of there  and never ,  ever see her again .  But something about  what she just said kept me standing in her doorway.  I decided to man up and apologize.  I turned to her, looked her straight in the eyes,  and swallowed my pride .  And then,  it hit me like a train  full of bricks. 

She was eating Salmon. 

She tries  to eat all healthy,  natural foods ,  like wild berries and honey . 

She told me that I might  want to bear in mind what kind of thing s I want to keep to myself. 

Ms. Depew  was a bear disguised as a human . 

Immediately,  the bear saw that I had seen through its charade.  It roared loudly and took a menacing swipe  at me. I deftly avoid ed its claw and sprinted out of the office.  The bear was soon in chase ,  crashing through the walls  of the office as if they were made of paper .  I jumped over the receptionist desk and ran out the back entrance.  The bear followed,  tossing the secretary aside  like a rag doll.  The bear began  to pursue me through the street traffic.  While  I fought my way through the maze of vehicles,  the bear simply careened its massive force  through anything standing in its way. Cars veered off the road to escape the onslaught of grizzly force  that was barreling down the road.  The bear was gaining fast.  I had no other  option but to make my way into the nearest building:  a preschool.  I burst  through the door,  start ling the children from their  naps.  Immediately,  the bear slammed through the wall,  crushing a child  beneath his massive paws and burying several other  children in sheet  rock and debris.  I maneuvered  my way through the chaos  towards the back exit.  The pre-schoolers were little more than a screaming annoyance for the bear.  Its massive paws cut swath s through the sea of toddlers with each swipe .  I used the precious time these  children had afforded for me to make my escape into the playground .  I scram bled up a ladder to a fort- like structure.  My goal was to walk across the monkey bars then jump to a tree which  I could  climb  to the roof of the preschool and perhaps flag down a passing helicopter . 

I began  my trek across the monkey bars just as the bear charged outside,  its teeth  and claws  still  fresh  with the blood  of the innocent.  It let out a monstrous roar and began  its assault on the cheap ,  wooden playset.  I let go of all caution and ran to end the end of the monkey bars.  I leaped for the tree branch just as the bear' s enormous girth  came plowing through the entire structure.  I grasp ed the branch tightly as the bear collided with the tree,  sending it into a daze.  I saw this as my one opportunity not for escape,  but for victory.  I leapt  off the tree onto the ground and grabbed a stray  bar that had been shorn  from the playset.  The bear was slowly coming to so I had to act fast.  I ran to the beast  and thrust the jagged end of the pole into its jaw and through it's skull . 

The bear had been defeated.  I shambled home in pain but victorious.

But today ,  I returned home a champion.

tl;dr:  School counselor was deceitful but should I have asked her out?"

The idea has always scared me a little bit, so I've repressed it and tried to act as masculine as possible, which I've actually come to like about myself. I've dated and had sex with girls for years, but it's never been satisfying and I've always felt that I'm not really getting anything out of it. Additionally, to avoid being depressed, I've kept myself buried in work for as long as I can remember. Right now, I'm a 21 year old college student at a pretty prestigious university and I just accepted an internship at Google. I'm about as stoked as they come for my future, but I can't help but feeling fairly hollow inside.

A few days ago, I got pretty drunk with a few friends at a local bar. One of the guys I was hanging out with is openly bi, and, for some reason, I decided that I wanted to talk to him one-on-one this night. Eventually, I was walking home from the bar alone with him and I decided to come out to him. It was probably pretty awkward, but I got it out there. I started to cry when we got to his apartment, which seemed to scare him a little bit. He hugged me and told me that I wasn't the first to come out to him, and that he would keep it private. When I was walking home, I felt better than I'd felt in a long time. It was an amazing, liberating feeling. I just don't think I can bring myself to come out entirely. It's one thing to come out to a close friend who has gone through something similar - it's quite another to come out to a fraternity of guys who think they know the ""whole"" you. If I come out to people, the two things I fear most are: them thinking ""well..._that_ explains it,"" and being typecast to a group that I don't really identify with. Anyone got any suggestions or been through anything similar?

fgb42,0,2011-02-06,I am Filled With Worry and Woe: Confessions of an Uneasy Intern. Advice is Appreciated.,Worryandwoe,education,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/fgb42/i_am_filled_with_worry_and_woe_confessions_of_an/,"So, the following series of long winded rhetoric is a brief 5-year autobiography for me that will explain why I'm filled with such unrest.

After graduating High School I was accepted to the [University Here]. At that time, I wasn't sure what I wanted to study, and I made my decision based on short sighted reasons involving a girl. Shortly after socializing with people in my dorm community I found myself immersed into the culture that's kept me getting up in the morning everyday: Heavy Metal and Hardcore music. Doom, Sludge and Post-Metal more specifically.

I founded a band and intended to study Hospitality. Fast-forward a year, Hospitality isn't anything resembling satisfying for me. Working for Expedia proved that. I took my winter break that year to do some serious reflecting. Having taught Karate for 7 years through High School and College, I decided that working towards the betterment of the generation behind me was a personally respectable and satisfying choice for career. I switched my major to Language Arts Education at the advice of my advisor against my instinctual reasoning to earn a degree in Composition. Mistake #1.

I start taking Education classes, and BOY am I unfulfilled. However, promises of more challenging and relevant curriculum given by my professors kept me pushing. It never came. This gave me time, however, to start my own Metal/Hardcore promotion company, go on a few out of state tours to play shows, and enjoy college to the fullest.

Junior Year was when my life took a more sincere turn. My best friend in the whole world passed away due to a heart condition at 23 years old. My girlfriend of 5 years at the time became jealous of my mourning for my best friend (who was female) and leaves me, throwing me out of our apartment. I still am feeling unchallenged academically having taken all of my English requirements (equivalent to 1/3 of a Lit Degree). I was a wreck for nearly a year, and I took until late 2010 to regain 100% composure. 

Taking classes like Young Adult Literature, Teaching English in K-12 were not helpful either. The average class involved 60 minutes of hooting soccer momlets talking about their week. This practice was considered routine by our own professor. The remaining 2 hours of the class involved a series of long winded presentations/projects from students in the same boat as me. The majority of my classes were comprised of little to no involvement on behalf of the professor other than basic facilitation of student centered curriculum. This consisted of half-hearted attempts at lesson plans, powerpoint presentations riddled with clip art, pictures of their husband/fiancee, and extensive descriptions on why they enjoy their favorite CW programming; among other barely relevant topics. I'm fucking suffocating.

Back to music, I represent bands with names like: Weedeater, Eyehategod, Zoroaster, etc etc. Not the most PC choices in titling, but the music/sound that each band evokes is thoroughly satisfying to those that enjoy passion in their music. This is a cause for concern for me should my students/parents ever draw that connection. I will not abandon everything I’ve established in the music scene my friends and I have constructed from the ground up in just 3 years. 

I'm currently in my Senior Internship with a High School in my county. I'm working with the AP English Chair as my supervising teacher. Sounds great right? Wrong. I was bottlenecked into teaching her HUMANITIES class for her. Not only teaching, but developing 100% of the curriculum from scratch because she'd never taught the class before. I have little/no experience in evaluating students for social science curriculum, so I've been researching ideas online and I've had small victories in just four weeks. 

I graduate in May, and lose my university appointed position at the end of August leaving me unemployed. I have a good rapport with my supervising teacher and department so employment is looking good at this point. There have even been hints that I’m already being considered for an opening in the next school year. However, my supervising teacher also claimed that my degree was almost worthless compared to that of a Composition/Literature major. She seemed optimistic though, saying that I should just strive to earn my graduate degree after establishing employment. 

However, this brings me to my points:

1. As a promoter of Doom, Sludge and Death Metal do I have a giant target painted on my back for lawsuit crazed parents to pick off from a safe distance?
2. Having obviously been unprepared and lied to by my university in not earning the correct degree, am I at a severe disadvantage for job security?
3. My current plan is to earn my graduate degree so as to further my craft as a writer and educator (and not have to lose sleep over worrying about if my personal projects and hobbies would interfere with job security). Would teaching entry level composition classes at the collegiate level be feasible with this degree? 

Tldr; liberal Floridian junior teacher feels unprepared and that he must live a stressful double life under two different last names depending on who he’s talking to

All advice is appreciated. Thanks."
fg8vi,2,2011-02-06,It's over. What should I say?,whatshouldido11,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/fg8vi/its_over_what_should_i_say/,"Hi guys. I have been in an on-again-off-again relationship for the past 4 and half years. She and I got together the first semester of our senior year of high school, and we dated for about 10 months before our first break-up.

We were in love and we both decided to go to the same college, but she had family issues I wasn't aware of and had to drop out the first month we were there to move back home. That blindsided me caused me to break up with her (another long story).

Since then, she had another boyfriend and they were together for a while, but eventually they broke up and she told me that a major reason for that was because she still wasn't over me.

I told her that I wasn't over her either, but that I didn't think it would be a good idea to get back together because I was still in school, while she was still back at home 200 miles away. She asked me if she should wait for me, and I told her that I didn't know what fate had in store for us in the future and that anything was possible. So we decided to wait for each other until I graduated.

This was the summer after my sophomore year.

During my junior year, we started moving apart emotionally again and meanwhile, I got accepted for an internship 1000 miles away. When I moved at the beginning of last summer, it got harder and harder for me to still see a future between us and that scared me. So one night last May I called her up and told her that I still loved her and that I thought we could somehow make this long distance relationship work. She was really happy and so was I.

For a while.

I starting thinking about how I would never be moving back home once I graduated and I thought about how she had these dreams to go back to school and become a pharmacist. We would be apart from each other for years and years more, and I started to doubt everything again. And now I know that it's not going to work out.

I wrote her the following letter telling her that I want to move on, but I wanted to run it past you guys first to get your opinion if parts of it are too harsh or not harsh enough.

Thanks for your input:


&gt;Jane,
&gt;
&gt;I am writing this the day after we sat down and I told you that I thought we could make our relationship work out. I have been trying to think of the best way to tell you this for a while now, but the longer I wait, I the more I realize that there is no best way to say this: we're through. I lied to you, and for that I am deeply sorry. The truth is that I have had doubts about us for a long time, and I have been struggling for a while to overcome them, but in the back of my mind they are always there.
&gt;
&gt;We are becoming two very different people, and our paths in life are taking us both in different directions. In the past, I thought that somehow everything would work out for us; that fate would be on our side to bring us together one day; that one day, everything would click and it would feel right for me. But as time has gone on, I just can't see that day coming, and now I'm tired of waiting and tired of hoping. I'm ready to move on and to accept that this isn't in the cards for us.
&gt;
&gt;I know this will come as a shock to you, but you must have known something wasn't right between us. I have been distant for a while now, and I tried telling you how I was feeling back in August, but I caved and told you what you wanted to hear, just as I did the other night we were together. I never wanted this to go on for so long the way it has, but I couldn't bear to say anything to you until I was absolutely sure of what I wanted. I wasn't trying to be cruel or heartless; I just wanted to spare you of this pain for as long as I could.
&gt;
&gt;I do want you to know, though, that what I told you last May, that I loved you still, was true then and it's true now and will always be true. I won't take back those words or the feelings behind them. But sometimes I feel that it would have been better for both of us if I had never said anything because I had doubts about us even then. I was just hoping that if you knew, I could work through them and finally see a future with us together, but it was unsuccessful.
&gt;
&gt;I know how much I mean to you and how much time you have spent worrying about our relationship and trying to make it work. I know that it must have been really hard on you every time I was distant with you, every time I didn’t return your messages or your calls. You may have thought about quitting then and moving on every time I hurt you by pulling away. And you may be thinking now that all of these years have been a waste, but I don’t. You were my first girlfriend, and you showed me what it was to really love someone; and even though our time together has been full of hurdles, I don’t regret any of it for I will always cherish what we had together.
&gt;
&gt;I want you to know that I have always believed in you, even when you didn’t believe in yourself. You are an amazing, brave, powerful woman and I truly believe you can do anything you set your mind to. I want you to remember to keep those who know that close to you, and keep those naysayers in your life from interrupting your dreams. Your dreams belong to you and no one else. Treasure them, cultivate them, and don’t give up on them. You can accomplish them.
&gt;
&gt;And please don’t give up on love.
&gt;
&gt;I think it will be best for both of us if we don’t try to contact each other for a while. I am going to remove you from my friends list along with all of our mutual friends so the temptation isn’t there. You may write back to me when you are ready.
&gt;
&gt;John

Should I go back to school and finish up my second BS and adding even more money to my massive student loan debt (~100k)?  Read The Plan: for a more in depth question, if you wouldn’t mind.

**Then:** I always wanted to be a game developer, so I thought a CS degree would take me there.  I started out at UTSA, had a great first year, completely flaked the second year, transferred to Full Sail and graduated with a BS in Game Design and Development.  After graduating, I helped my dad per our arrangement for 8 months, then started looking for a job.  I moved to Houston later on to be in a larger town, stop mooching off my parents, and continue to pay back my student loans.  It's been 4 years since I've graduated and I've yet to find a job.

**Right Now:**  As of right now, I live in Houston working nights at a hotel making $12.50/hr, I do tutoring and teach some on the side, and I’m trying to start a small mobile apps studio.  I make ~$25k per year, and because I finally figured out the stupid importance of money and how to manage it, I’ve been able to funnel about $8,000 per year of that into my student loan with a decent size emergency fund and no other debts.  The problem is after a year of doing this, I’m beat.  I work almost 18 hours a day for about 6 days a week, I have absolutely no social life because I work nights, and haven’t been able to enjoy a lot of the things I used to.  I’m OK with that, you have to do what you have to do.  However, considering I have ~$100,000 in student loan debt left to pay, I don’t think I could survive doing this for another 12-15 years.  I need to find a catalyst; I need to do something that will springboard me into a more prosperous place.

**The Plan:**  I plan on transferring into UT Austin using my original credits from UTSA and finishing up my CS degree there.  Should I get in this coming fall, I should be able to finish up my degree in 3-4 semesters plus summers.  I don’t know if I’ll be able to get in for this fall semester, as I would have to apply as a transfer from UTSA with my failed craptastic year and low GPA, as UT Austin does not care if you have an undergrad degree or not if you’re seeking a second bachelors.  To help boost my GPA as well as fulfill some of the UT Austin degree reqs, I’ll be taking classes at the HCC (Houston Community College).  When the summer ends, I’ll be moving to Austin regardless if I am accepted or not, as it must cheaper to live in Austin than in Houston, and the software and game industries are huge there.  If I’m not accepted, I’ll continue taking transferable credits at ACC (Austin Community College) and try again the next semester.  I’ll also be working there, as I’ve made a lot of contacts in the hotel industry.  If/When I get accepted into UT Austin, I’ll still be actively looking for a job, internship, or any opportunity that will get me to where I want to go, as well as putting effort into rebuilding a current portfolio and working on the mobile apps studio.

**EDIT:** Holy hell, I submitted this thing and it's the longest post I've seen.  I've cut out a lot of backstory and context, but if anyone is curious I can post it as a reply."

fg5vk,0,2011-02-06,I fucking hate my boss (Rant. Nothing to see here),[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/fg5vk/i_fucking_hate_my_boss_rant_nothing_to_see_here/,"I was lucky enough to get a job in the entertainment industry right out of college after working my way up for three months as an intern.  I work in the mail room, which I know isn't much but it keeps me afloat when it comes to bills.  I do, however, work 60 hours a week with a 1 hour commute each way.

My boss (the ultra-wealthy owner of the company) regularly likes to play ""jokes"" on me.  I was okay with them at first, because apparently getting regularly punched in the shoulder by him while walking down the hallway meant he liked you.  But things only got worse from there.  He once forcefully pushed me into a conference room full of executives, to their amusement.  Three days ago I wore new, white shoes to work.  He scuffed them for the hell of it.  The other day he tackled me and threw me into an elevator in front of more executives, again to their amusement.

I was able to handle it up until now, because it was just a minor inconvenience in my day to be made to feel like a lesser person.  However on Friday things reached a tipping point.  I was sorting the mail as I usually do, when he came up to me.  He asked me what I was doing, and I casually answered, ""sorting the mail"".  He took a look at the big post office box full of letters, grabbed it, and dumped it all on the floor.  I bent to pick all of the envelopes up, and then he stepped on my shoes again.  Then he asked me what I would think if he kicked me in the face right then, and I replied that I probably wouldn't like it.  He berated me a little more and then left.

I know it's probably not the worst ""my boss is a dick"" story, but I sacrifice a lot just to have a meager job in this industry, and it's getting harder and harder to get up in the morning knowing that I'm going to be treated like dirt.  Anyway if you've gotten this far, thanks for reading.  It means more than you think."
fg2op,1,2011-02-05,"Reddit, how do I deal with my girlfriend's stalker ex-boyfriend",jvi,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fg2op/reddit_how_do_i_deal_with_my_girlfriends_stalker/,"I've been with this girl for about two years now, and I'm really in love with her. The problem is right now we are on completely different continents due to school/work. I'm about to graduate, but she's finishing an internship and still has a year of school to go after that. We've probably only been physically together for a year, and it's been rough at times doing LD, but we've made it through the hardest parts and we're still going strong.

Anyways, this week, out of nowhere, her ex-boyfriend calls her (he's on the same continent as me, but not the same city) and tells her to leave me and get back with him. Now, I know little about him (I don't even know his name), but I know he's an accountant and pretty smart (top of the class), and they were together for about 2 years before he cheated on her. 

But, this guy basically destroyed her life. He made her move with him to a different city, and she's the kind of girl that believes in sacrificing a lot for love. She also gave him all her money because she was working at the time and he wasn't. Then, he cheated on her and left her there and went back to his city. She couldn't go back due to financials. Her life was a mess since then, which is why she has to graduate later with not as good a degree.

I met her maybe 4 months after she broke up, and I always try to help her financially and make her happy (she had depression for a while), but she pretty much always refused any money, so I just always insist on paying whenever we eat together. I'm also just a poor student, but I just spend money very rarely, so I have quite a bit saved up.

Now, she pretty much tells me everything that happens in her life, which is how I know the guy called her. And, he's been calling her day and night for a few days now. She also told me that she previously tried to file a restraining order against him, but the guy's parents pressured her parents and forced her not to do it. These are asian parents. They'll do anything for their son, even at the cost of the well-being of others. Also, the girl's parents are very nice people, and would probably put other's needs before their own or their daughter's.

Since the ex-boyfriend and her physically apart, I know a restraining order doesn't make much sense right now. And she says she doesn't want to do it because it will ""ruin his reputation."" But, the guy cheated on her, took all her money, left her in a cold place by herself, and is now harassing her to try to get back together.

I'm not sure what I wanted to ask anymore. I guess I just wanted to type this out. But, does anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with this? When we're physically together, I'll probably insist that she file a restraining order, but is there anything else I could do? I've told my girlfriend that I could call the guy or his parents and have a nice chat simply telling them to stop harassing my girlfriend, but she refused and said she ""can handle it.""

She's under alot of pressure right now due to work and the coming school term, and I just want to try to help get rid of this additional unnecessary pressure. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

tl;dr my girlfriend's ex calls her out of nowhere and tell her to dump me and get back with him. he has physically abused her in the past, but they've never had sex. i want her to file a restraining order against him, but she refuses because she doesn't want to ""ruin his reputation."" how do I keep my girlfriend safe?"

Can I get some high fives?,michellijp,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fg235/havent_tried_to_contact_her_for_one_month_can_i/,"Girlfriend--er, ex-girlfriend (25/f)--broke up with me (24/m) at the end of December. Made a couple of overtures to her for us to get back together, was tearfully but firmly told no. Last time we spoke was Jan. 8; I told myself that out of my love for her I would respect her request for space even if it killed me inside. 

If any of you out there have recently been dumped, let me tell you that it gets better. I'm still not out of the woods yet, but it gets a little better each day. I picked up a new internship, picked up a new exercise regimen, rearranged my whole house, and I try to get out as much as I can. If you just got dumped, I can't stress this enough: BREAK ALL CONTACT! NO MORE CONTACT! Also, find ways to get out of the house and be social. You don't have to start thinking about other girls, but just getting out and chatting with new people helps. 

I cried today. Every few days I'll just start to cry--the most random things can bring up the pain again. But the crying helps too.

However, one of them requires a considerable amount of security clearance. A good portion of the US ones in the same field require you to be a US citizen for that reason, but it didn't mention it on the requirements for the Canadian internship. 
Does anyone know if you need to be a Canadian citizen in order to get security clearance?



I looked at some of the forms and it didn't mention it, although reference in Canada were need (which I have). I also tried Google but was flooded with question about being Canadian and getting US clearance, not the other way around.


Any insight would be appreciated! Worst case, I guess I'll find out if they tell me I can't take the internship."

So basically, I'm a Physics Major at UCSB and currently on my 3rd year. My first two years were a cakewalk, where I took GEs and only one Physics Class at a time, a long with a lab.This made it fairly easy for me to keep a 3.85GPA for a while, but now that I have finally hit upper-division classes and have to take 3 at a time, I've noticed my GPA slowly going down.

I got an A-, B+, B last quarter for Mathematical Methods, Stellar Structure and Evolution, and Thermodynamics. The point is that I feel like if I project this my GPA will definitely drop below a 3.5 by the time I graduate, and I really am putting in a lot of effort into everything. Besides the usual class-related stuff I work as an Engineering intern at a local company associated with my campus, and at the same time I'm working on getting a few things set up so I can do research for a Professor this summer.

I'm really not sure where I'm going after it is all over, I am definitely planning on attending Grad School, but I'm stuck between sticking to Physics or jumping on the Aerospace Bandwagon (although, I would have very little idea on how).

TLDR: 3rd Year Physics Major at UCSB, used to 3.85GPA. Upper-divisions have dropped it down a bit, most likely going to end up below 3.5 by the time I graduate. Is this gonna cause issues for me getting Grad Schools? What exactly should be my priority at this point? Finding a research field in something I like?

Thanks, Gents."
fhslu,6,2011-02-08,Has anyone here made a drastic career change within the legal profession? (specifically: corporate to civil rights),[deleted],law,https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/fhslu/has_anyone_here_made_a_drastic_career_change/,"And if so, any advice for doing so?

I'm posting this as much to help myself think about it as much as I am to solicit advice, so please feel free to skip the background and gory details of how I came to ask this question.

**Backround:** I'm a 3rd year corporate associate in big law (specifically in finance), graduate of a top 10 law school, undergrad degree in economics. I loved economics and went into law school with my eye solely on being a deal lawyer. I built my course schedule around that goal, taking every corporate or finance-related class I could get into, b. school classes on negotiation and corporate finance, and I even worked part-time during school as an intern for in-house counsel, instead of doing a journal or moot court.  I got my top choice for a job coming out of law school, and have endured massive layoffs.  I should feel proud and lucky to be where I am.  And yet after two and half years on the job, I've come to the conclusion that I utterly hate this shit.  It would take me all day to describe all the reasons why, but I need to make a change soon or I may lose my sanity.

I've spent quite a bit of time thinking about what I would rather do, and what I've learned about what I definitely do not want to do, and here's what I've come up with:

(1) **Something I care about doing, rather than something I find interesting at the time.**  Looking back, I can't help feel like my interest in transactional law was much more than a fleeting one that I convinced myself I would enjoy, based on what I expected I would like (considering my educational background), what I thought I would be good at, and a bit of rationalization of my urge to chase money and prestige.  Now I know that, if I'm to spend a good 70-80% of my waking time on something, it needs to be something I actually care about, something that I will actually derive some feeling of satisfaction from doing well.  I get plenty of praise for doing excellent work above my experience level, but I don't really care about the outcome of these deals or the well-being of the firm, and as a result, I also get plenty of criticism for not being committed enough.  My billable hours are abysmal and it's been tossed out there that I might prefer to move in-house or to a smaller firm.  I have two motivations in my current job: (a) avoid getting fired, so that I still have the means to pay my loans and (b) a sense of personal pride that compels me to do good work. I'm basically a highly compensated indentured servant. 

(2) **Something with a modicum of social value.** I have a genuine, deep concern for the state of our society, and yet I spend most of my time contributing a marginal amount value only to the institutions and individuals who are worsening it.  At best, finance is completely amoral, and most of the lawyers, bankers, traders, etc. in it are at best completely oblivious, if not actually despicable.  As a bit of an aside, I've become horrified at the amount of human capital that is devoted solely to arcane areas of finance, where the only objective is to figure out how to make more money off of money (real or imagined).  I want to stop being such a hypocrite and actually commit myself to making things right.

(3) **Less of a desk job, more excitement.** It's hard for me to describe the depth of my boredom and disinterest with what I do.  Whether we're busy or slow, I'm always thinking of what 500 other things I'd rather be doing. By my nature, I'm a creative person, and a bit of a thrill-seeker, yet I spend most of my time huddled behind my desk performing tedious paper-pushing.

**Conclusion:** Taking these factors into consideration, I know what I want to do: civil rights litigation.  My interests and politics and have shifted massively throughout my life, but my first passion, and the only thing I've cared about consistently (since I was about 12 years old) was civil rights/civil liberties.  I am passionate about the issues, interested in the legal theory and jurisprudence, and believe it is an area in need of more committed and talented people.  Trying cases is also far more consistent with my competitive personality, and I've always gotten a nervous thrill from public speaking.

**So my question is: is making the move from the corporate biglaw track to ultimately becoming a civil rights trial lawyer a realistic goal whatsoever?**

tl;dr: corporate biglaw associate in finance wants instead to save the world and live up to his childhood ideals."

My boyfriend and I have been together for 16 months exactly now (disclaimer: no I'm not one of those girls who counts every second and every day, it just so happens to be the 8th, which is our anniversary day). We're very serious; he's been ring-shopping when I'm not around and has ""the perfect way to propose"". He's already gone out and bought me some gifts, so I want to do something special for him, especially so since he's such a great guy and has been so damn good to me.

I'm in favor of more thoughtful than expensive, especially since my budget is tight while I try to pay off my car with internship money before returning to college.

Here's what he likes, and I'll list some things he already has.

Likes: cooking, geeky things/tech/electronics, puzzles, tv, reading, his car (2010 Nissan Versa), photography, travelling, gaming

Already has:

* super-expensive desktop, buying a new laptop shortly, awesome sound system, big screen TV, bluray player, a million remotes.

* every kitchen utensil that exists other than a stand mixer/unitaskers (Alton Brown anyone?)

* a Kindle to read with

* brand new touch-screen car stereo, speakers, amp, and gps

* lots of little things like pocket knives, mice, keyboards, etc etc

What I can do (maybe):

* drawings

* crafty/artsy things (to some extent, though these are often frustrating for me)

* knit

I really want to make him something that says ""I love you and thank you for everything you do. You make me super happy."" And throw in some little thoughtful store-bought things, maybe. 

Any ideas, ladies? I appreciate the help.

TL;DR: What do you buy for the man who has everything he wants, but deserves so much more, for Valentine's Day? 

P.S.: No to lingerie (too expensive!!! Plus I already have a few pieces), and since this is asking ladies for help, this may be unnecessary, but please no ""Give him coupons for blow jobs!"" etc. Thanks :D"
fhn92,0,2011-02-08,"Seriously /r/politics, can we agree to never post another link to the Huffington Post?",drinkonlyscotch,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/fhn92/seriously_rpolitics_can_we_agree_to_never_post/,"I propose to you that Huffington Post is not reddit-worthy. I'm sure many of you have witnessed the gradual degradation of its quality as I have. But it's gone too far now and I wanted to let you all know why I will be downvoting any and all links to HuffPo regardless of how critical the story is. Here are just a few reasons why HuffPo is not deserving of reddit's readership:


1. The front page has been overrun by slideshows and Top Ten lists designed to do nothing more than generate pageviews. Often, the contents of these lists are straight-up stolen from other sites which are never cited.

2. Another thing you're likely to find on the homepage is celebrity gossip. And no, not things that are actually news like Jack Lalanne's passing, but real gossip. Like today's story: ""Katy Perry Reveals Her Weight In 'Elle'"". 

3. The political coverage has also become quite a joke. Most of the articles are written by unpaid interns or journalism grads who are just excited about the opportunity to write for a big, well-known pub. In addition to that, much of the political content is written by celebrity guest writers including such intellectuals as Madonna and 50 Cent.

4. HuffPo regularly publishes quack science bullshit including stories about Homeopathy and anti-vaccination hackery. Today, one of the top stories in the ""Living"" section is titled ""7 Ways Meditation Can Save Your Life."" If that doesn't sound like a truckload of donkey shit, I don't know what does.

5. AOL has just acquired Huffington Post and with last week's leak of [The AOL Way](http://www.slideshare.net/d1n1ska/aol-strategy-leak-feb-2011) it's clear that HuffPo's already highly questionable journalistic standards are set to take a nose dive from the gutter into the sewer.

So reddit, if you're a regular HuffPo reader I suggest you rethink your habit and switch to a left-leaning magazine or blog that still has integrity such as [The New Republic](http://www.tnr.com/), [TPM](http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/), or [Daily Kos](http://www.dailykos.com/).



TLDR: HuffPo sucks and we all know it. Should reddit really be getting its news from a magazine that writes stories titled ""Professional Guidelines For Sleepovers Still Lacking""? I think not."

EDIT2: I am in the USA.

Hey guys. I'm a 2nd-year (almost 3rd year) student at a university, doing a BS in CS at the moment. I'm starting to think about grad school a little bit - my school has a program where if you keep your GPA at a 3.5 or above and do enough undergrad research, you can apply to grad school and not have to take the GRE. On top of that, you can finish your BS AND MS in a total of 5 years if you are accepted. (being accepted depends largely on the fact that you have done undergrad research)

Does this sound like a good path to take? I have done absolutely no undergrad research so far so I would probably need to get on that. Also, I'm kind of interested about how useful a MS is in the real world, seeing as the company I intern for only has 1 guy with a MS. My dad's trying to push me to do it because he thinks I'll hit a 'glass ceiling' at work if I don't, but I'm not sure it always works like that...

Since there seems to be a lot of ""im in school and need guidance/help"" posts, I'll start with the beginning;

I started undergrad at Stetson university as an international business major. After a difficult conversation with my neighbor (M&amp;A Lawyer) about how this degree will help me I decided to switch to finance (Sophomore year). Sophomore year I really wasn't ""following the markets."" I wasn't into finance because; a) the coursework was fairly mundane and b) I didn't know the scope of what I could do within the industry (from I-Banking to VC to being a broker to Investment Management to trading). 

That summer I started to tentatively follow the markets during my study abroad in Austria. 

I came back Junior year with a fresh appetite for learning the material and really applied myself, I started to pull my grades up (had too much fun freshman/sophomore year) and took an AMAZING PE/VC class that really got my brain spinning with wanting to get into buyside finance. Much to my disappointment I realized that I didnt have the grades (3.3 gpa) or the brand name school to get anywhere near that side of the industry. 

I started applying aggressively to all the bulge bracket bank websites for internships in August/September of 2007 (keep the time frame in mind as it is important). I didnt, and was not expecting, to hear anything back at all. I got a phone call from one bank and went through the interview process for the asset management internship program, 3 interview total; 1 behavioral 1 technical/current event 1 getting to know management (ie you have it in the bag). 

**Bolded because I cannot emphasize this enough -- without this internship I would never ever ever ever be in the position I am in now. I can comfortably place 100% of my relative success on this internship.**

I did very well during my internship, however, only 1 intern out of a class of 49 got an offer (this was summer of 2008). I learned for summer of 2009 they were going to make all internships unpaid except iBanking. 

Senior year I got my first taste of the buyside with my experience in a student managed endowment class. 10 sutdents about $13 million of capital and buy/hold/sell reports every half quarter on any equity (first semester). Same set up except on debt securities second semester. All around an incredible experience and actually gave me selling experience/research experience/valuation experience and a feel for what I would be doing in the real world. This course made it onto my resume because of how amazing it was. 

I did a 13 month mating dance with the bank I interned for, had about 15-18 interviews for 6 or 7 positions (going 2nd and 3rd round in a few).

Finally, I got a break in Miami. Worked for a year and got an offer from the group I worked with during my internship. Now you're caught up. 

**What I Do**

I basically oversee money from institutions/pension funds. We specialize in liquidity events and developing balanced portfolios while delivering alpha (yeah, that was lifted almost verbatim out of a pitchbook). 

My job:

Basically follow the news. Look at everything from geopolitical (we've been super busy with Egypt, our PBR trade has been awesome so far) to M&amp;A to earnings etc. Develop debt and equity strategy and then if we decide to put on a trade develop an effective strategy for buying either equity, debt, equity &amp; debt, or derivatives. Its a fun job and I get to work relatively sane hours (5.30a - 6.30/7p -- weekends if I want, not really req'd since markets aren't open). 

My daily routine:
This is basically what I did in Miami and what I imagine LA will be like.
4a - Swim for 30 minutes
5.30a - get into office -- read news, check futures, morning calls, emails etc
6.30a - watch how we open, check for news
6.40a - 1230p - debate ideas with MD, conf calls, talk to investors, put on trades (if we do anything that day), research, work on my own models and team models.
1p - watch the close
1.01p - pee for the first time all day since 6.30
1.05p - 4.30 work on models, conf calls
4.30 - 6.30 - meetings (if none day will end at 4.30)
7p - gym
9p - dinner

Salary;

I make less than 80k base and more than 50k base. Bonus will probably be based partly on performance and be part discretionary (i'm hoping around 20k -- pretty low actually). 

I know I'm probably missing a lot of stuff so ask away, I'll be replying for a few hours tonight and around the same time tomorrow.

I'm a high school senior that's about to graduate in May. I'm currently working for a local (and damn fine) new media firm as the only iOS developer. I started as a development intern over the summer and got hired for the school year on a part time basis.

My life plan had basically been to go to school for a comp sci degree and then get a job as a developer, as that's what I really enjoy doing. However, I've recently been having second thoughts on school in general and whether or not I even want to pursue a degree. This, coupled with the fact that I've recently received two separate offers for full time work (one with the firm I'm currently working for, one with a new startup that shows a lot of potential) as a developer straight out of high school, is making it very difficult for me to make a decision.

I've been discussing it with my parents, and they've been being very diplomatic about it by saying that I should do whatever will give me the most options in the long run. My friends that I've asked think that I should take one of the jobs that've been presented to me, as this sort of thing doesn't happen to most people in their lifetime, let alone before their high school graduation.

I don't really have a specific question, just a call for advice: what would you do in this situation? If you need anymore information, just ask. I'll give what I feel comfortable telling.

In the grand scheme of things, considering the LHC produces 15 petabytes of data a year, I analyzed ~3.3*10^-5 % of the data for the year.  Nevertheless, I am thoroughly proud of what I've accomplished. 

What have you done reddit??

**Edit:** Wow I'm really impressed with all these heart warming stories! Stay motivated Reddit, 2011 is looking like a good year:)

**Edit Two:** After being motivated by *BitterSweet8* and *orientis,* I told my manipulative ex-gf to stay out of my life, I worked hard to move on after our break up to create a new me and I don't want to fuck up what I have again. Thanks guys:)

* She frequently has to care for other intern's bounce-back patients, when that intern is allowed to go home early or take the day off 
* based on completely random assignment, she constantly gets patient loads that make her cap out (i.e. 7 patients at a time) while other interns only have 4 or 5.
* She has gotten a pretty rotten rotation schedule and she has not even had a vacation yet (outside of x-mas break). Her first vacation isn't for another month.

She is at her wits end and I'm extremely worried about her. Are there any doctors (or spouses) out there who have any ideas on what I can do to help her out, and maybe what she can do to help herself? 

I think that once she gets to her 2 week vacation, she can decompress. But now, every little thing sends her over the edge. She's had 2 black weekends (no days off) in a row, and she is just exhausted.

She loves what she does when she's not run down, and she really can't quit anyways (signed a 1yr minimum contract - and it's a BIG no no to break that). I'd like any advice, stories, etc. you may have to offer."

Here's the thing. The vast majority of my jobs up until 2010 were restaurant, food service jobs. As of August 2010, I work on campus in the computer labs, fixing printers and helping people with passwords, crap like that. Not terribly glamorous work, but probably a step higher than being a waitress/cashier. From May 2010 to September, I was volunteering for a Ph.D candidate in his lab, analyzing soil samples.

So. Should I just not mention the food service jobs on my resume since they're kind of...irrelevant and were mostly during high school? The only problem is that it would make it seem like I haven't held a job at all until last year, which isn't true. Is there a cut-off date? Should I omit jobs that were before a certain year? What to do?

Thank you for your help. (Edited for grammar.)"

I accepted a summer position with a prestigious USAO office. I accepted the position before grades came out and because they gave me a Feb 1st deadline. However, today I received an phone call to interview for a company/organization that I would LOVE to work for upon graduation. It's a very niche practice area and a very difficult to work for this company/organization full-time after graduation. I think getting my self out there now and meeting people there would be a huge leg up. Based on my experience, interviewing skills, and other factors I definitely think I can land this job after the interview. However, I already accepted the USAO position and it would be wrong to go back on my word especially if I want to leave the possibility open of working there in 5-8years. Also, the other job pays 3x as much as the USAO does for the summer. So what should I do?

a) Decline the interview. Ask the company if I can intern there during the fall/spring semester next year for credit.
b) Go for the interview so that I can meet the interviewer face-to-face and establish a good demeanor. Then later turn down the position and ask the company if I can intern there during the fall/spring semester next year.
c) Go to the interview and hopefully land the job and then decline the USAO offer even though I accepted it.

I really want this job at this other company/organization. It is essentially my dream to work for this company/organization after graduation or sometime in my life. My second dream job would be working for the USAO. Leaning toward choice B."

",BK8509A,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fj3we/my_girlfriend_moved_across_the_country_with_me/,"I met my girlfriend over Facebook, before undergraduate school.  She looked beautiful, had some great interests, so I messaged her.  Creepy right?  Well it worked.  We've been dating for four years and for three of those we've lived with each other.  We're a great pair; she's my best friend.

After I decided my major during undergraduate, I thought of transferring.  My alma mater was a great school, but not so great for the sciences.  I decided to stay, because I valued our relationship.  I ended up working my ass off to make the most of my degree.  I took classes at other schools, taught myself, and applied for countless internships.  I thought that these would all help me get into a better graduate school, despite my school's tiny reputation.  In the end, it worked.   I managed to get into an amazing school for what I want to do.

My girlfriend decided she would come with me.  It was a hard choice for her, which lead to a rocky bit in our relationship.  We both had never been to the midwest, and she had no job, friends, or family out here.  It was just us.  She planned on finding a job and taking a year off, after which she would enroll into a graduate school.

A few months ago she applied to a school of her choice.  Her test scores for the GRE were about 80% in both the english and math and she graduated just a few hundredths of a point short of honors.  Shes a supreme person with an unbelievable work ethic.  She visited the department and met the faculty.  I was almost 100% sure she would get in.  She was denied today.  She applied to one program.

What would you do Reddit?  I'm sure that this is going to put a lot of stress on the relationship.  Should she forget graduate school and try to find a job?  Right now she's working at a pizza shop and feels worthless. How can I help her?  Has anyone ever been in this situation before?"

I’ve been a very optimistic and generally happy person for most of my life.  Not that everything has always gone well for me, but I’ve been able to keep a positive attitude.  However, I feel that old self slipping away from me now.

I’m part of the first generation of my family attending college and the first girl to graduate from both undergrad and grad school.  I was top of my class in high school and went to a very prestigious college.  I just always assumed that if I did well in college that I would get a job upon graduating.  Clearly if I’m posting here, that was not the case.   I’m now six months out of graduate school and have yet to find a job.  I’ve gone on a few interviews none of which resulted in a job offer.  I just have this relentless, depressing feeling that I’ve done everything “right” and have failed miserably.

I’m starting to feel that I’m unemployable for some reason.  I’ve had internships and received enthusiastic praise from my supervisors.   I’ve always been a hard worker and gotten along great with colleagues and supervisors.  I’ve never been extraordinarily outgoing or a schmoozer.  

Everyone keeps telling me that the economy is bad and that everyone is struggling, but it just doesn’t make me feel better.  If anything it makes me feel like my job prospects are even slimmer.  I’m constantly trying to remind myself that a job does not define my life.  It’s just really hard.  I just had to contact my lender to put my loans on forbearance, which made me feel like absolute garbage.   

I’m not sure what I want to get out of this, but I wanted to post.  I hope this post doesn’t sound too whiny, but these are my honest thoughts.  It feels nice to get this written down.  I have trouble talking about this with friends and relatives IRL because I just feel like they don’t understand.  I thought if anyone would get it, it would be this lot.

TL;DR  I’m feeling like I will never get a job, and unemployment makes me feel worthless.  Don’t really know what I’m looking for out of this post.

I am an 18 year old male high school student from Germany, now in the last year of school. I will graduate in June. 

I love film, editing and everything remotely related to this, including photography, graphic design and so on. 
I did an internship at a graphic design agency a while ago and I really enjoyed my time there. I made a few little films and have actually been paid to film a short promotional clip for a party series in my homecity.

On the other hand, I love to ponder and debate about current events, politics, and, most importantly, philosophical questions. This may sound arrogant or nerdy, but I really like to think and use my brain. I think it's safe to say that I enjoy debate more than most of my friends, and frankly, I think I'm good at it :P

My problem is that I have a very hard time deciding what to do with those passions later in life. I thought about going to film school, which is hard to get on in the first place, but I'm afraid that while studying this would be great fun, the world of film might not be the young, creative, artsy world that I want it to be. I also wonder if there's a better way to keep exploring the world of philosophy, but studying philosophy is a bad idea for people who want to have any, or even an interesting profession, it seems. 

I hope my ""problems"" have become clear to you, and I would really appreciate any suggestions about what I should study, work as, do. 

Thank you very much in advance!

fiw3x,31,2011-02-10,"AMA So, you want to make video games.",DarrenEdwards,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fiw3x/ama_so_you_want_to_make_video_games/,"Before getting in games I had an ideal that art of the 20th century was photography or movies and the art of the 21st century was video games. I wanted to be part of that. I saw a golden age of possibilities as limitations fell and the technology grew. 

The reality of the business side burns people out.  A publisher takes the risk, but also gets the bulk of the reward.  A game is made by a couple dozen people, artist, programmers, designers and producers.  However, it takes several hundred people to get a game to market for distributing a physical disk.  For this reason most games never make it to publishing.  If it may not be profitable, it's cheaper to kill it during production than to get marketing involved.  Working on a game that never sees the light of day is a special kind of soul crushing.  

The publisher pays a development house.  The developer can be thought of as a games specialized employment agency.  The publisher's product is a finished game, the developer's product is man power.  The developer will charge by so many seats in each department and bid out for these seats.  Software and hardware are fixed costs, the variable is the cost of the employee.  For the developer to profit, it comes out of a livable wage of the employee.  If you have fantasies of being creative, you are just a cog in a machine.  A sign of a happy, well managed team has lots of Easter eggs, if it doesn't have side humor or hidden items you can bet the employees hated this project and management cracked the whip.

The developer is charging for your seat to be filled.  If the boss can fill it with an intern he will.  The rest of the employees now have to do their job, plus pick up the slack and get the intern up to speed.  This makes people form groups and hate each other.  As teams get split apart as one project needs help and another one completes, this makes for a rocky dynamic.  

I've seen kids reduced to full open sobbing from overwork.  While some are picked on, others outright steal other people's work.  I saw an entire afternoon wasted arguing if a werewolf would have a flat screen or an older monitor.  I saw a guy get so overworked by an argument he stabbed himself with a pencil.  I saw a guy quit with no notice and get into a shoving match because he wanted his last check before he left.  The worst I saw was a dating couple get fired because a drunk supervisor was turned away from the girl's apartment  at 2:00 a.m.  Firings happened for stupid reasons.  One guy was fired for sexual harassment on a day he was gone, over a girl he had never met.

Initially I saw a roommate, who lived on my couch and didn't work, get a job because he spent all day working on his portfolio.  He and another friend ended up working for a developer that had success elsewhere but had moved across the globe in order to run from an international lawsuit.  They took their best employees and padded their numbers with glorified interns.  I spent after hours there trying to learn 3d and eventually was able to pirate software and learn 3d myself at home.

I got my first gig working making an Age of Empires clone.  This was a small startup.  This was founded by a guy who had managed to only have mediocre gaming skills by the time he was in his mid 20's.  He also had a huge inheritance.  Once that got that he decided that putting a few programmers and artists in the same room a game would pop out and he would get richer.  Unfortunately he gave himself all the leadership responsibilities, and spend all day playing games.  After a year and a half, I left.  I heard he ended up blowing 6 million without ever accomplishing anything.

Next I worked for a developer that specialized in sports games.  I worked on about a dozen games( a zombie shooter, a couple of sports games, a WWII FPS, a Disney interactive, a real time strategy, and several other games that get killed half way to publishing.  The workload was stressful.  We were in dark rooms, not looking away from our screens, not going to the bathrooms too often, working 10 hours a day and sometimes weekends or overnight.  This place hired kids who still lived at home with their parents.  The pay and benefits were pretty bad.  They promised bonus checks, but those almost never happened.  It would take a year or more after a game was shipped before a check would come, if the employee had moved on in that time the company kept the check.  The turn over was pretty high.  After a series of bad decisions, they started firing for ridiculous reasons.  Eventually that had to do layoffs, just as the big project I worked on went into beta.  

With incredible turnover and so many young, antisocial employees the office politics at a game company is immature. While at the company, if someone doesn't have your back, you are fucked. It's more cliquish than high school. There is a pecking order for work and ideas. Those at the top feel no problem stealing credit from those at the bottom. The same goes with assigning blame for mistakes.  Sure that happens in all companies, here it was blatant.  Typically a career could be over quickly and many were eager to make a mark on one title.

I was once approached by a friend of a friend to help with a religious game.  Despite philosophical differences I said I would help.  That is, until I read the contract.  It was full of catches that restricted the employee, but no obligation to the employers.  The last line was,""as witnessed by our Lord, Jesus Christ.""  They tried to appeal to my greed, saying how much money I'd make when it was done.  This rubbed me the wrong way and I walked without signing, even though I had already provided some work for free.

The last place I worked in games was a Casino game company.  This place was made up of polar opposites, but with still serious communication problems.  The place was a bunch of sad old men with chemical dependency problems.  Some showed up drunk, or drank all day.  The main programmer had a 'fish bowl' office in the center where he chain smoked and a special air system sucked the smoke away.  The same core half dozen guys had gone through about 4 different companies in the area in 10 years.  They would run one place into the ground, split up, when one would get a job he would recommend his friends and they would run it into the ground.  Because they were part of a casino, they had lots of money to throw at problems.  I only worked there a few months.  

I don't know what it is about games work.  I don't know if it's the stressful environment or the people it attracts.  I am proud of the work I've done, but I don't think I'll ever go back.  I've moved on to interactive educational work and am much happier.  I've talked to a few redditors about the AI game developer degrees and they sound insanely bad.  $90 + 4 years of your for a degree in a field that often pays not near enough to cover student loan payments and will burn you out in a year or two.

Advice and critiques are encouraged.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Throughout my life, I’ve found that the most effective way to grow as a person is through learning:
learning about the world, learning about others, and learning about myself. 
Whether it be through teaching myself to play a new musical instrument, traveling to new places, or simply working hard in school, I have always looked for ways to keep learning new things. 
I view an internship with NIST as a powerful method for learning new skills that will be invaluable to me in years to come, both as a Physicist and as a person.

I am a Junior year Physics major at Lebanon Valley College, and am most interested in the Engineering Laboratory research position at NIST, but would also be very comfortable in the CNST research position as well.
I’m currently preparing to attend graduate school as an Engineer, and feel as though an internship in this field would provide excellent hands-on opportunities that I could not get elsewhere.

My backgrounds in both science and technology has prepared me well for either of these positions. I’ve taken a total of 5 years worth of physics courses (2 years in High School and 3 years in College), and have earned a major GPA of  3.49. I’ve also worked for two years at Lebanon Valley’s IT services help desk as an IT Technician, so I already have an experience base with computers off of which I hope to build even further. I am a hard worker, and am not afraid of a challenge, and I would definitely bring this attitude with me every day at NIST.

In short, I’d be very eager to use NIST both as a means of furthering my future career and simply as a way for me to grow and learn more about the world in which we live."

However, they have a very lax internet policy, so I am using this job as an opportunity to maximize my Reddit time.

To make a long story short, the amount of resources Reddit has exposed me to has unearthed a desire for learning that I never knew existed.

Currently, I am learning: Python, FL Studio, and basic psychology related to fallacies and the like. I have much more on my list of things to do (eg. learn to draw, economic theories, etc), but I'm trying to give myself ample time to become proficient at each one rather than do everything at once.

Sooo has Reddit given you anything or inspired you to do something?

My worry is that with non-programming background (bs biotechnology + applied to ms in biotech) and non-biostat/stat postgrad degree i wont get taken seriously for jobs involving sas no matter how decent i get at it. 
most masters programs in biotech make you do internships that seem to be involved in lab research or mangement roles and i'm not sure if i can work my way around to doing a internship focused solely on sas/biostats with the degree requirements. my supervisors have told me that i should focus on CDM (clinical data management) because it involves learning point and click databases like OC etc.. and SAS is heavy programming

The last month of school is devoted to a project of my choosing. I'd like to do some graphic design or some graphic design training, but I need to have an advisor with no relation to my school at all. 
If you:

**A**. Do work with graphic design and have the time and resources to take on an unpaid intern for 5 weeks,

**B**. Have some graphic design experience and the time to meet with a random high schooler for less than an hour a week for five weeks, or

**C**. Know someone that does,

do you think that you might be able to do a high schooler a massive favor and either help out or point me in the direction of someone or something that can?

Thanks in advance!!

**EDIT**: I really appreciate all of the help so far, guys!! A lot of you have been asking for some examples of stuff I've done. These are just a few of the things I've done for school... The way I see this working out, I would either intern somewhere, or I would create a moderate-scale skin for the desktop modification program, Rainmeter (Which I would do alone and bring to you once a week just for criticism and whatnot)

Also, people have been asking for examples of my work.
These are just a couple things I've done this year for my school, and I suppose the only large scale projects I've done this year... Aside from these, there are a lot of really small scale things I've done like vectors and whatnot, but that's really about it...

fif2e,17,2011-02-09,Anyone know where to look for entry level web design/development that is actually ~gasp~ entry level?,[deleted],bayarea,https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/fif2e/anyone_know_where_to_look_for_entry_level_web/,"I am finding that all of the ""entry level"" or ""junior"" positions in web design and/or development are requiring 3-5 years of experience and ""expertise"" in anywhere from 4 to 8 programming languages. Perhaps I'm the only one who finds it weird that ""entry level"" no longer actually MEANS entry level. :(

I've been spreading my resume around and not getting enough interest for two reasons: one, I'm making a career transition from psychology (I have a masters degree, which makes me ""overqualified"" for anything that might actually pay the bills right now *headdesk*) so my resume is full of recent psychology and social work experience. This is a turn off, I realize that. But two, I really AM ""entry level"" rather than 3-5 years of expertise experience. I mean, I HAVE more than 5 years of experience working on these things, but that experience is from the mid 90s which is out dated and then all of my recent skill acquisition has been part time after work.

I was given the opportunity to quit my job and have my bills get covered by my friend while I went to self-studying full time last November, but my friend has since been laid off and I only have a few hundred bucks left to my name... which will be gone very soon as I don't even have enough to cover my student loan payment next month.

I'm starting to panic.

I have a budding portfolio. I am also a sponge for information and I pick up new information SO quickly so even if I don't have ALL of the skills necessary, it would be a very short time (I'm even willing to study on my own time after work hours) before I'm up to speed. I have references that will demonstrate this feature of mine time and again. I would positively adore a paid internship or an entry level position that would expose me to all sorts of learning opportunities.

I'm currently in San Jose and am willing to move within the bay area, preferably the south bay but a girl's gotta eat. ;)

If anyone has any ideas for places that I may have missed looking, perhaps there is (yet another) subreddit that I have been unaware of that might point me in some good directions, maybe someone here knows someone who is looking for an intern or entry level worker, maybe you have a website you'd like me to work on? Any nudges in the right direction will be awesome and SO greatly appreciated. Thank you. :)

p.s. I will gladly share my portfolio and resume with anyone that has an actual job opportunity - feel free to PM me with details. My skills are currently centered on HTML, CSS, still learning PHP, and I'm using LAMP on my laptop at this time. I'm good with windows and familiar with mac as well.

**EDIT** For the few who were goodly enough to message me asking for my resume and such, PLEASE realize that I need you to send me some details of a job opportunity or something of relevance first. I am a female on the internet and I'm not going to send out my resume and portfolio, with all of my contact information and work history, to an otherwise random person on the internet. I TRULY appreciate your offers to help, and please keep them coming, but send me some credible information with your messages first. :)"

""Networking"" felt faked and forced. 

I feel like I wasted four years of my life learning things I could have picked up on my own. I feel like state school was a trap and a money sink. Big surprise, I'm a double major in Journalism and Strategic Communications and I feel fucking worthless. Also, 40K in the hole. I feel like I'd be in better shape with an associates degree or two for half the price. 

I feel like there was more I could have done while I was here (internships mostly). I keep hearing things like, ""If you work your ass off, everything will turn out ok."" Yeah, well, I do. I work a full-time job to support myself. I send money to my parents to help with house payments. I barely make rent, utilities, etc. as it is. It's kind of difficult to take an unpaid internship when you have to worry about money. Fuck the economy. Fuck the way this country works. Most of my professors worked part-time jobs and put themselves through school when they were my age. How is my generation supposed to get ahead? It seems to me you have to be born rich.

Please, someone tell me I'm just looking at things under a bad light. Maybe I have an over-developed sense of entitlement, maybe I'm just used to instant gratification, maybe my values are fucked up. Maybe all of the above.

To those of you who have gone through this, what did you do? Is there anything that helped guide you along the way? How did you stay motivated? I'm just looking for some help, maybe a little love and probably a kick in the ass."

I'm creating as a Valentine's Day present a recipe journal for my boyfriend/soon-to-be-fiancee. Cooking is a hobby and an interest we both share. We're both amateurs, but with extra income coming in while we both work as interns, we've been experimenting and creating our own list of loved recipes.

So I'm coming to you, fooditors, asking for your own family recipes. Give me your best. I want to add them into a special section of the journal, as reddit is another common love we have. My only requests are these:

* Keep them (relatively) simple. We live in an apartment and will for a while. We don't have a lot of fancy kitchen tools available, like KA mixers, bread machines, etc. If you have one that you absolutely MUST post, that will make our lives significantly better because of the awesomeness of your recipe, that requires a little more fancy cooking equipment, go ahead. Someday we'll have a house together and own those fancy cooking tools, so I'm not opposed to putting a few of these in there. 

* If you normally use your KA mixer/xxx crazy-expensive kitchen equipment but know we can do it with other tools/by hand, post away.

* Nothing too crazy and exotic, please. We can't afford gourmet ingredients, nor do we have access to anything very fancy in the way of groceries. Maybe down the road, but right now I'd like to keep it somewhat relevant. 

* If you post a link to a recipe but tweak anything, *please* put those tweaks in your comment. These are what makes those recipes so good.

I think that's all. Thanks Foodit!

P.S. I'll give you credit for your recipes no matter what. And please upvote...the more the merrier!"

**Story** Girlfriend of 9 years and soon to be wife is in her first year of law school and is having a tough time. She has confided that she sometimes has fantasies of leaving, but since she's done that for the last two careers, she feels like she needs to stick this one out.

**The Problem** She is freaking out about not securing an internship for the summer like a couple of her friends have. I advised her to seek help from career services at her school, but she's putting that off for some reason. It is making her depressed and today she skipped school to watch foreign movies. This is all nice and pretty and I might sound like a concerned, great guy but I have ulterior motives.

**Ulterior Motive** I want booty. I want her magnificent, beautiful and destructive booty (she sits on and breaks things). As most guys (should) know, when a lady is depressed that booty is on lockdown. Well, that's the case for her. This law school lockdown of the booty has gone on far too long and I wish to break it's vice-like hold.

**Where I Need Advice** Is there some sort of law directory for internships I can direct her towards? She said, ""Contracts are a lot of fun."" and I've no earthly idea what this means or what kind of internship would cater to this. I suggested weeks ago to ask reddit for advice, but methinks she's a little too proud. We live in the Philadelphia area and she has stated she would move for the summer internship, which is not good for my booty situation.

**TL;DR I'm a typical man who wants the booty but girlfriend is depressed about summer law-related internships. By helping the GF, I help myself with more booty. Ladies please don't hate.**

Also, please don't grammar-nazi me, I'm an illustrator. I wish there was some way to star this like the IAMA's to let people know I'm legit."

Disclaimer: I don't intend for this to come off as overly whiny, just legitimately looking for advice.

I'm 23 years old and have yet to figure out what I'm doing.  My parents constantly treated me like some golden child who would be a millionaire by 25 just because I performed *slightly* above average in school, whereas all my siblings were slackers and dropouts.

I moved across the country several years ago in hopes of being a career musician, whether that’s hit songs and international tours or just making enough in bars and clubs to pay the bills and survive.  I play five instruments, sing decently enough, and am a songwriter and classical composer.  I’m smart enough to know and accept, however, that being a career musician is probably one of the hardest jobs you can get.

So my backup plan was school.  Success!  I’ve got a Bachelor’s now, and have been relentlessly working on my music career the whole time.  Playing in bands, going to writer’s nights, completing two music biz internships, schmoozing anyone and everyone I meet (including a few real 'movers and shakers' in the industry). 

In the meantime, I’ve also been applying for “regular” jobs like crazy.  I’ve gone door-to-door, called everyone I know, and hit up internet job boards.  I’ve probably sent out 100 resumes over the last few months, and have only gotten two interviews.  Obviously neither worked out in my favor.  The jobs I’ve applied for have been anywhere from part-time minimum wage retail and fast food joints to salaried, white-collar jobs paying $50k or more with benefits and company cars.  

I’m not getting anywhere, and bills are piling up.  I know it’s tough for everyone these days, but I don’t feel I have any options left.  I’m educated, reliable, and work my ass off at whatever comes my way, but nobody seems to care.  

**tl;dr** - I’ve got a degree with a good skillset and drive, but nobody anywhere, *ever* wants to hire me.  Halp.  "
fk533,8,2011-02-12,"Hey r/canada, interested in helping a non-profit that gets it?",ImpliedOralConsent,canada,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/fk533/hey_rcanada_interested_in_helping_a_nonprofit/,"I volunteer with [Engineers Without Borders Canada](http://www.ewb.ca/), an NGO that works to build capacity in southern and western Africa, and also engages Canadians to help drive further change (I'm mainly involved in the latter). (Full disclosure: I also had a short-term paid internship with EWB a few years ago.)

I humbly submit that EWB is an organization that gets it. They don't do handouts; they work for sustainable change according to the needs of the community. They challenge the paradigms that sometimes exist in the development sector. They also do something that (to my knowledge) has been unheard of among NGOs until now: they embrace their failures, instead of trying to hide them from their donors. EWB publishes a [failure report](http://issuu.com/ewb-isf/docs/failurereport2011) every year to outline where they've gone wrong, and how they plan to learn from the experiences. They've also just launched a [website](http://www.admittingfailure.com/) to encourage other NGOs to do the same, sharing the experiences so they are not repeated.

Anyway, right now Wind Mobile is holding a [Charity Challenge](http://bestconversationever.ca/charitychallenge) where you can vote for a Canadian charity once a day, every day until March 7, and the winning group will get $50,000. EWB was leading for a while but has since fallen back to second. I don't know exactly what their plans for the money would be, but they are scaling up their overseas work, and $50,000 would be enough to cover two additional overseas staff for a year.

**If you agree that what Engineers Without Borders does is worthwhile, it'd be great if you could [vote for them](http://bestconversationever.ca/charitychallenge).** (This vote isn't on Reddit, so I'm assuming this request doesn't violate Reddiquette.) You do have to register (to prevent duplicates), but if you're not entering the main ""Best Conversation Ever"" contest, the contact info doesn't have to be, shall we say, accurate. ;) 

As well, if you're interested, EWB has set up a [tool](http://www.ewb.ca/daily/) to remind you to vote each day.

Thanks! :)

 I am a 32 y.o. childless female, he is a 38 y.o. male with a 10 y.o. son from his first marriage. For all intents and purposes, we have been together for a bit over 2 years. We are 19 months into a 3 year LDR, I had to leave for school, with plans to live together while I intern in his city this summer and then full-time after I graduate in 2012. We are not officially engaged, but our eventual marriage is a foregone conclusion.

I have spent most of my adult life vacillating on my position on children. As a child myself, I knew I wanted to be a wife and mommy when I grew up. I married young, and during the 16 months that that marriage lasted my then-husband and I unsuccessfully tried to start a family. I then got into a 7 1/2 year relationship with a man with grown children and a vasectomy. I did a lot of soul searching and eventually decided I would rather have the relationship with my then-boyfriend than the possibility of children. I even went through a phase of very vehemently not wanting children, as I enjoyed the freedom of my child-free lifestyle. At about 28 the biological clock started ticking though, and I told my then-boyfriend that if we were still together when I was 35 I was going to order some sperm popsicles and a turkey baster, and he could help raise the baby with me or not. Within a year or two though, the clock seemed to have broken.

So for the couple years since then (and for the entire time I have been with my boyfriend) I have been just without a desire one way or the other on the matter. I have known that if a pregnancy were to transpire I would be happy about it, though the timing right now would be quick frankly atrocious, but I have not actively wanted a baby enough to try for one or for it to be a deal-breaker in my relationship. I should note that as far as I am concerned, at this point I have a 10 y.o. son, and I love him dearly. But I did miss out on the first 8 years of his life.

My boyfriend has mentioned a vasectomy, so I infer from that that he is done, but we have never actually discussed having any more children. I've never brought it up because it's never really been an issue for me, I've figured if he decides he wants more children I'll be happy to go there, and if he decides he is done I'm okay with that too. Today though, I was on a forum where suddenly a LOT of women are announcing their pregnancies, and the idea of never having that myself did make me a little sad. I think I do want at least one more child more than I an admitting to myself. At the same time though, more children would only be icing on the cake, I am wholly happy and content with the little family that I have now. There is nothing in the world I would choose over them.

So all that being said, do I even bother discussing this with my boyfriend? And if I do bring this up, how do I make it clear that whatever decision we make is together? Because he always wants my happiness about all else, and I am concerned that if he knows that I would like to try for a baby he will say of course just to see the smile on my face. I am sure that he would love that child, but I don't want him to go there just for me. "

AMA. ,Bythebook,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fksgj/iama_fedup_employee_at_a_textbooks_store_for_a/,"**About me**: I'm a junior at a large state university. I've been a textbook employee for almost 3 years now and I can pretty much run the store if given the chance. I know it's about time to jet off and start looking for internships but right now this 25-hour a week job is paying my rent and being able to write that check each month is more important. 

I'm not really complaining about the quality of the job. As college jobs go, it's a pretty sweet (albeit low-paying) deal and my co-workers are, in general awesome. However, I feel like I'm making my living taking advantage of my fellow classmates and while that may not be directly my fault, my Catholic guilt sure makes it feel like it. 

**About my store**: Does about $5mil in total sales each year. This is including textbooks, general books, and school spirit wear. I don't have the numbers on strictly textbooks but it's a good portion of it. Compared to other schools I've visited, the store's pretty damn big. We're contracted out by the university and handle all of the professor's adoptions but we're not officially university employees. There are two major competitors near campus, one legitimate and one not so.  [I really hate saying ""my store"" and implying ownership of this hellhole but it's the best way I can think of.] 

*Issues I want to rant about (if anyone wants to listen).* 

* How the textbook industry is like the video game industry and why traditional textbook stores are screwed if people start to figure that out. 

* How student athletes are the most stuck up characters on campus. (Though I may be preaching to the choir here.) 

* Who's at fault for the rising cost of textbooks and what we can actually do to stem the tide. (Surprise: Co-ops aren't the way to go.) 

On a less serious note, I've got some funny stories to share about stuff we've found in books too. 

Then again, this is an AMA so, AMA! 


*Note: I'm typing this up at the library and heading home. It's about a 30 minute walk so I don't want to get into too much before having to pack up and leave. I'll starting ranting in earnest and answering questions when I get home.*

EDIT: Ok, I'm home and typing. I'm a terrible typist so it's going to take me a while (plus I'm counseling my partner who had a crappy weekend at the same time). Thanks for the awesome response so far! 

EDIT: Partner crisis averted. I'm back, sorry for the abandonment.

Graduate student with specific resume questions.,[deleted],resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/fks8k/first_post_ever_graduate_student_with_specific/,"First off, thanks for taking the time to look at my resume.  I'm trying to secure an internship in my area for the summer (I have only worked for school offices and I want some corporate experience).  Even though I'm fairly happy with this version of my resume, there are still some things I have questions about.

**Google Docs Link:** [My Resume](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0B2rmXu-3CXJ1YmM0NDFjY2ItODdjNS00NjQ5LTg2ODgtZTA4ZmQ1ZDQwYTdi&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CLmxzKoK)

1)  Would an objective (or summary) be needed on a resume for an internship?  I really don't have much room left on the document and would have to cut things out to include it.

2)  Does it look pompous putting the amount that my scholarship was for?  Is just the title of the scholarship more appropriate?

3)  My undergraduate cumulative GPA is low, so I listed my specific major GPAs (which are higher).  Is that acceptable?  Should I not list any undergraduate GPA at all, since I'm in graduate school now?

4)  I've seen many resumes that have a paragraph underneath each job describing the position.  I broke mine down into four bullet points each.  Any downsides to my approach?

5)  Is there a better way to list progression in the last job on my resume?  It seems like there's a whole bunch of dates there, but I don't want to squish all the positions I held on one line.

EDIT: 6)  I used indents throughout the document to line the content up (see the Education section for an example).  Is it distracting?

Any other comments about my resume are also really appreciated.

fl7dm,7,2011-02-14,Temporarily moving to San Francisco. Have a couple questions.,[deleted],sanfrancisco,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/fl7dm/temporarily_moving_to_san_francisco_have_a_couple/,"Hey! I'm going to be spending the summer in San Francisco (which I'm super excited about), and I have to move out there at the end of May, sight unseen. I've stayed there before, but I am not going to have time to appraise a bunch of apartments--I basically need to get out there and immediately get set up. I have a few questions that I thought maybe some locals could help me with.

Here is the situation:

1) I have an internship in the mission

2) I will be living on about $2000/mo

3) I have had a chain of bad experiences with roommates that I didn't know--nothing traumatic, but things that really spoiled my experiences. I've decided that, if it can be managed, I would much rather have a place to myself (or myself and friends) &amp; have to teetotal a bit than live in an apartment with a bunch of strangers &amp; have extra cash. I know this is idealistic, but I'm trying to work the numbers with that in mind.

4) My girlfriend and a good friend of ours are going to be in San Francisco--unfortunately, their budget is much more stringent than mine. If they can afford to live with me, they will; otherwise, they will be staying at the friend's parent's house in Oakland. I would love to be able to stay with them, and I think it would be a lot of fun (I've lived with each of them before, so I'm pretty confident it would all work out). They will probably be working in Oakland.

5) I will be turning 21 over the summer, but I don't need an immediately accessible night-life--I'm not a big bar/club guy, and being as how the two girls are younger, I am not going to go out bar-hopping without them very much.

6) I would gladly pay more money than the girls if it meant I got to live with them--if we found a 2br for 1600, I would have no compunctions about paying 1000 to their 600. The way I see it, I am fortunate enough to have some funds, I should share that with others, and it would still end up cheaper for me than paying to live alone. Also, it's only going to be 3 months, so there's no question of me saying ""OK, I'll pay 1000 for &lt;this long&gt; and then you guys have to start making up the difference""--I know exactly what I'm getting into w/r/t cost.

As I see it, here are my two basic options if I do manage to not get a place with strangers (and feel free to correct me):

A) Get a furnished studio (~1400 to 1600, if I'm very lucky) in the Mission, spend the rest of my money on food, live an ascetic life. See my girlfriend and our friend once in a while when I get up to Oakland or when they get down to the city.

B) Get a 2br in Temescal or someplace like it (I have found a few for 1600 or thereabouts). We would all be together, and the place would certainly be bigger than in the Mission, which would be great, but I would have to commute to the Mission.

So the explicit question is: how plausible is it to commute to the Mission from Oakland using BART? Maybe not every day a week, but pretty frequently. I pretty regularly did a ~50 minute commute when I was living in Paris, so I'm no stranger to treks on public transportation, but I have never experienced it in SF.

Also, any general advice would be much appreciated."
fl773,2,2011-02-14,I know I'm not the first one,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fl773/i_know_im_not_the_first_one/,"I met my best friend in October of 2002.  I started dating her in October of 2008.  Last Wednesday she broke up with me.

It isn't a ""I just fell out of love"" situation.  We don't hate each other, nobody made a mistake, but we are in a long distance relationship and we are young (I'm 22, almost 23 and she is 20, turning 21 in May).  There are somewhat mutual feelings that being in this relationship at this age, given the distance, there are certain burdens that we're creating for ourselves.  In feeling that the relationship comes first it is easy to miss other opportunities for growth.  

How can I leave her out if I want to travel abroad alone?  How can she take that summer internship she's been dying to get if it means we'll hardly be able to see each other?  How can we remain youthful and committed?

When we broke up on Wednesday I didn't know what to think.  I had passing feelings of anger, sorrow and fear.  I tried to be stoic, I tried thinking that I'd be fine.  I went as long as I could without saying anything to her, but last night I texted asking if we could speak and we ended up having a few hour long conversation online.

It was extremely lucid.  We were speaking to each other like we were bystanders to the relationship.  How we both felt like in the relationship we were giving up on other opportunities, but outside of it we were giving up on what seemed so natural.

I cried like a baby afterwards.  She told me that she loves me.  That makes it so much harder.

I want more than anything else to realize that this isn't real, for her to realize that this is a mistake.  I know we need space and time to feel better, but right now I feel so helpless.  How do I even begin to move on when I feel like we're making the biggest mistake of our lives?

And how do I pick up later?  How do I meet another girl and not think that, even though everything seems perfect, she won't just get up one day and say it's not working out?  How do I even find someone as good as her?

I'm really hung up on this, and I know things will get better - no matter what happens.  But this thought doesn't make it any easer right now."

* Are you part of or do you know of any large corporations looking for the same kind of person?

Some more general questions:

* For any of you working at a large corporation, how do you like it? is it as soul sucking as all my friends who did internships / co ops at places like GE, IBM, etc say it is?

* Robotics is a huge field, encompassing computer science, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, etc. I've done a lot of this type of work in my job, at school and in my spare time that can be thought of as 'robotics' in some sense.

----------------------------------------
Ok Reddit I really need a shoulder right now and I don't have anyone to talk to. I was born with OCD/Severe Anxiety. I have been battling the mental illness my entire life. At first I was completely obsessed about germs and I feared germs where everywhere. I used to wash my hands till they bled. 



----------------------------------------

Sometime after my Grandma passed away I became obsessed with death and dying. I couldn't stand the thought of dying and I would build myself up into hysterical fits. I couldn't even walk through the toy isles at the Toys'R'Us without breaking down and crying. The anxiety brought on by thinking about death and dying (mostly concerned about the pain of losing loved ones especially my mom and cat) is still a big struggle for me to this day.



----------------------------------------

Now fast forward to why I am posting this stuff on the intrawebz. When I was a little boy I watched the movie ""Top Gun"" more times than I could count. I love that movie, I know every single line. When I grew up all I wanted to be was a fighter pilot but unfortunately I have medical conditions that keep me from being able to join any branch of the military. 


----------------------------------------

After I realized that my dreams of becoming a Fighter Pilot were pretty much destroyed I moved on to enjoy law enforcement through my teens. One thing that I really liked about law enforcement was that there was a real chance that I might get killed on the job and in doing so I would not have to suffer through life knowing I am going to lose loved ones. 


----------------------------------------

Using this mentality I moved away to college with my buddies and had a great four years. I studied criminology and got a 3.26 GPA and graduated on the Dean's list of scholar's since I had a GPA of 4.0 my last two terms. 

----------------------------------------
During the end of my college experience I got to do an internship with a Law Enforcement Agency. I had a lot of fun doing this since It was basically just riding a long and assisting the officer. The only parts that sucked where when I was trapped at their office with nothing to do but play flash games for eight hours.


----------------------------------------

After I graduated I moved home with my parents and I tried right away to get into Federal Law Enforcement. I sent out over 100+ resumes and only heard back from one agency. This was a BIG name agency and I was really excited and scared. I made it all the way through to the polygraph section and then failed the test (polygraphed couldn't read chart) because I was all over the place (I fell asleep during the test as I stayed up all night worrying about the test the next day).

After I failed that test I drove home like a bat out of hell with tears streaming down my face. The entire process with that agency had taken months and I had pinned all my hopes and dreams with them.

----------------------------------------
Since that time back in May 2009 I have only held two other jobs that lasted no more than 3 months.

In Dec 2010 I worked with UPS as a seasonal helper (Terrible job don't do it unless you really need the money, UPS people are not happy people).

In May of 2010 I did loss prevention for a retail store. During my time doing loss prevention for the retail store I started to realize that I did not like going into confrontations unarmed. I also realized that I didn't want to interact with nasty people all day. The job was horribly boring I sat in a room with a monitor in front of me and watched until my eyes bled for a shop lifter. It was really really boring and at other times terrifying. 

----------------------------------------
After that job fell through I became deeply depressed and suicidal. I struggled with that up until today and I am hoping to start seeing a new psychologist soon. However as such I have become completely lost in life. I have no idea what I want to do for a career. I have taken every personality test there is under the sun and nothing really helps.

I am an INTJ personality type. Do you guys have any ideas? Math is not my strongest subject and I hated high school chemistry. I feel so lost in life that it aggravates symptoms of my other condition(s). 

I beg all of you for your help or advice. I am meeting with a career councilor tomorrow and I am praying they will be able to help. I just want my life back and a job I enjoy.

----------------------------------------
I am 1000x better I spend all day on my computer or on my Xbox. I know more about computers than anyone in my family and could easily learn scripting if needed I am just so lost in life I do not know which avenue is best suited for me.

----------------------------------------
TL;DR
INTJ personality type cannot find job. B.A. Degree is in Behavioral and Community Sciences. "
fkzt0,0,2011-02-14,"How to help ensure ""productive"" summers for university students",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fkzt0/how_to_help_ensure_productive_summers_for/,"I'm a third-year university student (studying mathematics and computer science), and like in the past, I'm spending this spring semester stressing about the coming summer and my future in general.

Basically, I've heard the key to summers is getting an internship during them.  And I've been having a ton of trouble in that area (and now I fear I'm way too late).  I hope I'm just doing something wrong that's easily fixable, but it's pretty disheartening when after career fairs or whatever, your friends all get interviews and some of them wind up with great internships, and I wind up with nothing.

In fact, I've never actually had a real interview before.  And I'm 21.  All the jobs I've had (organizing an extremely unorganized file cabinet at an engineering office to an easy-to-use electronic form in summer 2009 and my two jobs which are basically TA'ing) I have gotten without interviews.

The thing I'm most worried about I guess is way in the future.  I haven't really done any projects (part of being interested more in the theoretical parts of CS I guess) and it looks like I'm not going to have time to get involved in any right now--as part of trying to make myself better (can't find a better word than that) I kind of overloaded myself this semester and don't really have time for much else.  And I'm scared that when I'm older I won't be able to get anything because I never had anything when I was younger.  And I'd say some of the anxiety comes from still not knowing what I want to do--I do not particularly want to be a code monkey / software engineer, and my biggest interests outside my field are transportation (like civil engineering), linguistics, and modern east Asia (thanks to the awesome people I've met here at my university that are from there!  I actually went to Taiwan last summer and am studying Mandarin Chinese because of it) and of course my ultimate dream job would be simulating proposed changes in traffic networks either here or over there.

But I'm rambling now.. back to the main question:  if it's not too late now, what can I do to help ensure I have a productive summer and therefore have a better experience later on?  I've applied or are applying to a couple of things like REU's (research experiences for undergraduates) because I'm also kind of strongly considering going to graduate school, but there's still the chance that everything falls through and I spend the summer with a cloud over my head for 14 weeks.

I think I can take it as an opportunity to become more cultured and more well read.


My ideas so far:

* Take a few art history courses at a local community college and then make better use of the museums and galleries in my city

* Take advantage of the theater scene within my city

* Keep a consistent journal

* Volunteer at a local food pantry I've worked with off and on

Reading list: (i.e. the *great* books I somehow haven't read yet)

* Re-read Great Gatsby

* A good history on the Civil War, World War I, and World War II (suggestions?)

* 1984

* Clockwork Orange

* The Structure of Scientific Revolutions

Any additional activities you guys can think of along the same line?  Also, I would love any reading recommendations.  I'm much more into non-fiction than fiction, but always love a good novel.  I'm looking for books that really make you think, especially philosophy based.

I would like to get it out of the way, but I'm hearing a lot of conflicting opinions.

I covered roughly the first half of Math 53 near the end of the second semester of my AP Calc BC class last year, so I'm familiar with some of the material. I'm aware that it will be covered faster over the summer, but that's not as much of a concern for me as the instructors and the exams.

Lastly, is there a way to see which instructor you're signing up for when choosing summer classes? I think I have a basic idea of who's good and bad based on Ninjacourses reviews, but any input is gladly appreciated.

Long time reader first time poster here. I’ve got some situations I need advised on, and would appreciate some internet advice. A little about myself, I’m 50% of an IT department for a medium sized office of a large financial company. I obtained an associate degree in IT (regret) and am currently attending a big boy university for my CS degree, because I want to and got offered some pretty good scholarships.  I got myself into this job while working helpdesk at my first school. They took me on as an intern, then full time, and now make my own hours between classes (averaging 20). I have not had my pay raised above $8 an hour, despite having taken on every role imaginable. I also have not received my state mandated overtime each time I make it above 40 hours. This was all okay because I moderately enjoyed it. Around four months ago I got put in charge of a “paperless solution”, sparing the details this means that I, without help, am tasked with pulling staples out of files every hour of the day. While pulling staples, I am also tasked with responding to the whims and quarrels of anyone who makes more money than me (read: everyone). I’ve, obviously, become disinterested in my job.

I could even handle this because the other IT’er is a cool guy and we get along great, covering each other’s asses from upper management (who is always on our cases). Recently the company hired a new employee who is tasked with doing random things. I, being the young’in, can’t shake the feeling that this new employee is going to be taking over my job; I was asked to teach them each task that I would normally be taking care of…


Questions:

* 1)	Is this how a normal job is supposed to operate? Or am I  just being a baby about it?
                      
* 2)	I am broke because my pay sucks, suggestions? Is $8 average for someone in my position?

* 3)	Should I look for a new job? (I have some leads, and a way in with a major hospital in the area.)

* 4)	What are the possibilities of having a job similar to this while being occupied with classes in the morning?

* 5) WWYD? I’m open to most anything.


Ps: if it sounds like we could be friends or even coworkers and your city has the most superbowl rings, despite a heartbreaking loss recently, PM me!

So far I've been at the job one week and it's great although I have encountered a couple of things that are beyond the scope of my knowledge.

I guess my question for you techy redditors out there... how can I run the most efficient help desk possible? I have a Google form made up that faculty are filling out so I have a list of things to do. How do you deal with keeping users informed on the status of their tickets? What do you do about problems you can't solve?

I have a great job (at least the benefits are great) as a software engineer, but I can't shake the feeling that I just don't love it, but I can't think of what I'd actually like to do.  

I can't tell if it's the actual work of the job, or if it's the fact I am a young girl working with a bunch of older men that I can't possibly connect to.  There are also a few younger coworkers I'm friends with, but I literally don't know a single girl in my office (it's filled with older men and a few older women).  I also feel like because of how development is structured, most of my coworkers and I are just the minions of a few ""geniuses"" who literally tell us what to do, and most of them have been here for a decade or more so there is a lot of tribal knowledge and a huge learning curve.  I feel like my skills are going unused and that I'm actually getting worse at programming and forgetting things I learned in school, especially because there is more bug fixing (read, one line changes with extensive testing) than new development.  We also program primarily in Ada, which obviously isn't a hot skillset.  I yearn for a company with a less stuffy environment, that has more new work coming in and where I actually feel like I can be creative and actually ""own"" something.

I go through periods where I'm a little busy and it's not so bad, but sometimes I feel like I'm depressed, I don't feel like I'm good at my job and suffer from low self-esteem and lack of confidence in my abilities.  I am interested in web development (which is what led me to choose CS in the first place) and web applications, though I've only really worked in that area in an internship for a 7 month stint. When I even get time to browse job postings it seems like they all call for 5+ years of experience working in the area, so I wouldn't even know how to get that experience to even get an entry level job.   

I guess...does anyone have any advice about how I could even begin to build skillsets on my own to get out of my job and into web development?  Or has anyone ever felt this way?  I'm afraid of switching jobs just to find out that maybe programming is just not my cup of tea any more, but I also don't want to give up because I worry that it's just this specific job and environment that I don't thrive in."

I don't really like the attitude I get from the job posts they put forth either, like we should feel grateful they're telling us to solve their rat mazes for a shot at a job there.

The Reddit employees I've met seem really nice, but I don't think I'd ever work for Reddit.

Do any other programmers already into their career feel this way? (Students/aspiring interns need not respond, you guys are impressed by being able to pay your bills. ;)

Edits:

To clarify the architecture comment, much of what I've read about various technological decisions (sorry alexis, chris, et al) made by the founders and team at various stages of the company have made me cringe.

I try to be charitable when evaluating decisions and examining situations from the outside, but it's beyond my capacity to cover for the continual problems the site has had since launch. The arrogant, ""you should be excited to work for us"" attitude in the job posts just cements my feelings on the matter.

I don't think Reddit is going to find many experienced and valuable people (and I don't mean me here, I'm in the first leg of my career) willing to deal with a combination of arrogance, many bad legacy decisions, less compensation, and what would likely be startup-esque hours despite having been bought out **years** ago.

Reddit is not cutting edge. It is not well designed. It is not an excellent place to work for.

Humility and humor will impress me, not ""zomg you should be happy to waste your time on our puzzles"".

**Comments from colleagues of mine, some of them more experienced than myself:**

----------------------------------------
Ok Reddit I really need a shoulder right now and I don't have anyone to talk to. I was born with OCD/Severe Anxiety. I have been battling the mental illness my entire life. At first I was completely obsessed about germs and I feared germs where everywhere. I used to wash my hands till they bled. 



----------------------------------------

Sometime after my Grandma passed away I became obsessed with death and dying. I couldn't stand the thought of dying and I would build myself up into hysterical fits. I couldn't even walk through the toy isles at the Toys'R'Us without breaking down and crying. The anxiety brought on by thinking about death and dying (mostly concerned about the pain of losing loved ones especially my mom and cat) is still a big struggle for me to this day.



----------------------------------------

Now fast forward to why I am posting this stuff on the intrawebz. When I was a little boy I watched the movie ""Top Gun"" more times than I could count. I love that movie, I know every single line. When I grew up all I wanted to be was a fighter pilot but unfortunately I have medical conditions that keep me from being able to join any branch of the military. 


----------------------------------------

After I realized that my dreams of becoming a Fighter Pilot were pretty much destroyed I moved on to enjoy law enforcement through my teens. One thing that I really liked about law enforcement was that there was a real chance that I might get killed on the job and in doing so I would not have to suffer through life knowing I am going to lose loved ones. 


----------------------------------------

Using this mentality I moved away to college with my buddies and had a great four years. I studied criminology and got a 3.26 GPA and graduated on the Dean's list of scholar's since I had a GPA of 4.0 my last two terms. 

----------------------------------------
During the end of my college experience I got to do an internship with a Law Enforcement Agency. I had a lot of fun doing this since It was basically just riding a long and assisting the officer. The only parts that sucked where when I was trapped at their office with nothing to do but play flash games for eight hours.


----------------------------------------

After I graduated I moved home with my parents and I tried right away to get into Federal Law Enforcement. I sent out over 100+ resumes and only heard back from one agency. This was a BIG name agency and I was really excited and scared. I made it all the way through to the polygraph section and then failed the test (polygraphed couldn't read chart) because I was all over the place (I fell asleep during the test as I stayed up all night worrying about the test the next day).

After I failed that test I drove home like a bat out of hell with tears streaming down my face. The entire process with that agency had taken months and I had pinned all my hopes and dreams with them.

----------------------------------------
Since that time back in May 2009 I have only held two other jobs that lasted no more than 3 months.

In Dec 2010 I worked with UPS as a seasonal helper (Terrible job don't do it unless you really need the money, UPS people are not happy people).

In May of 2010 I did loss prevention for a retail store. During my time doing loss prevention for the retail store I started to realize that I did not like going into confrontations unarmed. I also realized that I didn't want to interact with nasty people all day. The job was horribly boring I sat in a room with a monitor in front of me and watched until my eyes bled for a shop lifter. It was really really boring and at other times terrifying. 

----------------------------------------
After that job fell through I became deeply depressed and suicidal. I struggled with that up until today and I am hoping to start seeing a new psychologist soon. However as such I have become completely lost in life. I have no idea what I want to do for a career. I have taken every personality test there is under the sun and nothing really helps.

I am an INTJ personality type. Do you guys have any ideas? Math is not my strongest subject and I hated high school chemistry. I feel so lost in life that it aggravates symptoms of my other condition(s). 

I beg all of you for your help or advice. I am meeting with a career councilor tomorrow and I am praying they will be able to help. I just want my life back and a job I enjoy.

----------------------------------------
I am 1000x better I spend all day on my computer or on my Xbox. I know more about computers than anyone in my family and could easily learn scripting if needed I am just so lost in life I do not know which avenue is best suited for me.

----------------------------------------
TL;DR
INTJ personality type cannot find job. B.A. Degree is in Behavioral and Community Sciences. "

Maybe you're no Facebook, but even Dropbox and all the little guys are getting out there. Y U NO MAKE BANK?

I understand that you fear the Hivemind, and rightly so. I understand not pulling a Digg, because that would suck. What I don't understand is, why must you fall into the other extreme? You put up ads, you throw money at hardware, and you're even starting to expand your manpower just a bit. And still, I break reddit at least 11 times a day. Reddit is slow as balls. It runs like a hobbyist proof of concept.

But, I reiterate, why? Why is reddit such a tiny operation that hardly seems to turn a profit? Why isn't reddit hiring hundreds of interns and even more full-time employees to churn code and manage datacentres around the world? Why is reddit more of an inside joke than a popular phenomenon? Is it because you're afraid of ""selling out"", even if it improves the experience? Or is it simply a deficiency in corporate vision?

I don't mean to bash anyone or the site, but I think this is food for thought. It seems absurd that one of an elite ""100 sites on the entire Internet"" is not a hub of major growth in the world."

So, for years before college, and all through college, everyone in the science and engineering industries were freaking out “There aren’t enough people going into science/engineering!” – “America needs more engineers, we won’t have enough” – “No one is going into Science/engineering. Will America fall behind technologically!?!?!1!!1?1!one”.  

Well. Guess what? I loved math, I loved science so I got my degree in Structural Engineering. I worked my ass off, studied, got an internship working 30+ hours a week. 18-22 credits a semester, I gave up so many things. And I did it! I graduated with my degree in Structural Engineering! I took the F.E. and passed! I was ready! … but guess what?   

That’s right. No jobs. Where did they go? No one could tell me. Were they coming back? “I don’t know” was the response. Well, wait, I was told for 8+ years these jobs were needed, in fact, it was a matter of national-fucking-security that I be some sort of scientist or engineer. And here I am, and there’s nothing! I have to work part time at fucking McDonalds and even then, I can’t afford my school loans. You tell me it’s because there’s just not enough money, no one is building, no one is investing. I call Bull Shit. I think people are hoarding money, and genuinely just don’t give two fucks about our economy or it’s direction.  

Now, I understand the economy sucks. But here’s the deal. It will come back, and when it does, you know what will happen? Your company is up shit creek with no paddle. Why? Because instead of INVESTING in younger engineers and training them, you sat on your stacks and whined that you were no longer making 40billion a year, only 10 billion. And that just wasn’t enough for the Jet AND the M3.   

So guess what. Fuck you. Fuck all of you and your stupid companies. I hope in the end, America becomes an intellectually and technologically bankrupt society for lack of caring and investing in those willing to sacrifice their time and money, for those that were willing to invest themselves into a part of society that clearly no one gives a fuck about.   

Have fun explaining to your grandchildren why there are no serviceable bridges left the country, and why there are no roads in the year 2030. **I’m out bitches!**  

**TL:DR** - Fuck every single last one of you.

I am planning to do my first AT hike starting late this may.  I have never been out on more then a weekend hike so bare with me on my gear selection.  I am planning on a 3+ week trip NOBO starting in PA and ending where-ever I end after the three week mark. I am tentatively leaving for Korea for a year to teach English, and I want to really get one last piece of the Americas before I leave.  

I am starting from scratch with all of my gear.  I have read numerous reviews/journals/guides for the ""correct gear"".  I value all of your opinions greatly and would like your thoughts on the Big Three, as well as some other items.

  **Sleeping Bag**:  Here is where I have the most trouble deciding. I was something light and compact.  I am willing to spend some money for it, but I am soooo strapped for cash. As an intern that only makes $50 a day and is living in Manhattan.  Most of this will be coming out of my tax return.  I like the idea of goose-down, but the water issue is concerning considering I am a novice.  I would like to aim for a 20 degree spec'd bag just because it will be more versatile when I tackle other trails. Are there brands I can always trust? What's a sensible option on temp rating? is the weight/size difference that dramatic between goose and synthetic?

  Has anyone here hiked in a kilt? I've never worn one, but damn they sound enticing.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036TSR5C/ref=ord_cart_shr?ie=UTF8&amp;m=A2WCLPIBW35OCX

fmac1,2,2011-02-15,Is this legal? Background Check shows 'Criminal Record' for a case that was dismissed before trial.,piko_riko,law,https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/fmac1/is_this_legal_background_check_shows_criminal/,"Hi Reddit,

A lady-friend of mine recently had a Criminal Background check performed on her.  The results are being used by her University to qualify her for specific clinical rotations (internships). Needless to say, she is distraught over what showed up on her report, but let me provide some history first.

This occurred in Michigan in 2009. She was cited for misdemeanor open intoxicant while riding in a vehicle. There was a bottle of vodka behind her seat that had a cap on it, but was not ""sealed"". The best part is the bottle was not hers, nor was she aware of its presence (one of her ""friends"" decided to claim it was hers). She did not admit guilt at any point during the stop, but she was still handed a citation and ordered to appear in court. 

Court day rolls around, she pleads not-guilty and asks for a court appointed lawyer. Her bond is set at $100, she pays and leaves. They have a final pre-trial, which her attorney and the prosecutor attempt to pressure her into a plea deal, but she refuses. A day later the case is dismissed before the actual trial or jury selection occurs. Rejoice! For a great injustice is about to be undone! Wrong.

Fast forward to now. She has a background investigation performed by this company, [Certified Background](http://www.certifiedbackground.com/). On the results, it shows 'Yes' for a 'Criminal Record' under the county where the incident occurred. At the bottom there is detailed information about the case including: case number; the charge (open intoxicant); and the verdict which shows **dismissed**.

My question(s) for you: How is this legal? Why would there be a public record available of this?

Being that an at-will employer can fire (not hire) you for nearly any reason. Wouldn't the fact that you were served a citation count against you?
  
**edit:** borkborkbork, pointed out that the record is technically accurate, and that I am confusing a public record with what is made available through consent. 

**edit2:** I'm wondering if there are any states with laws that prohibit this kind of a record (dismissed charge) from being available to anyone outside of law enforcement. Or, that if an employer would be prohibited in using this record as a means for disqualifying someone for employment.

Worker's Comp, a lawyer and a weak settlement 6 years later I still need surgery. I found out about an experimental surgery at University Hospitals and applied to be considered as a candidate since my settlement isn't enough to pay for the surgery I need. 

The consult lasted around 2.5 minutes. It involved 20 minutes of paperwork and supposedly I had to have an X-Ray on my shoulder. All of this cost me over $600 dollars in bills. I'm already paying in the thousands of debt for other various college costs, this on top of it feels like the house of cards is coming down.

I have no income because I am a student and nothing lined up yet after graduation in May (I have a seemingly uninterested internship). I wish I never went to this consult and I'm pretty much screwed because I have just enough to pay for my lease until it runs out.

So I am turning to you. I am an excellent typographer, and graphic designer. I work primarily in 2D print design, but I can do web stuff too (not programming, just designing). Name your project and your price to help me raise some funds to stop the madness. I'll set up a PayPal if that works.

",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fnbeh/should_i_stay_or_should_i_go/,"I am a university graduate who was out of work for around 9 months.

I am currently employed as a marketing assistant (SEO) though I do very little marketing. The majority of my work is answering the phone as operator. I don’t particularly like my job ,as in, find it intellectually stimulating enough. I don’t have enough work to do. Often I am disciplined by my manager for not doing work , though there is nothing to do. I have asked him on around 5 occasions for something to do; sometimes he says busy at this instant and will get back to me (which he doesn’t). He told me to ask colleagues so that I could help them. But as I am not familiar with what they do, they couldn't give me anything or they were up to date in their work. 

I have good ideas for the website but it’s as though my manager has no time for me. We used to have weekly meetings but he delays them because he has more important things to do. Indeed, sometimes the meetings are delayed by weeks. I resent the fact that I don’t have time in the weekdays to work on my own projects, such as video editing, programming and fitness. I am paid minimum wage ( it isn't about the money I have enough savings) and my contract is up for renewal at the end of March for another 3 months (i've been working here since October originally as part of the University's Internship programme). 

I am exploring other avenues for my future, for example I've applied to a few university courses and graduate jobs, I do part time courses at the local college (image editing, web design) and i'm in the process of being assessed to become a private tutor. With all that said, youth unemployment is at 20% now, particularly graduates doing rather badly in getting a job. Before, I felt like I didn't have the pre-requisite work experience to get a job but after having done a few internships and other jobs this is no longer the case.

Never was.",yetanotherthrowaway-,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/fn4nc/going_nowhere_with_this_not_worth_anyones_time/,"It's a defense mechanism. I just stop thinking about it. I just disaccociate myself with the situation that the other stakeholders see. I'm procrastinating in this stupor, perhaps distracting myself with single-serving feel-good actions. Read yc news. Check out hackaday. The daily web comics. /r/depression, /r/sw. Just don't think about the final internship that you were supposed to start last week. Your mother had to fly in from the other end of the continent to babysit you a month ago. You were thrashing around looking for an exit out of that unstable emotional state. The short sting with antidepressants could be the reason. Most likely the external pressures. A bad trip on mushrooms actually stabilized you. Or was it the fact that you called your mother during that bad trip and it was the last straw that convinced her, and you, that you needed help. And you couldn't ask for it for so long. Well, helped for a week. She did nudge you to submit two applications and finish some schoolwork. You gave yourself a short break after she left. Of course that meant you were back in the vicious cycle. Didn't do shit for the next two-three weeks. Got rejected by both places - aiming too high, most likely. Or is that just the self-hate talking. It was finally yesterday that you managed to not be anxious enough. You managed to fool yourself that you can do it, that you can ignore anxieties and focus on the task emotionlessly. Recruited the help of a housemate to watch over you and submitted two more applications.

Well, had a chat with my mother. Have completely disconnected with my father and sister. Thank god they haven't called recently. I am way behind. I will fail my education or at least cause a lot more suffering to my father, who's supporting it. I never wanted any of this. I like the education, I like the place. No, scratch that. Netherlands. Tolerant. You can get along with only English. Yeah, right. Try that when you're still dealing with leftover social anxiety, wildly swinging self-esteem. You're cutting yourself off from 90% of the thing that you so desperately need. Mental help? Yeah, right. Group therapy? Hah. Friends with similar interests. You've got to be kidding me.

I've successfully alienated what little friends I had. I'm pretending to be OK in front of the housemates. That's a good thing. Forces me to be relatively balanced. The Xanax and unnamed-herbal-anti-anxiety pills appear to be kicking in. If they force me more, I panick and paralyze more. If they don't do anything, I avoid doing the complicated stuff - applying, being proactive. Stuff that doesn't have a well-established protocol. I'm not able to do any of that in my current state. Mindless work, yes. Going to points A, B, C. Shopping. Doing programming exercises. Buying more shit. But writing a goddamn cover letter? Not a chance.

Oh fuck this, I don't even have the drive to finish this

[EDIT]

Who am I kidding. As soon as I close the page, the anxiety starts again. At least now I'm busy doing something. This is my method of escaping anxiety. As soon as I stop, all the worries rush in. All the panic lights. You have to do something about this, that. Something. You don't know what that something is. You can't break the seemingly impossible, complex and delicate task into smaller pieces. Into a list of next actions. You can. But you can't make yourself do the first ""next action"". Because you will be given consternations, people will be disappointed with you, people will tell you how it's not possible to do anything about it. You will feel bad for complaining and begging, for using whatever ""mental situation"" bullshit excuses to get pity and compassion from school figures. Or parental figures. There's no way out. Or at least a non-painful way out.

So far the suicidal thoughts haven't come back. You know you're too much of an emo faggot pussy to act on them, of course. They are just a semi-conscious mechanism for making the situation easier for you. For forcing other people tho cut you even more slack. But that's the tragedy of it. You don't want slack. The more slack you get, the more you keep on procrastinating. You can't do this alone. You need help. Even as simple as someone sitting there right next and acting as a sounding board. But you need support. Someone who can guide you along the way, can explain the protocol, can correct you when you're being too unprofessional, or oh the other end of the spectrum, too inhuman. But you don't think you're worth enough to have someone waste their time on you. Because there's always been a way for you to do it by yourself. That means that if you ask for someone's help, you're just being lazy and wasting their time. You don't deserve help. When you've asked for help, you remember getting some initial pointers and the ""you can do it by yourself, it's easy"" line. The ""I have more important things to do, I'm not going to hold your hand"" argument. I am doing a bad thing by asking for help. I am a bad person if I do. And I'm too much of a stubborn lazy bad child, because I stubbornly refuse to do it by myself. I don't do anything. I procrastinate.

Well, here I am. Feeling worthless. No, hating the fact that I've been made to feel worthless. Hating all those authority figures that never taught me coping skills. Hating how I'm not allowed to ask for that now. My throat's tightening. Crying has become something normal, despite me being a 22 year old guy. Despite leaving those emo nu-metal days behind at least 6 years ago. Despite assuming the popular condescending look on the topic. It is better to condemn people for being unable to deal with trivial issues, instead of teaching them (with understanding, without impatience and annoyance) how to handle them. No, wait, yeah, now the pills are taking effect. Feelings are muted. Ah, that familiar feeling of emptiness and lack of anxiety. My best guess is I'm going to waste the entire day doing nothing, or perhaps wallowing in self-pity.

[...]

It's fascinating. A housemate having problems finding and setting up a game gave me the opportunity to feel useful. That single thing boosted my disposition to above-neutral. Hell, after grabbing a morning shower I may even try to send out a couple of more applications (but we'll see how the mood swings will treat me).

Over and out.

They finally see online radio as a threat...

Here's my story: I grew up listening to radio (mid to late 90s) that I thought was fun and interesting. The local FM jocks having a lot of fun, not giving a shit, being live, getting in to trouble, playing cool music and **MAKING A LIVING**.

I thought to myself...*I can do this...I can do all of that and BE entertaining*. That's the key, of course...**be entertaining**. 

I was young...very young. No radio station would even consider having me intern, or else I would have. Being 16-years-old I wasn't exactly internship material. No pesky college credits.

I stumbled upon online radio and the ability to create my own channel that played what I wanted and that I could be DJ on. This was about 1998...very revolutionary for its time. Very impossible to explain to people how to listen / get them to. 

People trying to listen might say, ""Radio on the computer? Music? Why don't I just listen to my CDs?"" Etc.. 

Anyways, being young and interested in radio, I created an online radio station and played all sorts of rock and alternative music I knew should have been popular, and I mixed it with stuff that was. I invested a TON of money into it. Surprisingly and disappointingly, that station eventually crashed and burned. 

What lasts from that station is a radio show that I still host with high school friends. We're now in our mid-twenties, and the show we started long ago airs on a one of the top online radio stations. 

We still do our show for free as a hobby. Some podcasters have taken some of the online radio glory in the more recent years, but I feel we helped pioneer a new way of broadcasting. Big names like Adam Corolla would have laughed at broadcasting online when we started doing it. And many did when we asked for help. 

Today, for a day job...I work for a major radio company that's trying to stay afloat while online radio, and all the other choices people have, steal their audience. These big radio companies (including where I work) aren't what they used to be...skeleton staffing, little to no local DJs.

In a way, I feel I cannibalized my own career, but on the other hand, I feel like I was on the cutting edge. Anyway you cut it, I'd be making more money working at Wendy's. Literally. I still do what I do for the passion of it. 

If you have any questions about my story, radio, online radio, etc..ask away.



**TL;DR** I was one of the first people to do online radio, now I work for corporate FM radio.

edit; tl;dr- i graduated. dont know where to start with jobs. new to reddit aside from my trolling. be kind :("

I'm in a bad way, and I need some advice. I've been unemployed for nearing three years now, partly due to bad luck and family obligations, but also in large part due to my own screw-ups. If you'd be willing to read how I got to this point, and give me advice on how best to get out of this situation, I would be ever-grateful. Okay...

It's December 2007. I'm ending my third semester of graduate studies at Iowa State, studying Rhetoric and Professional Communication. I went into grad school right after finishing my undergrad, also at Iowa State, in Technical Communication Though only a TA, I am also teaching, on my own, two sections of Freshman composition, and have about 40 students. I am also working a second job, 10 hours a week, for an on-campus engineering organization as a ""Communication Specialist"" to make ends meet. I also am planning on doing a ""creative component"" in lieu of a thesis, relating to the Iowa caucus. Due to me biting off more than I can chew, and procrastination due to my already full schedule, the creative component winds up blowing up in my face.

I drift into a deep funk due to this, and after winter break, I can barely get myself to go to classes and do my teaching. I stop going to my ""communications specialist"" job, and then am to ashamed of myself to contact them saying I quit. As far as they know, I've fallen off the face of the earth. To this day I still feel bad about how I handled it, as I probably should. When suicidal thoughts start to enter my head, I get some counseling. I finish out the semester and, my TAing elegibility run out, become unemployed. I decide to take a couple months or so to rest and recuperate before looking for a job as a web designer/developer. About September 2008 I realize that while I've got the ""theoretical"" skills for my hopeful profession, I'm lacking a great grasp of the technical skills, such as javascript and even anything beyond basic HTML/CSS. I start working on improving this, but still find no job.

It's February 2009, and my mom (who's disabled) develops a severe case of pancreatitis which, with complications, almost kills here several times. She's in hospital about a month. I move home to help out, both with her, and with my brother and sister, then ages 10 and 12, who both have fairly severe Asperger's. Helping take care of the family puts my job hunt on hold for a while, and I spend time working 'round the house, and working on my web design skills. My car develops trouble and my dad, ever the handyman, says that he and I will work on it, instead of taking it to a mechanic. First, however, we work on building a wood shed, that is done about the time the first snows of winter come, making working on the car impossible until about March of 2010. Being wheel-less, I dial back the job hunt, thinking (in retrospect, rationalizing would be a more accurate description) that I can't commit to a job when I don't know if I'll be able to get to it. I do, however, try my hand at a bit of freelancing, and design precisely one website.

Once the car is working, I begin looking again, and get a couple interviews, but never hear back. In September, my Dad has a heart attack. We've been working on fixing up our house during the summer, and I find myself having to finish replacing a floor and a toilet on my own, with dad now just walking me through it, before Winter sets in. I also find myself helping take care of my dad for a while.

I now find myself looking for jobs, but not hearing back. I know that this long stretch of unemployment is hurting my job search, but I'm not sure what to do about it. I have a few letters of recommendation, from a professor and from a supervisor at an internship, but feel odd about listing them, as it's been years since I worked with those people. My dad was laid off a while back, and while his unemployment is keeping the family afloat, I know I'm a drain on my family's tight resources, and it's eating me up inside.

I know I've screwed myself, I'm just having a hard time figuring out how best to get past it. Any advice you can give me would be a godsend, but even if you just read through it, thank you for caring that much.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask them."

I received a call and an email from an apple recruiter giving me the opportunity to interview locally (San Francisco Area) for the iPhone / iPad design team.  I'm not really interested in relocating, but I didn't want to miss this opportunity.

I met with one of the Design Engineers working on Apple's products, and he looks through my resume, and asks me a basic question about material properties relating to one of my previous design internships.  He basically asks me what properties of steel would be most important when selecting a material for a flexible application.  For the life of me, I couldn't spit out yield point, yield strength, or stress/strain curves properties.  I just said that I couldn't recall what the terms for the properties were, since it has been a while since I worked with that information.

Afterwards, he kind of just put down my resume and let me ask him some questions.  He was a really great guy and was really informative about the design side of their new products, but the entire time I couldn't help but try and recall the answer to his previous question.

At one point, the answer popped into my head, but it was too late to try and re-answer. I even told him that not recalling the answer was eating me, but I wasn't going to try and throw terms out there and hope that one sticked.

I am currently employed as a marketing assistant (SEO) though I do very little marketing. The majority of my work is answering the phone as operator. I don’t particularly like my job ,as in, find it intellectually stimulating enough. I don’t have enough work to do. Often I am disciplined by my manager for not doing work , though there is nothing to do. I have asked him on around 5 occasions for something to do; sometimes he says busy at this instant and will get back to me (which he doesn’t). He told me to ask colleagues so that I could help them. But as I am not familiar with what they do, they couldn't give me anything or they were up to date in their work.

I have good ideas for the website but it’s as though my manager has no time for me. We used to have weekly meetings but he delays them because he has more important things to do. Indeed, sometimes the meetings are delayed by weeks. I resent the fact that I don’t have time in the weekdays to work on my own projects, such as video editing, programming and fitness. I am paid minimum wage ( it isn't about the money I have enough savings) and my contract is up for renewal at the end of March for another 3 months (i've been working here since October originally as part of the University's Internship programme).

I am exploring other avenues for my future, for example I've applied to a few university courses and graduate jobs, I do part time courses at the local college (image editing, web design) and i'm in the process of being assessed to become a private tutor. With all that said, youth unemployment is at 20% now, particularly graduates doing rather badly in getting a job. Before, I felt like I didn't have the pre-requisite work experience to get a job but after having done a few internships and other jobs this is no longer the case.

fonb7,16,2011-02-19,Question about physics graduate studies,WelcomeToRapture,Physics,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/fonb7/question_about_physics_graduate_studies/,"Greetings everyone, hopefully it's fine to ask such a question here. I'd like to apologize about my bad english also; I'm from Quebec and french is my main language.

I'm 24 years old and recently went back to school after getting a technical education. You should know that the Quebec school system is different than most countries: We finish high school at 16-17 years old, and we have access to a school called Cegep. In Cegep you can study for a bunch of 3 years technical courses (engineering technologies, a program to become nurses in our hospitals, etc.) and you also get 2 years programs called ""pre-universitary programs"". One branch is the science one, and the other one is the humanity science one (sorry if these aren't the correct words, I'm not sure how to translate properly). I said I recently went back to school, and I started this 2 years science program from scratch, where I studied chemistry up to organic chemistry, 2 biology courses, Calculus I, II and III, physics I, II and III (classical mechanics, E&amp;M, waves and modern physics). 

The reason I went back to school is because I love mathematics and physics, and I felt like my life was missing something. I didn't want to work for 35 years in a brainless job, I felt like I *had* to do something mentally-challenging or I'd get bored. So far I've loved every math and physics course I've taken, and I do well in them despite being older. Actually, only the very beginning was harder; it's hard to jump into derivatives when you don't remember what sin/cos/tan are!) now I feel like my maturity gives me a drive that other students simply don't have. Everyday I feel lucky to be able to pursue my education.

I'm about to apply for university and I'm currently debating between electrical engineering and physics. Unfortunately, being older, it's hard for me to apply to physics since I feel like it might be harder to secure a related job. I'd like to get up to a master's degree in either physics or electrical engineering, and I might keep going for a PhD after that but since i'll be close to 30 by then, I might want to settle down and start a family, etc. 

1) Would a MSc in physics be enough to land me a challenging job in industry?? Also, is it true grad school in science pretty much pay for itself?? I was told I could get a PhD in physics with 0$ debt, but if I was to do the same thing in engineering I'd actually have lots of debts, is there any truth to that??

2) I don't know if you guys are familiar with electrical engineering, but are the more theory/math heavy areas of EE at the graduate level kind of related to the more applied areas of physics??

3) I don't know if this changes anything, but the EE program here is a co-op program with 5 internships (4 if I choose to keep going for my master's degree), and the physics program has 2. However I'm going to assume that the physics internships are mostly for lab positions. Assuming I get a master degree in either field at 30 years old, would I be too ""old"" by then to be considered employable in industry?? The 2/2.5 years of industry work experience given by the co-op engineering program might be something to consider, if so. 


I know my true love is physics, but I don't want to sacrifice my family life forever for choosing to pursue that path. If I was 19 years old as I ""should"" be right now, it would be easier for me to study physics without afterthoughts such as ""what will I do with this degree once I graduate?""

Thanks in advance, and sorry about the poorly written wall of text!

I found an organization that I really want to work for, but I understand that with my limited work experience I am not qualified for much, so I applied to be an unpaid intern. However, the position had already been filled.

Now there are two more entry-level job openings available at this organization, an assistant and a box-office worker, that I think I would be good at.

What do you think I should do, Reddit? Things to take into consideration:

1. I was not unqualified for the intern job, it was just already filled.

2. Since I first applied to the unpaid job, hopefully they'll understand I just really want to work with them?

3. Both of these positions actually have less duties than the internship would have.

4. If I do apply, how do I go about the cover letter? I've found examples saying it's okay to mention you already applied to a job, thus proving your interest and persistence. But I've also found examples that apply to two jobs at the same time. Should I somehow meld these two ideas? Also: these two jobs applications will be viewed by the same HR person, but not the same person who saw the internship application.

Any advice or opinions or experiences are helpful, thank you.

fob8y,4,2011-02-18,Junior Finance Major - Manage University's Investment Fund or Intern At Boutique Firm For The Summer,[deleted],finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/fob8y/junior_finance_major_manage_universitys/,"As you can see, I'm in a dilemma.

I go to a completely random state school, not even a semi target, but I do live in a decent sized city.

I've yet to hear anything back from cold emails, so starting next week I'm going to start cold calling every firm in town. If there ends up being an opening, should I take the offer or just take a few summer classes and manage my university's investment fund? It's only a $250,000 fund, but I really would like to do it this summer so I can run for president in the Fall and Spring.

Obviously, I'd like to intern and manage the fund at the same time , but I'm not sure if the boutiques would be cool with my availability. The fund will keep me occupied from 2-4pm on tuesdays and thursdays.

Another question, would offering to intern for free be a plus or seen as being annoying/persistent? I understand firms don't want to go through paperwork trouble, so I'd be willing to come in and work 20 hours a week for free just on a gentlemens agreement, as long as I can add that experience on the resume. That might come off a little sketchy to them

Worst case scenario, I manage the fund and intern at some non profit organization"

EDIT: And before anyone asks, I go to a small state school in Pennsylvania. That's as specific as I'll be.

EDIT: Some more basic info...

I developed an initial liking for Microsoft in middle school when defending them against the Apple fanboy/hipster hybrids. As my education advanced, I developed an interest in technology, and after familiarizing myself with some products, developed a strong liking for those developed by Microsoft. Ever since, I've tried to become an early adopted with each of their products to display my loyalty.

I recently applied for a corporate internship with heir finance department, but do not expect to hear back from them anytime soon.

I was an IT Intern for an electrical contracting company for about 8 months before being laid off after they closed some major contracts.

So they put me on software analysis. First Microsoft Infopath, then a few others, and eventually they had me try out SharePoint. They wanted to use it for the company, so they set up a mock server, and I messed around in that. Once I had a good handle on that, I made some applications using VB.NET to expedite some command line functions for importing templates and other miscellaneous tasks for SharePoint.

I’ll be finishing up my 3rd year of engineering within a couple of months, and I think I’ve gained enough experience as an engineering student to share some of the observations I’ve made over the last 3 years with others. Similar to many redditors, my major is electrical and computer engineering, and I’m doing this through the Engineering Science program at the University of Toronto, which has a fairly large engineering faculty (~1000 students per year in undergrad) from which I have learned a lot over the last few years. So, let’s cut to the list:


**A lot of engineering students don’t really want to be engineering students**

This observation became clear during a 2nd year robot design course. I like to think that I have a fairly intrinsic interest in the courses that I take, especially the most recent ones as they are more specialized and geared towards my ECE major. My team and I took great pride in our robot – there was fabrication, circuitry, and microcontroller programming involved and it was a fairly time-consuming project (the course *was* the project). Towards the end of the course as groups neared their robots’ completion, a “don’t-care” attitude became immediately evident with many of the robots made by my peers. The same students who would get 90s on their calculus and physics exams would be the ones with dysfunctional robots made of cardboard and Popsicle sticks – it also looked like they came from a place where you must be drunk to use a ruler, or you weren’t allowed to use one at all. Some of the students behind these engineering disappointments were actually good friends of mine, and I grew to learn that a handful of them had previously tried switching out of engineering altogether. However, because their courses were so radically different from those in other faculties, they would have had to start their degrees all over again, which would waste both time and tuition money. Unfortunately, I’ll be soon heading into 4th year with a handful of students who really hate what they are doing in school.


**Grades shouldn't matter – but they do**

For those of you who know about Engineering Science at UToronto, you’ll know that it is quite likely among the most difficult engineering programs in North America. The average 1st year student in my year had a 94% average in high school. After 1st year, one-third of the class dropped into other engineering programs. I graduated with the highest average (high 90-something) in my high school, and in first year I dropped into the mid-to-high 70s, which I have maintained throughout. I recently learned that one of my friends in another (less difficult) engineering program at UToronto had an 81% average last semester, and was ranked 7th in his entire program (rankings are based purely on % average). My roommate on the other hand (who is also in Engineering Science), also had an 81% average, and was ranked 58th in our program. I know for a fact that my roommate worked 10x as hard my other friend, and wrote exams that were much more difficult (in a program where 58 people have an 81%+ average, the exams need to be tough to prevent the prof’s from having 90% averages in their courses)

Now, (if you’re not already in this position) imagine that you are heading up an engineering team that needs to design and build some robot of sort and you need some interns. On paper, you would probably hire the students with 90%+ averages over the students with 60% averages, right? Well, as I mentioned in the previous section, many of the horrendous robots in my design course were built by students who are at the top of the class – the robot that got the highest mark was designed by a couple of friends of mine who have 60-something averages. You would probably flinch if an intern you were considering failed half of their courses, but as I’ve learned from this experience, don’t disregard the candidates with satisfactory grades – you never know what they’re capable of. Who knows what McKinsey would be like today if they stopped having a 3.9GPA cutoff for their applicants?


**“Engineers only study and never have any fun”…False.**

I definitely had this fear when I started studying engineering. After about 3 months, I realized how engineering, in many ways, is easier than programs in faculties such as arts and science. If you are in engineering because you actually enjoy it and want to learn about it, chances are that once you learn the concepts that need to be learned, you won’t even need to study much more! When I see the hordes of science and arts majors leaning over their small print “readings” at the library, I have a lot of respect for them. I personally don’t have the patience to read things that I may not necessarily be interested in, and then moreover to memorize them! In engineering, if I know the concepts that are required, chances are I’ll be fine. Even if I don’t study for an exam, I’ll probably be able to pull through having a vague idea of the concepts. On the other hand, if you don’t study for a Greek mythology exam, you may as well not even write it. Despite the long class hours, and arduous labs, I still find time to have fun in engineering, and as long as I’m on top of content of my courses, I have nothing to worry about.


**Don’t blame your school for your lack of success**

UToronto’s a great school. Its research in engineering is world renowned, and although it’s not quite on the level of say, MIT or Stanford, it’s made a pretty damn good name for itself. The definition of success in engineering can mean many things. To some it may mean getting jobs at big companies like Google and Apple, to others it may be getting into a good Masters program and ultimately a PhD, or even using engineering as a basis for another career direction (I’ve seen engineers pursue photography full-time after their degrees). Either way, success means you’re doing *something* with your education, even if it isn’t related to your major. I’ve met a fair share of students at my school who are doing absolutely nothing with their education – they still work at Wal-Mart in the summers, and have no drive to pursue anything bigger and better. I’ve also met many students from smaller universities with no reputation for engineering, who are doing ambitious things with their life because they have the drive to do so. This sounds like something a guidance counselor would say, but you get out of your future and career what you put into it. If you go to Harvard with no ambition or motivation, you’re probably not going to be very successful in anything you do, despite being a Harvard grad. If you’re an ambitious, go-getter who needs to go to DeVry to better your education, you’ll probably go further than the Harvard guy (well… that’s a bit much, but you get what I’m trying to say).

If you've read this far, thank you! I have more points to add to this list, but at that point TL;DR would become an understatement. "

AMA,TheBryanMeehan,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fov47/iama_younger_sibling_to_someone_with_susac/,"My older brother was 23 when we noticed something wasn't right. It was his daughters first birthday, and he spent the day, as well as the two leading up to it, in bed sleeping. He had a history of drug use, but nothing TOO major (weed, pills) Anyway, he was slightly unresponsive so we took him to get checked out in the hospital. After being misdiagnosed several times (first MS, then ADEM) his mind started deteriorating in front of us. This was at the time of the Summer Olympics. He was convinced he was at the Beach Volleyball competition due to his hospital room having a view of the beach. He also thought that he was fighting in a major UFC event, even asking me if his fight had made it to the front page of the newspaper. He was transferred to Jefferson in Philadelphia where an intern actually came forward with the idea that it could be Susac Syndrome, but it was a long shot. It turns out, she was right.

Don't want to make this post too long, as I would like to answer any questions I can. Feel free to ask anything.

fout9,11,2011-02-20,Questions from an aspiring web developer,Sunshineq,web_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/fout9/questions_from_an_aspiring_web_developer/,"Just started using Reddit pretty recently and its an amazing community that I'm happy to (now) be a part of.

First, some background info (feel free to tl;dr this section):

I'm 19 years old, and have been doing some form of web development since I was 14. I started with a free site on bravenet with a really horrible design, it was terrible. Looking back now I realize exactly how horrible it is (My 14 year old self thought it was awesome).

Throughout High School it became a hobby, and I got better (I still can't do design). I started teaching myself HTML and CSS, and later JavaScript and PHP. Around junior year I had built a website using PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I hosted it using a shared host and registered a domain name. It was basically a meeting-grounds for students to talk on the forum, play embedded flash games, and other entertainment stuff. Mostly it was done to get past the web filters.

Lately, I've been thinking about what I'd like to do with my life in the long-term. The career I keep coming back to is web development. I enjoy implementing my own designs in HTML and CSS (even if my designs are horrible); and I think I'd love implementing the designs of people who know what they're doing. I also enjoy doing the server-side as well, though I'm not as confident in my abilities in that area.



So now on to my questions:

1. How can I learn about industry standards and best practices? I work as an intern at a very small tech company where I do a range of things like web development, IT, and software development. I learn tons, but not a lot specific to web development.
1. Where can I get experience with the interactions between clients, designers, and developers? Things like how the designer communicates his visual ideas to the developer who implements them.
1. What are some good ways to improve after I've learned the basics? I ""know"" HTML and CSS in that I understand how they work and interact together, and I know a lot of properties and good ways to use them. But for some reason no matter how much more I learn I feel like I'm lacking an advanced grasp of the material.
1. What can I do to assess my skill level? Things like assessing my ability to implement someone else's design.
1. What are some good ways to get into the industry? Either as an employee of a company, or doing freelance work on my own.
1. Do you think a degree is necessary/worth it, if so, which degree would you recommend?
1. How can I get employers/clients to take me seriously at my age?



Those are all of the questions I can think of right now, if I come up with any more I'll let you know! Thanks to anyone who took the time to read all of this.

**Edit**: Thank you to everybody who answered, I learned a lot of new information and have a bunch of new resources to look through. "
fou7m,10,2011-02-19,Went from [7] to paranoid in 5 minutes. [RANT][4],atworkbored,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/fou7m/went_from_7_to_paranoid_in_5_minutes_rant4/,"I need to get this out of my head so its going to /r/trees because ents, we're the best people around.  So! I currently am a college graduate, with an amazing job at an amazing company where my projected net worth in 3 years is 100k a year usd.  At the moment I live in my parents house, my city is expensive and Im a poorly paid intern at the moment which is why i dont have my own place.  So this morning I woke up with a horrific hangover at my gf's house.  After a long day of hangover and having to teach a dance class, i make it home, thinking about my MFLB that awaits me.  Vape once, get to [3]  eat some dinner and fam goes out.  Sweet, lets hit that box.  Cant! Batteries are dead.  Okay, throw them in the charger, takes the ones i use about an hour to charge.  Sweet, they're charged, lets vape again!  *VAPE* feeling good, i burn some oil to mask the air.  My mom walks in not 5 minutes after the oil has burned.  

""Oh why does it smell like burning in here"" 
*poker face* its the oil


She takes the oil dish and washes it out.

*Everything went better than expected*

She comes back 5 minutes later and still comments on the smell, she then says, it smells like marijuana, are you smoking marijuana in this room?

*poker face*No that silly, you know I wouldnt do that.  (note: im asthmatic so im not supposed to smoke ANYTHING it really fucks with me, also the mflb is pretty good, but i still feel gunk in my chest)

She looks like she doesnt believe me completely and i mention ill just open the window (which i fucking should have earlier, but its really cold out :( ).  

I leave with the cup of tea i had earlier to put it in the sink, here she can go and search my desk and find my mflb in the tin, but when i come back with another cup of juice, nothing looks disturbed.  

Great im out of the woods; nope,  not yet.  She comes back a THIRD time and asks why my room has a hint of pot in the air.  I blame it on my clothes that are on the bed.  I was out drinking and at bars around a lot of smokers.  She doesnt seem like she buys it completely and kinda hovers for another minute.  

My mom doesnt work, so she can tear my room apart any day when im out at work, so i need to dump my stash.  Im not about to flush 1/4 down the pisser, so I get the great idea to call my friend to come get it, hes not far and was playing a show so he should be on his way home.  Thankfully he is, so i ask him to come over i need a favor.  

Okay, great, i can dump the stash, but i cant throw it all in a bag and walk past their room, she could jump out and inquire whats in the bag.  I cant say i dont smoke if she grabs a nice ball jar of it from my hands.  I throw the jar in a shirt, throw it in a bag, with my mflb tin and throw it out the window, its just a 2nd floor, and it landed in grass, didnt sound like it broke, ill hope for the best.  My friend comes and gets the bag and here I am.  A bit worried, but the only thing she can do is get a drug test if shes really determined to find out if i smoke.

I dont get it ENTs.  I finished college,  I have no kids (pretty impressive if youre hispanic and over 18),  I have a great job which i guess i can start calling a career, I have no criminal record and im a great happy person.  Why the fuck cant i just smoke a bit of pot, it would be totally okay if i were drinking in my room tho.  I hate that shit.  I need to move out, ASAP.


Thanks for listening to me rant /r/trees.

Toke on."

fpv9t,2,2011-02-21,"I want this dog like nobody's business, but....",[deleted],Pets,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/fpv9t/i_want_this_dog_like_nobodys_business_but/,"It's a long story, but I'll try to make it short. My boyfriend and I are both college kids on an internship at the same company together. We're very serious (he's ring shopping). I've been volunteering at the local Humane Society for a college honors requirement and because I just freaking love dogs. 

So I have a dog [Rikku](http://i.imgur.com/vEOjd.jpg), who was my Christmas present from my mom in 2009. I call her my miracle puppy because she healed my broken heart after I lost my best friend, Leo (sorry no pics, they're all at home on my home computer), who was hit by a car the first week I went away to college. I love her to death, but because of where we are (in a tiny apartment), and the long hours we work (11-ish hours a day, 5 days a week), she's staying with my family. I took her with me to college for a quarter, and she did ok after I moved into a better apartment than my original one, but never quite seemed herself. For example, she stopped kicking her leg when I rubbed her belly (when she is home with my family, she gets so excited about it she literally kicks both legs insanely). She wasn't unhappy, just not entirely the puppy she is when she has Brodie, my family's dog, to play with. Or maybe it's my family in general. I'm not entirely sure on that point, but I feel like she just needs other dogs to be happy (we took her from a trashy family that had about 10 dogs in a 10x10 pen, so she spent the first few months of her life with lots of company).

Anyways, as I was volunteering, I fell in love with a little dog. I begged my boyfriend to adopt her (he's 21, I'm almost 19, but the rules are that applicants must be 21 or older), but he was adamant about not getting another dog, even though she was really tiny (4.5 lbs). I was super heartbroken when she was adopted by another family, and in a state of heartbroken-ness I started looking at dogs to adopt on Petfinder.com. By pure chance I stumbled across [Autumn](http://www.petfinder.com/petdetail/18571259), and was floored at her shocking resemblance to my dog (note they are most certainly not related). Now I can't get this dog off my mind, but I know my boyfriend would probably never be ok with me running off and adopting another dog, and my family can't take in another one for me.
Any advice?

EDIT: Thanks to all the responses. I needed some reason to be injected into my addled brain. I'm going to look into possible fostering, talk with my boyfriend some more, and wait until we can both agree it is a good time to take another precious life into our home. Again, thanks redditors. I definitely got a lot of good tips here.

TL;DR: I want to adopt a dog that looks like my dog's twin so they can play together and maybe be happier. But my circumstances and my boyfriend aren't very friendly to adopting at this time. Advice would be wonderful."

fpuof,0,2011-02-21,I Am a Young Adult from a Wealthy Family- AMA,[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fpuof/i_am_a_young_adult_from_a_wealthy_family_ama/,"My mother came from a family that hovered right above the poverty line, while my father was from a working-class background. Both of them managed to obtain their bachelor's degrees. My father was (and is) particularly ambitious, and he worked his way up the corporate ladder. While my family was middle-class when I was born, we quickly accumulated a vast amount of wealth.

Throughout my life, I've been granted a ridiculous amount of privileges. If I want something that will benefit me as a person and help me grow, my parents will pay for it. I've been on lavish vacations in world-class hotels, given ridiculously good internships through my father's connections, and went to school with equally wealthy teens for a bit (yacht party, anyone)?

However, this doesn't come without drawbacks. I've moved a hell of a lot, which has caused me to develop some serious problems with relationship development. I've also been under immense pressure to succeed since I was a young child. Failure was never an option. When I received my first 'C' grade in middle-school, I tried to kill myself. Fun times for all.

Today, I'm a university student at a prestigious college in the UK. As can be expected, my parents are footing my travel costs, tuition fees, and recreation fees. I will eventually move on to graduate school, and, if everything goes according to plan, obtain my Ph.D and become a professor. I'm an aspiring novelist on the side, but I don't expect that to go anywhere unless I'm incredibly lucky. Either way, I'm comfortable with my career possibilities.

**EDIT::**I made a mistake in answering one of these questions. I have no personal knowledge if these girls orgasm or not, I can't be inside their head and I certainly didn't have the balls to ask them. I just used my knowledge of being around porn of a year(and more of course) to tell when a girl was faking it or not. I apologize for making that assumption, I have just been around enough orgasms to have a good sense of when someone is faking it vs. when they are acting. 

And yes, there are times when the girls don't orgasm or don't enjoy it. However, that rarely happens. Almost so rare it's not worth mentioning. Every ""orgasm"" you see in the videos are real. They cut the ""fake"" ones out.

For as long as I can remember I have had manic highs and lows, that flicker like a light-switch, triggered by interactions with others. Regardless, I haven't caved to the idea of medication because I am weary of the power of narcotics. Also, I don't have insurance, so I can't go talk to anyone, if that were covered. 

I have self-medicated since 16 with marijuana and drink irregularly but recklessly, when I do. I am heavily addicted to grass, I smoke as regularly as some cigarette smokers do, if able. 

I suppose I never convinced myself that functioning high all day was a poor reinforcer of living habits that might have netted me a job by now. 

While on topic substance (booze), I got hit by a car about two weeks after graduating college and am still, in some ways, physically recovering from it. I was drunk and the driver of the vehicle was, but the accident was my fault. 

I realize now that this accident has affected me in all sorts of ways, but the take home point is that it really threw me off balance. I didn't really even start looking for jobs until late in the fall of that year because of the injuries. I thought that some of the injuries were going to be permanent and this devastated me. 

Anywho, the injuries are much better, though if i ever hit my 80-90%+ I will report back with pics, detailing. 

So, I spent a while living on my own, hoarding what money I had left, smoking too much and applying for jobs. Then, I started to run low on money then out, then my folks supported me, then failed interviews, DEPRESSION, then JOB!! But, its a shitty job, and I fail to realize that ""any better than none"".

So the money runs back out, and I am forced to move home, beaten. A year out of school without a thing to show. 

Fast forward, hiking, sprained ankle, girlfriends, concerts, holidays, a few applications, hate living with folks, I finally get another job. 

Its another shitty job, and I have a contract labour position somewhere else. 

What can I do to keep going? Grad school was always 50/50, I never made a solid decision on field. And until I do, and at this point manage to get reimbursed or table my undergrad loans, I am not considering going back to school.

I have alienated people from school that call to check in on me because I am embarrassed, my best friends are all jollying on, I vent to my folks because I'm a joke and they still fawn over me, I feel myself slipping into my mid 30's with nothing. 

I don't know, have i just deluded myself into thinking that I deserve a solid 40k out of college too?  

Hey, for the anyone who connects with this, i'm here too, and *maybe* this is just reality, seats taken. Just get in where you can fit in and try not to push everyone else around you away^away^away^away^away

I've been programming for a while now and I think I'm a pretty decent programmer, insofar as I can come up with working code that does what I want it to do. 

I'm a junior in college, majoring in computer science, and I've been applying for internships for the summer. I said that I know Java on my resume because I have about 4 years of experience programming in Java, and I thought I did know Java really well. However, I keep getting slammed on questions about the back-end: basically, technical questions about what's going on behind-the-scenes. For example, one question that I wasn't able to answer was the difference between 

String x = ""abc""; and String x = new String(""abc"");

What are some good resources for learning about things like this? Most intro programming books just kind of cover ""how to do this in Java,"" which I pretty much know already. I guess I'm looking into learning how to write Java well, not just how to make it work, if that makes any sense. 

Thanks guys!"

I have been to numerous doctors who have told me a number of different things and prescribed a number of medications. These treatments have had some varying success. I am now 23 and in my final semester of college. I have worked my way through college as first an it tech for a department of my campus and then as a desktops system administration intern for an engineering company. My supervisors in both positions were very understanding of my condition and worked with me and did not mind me taking time off when my headaches were to bad to work. I like what I do now and feel like I am good at it but I am concerned that my headaches will prevent me from being able to keep steady employment. Currently I am having less headaches then I have ever had but still end up being out of commission 1-2 days every two weeks. When my headaches were at their worst I ended up taking a break from school for a semester because I was suffering 5 days out of 7. My wife and myself would really like to move once I am done with school and doing so will mean the end to any position I have with my currently employer (staying would not guarantee a position either).

I feel like my life could be much better, and I was given the opportunities, but I threw it away.

-----

I feel like I threw away opportunities for a romantic life. I am/can be relatively social/fun to be around, and am decently attractive/in-shape, but I've gone my whole life without a girlfriend. I feel like a complete loser for never even going on a date. I have no idea what it feels like to kiss, let alone hold hands with a girl, and this makes me feel incredibly sad and pathetic. I know I'm relatively young, but try talking to Freshman/Sophmores about your college experiences so far, and it's painful when they see you as someone that's already gone through college and experienced the next 4 years they are going to experience, but you've never even been on a date. I feel like middle school/high school/college are set-up nicely for getting into dating, but here I am with 0 experience about to enter the real world with people with experience (I feel like a complete loser--it'd be like a middle school boy on his first date with a mature 22 year-old woman)? I feel like there's no hope here; I messed up.

Even if I do somehow go on a date or am present with an opportunity for a first kiss, my mind is totally psyched-out as I've been wanting this all my life; and what a mess I will be when I have to deal with my first break-up...).

-----

-----

I feel like I threw away high school. Every lunch period I spent in the library. I feel like I had a decently enjoyable personality, but I was too shy to ever try to talk to or hang out with my ""friends"" outside of class. I also never went to a single dance in my life, so I feel like I really lost 4 important years of my life (people are always shocked when I tell them I've never been to a formal/prom). Don't tell me they were pointless if you went; it's easy to brush them off as nothing important when you actually went to them.

-----

-----

I feel like I threw away college. I had pretty solid grades to start out college (ended up in an honor society), but I *never* did anything outside required school-work, and my GPA slowly decreased. It's still solid, I guess, but the end-result is that I am graduating soon with no internship experience, no research experience, and no faculty member that could give me a letter of recommendation, and the job market is grim for an experience-less B.S. in EE (and I couldn't apply for Masters anywhere due to no experience and nobody to write letters of rec). 

Being in an honor society, I was surrounded by people that did the exact opposite of me and are so experienced and on top of things.  I feel like I threw away a great opportunity here. I don't know what I'm going to do after graduation (a strong part of me sees myself dead by graduation). I absolutely do not want to move back home.

-----

-----

I feel like I threw away a relationship with my family. There's a language barrier between me and my mom, so there was hardly any communication growing up beyond very simple things, and the barrier wasn't as bad with my dad, but a lack of interest resulting in no deep relationship there either (never ate dinner with them together, usually cooked my own food; never call home; when my dad does pick me up, the 90 minute car ride home usually only contains a grand total of 90 seconds worth of talking). 

They took a hands-off approach to parenting, and I always felt they were bad parents because of that. They would drive me crazy when they would make comparisons between me and my brother (2 years older &amp; worse off--also depressed, didn't go to college, over-weight, balding, little social life, lives at home, etc.); for example, on the rare occasion that my brother would get the motivation to walk (too out of shape to run) on the treadmill, they'd tell him to run like I do, he would get mad, and they would be clueless. I would try to explain to them that that is bad parenting, but the language barrier makes it impossible to explain the somewhat complicated reasons why what they did was stupid. The end result was frustration on my part. 

Similar episodes built-up over the years and I kept it all to myself--the end result was pretty much a total drop of communication once I entered college since I was fed up. I know a lot of people don't get in relationships until late, or aren't too successful professionally, but I feel like these people usually at least have a family they have a strong emotional connection with to fall back on...

-----

-----

I threw away the friendships I gained in college. I opened up to some people about my suicidal nature, but I've broken contact with them since I go nuts around them (one I had a crush on, the other I couldn't believe really, truly cared about me as much as I wanted to believe she did, so I blew up little indicators of a possible lack of affection into big fights with her). Haven't spoken to them in ~7 months.

I had a somewhat close group of friends, but they were all academic go-getters that didn't seem to have the problems I had (they had internships, research opportunities, significant others, actual relationships with family, etc.) and I grew bitter/jealous around them. So, now I have no social life.

-----

-----

It's hard not to feel weak or like a failure at life. My brother even told me he attempted suicide, but I find myself running from his problems as well and not doing the things I should be doing to help him (like regularly talk to him, or try to get him enrolled in a community college or something).  

I tried therapy, anti-depressants (Lexapro, Pristiq, and Wellbutrin), opening up to friends, and a support group, but I'm still here. I still can't fight off this urge to just give up and kill myself because I can't change the past and I don't see anything promising in the future. I know my suicide will affect certain people, but I can't feel miserable every day just so that I don't send a ripple through other people's lives. "

I know eventually I'll have to get a more professional haircut for internships and jobs, but I hate my hair so much right now that I spend at least an hour a day messing with it. I think part of the reason I feel so bad is that my eyebrows used to be covered up, and I have a serious problem with them. Even though I tweeze them, I feel like they're too big, and now they're so exposed if I'm not wearing a hat or something. I've been thinking maybe getting them threaded if I can find a place.

When they offer me, should I be negotiating for something specific? Is there something I'm missing like the amount of pay, any perks, or anything else?

I know this might be very broad that I'm asking about but I'm sure some people who are programmers started out as interns and I want to know how you guys got into permanent or full-time positions."

I'm considering changing my major to economics because I enjoy the business side of biotech rather than the actual science side of biotech in itself. To become an econ major, I would need to drop my biotech major. Double majoring in both is not possible due to the unit cap my university places on students. The econ major itself is only 60 units (something I could complete in a year, meaning I could still graduate on time).

I actually have a lot of research and science experience from internships that I've done in the past and I know how to program in Python, C, and create websites. I even wrote grant proposals to NIH. The point is, I do not wish to leave the biotech industry, just the biotech major.

I know that dropping the biotech major will close some doors for me career path-wise, but will being an econ major with many bioinformatics skills open up other new doors?

fpzv0,5,2011-02-21,I was offered a paid internship and a year of employment after that if I lent my boss $5000. What does reddit think?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fpzv0/i_was_offered_a_paid_internship_and_a_year_of/,"Throwaway for identification and legal purposes. This is a complete shot in the dark, but any help with this decision helps, so I thought I'd give reddit a try.

So here's my story. I am a fourth year engineering student at a UC, and I've been interning at a small engineering company for more than a year now. And by small, I mean less than 5 people small. It's an engineering firm, and they are at a crossroads. The boss is about to lose his building because he is over $30,000 behind in rent. He has asked me and a couple other fellows at this company to borrow $5000 each in order to stay afloat for 3 months in order to sell some assets. These assets are worth about a total of more than $300,000, and would help him hire engineers and to help pursue venture capital. He received a letter of eviction a few weeks ago, but managed to go to court for an extension and he needs the money from us by this Friday. This is what he proposed:

In exchange for lending $5000, we would be offered a paid 3 month internship after we graduate in the Spring. Depending on when he gets his venture capital, we would start our full time position, and would be paid back the money we lent. He would set aside about $10000 worth of “valuable mechanical devices” in a storage in the event that nothing goes right, and the company tanks. We are also offered stock options, with the promise that this company would become the next Google of the industry that the company is in.

Here is where it gets really complicated. I’ve applied for the Air Force Officer’s Program, and I would know if I get accepted or not in June. If I were to accept this offer from the engineering company, I would have a guaranteed position in this company for a year and a quarter, if things go right. But I’d have to turn down the Air Force, which is something that I sort of want to do. However, I signed an agreement with them, stating that should I be accepted, I would have to join. My recruiter, however, said there was technically a way for me not to join if I were accepted. The reason I chose the Air Force was because I am sure I would get monster job offers once I get out. What engineering firm wouldn’t want a commissioned Air Force Officer to join their company, especially with engineering experience in the military?

So pretty much, I am having a tough time deciding to take this engineering firm’s offer or not. To me, it seems like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, because if this company really were to become the next big thing, I would be set for life. I would probably be able to retire very, very early. On the other hand, if I did not accept and this happened, I would be regretting it my whole life.

There are many factors I’ve thought of. It might sound like I am paying for a job, but the boss justified it by saying it is only lending, and that I would have been offered a position out of college anyways. The Air Force AND this offer seem like great opportunities, because in the Air Force, I would be gaining extremely valuable experience and skillsets. With this company, I could probably be a very rich man, given that it works out, or I could regret not joining the Air Force, given that it does NOT work out.

What do you guys think? Input of any kind is welcome. Suggestions, advice, stories, questions, etc etc.

EDIT: So far, everyone's been giving good advice. The consensus seems to not lend the money. Let me add some things. One of the employees there, who's been with the company for 10 years, is also a Vice President at another company. He makes commands a six figure salary, but said that he would give it all up and work full time with this company should it raise the venture capital. Another employee, a lawyer, works for the company without pay. He is an environment attorney with a good rep who works for FREE. Shouldn't this say a lot about the potential of the company? But reading through my comments, you can tell that I am biased towards the company. Please understand that I am passionate about green energy, and I really, REALLY want this company to make it. I am not sure if this changes anything, for the better or for worse. Hope this helps.

BTW thanks for the comments and keep them coming!!"

fr7ke,1,2011-02-23,Observer at a law firm.. worth it?,[deleted],law,https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/fr7ke/observer_at_a_law_firm_worth_it/,"I'm a 2L (equivalent) law student in India. I've been interning at a lot of the big firms here, but I applied for a summer internship with a big-name law firm in New York (because I could really use the holiday).

They've offered me an Observer position for a month, because they claim that internship offers are tight right now and for a foreign law student there wouldn't be much to help out on.

I was wondering if it's worth taking it up. Has anyone done this before? My understanding is that I won't get to actually participate in anything and it'll be a strictly watch-and-learn sort of gig. It's also an unpaid position but the money is irrelevant because I'm flying on miles and staying at my sister's.

Help.. anyone?

TL;DR- Got an observer position at a big city law firm in NYC with a non-US law degree. Is it worth it?"
fr6yb,4,2011-02-23,"I'm 22, made $20,000 last year as a consultant. Am I screwed with taxes?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fr6yb/im_22_made_20000_last_year_as_a_consultant_am_i/,"I was basically an intern at a firm last year, during school and after graduation, and was paid hourly without any witholdings. I have never done taxes before as a consultant and have read that I must pay around 20% ($4000) back to the government plus any fees or fines that may have accrued since I did not file my taxes quarterly. I am just wondering if there are any consultants out there that can give me some insights/advice on how to file my taxes. Is my $4000 prediction correct? I feel so screwed right now...

**EDIT:** I know I screwed myself over by not staying on top of my taxes. I just wanted to know if my estimation is accurate or not from someone who is a consultant and had to file their own taxes. Some websites state that I owe $800, while others says somewhere around $1200. I also see comments saying that I'm going to owe $5000+. I guess the best thing to do is just talk to an accountant (which I will do)."

## STATS:

&gt; Male or female?
&gt;&gt; Male

&gt; Age?
&gt;&gt; 23

&gt; Relationship Status?
&gt;&gt; In a relationship for about four and a half years.

&gt; What general area of your country you live in? Do you love it?
&gt;&gt; I've lived in Bristol, England all my life. I find it to be one of the nicest cities in the United Kingdom, although one day I'd like to move on somewhere else for a bit, perhaps to America or Australia. However, given that all the good software jobs seem to be in or around the London area I'll probably have to drag my girlfriend there.

## FAVORITES

&gt; Foods/ Beverages?
&gt;&gt; Either Curry (the hotter the better) or Chinese takeaway, and to drink Cherry Coke by day, Beer by night (and sometimes day).

&gt; Movie/ TV?
&gt;&gt; It depends on my mood. South Park: BLAU,  Anchorman, Forrest Gump and the Harry Potter and Rocky movies are all pretty good. I'm a huge fan of stand-up comedy so I love shows like Mock The Week and Live at the Apollo, and I quite like American sitcoms, like Frasier and Scrubs. If it's funny I'll watch it.

&gt;&gt; At the moment I'm somewhat addicted to 30 Rock. I think it's terrible that so many great American sitcoms are overlooked on British TV.

&gt; Music?
&gt;&gt; I listen to a lot of pop-punk, alternative rock, and some older stuff too. My Spotify playlist is full of stuff from Motion City Soundtrack, The Fold, The Smiths, Killswitch Engage, Explosions in the Sky, Millencolin, even a bit of Justin Bieber. I'm really crappy at choosing favourites, so I typically say Foo Fighters, as I rarely hear a crappy Foo Fighters song.

&gt; Books?
&gt;&gt; I quite liked the Abhorsen trilogy, love On The Road by Jack Kerouac and quite like a good autobiography; My Booky Wook by Russell Brand is a fantastic read. I'm not the biggest fan of sci-fi books, but I've (finally) finished what's been released of the Ender's Game series of books and all I can say is ""wow""...

&gt; Games?
&gt;&gt; Chrono Trigger, then Ocarina of Time. Final Fantasy rocks my socks too. I own a Nintendo Wii that will remain unused until Skyward Sword comes out, and a worn-out PS3 that's suffered through hours of Fallout 3 and New Vegas, and some FIFA '11 (when people don't rage-quit on me).

## MISCELLANEA:

&gt; What makes you laugh?
&gt;&gt; I'm a big stand-up fan, and I try to go to live shows whenever I have money and/or free time. I love Jimmy Carr, Frankie Boyle, Russell Brand, Jim Jefferies, etc. I also like to watch or listen to something funny at night before I go to sleep (for some reason I struggle to sleep when it's quiet) so I'm usually watching whatever comedy I can find. My current favourites are The Trip with Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon, the Russell Brand podcast and Jackass.

&gt; What is your biggest pet peeve?
&gt;&gt; People who fail to regard the feelings of others really piss me off.
More often than not I tend to be nice to strangers. If someone is running for the lift (elevator to you Americans) I keep it open for them, if I'm only going up a couple of floors I take the stairs, when driving I tend to let people out, etc. Most of my annoyances come from people who cut me up on the road, groups of people who wait ages for the lift only to get off at floors 2 and 3 (I'm on floor 13 and I take the stairs at least half of the time!), just small things that tend to add up during a shitty day.

&gt; What was the best thing about the last 12 months?
&gt;&gt; I finished my undergraduate degree in Computer Science, had a stress-free summer working on an internship (who now hired me full-time), got to speak to Nick Clegg at a Q&amp;A event and got to spend some quality time with my girlfriend. I spent a few months  studying for my Masters,  but I left due to money-issues and a lack of interest.

&gt; What are you looking forward to in the next 12 months?
&gt;&gt; I'm not too sure really, hopefully getting a raise (or looking for a new job), saving some money and going on a nice holiday somewhere. Hopefully I'll have time to work on something fun in my spare time, like a new Android application or a fun website.

&gt; All things considered what is the most important thing in the world to you?
&gt;&gt; Life. You were given one and it's your duty to live it.

## REGARDING REDDIT:

&gt; What is the origin or meaning of your user name?
&gt;&gt; At the time it just sounded cool, but then people kept asking me if it was a reference to Enders Game. I remember reading it a few years ago and it's probably where I got the name from. I've used a bunch of other usernames on different websites over the years, and the vast majority of them just come to me when I think of something that sounds cool.

&gt; Total number of reddit identities you’ve had?
&gt;&gt; Just this one. I don't really understand the need to have anonymous accounts or identities for different parts of Reddit.

&gt; What is your favourite part of reddit?
&gt;&gt; I joined Reddit after about two painful years on Digg, and used Reddit mainly for its CompSci, Programming and Java subreddits as the level of posting and commenting was far-above that of Digg. I eventually branched out into other parts and then realised that I hadn't logged into Digg in around a year.

&gt;&gt; Over the past year and a bit most of my time on the Internet is spent at Reddit, although I do spend a fair bit of time on Twitter and the BBC sport section too.

&gt; What do you do when you’re not on reddit?
&gt;&gt; I'm a web developer for a legal services company. To keep the nerds interested I am primarily a .NET guy, although on occasion I've been known to use Python with my Umbraco projects or do PHP work for external clients. Hell, a lot of the time I'm the one designing pages in Photoshop and writing the HTML and CSS behind them too. I don't get paid much, but there aren't many jobs out there for recent graduates so unless some opportunity at a large company like HP or IBM comes along I'm stuck here. It's not that bad a job, and I get a lot of freedom to do what I please with my projects.

&gt;&gt; Outside of that I live a double life. I mix between playing FIFA '11 and Football Manager, going out drinking with the guys, watching football and spending time with my girlfriend, and watching old Anime shows (Dragonball, Love Hina, Evangelion, Shaman King and Tenchi rock my socks), playing old RPG's and working on small programming projects. I've got a small group of very close friends and even though a bunch of them have moved around to find work we still meet up every now and again and tear it up.

&gt;&gt; Many people I know don't really see my nerdy side, and people tend to be surprised when I join in a conversation about who would win in a fight between Goku from DBZ and Superman.

&gt; Do you think reddit has changed in the last year or so?
&gt;&gt; Of course, any social website will change with its audience almost daily, just like everything else in life. As long as Reddit continues to understand its audience and its current vision for a social news website we'll be just fine.

&gt; If so, do you think it’s been for the better?
&gt;&gt; That's hard to say, because certain subreddits I frequent change drastically over certain periods. I'm a huge contributor to /r/Soccer and over the summer the user count almost doubled thanks to the World Cup; that had benefits in regular IRC game chats and added discussion and drawbacks in dumbasses that wanted to ruin the fun for everyone.

## FINAL QUESTION:

&gt; Is there anything you'd like to plug/promote/advocate?
&gt;&gt; As I've got the opportunity, I'd like to plug a cool independent pop/rock band that I've grown to like over the past year or two, named The Fold.  They all seem like cool guys and they're living the dream, and whenever I listen to a song of theirs I usually plug it on /r/ListenToThis.

&gt;&gt; Sadly, none of the small projects I've been working on are even close to completion, so I can't provide a link or plug it. My two main projects at the moment are a football diving catalogue site and a rather unique article system, both in ASP.NET. I'm sure that I'll post both, both on /r/soccer and on /r/startups.

",Our_Values,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/fr45b/generation_y_millennials_surge_in_serving_america/,"Do you know where Generation Y is headed, besides into debt? Service! We seem to be flocking toward serving America. Today, we’ll look at why that poses other problems for our generation.

All this week, we’re looking at challenges facing Generation Y—those aged 18-29, sometimes called Millennials or even the Boomerang Generation. Yesterday, we looked at Millennials’ boundless optimism. As a generation, we’re restlessly searching for options. Some of us travel, some go back to school and many of us compete to the death for unpaid internships. What do these options all have in common? They’re incredibly expensive, and add to the huge debt Millennials will spend decades trying to pay off.

The average college student graduates $24,000 in debt. With alarming unemployment levels, this kind of debt leaves many students looking toward options such as federally funded service programs that defer or cancel student loans—especially Peace Corps, AmeriCorps or the Armed Forces. Recruitment numbers for all three have dramatically increased over the past five years. In fact, applicant numbers for AmeriCorps, which includes the popular Teach for America program, nearly tripled in the past two years.

Though these programs are often short-term, they offer young adults a meaningful way to pass the time as they wait for more career opportunities to open up. As a result, Millennials gain needed experience, make important connections, and give back to their communities and country.

Researchers maintain that other factors aside from the economy also contribute to the surge in service among young people. National tragedies, including 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, as well as President Obama’s call to service have encouraged Millennials to act for change.

Whatever is driving our generation in this direction, acceptance rates in these programs are edging toward the very employment numbers young adults are trying to avoid in a competitive job market. Teach for America, which boasts recruitment of the most “elite college graduates,” accepts a mere 12 percent of all applicants—a rate on par or lower than acceptance at most Ivy League universities. Most young adults looking into service programs are left in the same discouraging, unemployed position as before.

What are young graduates left to do? Teach for America promises to double the number of corps members it accepts by 2015, but is this enough to change prospects for the millions of Millennials?

What do you think? Will that help?
Should the government expand service programs?
Will service programs remain popular if the economy improves?

fqwz1,23,2011-02-23,Any tips for a guy who can't pay his credit card/loan bills?,helpimbroke,Frugal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/fqwz1/any_tips_for_a_guy_who_cant_pay_his_credit/,"Quick backstory:
I wasn't always frugal, and in the 2 years after graduating 5 years ago (engineering), I racked up some stupid debt in addition to student loans, mostly building project cars. I had it under control but two years later, a job change, cross-country move, and car-engine-failure later I had built-up debt to uncomfortable levels ($45k).

Last winter, I got an opportunity to go to school overseas for some schooling related to my dream career. I got nearly a full scholarship, but I decided that to do it without going farther into debt I would have to really change my lifestyle. This was a success story. I sold my car and took the bus. I made meals. I drank less. I terminated the lease on my apartment instead of letting it sit empty when I was gone. I actually paid down my debt more than usual at the same time as paying for school, which lasted from June until August. Win!

Before that was over, I was offered an internship in a different country, for 6 months but with only a $2800 bursary at the end. I said yes, and had 6 weeks in between to save money. Through good luck with a temporary contract, I thought I saved up enough to last the whole 6 months, including making minimum payments. While here, I lived in a dorm and ate cheaply, and got a free bike instead of taking the bus.

I am at the end of month 4, and broke. Current debt level is $37k, almost all of it is unsecured. I have been procrastinating but I know I need to call my creditors and tell them I can't pay right now. I don't have a job to go to yet, but I think my prospects are good. I do not have a work visa in this country and am not willing to risk closing the door on coming back by working. Once working, I expect to be able to live comfortably and pay down my debt in about 3-4 years.

My **first dilemma** is I am really scared of making the phone calls. Has anyone here been through this, especially in the Canadian system? What can I expect?

My **second dilemma** is that after this internship, I can get a full scholarship in my dream field for a PhD. It would start one year from now and last for 4-5 years. Is it worth walking away from debts? I don't feel good about the idea, but I feel terrible about not going for it. I am at the upper age limit for this option, so doing it later won't work.

**tl;dr: Have no income and can't pay my debts ($37k). Help me grow balls to call creditors. I can pay them in a few months again, but then need to make a decision: pay debts or get PhD.**

I know this is only sort-of on topic here, but it's an embarrassing, difficult issue that I hope others can shed some light on. It's also very hard to find information online: it's all blogspam and bankruptcy agencies.

edit: typo in the tl;dr

**update**:

Thank you all for the advice and surprising udeserved kindness. I've got some academic advice as well and made my plans more flexible. I can do this without bankruptcy or being a deadbeat. Here is my plan:

1. 
Working on budget for my working year plus school years right now. **done**
2. 
Call creditors when they open in the morning to defer payments for four months (after leaving here and starting work). Ideally I want to pay everything but I will look at making a payment proposal and consolidation.. **done**. One isn't too interested in my current situation and is calling back in 3 weeks to arrange a payment schedule, when their system triggers for a missed payment. This seems odd and I will probably call in a week to see if I can deal with things BEFORE a missed payment. I keep getting stuck on hold on the other one, and have yet to connect before my crappy wireless connection kicks me off. **update**: got through to them and they were VERY nice. Switched me to interest-only payments until I have an income.
3. 
Set up appointment with a financial planner. I want some independent professional advice too.
4. 
Finish application for PhD. Turns out it's flexible, I can leave after personal research (1 year) or a master's (3 years). My realistic goal is master's, but if debt payments go well I can get the PhD. If they go badly I will still get a year of experience in the field. **in progress, going well**
5. 
Apply for more jobs. My focus is on cities with potential roommates and jobs with overtime. **in progress**. So far have one rejection and one headhunter talking to me, and two cheap places to stay in two different cities.
6. 
For all my decisions, I am going to try and be realistic. I am not simply getting the PhD no matter what. I will estimate best and worst case scenarios for how much extra interest it will cost me. Off the top of my head, I think this will be $25 to $30k extra in the worst case. I might have $20k or more remaining to pay when I am done. Ouch, but could be worth it.

Found out I CAN work with the scholarship, up to 20 hours a week. Got a really good connection for a part time job, but obviously can't rely on it when I won't be back for over a year. It's a positive development though.

fqt7j,3,2011-02-22,"it appears that my gf and I have reached an impasse, I might need some help :/",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fqt7j/it_appears_that_my_gf_and_i_have_reached_an/,"So, I'm not looking for any karma or w/e, I just need a few tips.

Backstory (sorry ADD'ers, i like to write):

We've been friends for about 8 years now, an item for 2; we're both 22.  we live about 2 hours apart, but managed to see each other virtually every weekend (i think 2 weeks is the most we've bee apart).

it's been a great 1.75 years, but things have been spiraling the past few months.  there were some red flags early on, like possessiveness and pushy-ness, but nothing that i haven't experienced in any other relationship.  In the beginning, we got together when I was in a bad spot in life with drugs and stuff, and her strong character helped me out of it (something I am forever grateful for).  Now I feel that strong personality is tearing us apart.

She believes that her life is falling apart, and the only way to soothe that is for me to be there with her.  Nearly every day that we're apart, she tries to find a way to get me to spend the night with her (not in a sexual way, more like a security blanket), and is disappointed every time I can't make it.  The fact is, her life is on a great track.  She just finished an internship that got her a ton of connections and a great entry level job.  The only problem that is ""holding her back"" is that we aren't living together so we can start our lives together.  So she expects me to be with her every weekend, for the whole weekend.  This has obviously caused friction between my family and friends.  All of her college friends have dispersed throughout the world, and but she's not lamenting their loss; she expects me to replace all of them.  

So the single event that started the downward slide was when our mutual guy friends converged on the city where she lived for a weekend.  The plan was for a guy's night to watch some playoff football, probably the first of such weekend nights since we've been dating.  It just so happens that my gf was a wreck that day because her internship was ending the next week (she still had upcoming interviews in the meantime) and 15 minutes into the game, she called my crying and angry that I wasn't there to help her get through this time.  Then the ultimatum came that if I wouldn't go back to her within an hour, it was over.  I ended up leaving my friends who were understanding.  On the surface, I felt like she was jealous that my time was being taken away from her when we have ""spend such little time together.""  A little deeper, I feel like my tendencies to placate her obsessive time needs have led her to be deluded about my my own role in her life.

I'm not completely innocent in this.  I am non confrontational to the point of a fault; i do this because i believe that i am inherently in complete control of every situation, and my gandhi-ness will eventually get me what I need.  Obviously, this does not transfer when trying to build a relationship.  she claims i don't support her, especially when our prior mentioned mutual friends troll her and everyone else.  For a person who is able to dish it out, she sure can't take it.  I (wrongly) just tell her to expect it from them every time and do little to ask them to change their behavior.  Although non-religious, i do believe in ""live and let live,"" so someone's personality is their own.  And this is my biggest mistake, because I expected a strong control freak to change her personality to be a little more ""chill"" over time.  All I ever want from her is to allow me some space from time to time for me to reconnect with ""old"" friends and form new professional relationships.  this, apparently, is non-negotiable.

This past weekend, we were planning on seeing our friends again, and of course the issue of troll support came up.  it spurted out into other aspects of our lives, and soon (like many times before) it became an argument over ethics and moralities, needs and wants.  We came to the conclusion that we weren't happy anymore, so naturally, I said we needed a break to see how I can change my own faults to better suit her needs.  This break isn't mutual and I know it's wrong, but I'm naturally a ""giving"" person, and she is a ""taker"".  Immediately, she claims that I hijacked the relationship and have relinquished all of her control, when all I need is a goddamn breather.  I never asked her to change, I never asked her to do anything except give me some space.  I guess for some that is too much to ask for.

I think I've conditioned her to expect the world, and I've put myself in an emotional hole.  I love her to death, but I don't think we're compatible anymore.  I think it's because we've been cooped up in this anti-social black hole that is her apartment, and being a sociable person, I try to do things that eventually keep falling apart (mostly cuz im broke).  But i feel like somebody here might have a similar experience where they are at a crossroads.  As a (sometimes) coward, I wouldn't know how to break up with my best friend.


So the big question is, is this time to break?  or how can i compromise for some space?  Thanks for any advice.


**TL;DR: did my gratitude placate my gf to the point of no compromise?**

It was 2am and at the time, I lived in a fairly dangerous neighborhood that was definitely no good to be traveling around late at night as a young female.  I am 5'3, 115lbs and of petite build.  However, I've been a student of many styles of martial arts starting at seven years old.  At the age of fifteen, I started interning with the local law enforcement as an observer.  There too, I learned many self defense skills.  I'm no superwoman, but very often my sparring partners were quite larger and stronger than me.  I'm no stranger to grappling with men or women that are considerably larger then I.

When I entered college I majored and graduated with a criminology degree.  I traveled abroad and interned in an all male prison for several months shadowing officers as they go about their daily routine.  Quite frequently, it would be me - an officer - and a room full of convicted persons.  (Before anyone calls bull; this was a British prison, so apparently this was allowed.  When I interned in prisons at the state, very rarely was I in direct contact with the prisoners).

Now back to the story.  I was out of cigarettes and had a mad craving (I have since then quit, it's nice to be able to run again).  So I decided to safest way to get to a gas station to pick up the goods would be to take a taxi to the station.  At no time did I ever believe what was going to happen next.  The driver was friendly, talkative and .. distracting.  It was three minutes into the ride before I realized that we were not going to the location I requested.  I asked him where we were going, thinking (sadly naively) that he was aiming for a different route.  Indeed, he was.  An alleyway.  More specifically, a very narrow alleyway.  The size of the taxi made it so that opening the door to step out was next to impossible.  I wonder if I could've squeezed out in time, but I didn't have that opportunity.  The driver parked the car and lunged over the backseat to where I was.  It was bench seating, so there was plenty of room for him to get beside me.

I can't say I have years of experience with violent offenders, as of now I am only in my mid twenties.  But I knew one thing; 'no' was not going to work.  Something about this man told me that he was going to hurt me badly if I resisted.  Everything about his behavior told me that he was going to get what he wanted, and that included harming me in the process.  At first he insisted he just wanted to give me a back rub.  I told him no, to back out, and to let me go.  He wasn't going to.  I was in a tough spot, a confined area with a man who easily outweighed me and was notably much stronger than I was.  The one important lesson I learned during my studies and various interns was 'deescalation'  He was going to sexually assault me and there was no way out of this vehicle without him getting ahold of me.

So I started talking.  I told him my name.  I told him I had a boyfriend.  As he fumbled with trying to take my clothes off, between each 'no' I said I kept talking about my family, my school, my hobbies and the things that I wanted to do.  I was meat to him, but I wanted him to see me as a person.  There's no doubt I was terrified, what came out of my mouth was more desperation than bravery.  I just wanted to get away without injury, without being raped and not to die in the back seat of a taxi car.

He got my pants down along with my underwear.  I kept full body contact at bay by countering his hands with my arms, pushing them away or to the side - trying to slow him down with what he was attempting to do so I could continue to talk.  Thankfully, the time it took for him to try and remove my clothing he had gotten so excited that he ejaculated on my thigh.  He was smiling the whole time, speaking to me 'sweetly' as he was assaulting me.  He even offered me a folded towel to wipe my leg off.  I dressed as he climbed back into the front of the seat and he even offered to drive me home.  When he pulled out of the alleyway, I threw open the door and bolted from the car.  I didn't know what where I was, but a kind stranger helped me find my way back to the apartment.

I found out later through news (and recognizing the MO) that I was his third victim.  He picked up young women late at night and sexually assaulted them.  The first two weren't so lucky.  Both women were beaten so badly they were almost unrecognizable even to their own parents, left on the street curb like trash.

He was even so bold that two nights later, he rang my doorbell and requested me for 'another date'.  My family was with me at this point to help me recover, and my very brave mother and sister ran outside and took both his picture and his license plate photo.  The entire time, he kept telling them:  ""Why do you do this?  I did nothing wrong!""  

He was never caught.  The police told me he was likely an illegal immigrant.  The photo evidence and the license photo lead to a dead end.

Herein lies what guilt that haunts me.

Should I have fought him?  As ridiculous as it sounds, in the back of my mind I feel ashamed that my 'self defense' consisted of begging to be brought home and not harmed.  My 'self defense' was repeatedly telling him no and trying to keep his hands off me.  I didn't do what I was taught.  Jab my fingers in his eyes.  Hit him in the throat.  Anything, everything I know that could hurt him badly and him render him injured enough that I could have attempted to escape without being assaulted.

I'm not saying that I was 'asking for it' because I didn't fight back.  I don't believe I deserved what happened because I didn't go at him with tooth and nail.  But I wanted to go home to my family, I wanted to live.  Out of the three victims, I went home without a physical scratch - but the mental trauma will last much longer. 

So Redditors, I'm asking you.  The dark part of my heart calls me a coward for letting him use me that way without going down fighting.  I feel ashamed in light of the women who died fighting to keep people like him (or her in any situation) from violating their body.

Redditors, Did I do what I had to do to survive this situation?  Or am I a coward?"

Unfortunately I get stuck on the part where I am asked for a resume. The problem is, I have no work experience (in any field), haven't done any programming projects, and have only taken first year CS courses.

I don't think I have a possibility to work for anybody at this point unless i get legal experience (the free kind, as an unpaid intern). I have been out of work for the last 9 months. 

I have been sending out resumes like crazy--just legal jobs up until now...but so far no takers.  I was just wondering if anyone here has been in the position of not finding work related to their field of study or degree and whether they decided to go back to school or begin a career in an unrelated field. 

My options as of now are 1) take an unpaid internship somewhere to get work experience, 2) go back to school and study engineering...I always wanted to do it...but I feel kinda old to be doing this, or 3) get a job somewhere (anywhere) and star being a productive adult.

fqoku,5,2011-02-22,Should I even bother to interview if I know there is no way I can even find transportation to the job if I get the position?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/fqoku/should_i_even_bother_to_interview_if_i_know_there/,"Hello all, 
I'm currently in college applying for internships and recently applied to a position through my school's career website. I have just been notified that I have been selected for a first-round interview. I'm not particularly ""dying"" for this position, but to be honest, I will just be happy for some experience this summer, so I am applying to any positions that I can find. Also, let me say that I have no problem with interviewing if just for the experience. 

The problem is, the interview is going to be business-case style, and will be held early next week. I have 3 midterms next week, yet I should mention that normally I would still attend and prepare for an interview even if I have a packed schedule. 

I reason that it will take me much longer to prepare for this interview, and another problem is that I have no car for the summer, nor do I have the means to get one and pay for insurance and all. The internship location is about 40 miles away and the shortest form of public transportation will get me there in FOUR HOURS, and this includes a ""take a cab"" portion on google maps. 

I know that I cannot take the position even if I make it to the final rounds of interviews, and the company will not provide housing support for the summer. Should I bother to interview considering that I will be very busy next week? 

Another question: how far would you be willing to travel each day to get to a job? In the past, I have turned down an interview because the position was located 2 hours away using public transportation, and the options were very unreliable. Was I stupid? 

Edit: Thank you everyone for your advice. I ended up preparing for the interview...it didn't take that much time. Unfortunately, I was just notified that I did not get picked to move onto second-round interviews. Oh well, it was a good learning experience! I am now saving up for a used car...hopefully it will make job-hunting easier eventually, "

I'm currently a student at Illinois Wesleyan University but was just accepted into a program where I get to study at Pembroke for my junior year. My area of study will be PPE (philosophy, politics, and economics) and I'm really excited for this opportunity. However, the one thing that is standing in the way is my ability to pay for it. 

The cost in British pounds for tuition and room are constant, but obviously will waver with the exchange rate. There is also airfare, passports, and various expenses like that which I need to account for. Overall, I'm going to be short a couple thousand dollars :/ 

Before you go thinking I'm a lazy college student, I hold two jobs on campus and have a full-time paid internship when I'm home on breaks. All three of these are being used to help pay for the study abroad opportunity. I'm also pursuing more scholarships and grants while finding ways to reach out to my hometown community. Not leaving any stone unturned, I thought I'd reach out to the community which is most culpable for my procrastination at school. 

I'm not expecting a donation of thousands of dollars or anything. But if you want to help my cause and donate a few bucks, I'd be forever grateful! I'm also open to helping you out in some way to return the favor. This does not mean sexual favors! But you could say that my copying skills are of good value.

I am graduating in fall 2011 with a Bachelor’s in Finance; however I have absolutely no job/internship experience in the field.  Not to get into too much detail, but I work full time at a very odd-schedule job that makes my availability for an internship very difficult.  I need to keep this job though because it pays for school fully, not to mention I am an older student (early 30's) with a mortgage and baby on the way and even a few weeks of no income would be detrimental.   So basically I want to see if there is anyone who is successful in the field that had a similar situation and what you did to make sure you were valuable to employers once you graduated.  Also advice from anyone in the field in general who could offer advice about my predicament or on gaining value to employers would be appreciated.

They sent me into the field to a small rural community for a few days to check out one of the renewable energy centers they've set up. Needless to say, I get stared at A LOT, which I'm still getting used to because its so blatant and people make no attempts to be discreet at all. Mostly because 'everything is different about you' as I was told (I'm a tall, white, left-handed female).

So far they have 3 of these such centers around the state, which they set up by partnering with a local NGO or microfinance institute, and what this particular NGO has accomplished was truly impressive.

Thought people might be interested in what its like in a rural village and trying to set up and scale these sorts of ventures. 70% of India is rural and a large portion don't have access to electricity, and use kerosene or coal instead. 

Also if there's interest in travel related questions, I've spent a large part of the last few years travelling- semester abroad in Sweden, cycled 6000+km across Europe through 15 countries last year (saw a few similar AMAs last week), spent late 2010 in NZ working on an organic vineyard (and experienced aftershocks while visiting a uni roommate in Christchurch only a few days after the first earthquake - hes still alive after the second one).

I'm spending tens of thousands of dollars a year to obtain a B.S. degree and will be in debt due to student loans after I graduate.  I guess my point is, what separates those that have a degree in college with those who are self taught with no education past high school?  


I understand employees recognize people with degrees more but this is another one of my points - all I will be doing for the rest of my life is working and for the first several years of my life to pay back those loans and another kicker is no one *guaranteed* me a job coming out of college.  Most employees want people with experience and I will have none coming out of college besides and internship.  I will end up spending years of my life paying back for the education I've received while working.  After I'm out of debt, I will continue to work most likely for the remaining part of my life (because everyone knows I will never see a cent of Social Security money).  So how do you justify going to college?

I fucked up my freshman year in highschool, I had just moved to a new town and spent most of my time trying to be social and meeting new people instead of paying attention in my classes. This sort of spiraled and I ended up fucking up my GPA for that year (ended up with a 2.4...yeah I know, ouch).

Since then, I have gotten my shit together and the GPA's for the rest of my highschool career (so far) have been 3.3-3.7. I am a junior olympian athlete for water polo (a 'highly' sought after sport for colleges, i am told). Have had a couple of internships, and won a stand-up contest.

Basically post-freshman year I have done very well for myself, yet my GPA is still a 3.15. Is there any chance this wont come back and screw me over? Will a college see how much more I have matured / have to offer? Or will they see the low 3.x GPA and send my letter of rejection with priority mail.

While I know some colleges would be happy to accept a low 3.x GPA, I am talking about the ones people really want to go to. UC, Colgate, Miami, the top dogs. I do not really want to go to an 'Ivy' League school (although I have met the Yale water polo coach and he said there might be a place for me on the team, if I did well (oops!).

Applicants must rank sites where they are interested in training, and a computer algorithm calculates matches between programs and applicants. Today is the 'match day' where the thousands of applicants find out the results of the computerized match.

It is a competitive process and many very qualified applicants do not match due to a discrepancy between the applicant pool and the available positions.

fscmv,1,2011-02-25,A treatise on the state of American Theater...,[deleted],theater,https://www.reddit.com/r/theater/comments/fscmv/a_treatise_on_the_state_of_american_theater/,"I graduated three years ago with a degree in playwriting. I work in a kitchen to pay the bills and manage time to write two to four days a week. Less than I'd like, but some. I'm working now on my fifth full-length play in as many years. None have undergone full-scare production; some have enjoyed staged readings or have won small writing contests.

All of my little money goes to seeing theater, printing scripts, submitting to contests and festivals, applying to various programs and general resume- and experience-building footwork. I love it, even wrought with anxiety as I tend to be, in large part, I think, because I'm in the habit of taking risks that make me feel alive. I believe good theater is kindred to a good life in that both are risk, and are born of risk. Edward Albee has said that, ""most people aren't actually alive."" I'm in a camp that believes that risk emboldens and enriches as it resists that which is safe and ordinary and rotting under the surface. But I digress...

In a recent conversation with a playwright-friend and mentor it was stated to me that the average age of the American theatergoer is in the sixty-somethings. While I was unable to find support for this claim in a quick search online, I did discover a somewhat-recent article that lists off more than a few discomfiting statistics on Broadway theater. (No such luck finding numbers on the greater American theater or theater at large.) See [here](http://andrewasnes.typepad.com/theater_advisor/2010/12/audience-demographics-statistics-highlights-for-the-2009-2010-broadway-season.html).

Figures of particular interest to me:
The average age of the Broadway theatergoer is 47.9 years. Not spring chickens.
Caucasians buy 75 percent of tickets.
77 percent of theatergoers 25 or older have college degrees.
The annual household income of the average theatergoer is $200,700

To drive the point home, to begin to shine light on the development of a trend, [here](http://books.google.com/books?id=xvGhQoNT27IC&amp;pg=PA867&amp;lpg=PA867&amp;dq=average+age+theater+goer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sV-b_XAbQT&amp;sig=ULkGWdoVQhjACAxhh0asvlINCU8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HAZnTbiZH4i4sQOdy-2mBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=average%20age%20theater%20goer&amp;f=false)'s writing from 2004 on the same subject. 

Looking at these numbers side-by-side it becomes clear that theater is attended to a staggeringly large degree by rich old white people. And they're getting older. I've seen more than a few ""youth discounts"" at LORT theaters for people as old as twenty-five years. That's crazy! Since when is twenty-five ""youth!?""

A former playwriting professor once said to me that, ""No one will ask you to write a play any time soon."" With a few years of trying my hand in the world of professional theater I've discovered that, so far, he's proven to've been on to something. Unless you're Tom Stoppard or David Mamet or Maria Irene Fornes--one with umpteen credentials and a name that sells tickets--the fact remains clear that there are already hundreds of great plays by people who are now dead, many of which don't cost royalties to stage, many of which have proven to keep turnstiles clicking and butts in seats.

But that's changing.

We seem to've erringly bought into a culture in the dramatic world in which things aren't perceived as viable unless they're backed by lots of money and made exciting and sexy by spectacle. Let me respond to this notion first by saying that if, say, your movie doesn't hold water without the hour-long helicopter fight, the script itself is probably, at it's core, crap. Indeed, some of the worst plays I've ever seen have been at notable, high-tier theaters, including plays Broadway; this I call ""gelding theater."" In none of these cases did I leave the space thinking ""could've used more spectacle."" Inversely, some of the best theater I've seen has been in people's garages, found spaces, community theaters, on college campuses, in living rooms. Do I have an especial taste for no-fi work? Again, no. Among reasons, one might be that these productions were not encumbered by the weight of someone else's investment, and so the possibility and beauty of RISK remained vibrant in them. They were virile productions, those, in which risk paid dividends.

To go back to the piece from 2004, on theater's current state of affairs, ""Most Broadway offerings are long-running musicals or revivals of old stage plays and musicals."" I'd noticed that. So to the world of professional theater I issue the following suggestions:

Young people are different today than ever before. Attention spans have changed with changing technologies and interests. Constitutions, fortitudes and stomachs for various topics have changed--we are not easily driven to shock or repulsion, nor are we easily driven to empathy or to take personal stake in the hardships or successes of others. Nor do we harbor many nostalgic feelings for antiquity. Nor do we have patience for being condescended-to by an overly-acedemic, insular community.

What's going to change all this?

Shall we continue to remount Cats and The Tempest and Streetcar? Maybe we could spice it up with some frontal nudity in the second act or consider having our heroin fly out over the audience in a harness as they trickle into the foyer for intermission? Maybe then young people will care? No. These are cosmetic changes, like the helicopter in the Michael Bay movie described above, that lack any substantial value.

We need new work by new writers directed by new directors. It's not that the present guard has done a terrible job. In many ways it hasn't. It's not that we don't need to learn the history of drama. I'd be among the first to assert that we do. But the present guard has proven ineffectual in making theater compelling for the next generation, which is being stifled and muffled in a time we'd be served to have it's creativity in blossom, encouraged. What's more, we need not to write and produce for the wealthy and the educated, performances only the wealthy can afford to attend, the educated feeling fancy with their esoteric thoughts and criticisms which they presumably share over wine after the show, which I might serve them by hand working late on a saturday night.

So here's my plea:

I can't get anyone to read my scripts. It's not that they suck. Maybe they suck. Maybe they're amazing. Nobody would know because nobody has read them. And I don't think it's that I'm impossible to be around or work with; I think it's a phenomena. I note that none of the dozens of aspiring theater artists with whom I graduated are working in the theater. A couple are in graduate school, a couple have had internships of various kinds, many have self-produced (myself included), but it's all been in spite and against the grain of the influences of the industry to which we've endeavored to ingratiate ourselves. Nobody's picking up the phone as they bide their time and energies doing safe theater. Safe theater is dead theater. That's why the theater is dying. It's not that shows aren't going up. They are. Dead shows. Shows by dead men about yesterday, produced with caution for an ever-aging audience. It's weak, lacking innovation, style, cleverness, bravery. This isn't to say that good work isn't going up in big houses. It's to note that most work isn't, and that the problem has become a pervasive one. I should make a button that reads, ""Risk a bad review! Produce something new!""

On that subject:

I know most theaters lack sufficient resources to be able to accept unsolicited scripts. But they need to find a way. Because the best would-be voices of tomorrow are not necessarily the best networkers, the best at applying for government grants or living proximate to big theaters. But they might be writing or thinking very well. I reiterate: Theaters, if you care about the long-term livelihood of your medium, or if you care about the cultivation of a worthwhile discourse, you need to cut the song and dance and read unsolicited scripts. Maybe you could forward submitted scripts to volunteer readers. Call it a ""satellite internship program"" or something. Have your readers send their top two favorite scripts to an organizer with short write-ups. You could do all of this online. Have the best scripts read by a panel of astute readers and then, dammit, produce a new work or two; that's what matters. Produce a new work or two by a writer or two you haven't met and don't know. Produce a work that's ambitious and courageous and aims high. Take a risk! There would be such integrity in that! Maybe try out a young director, fresh out of college? Your whole season doesn't have to hinge on the success of it. Have it come up on for a two-night run on a monday and tuesday and bill it in such a way that portrays spirit, energy, gusto, risk. You know? I admire Thornton Wilder but I'd see these new plays over another production of THE SKIN OF OUR TEETH any day of the week, as would most of my peers. Make it an affordable show. Please think about it.

To put my money where my mouth is: I volunteer to be your first reader. No charge or strings. Put me to work. I'll read a dozen scripts a week and write a review on each, even working full-time as I am. Innumerable university theater students would chomp at the bit to do the same for you. Resources abound.

When the present guard retires and dies, who will be there to keep American theater pertinent and moving forward with works that matter? Who will have had the experience or the training to do so? The best, or at least the most stubborn of us, will still be around, if poor and bitter. The rest will not. Or maybe theater has outworn its usefulness all together, and would do just as well to be buried with its current stewards? Either way, I for one, care, and would be delighted to learn that one or two of y'all care as well.

Whatcha think?

Hey everyone!

I am dipping out of Med School and going to field finance. Why? For several reasons. My family has always been in business, it's in my blood, the way I think and appraise property when I'm walking down a street in Manhattan. I have been always working on the side with them, so I highlighted that in my resume and back the science stuff in the back. But I feel, this has given me an opportunity to read complex scientific articles and extract only useful information, think critically, and solve unique problems. I feel my negotiating skills, charisma, among others will definitely be an asset to any firm I join but there a huge roadblock...

How do I get my foot in the door? 

**PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF I'M THE WRONG TRACK, THANKS :)**

I am open and all entry-level positions and found out some pros and cons working with a big or small firm. Big firms have money for training program so I will have a strong foundation enforced by people who push me harder. Smaller firms will offer quicker upper mobility, more hands-on training and much more exposure in comparison to a bigger firm. 

But if I really want to work with a larger firm, but it's really hard to get in, by my understanding. I guess I'm asking how do I become an analyst? Do I need to work at a small firm first for 8-9 mo. then transfer to a larger firm? How do you know there is an opening in a other firm? 

**It's late and I'm going to pass out, super tired. I know there's ton of sp. mistakes and grammatical errors. I want to add more information and clean this up. But I hope someone can give me a push in the right direction! Thanks for listening**

**EDIT 1: Thank you everyone for getting back to me. Ok some obvious stuff, I forgot to mention. I majored in Biology and minored in Economics. Also, yes finance is an extremely broad topic. I would love to do a summer internship anywhere, somewhere I can get my feet wet and acquire a taste of varying topics. What I am specifically interested is in something along S&amp;T (Sales and Trading). I am about a year deep in my education, but I do not foresee a future in this at least for me.** I hope this helps driving a stronger decision. I have read over and most of the consensus is suggesting just get into a good b-school and that should jumpstart my career, right? "

fsbk0,14,2011-02-24,I need help fighting a ridiculous Rogers cell phone bill,johnwalkr,canada,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/fsbk0/i_need_help_fighting_a_ridiculous_rogers_cell/,"In October of 2010, I upgraded to an iphone4 after weeks of trying to get one. This extended my contract to three years. I though carefully about this because...

At the end of October I moved to Japan for an internship. Sometime in November I called Rogers and cancelled my contract. This cost $400 plus 30 days of service from the day that I cancelled. This was understood by me previously and I paid the bill in full as soon as I got it.

In the meantime, I waited for a way to unlock my iPhone so I could use it in Japan. In early January, I found out that Rogers was offering unlocks to people will phones paid in full for $50. I fell in this category and called them.

After about 2 hours on hold and being passed around various departments, it was determined by the ""unlocking department"" that I could not use a credit card to pay $50 to have my phone unlocked because my account had been deactivated. Note the word account  was used by Rogers. Another department offered to reactivate my account so that I could receive a bill for $50. I accepted this offer and then was transferred back to the unlocking department and it was unlocked without hassle. At no point was I told that activating my account had any other purpose aside from sending me a $50 bill, and was not informed of any changes to my contract or state of service. The word ""account"" was always used, ""activating my number"" was never used. My understanding was that ""account"" is not a synonym for ""service"" or ""phone number"". After all, you can have more than one phone number in one account.

I informed Rogers of my situation, living in a different country, and intent on using the phone with SoftBank, a Japanese provider.

Yesterday I received a bill by email for approximately $130. It is for 1 month of service plus the $50 unlock fee. I have not used my Rogers sim card since arriving in Japan, so until this bill I had no idea of any Rogers services that were active.

I emailed Rogers to have the service charges reversed, and explained the situation, the fact that I live in Japan and my previous call to have the phone unlocked. The reply was that I had to call back. They gave me a number with a 416 area code and informed me it would be long distance while ""traveling in Japan"".

I called them yesterday and was told that it was policy that I had to have an ""account and service in good standing"" in order to be unlocked, and was rudely told that I should have known my service and number would be reactivated, as it was the only way that it was possible to unlock the phone.

I tried to explain that this was absurd, because I specifically said that I wanted an unlocked phone to use in a different country with a different provider, and that I would not be in Canada in the near future, and would not need Canadian service. I asked them if they understood why I was confused that my number and service was started again and was told there was nothing I could do. Since Rogers policy is that I need to have a plan to unlock the phone, I would have to pay the current bill and re-cancel, incurring an extra 30 days charges from now.

At this point I was informed that when I unlocked my phone, the following happened:

* 
My $400 cancellation fee was returned to my account
* 
My account was reactivated
* 
A $50 fee was added for unlock
* 
My number was reactivated and monthly plan reinstated
* 
My 3 year contract was renewed

All I was ever informed of previously was:

* 
Account would be reactivated
* 
$50 charge would be billed to me

I talked to a manager, and she repeated Rogers policy and would not discuss reversing any charges. I asked her if she understood why I was confused at why things happened that I did not agree to. She would not respond to this question and offered to cancel my contract again. She stated this would take back the $400 charge in my account, and take effect in 30 days. I said that ""I certainly don't need Canadian service"", not wanting to accidentally agree to any charges.

She stated that I would be billed the $400, current bill, and for 30 days. I stated that I would not pay for the currently billed or any future service. I asked if there was anyone else I could talk to or any other recourse. She replied ""no"". I informed her that I would be seeking legal and other advice and would not be paying anything beyond the $50 unlock fee.

Unfortunately, I paid my previous bills using online banking, not using a credit card, so I have no recourse that way.

What now?

**tl;dr**
I tried to pay Rogers $50 to unlock my completely paid for iPhone 4 after cancelling my service. I agreed to reactivate my account for the purpose of receiving a $50 bill only. I explained that I was in a different country and wanted to use a different service provider, and needed NO Canadian service. The reactivated my account, renewed my contract and started billing for service again. The will not reverse any charges. What do I do?"
fs7m8,5,2011-02-24,"I feel like I really screwed myself over by being a ""punk"" in high school.",[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/fs7m8/i_feel_like_i_really_screwed_myself_over_by_being/,"Reddit, I hope this post doesn't come across as too whiny, but I'm wondering if anybody else has been in my situation, or has some advice for me.  Back in high school I got involved with punk rockers.  I threw my whole life into it.  The culture, music, style.  I really felt like the philosophy ""no life, no future"" rang true for me.  I never imagined growing up, going to college and living a ""real"" life.

It's funny I ended up that way, given the fact that my father was in the computer science industry (he got me into science and reasoning at a young age), I was brought up with excellent opportunities, I had the support of a loving family, and a great childhood. I literally had the world at my feet if I applied myself.  What went wrong?

I went through this phase where I decided ""fuck everything"", rebel, and barely graduate high school.  Then adulthood happened, and I was making ends meet by working a crappy retail job that went nowhere.  All my punk friends now are knocked up (no offense to child bearers, it's just not for me to have kids so young) and work menial positions. Judging by their facebook posts, all they care about is bad grammar and getting wasted.  They're not growing up. 

I feel so different from that.  I'm trying to not sound elitist, but I remember I used to write letters to the editor (at the time, detailing how the imminent Iraq war was a really bad idea and here's why..), got published in the local paper a few times... I'd bring clips of my writing to the punk kids, and they'd laugh at me and blow it off.  There's other examples, but that's something that comes to my mind because it swayed me to not do it anymore.  Intelligence was not a badge of honor.  They were all just a bunch of hipsters. I don't know why I got myself into their culture when it's nothing like who I really am.  I much more identify with the nerd culture.  I feel at home on Reddit.

Anyway, I'm approaching my late 20s and I'm seriously kicking myself over these poor life choices.  You know what, none of these punk people were really my friends. I gained no opportunities by living paycheck to paycheck when I should've been in college, getting connections and internships.  I feel immense regret that I turned myself into the ""black sheep"" of the family because I feel like I have done nothing substantial with my life.

I have no idea why I purposefully chose to lower myself into a lower class lifestyle.  It drives me crazy.  My apologies if this all comes across as super judgmental, but I don't want to censor my personal thoughts on this.

I guess all I can do now is make myself a better person.  I just wonder if anybody else feels like they screwed themselves over and it's really bothering them now, or if you could help me to get over it.

I am doing a study abroad and research internship in Japan and will be finished between 8/1-12/26. I'd love to get back into sailing and I don't have a specific destination port in mind. I have an American passport (born and raised in FL).

I'm 22 and studying nuclear engineering and international business (along with Japanese). My Japanese is good and I can easily be your tour guide and take care of the various forms/procedures while in Japan.

I don't have a ton of experience sailing (been on ~10 weekend trips) but have been around boats all my life. I'm electronically and mechanically minded and also love cooking.  I don't mind helping to clean or doing watch shifts either.

I love learning, traveling, and doing new things. Scuba is a big hobby of mine too.  Once I graduate I plan on moving aboard so I'd really love to have this kind of experience and learn along the way.

Please let me know if I can be of any assistance to your ship!"

Man, we started off poorly. There is no reason we should be together still. She had just left her husband that was abusive. She was my manager. I was a friend that wanted to get her out and making friends and interacting with people. And we started sleeping together. I told her I didn't want a relationship; she didn't want one, either. But she spent the night. And the next. And the next. And we didn't want relationships. But spent every day together.

Months past, and the girl of my dreams was suddenly on a break. I'd pushed her into it. I left the girl I was seeing. She was, at that point, what I called a booty call, but we still never left each other's side. The girl of my dreams went back to her boyfriend, I went back to the booty call. We kept at each other's side. Then dream girl was single. By this point, booty call had developed into girlfriend. I dumped her. Told her I was crazy about the other girl, that she was marriage material. I didn't see that with the current relationship. A day later, I asked her back. A week later, I dumped her again and went on a date with the dream girl. I couldn't do it. Three days later, I was back with the girlfriend.

We had a threesome, and the other girl tried stealing her from me. She was honest the whole time and kept me in the know. Nothing happened. Then we started falling apart again and she cheated on me. It crushed me, tore me apart. And I still gave her a chance again. I buried my pain and despair and isolation and stayed with her because... I don't know. It was easier? She was honest during the whole ordeal and seemed changed?

Then she took an internship a state away. It was less than a year at this point, and yet we decided on distance. Sometimes it was great, sometimes it was horrible. She left her internship and turned down a job offer to move back with me. We started living together after a year and a half.

Then our roommate became a heroin addict. She started working at a job I got her while I bumbled around with side jobs and retail. Our roommate became a heroin addict. She became more and more stressed.

**Now**

She's still working full time, school full-time. The roommate is clean and may be moving out. Her stress is down, but she's getting afraid that she's not ready for a real relationship. Going straight from the marriage to me meant she skipped the dating scene. She married young. She loves me and thinks of me as her best friend, but has this fear that she's missing out on dating.

I have a real job, but she's heading back out of state for the internship, and if they offer her a job again, she's taking it. I had decided to move down with her, which scares me shitless.

I'm crazy about her and want to go for broke right now. But if she doesn't know where she's going with wanting other dating experience, I don't think I can move with her.

Our two-year is in April, and we've been all over the place. We've been through a ton, and we're finally getting to a happy point, which makes it seem so frustrating that this is where we're closest to breaking up.

I'm just being supportive of her and letting her work through this. We're trying to communicate as much as possible and be honest with each other. It frustrates me to no end, but when we're happy, we're the happiest we've been in life. She's my best friend and I'm hers. We love each other, but sometimes that's not enough. 

I want to stick with this, but I also don't want to get hurt any more than I already will. We fucked up and made it through it, we're fighting to get a successful life for ourselves, and we're both pretty scared that this could be the relationship that we stay in for life.

Ultimately I know that her fears are ones that only she can get over. Are there ways I can be supportive? Is this something that can be overcome? 

I'm trying to stay with this; I'm trying to be supportive and caring. But it's scary as shit knowing that everything might fade away and I could lose someone so important to me."

On average once or twice a month for about four days. Everytime he went away I felt a little sad but I kept it to myself. I know that he loves going on business trips and the last thing I want is to make him feel bad about having fun on his trips. The problem is that I could not stop myself from feeling sad. I sometimes feel it is silly to be upset about stuff like this because it's not like he's taking a long trip and I'll be seeing him soon. 
I was wondering if anybody else feels the same way about their SO when they are leaving for short times. 
Another thing is I don't like being so emotionally dependent on him. I am always an independent person and take care of myself. I have many hobbies that don't involve him. But lately I feel that I have a need to see him everyday, which is why I went over to his place every night after school. (We live about ten minutes apart in the city) 
I thought about not going to his place so often to get my old self back, but it was a lot more difficult than I thought. 
Please help. I really don't want to feel this way. I'm already distracting myself with focusing on school and looking for summer internships. I guess I'm looking for advice and moral support on regaining my emotional independence. "

In the end, I wonder ... Naturally I would prefer traveling, but I do care about my career. Once I finished my Master, would some employeers consider it as ""slack"" to use my summer traveling, and would have prefered an internship instead?

I love what I'm doing, I can definitely see myself teaching or working within the field of education for the rest of my life, no question.  HOWEVER, I think the unpaid internship is BS....I'm calling BS right now.  I have taken over as the primary teacher in all class blocks.  I am doing my own planning, grading, assessments, etc.  I am in the building from 7am until almost 5pm every day.  My exhausted ass is in bed by 9 every night.  I play trumpet in my University's pep band which means I am usually busy on the weekends.  

Basically, I don't have time for a second job...

I'm not asking for my internship to pay me half a teacher salary, or even minimum wage... It is just frustrating to me that I drive 200 miles a week yet I am barely able to earn enough money to pay for gas.  And with gas prices rising, money is just going to add to the stressful life of intern teaching....

**TL;DR:** Yup, I vented.  I wish unpaid internships would at the very least reimburse gas...

**EDIT:** Thanks for all the support, everyone!  I know that the internship is just part of the process to becoming a teacher and that everyone else has gone through this as well.  I'm treating my internship as a job, and I love my job! I can't wait until I start getting paid to do this! =D

**EDIT 2:** Playing in the pep band is a quasi-second job.  We get $20/game. There aren't enough games for the money to serve as a real income though.  When I signed up and committed to pep band, I had no idea how busy I would be with student teaching and I assumed that I would be able to work enough hours at the restaurant I work at.  I found out that I just don't have the time to do student teaching, pep band, and work.  I can't re-neg on my commitment to pep band until after the season is over so I'm stuck for the next few weeks... "

The job is basically to start and manage a local branch of College Work's painting business. From the company's description, I will be handling mostly marketing, sales, and management/hiring of employees. I've been reading up on this company a lot online. I want to say that, at this point, I'm convinced enough that it's not a scam that I'm willing to give it a try. Of course there's no way to be sure with a company like this, but I feel like it's the kind of thing that is not suited for 95% of people and it will take absolutely everything I have to actually make money on it, but whether I make money or not I will be able to take something positive from the experience. I fully expect this to be the most difficult thing I've ever done. 

I'd like to hear any and all experience you have had with this company. If they painted your house, tell me what they did right or wrong. If you were an intern, tell me how it was and what you thought of the experience. Did you think it was a scam, did you think it was something that some people could make money at but it wasn't for you, or did you do really well with it? Even if you quit halfway through or didn't end up making money, did you learn something worth learning from it? Most importantly, if you handle hiring for your company (especially for entry level positions) and you've come across someone with this on their resume, did it impress you? Did the applicant impress you? Would you recommend I do this, or would you recommend I seek a more traditional internship?

I never made a single mistake, even as an Intern, yet 1 month after I started full-time, they laid me off. After losing my job, I lost everything one by one, my education being the last to go.  A year later, me and my best-friend decided that something had to be done.  So we sold everything we owned, and bought an old beat-up motor-home, put the bare minimum of work into it, and started living full time on the road. We sell things we get at yard sales, we do odd jobs, whatever it takes. It's never easy but its always fun.  

That is until the motor-home broke down, after traveling to only 2 states. I had no choice but to be a burden on my family for the Winter until I can figure out what to do next.  The motor-home is broke down in Missouri, and we are staying in Michigan.  I'm not exactly sure whats wrong with it, or how much its going to be to get fixed, but I do know one thing.

Traveling is both of our dreams. We dont want to wait until we are 90 years old to experience the country/world.  We are both intelligent people, and I think traveling the country would make us even wiser.  

Currently, I am trying to start an online retail business, and my best-friend is trying to start a business as well.  We want to help young people like ourselves to be able to afford to live their dreams, and not work their whole lives to get there.

We have to get there ourselves in the meantime.

This is a day I have been dreaming of.  There is only one problem; I do not have any money, I have not been able to get a job, and as of right now, I'll have to pay an insane amount for tuition and I'm afraid I won't be able to go.

On the flip side, I received a full scholarship to an art school in Chicago (I plan on going to school for printmaking or graphic design) including room and board.  This school also offers internship programs and they have a fantastic job placement ratio.  The problem is I really want to live in California and always have since I was a little kid.

I honestly am not sure what to do and I am turning to you guys for help, advice...has anyone had the same problem?  How can I make sure I go where I want and won't be in debt for the rest of my life?  Anyways, thanks in advance fellow redditors. -skikles

[edit:] I agree with everyone that going to school for free is the best choice but say I were to go to California anyways.  How would you suggest paying for it (how and where to get a job) and what would you suggest as for housing and such."
ful8y,2,2011-02-28,I don't know what to do after college.,sorrybutwrong,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/ful8y/i_dont_know_what_to_do_after_college/,"I'm a sophomore, physics and math double major with an on-going internship that I've been doing for about a year, a lab position I've been working in my off hours with the university, and I'm also in the honors program for mathematics and the accelerated physics program.

I want to give something to my community; money is not my highest priority albeit a priority.  Overall, what I can't decide between, and why I ask you reddit, is: going to graduate school and getting a PhD; going into industry after I graduate; or becoming a high school teacher.  The PhD has always been my primary plan, but the length of time and amount of money weigh heavily on my commitment to it.  The internship that I've had has been a really worthwhile experience and they have every intention of keeping me, it's given me a great counterpoint to my academic work.  Yet I love to teach and I've tutored for the last two years off and on again.  Without my first high school physics teacher I would never have even gone to college; he was a tremendous influence and I'd love to do that as well.  

Am I just being naive?  Is this just me being young and confused about what I should do? I guess what I'm most worried about is putting in the time commitment to rise in a company or get that PhD and not really enjoy what I'm doing.  Any advice?"

1. I'm currently a 2nd year at uni and my GPA right *now* is a cumulative 3.448. After this term, thanks to some poor decisions and busy, busy schedules I expect my GPA to drop to about 3.3~ cumulative. I have two years to go until I graduate and I plan on getting my GPA to at LEAST 3.5 to be competitive. The problem is I've been advised countless times not to get C's at all, but it looks like this term I'll be getting a golden TWO on my transcript! How serious is it? Are my chances significantly worsened by having C's but being able to maintain an *okay* GPA?

2. When is the best time to start interning, shadowing a doctor, researching, or doing clinical work? I am currently searching for research opportunities and might have something lined up for that, but I really want to get some hands on experience in the field.

3. What is the difference between attending a medical school in the US, Europe, Canada, or even the Carribeans? I know the Carribeans can be like the JC of medical schools, but are Canadian medical schools or even European medical schools easier to get into?

4. What can I do to help my GPA not look so shitty? Besides doing better in my future courses is there any other things I can do to improve my application? I have research on the way, am looking into an internship at a local hospital, and plan on reapplying for a position on a student run clinic. I'm also pledging a fraternity and in a leadership position here on campus for an extracurricular club, if that means anything.

5. I'm planning on taking anywhere from 1-4 years off after I graduate to teach English in a foreign country. Is this a good idea? I figure spending a couple years in a foreign country working and possibly volunteering at hospitals wouldn't hurt. Do medical schools have more leniency on GPA for people that have taken time off or would I still be in the same situation if I hadn't taken time off?

Thanks so much in advance! I really appreciate any help :)"

[mechancal engineer/intern],[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fuk43/how_to_improve_phone_interview_mechancal/,"So I am a sophomore mechanical engineering student and I just got my first opportunity at a mechanical engineering internship. The company (Cummins) wants to have a phone interview with me later this week. 

The Cummins interview process consists of three steps. The first step is a phone interview with a member of the recruiting team. The second step is a phone interview with a hiring manager about a specific job opportunity within their department. The third and final step is attending an Open House event at one of our locations to get better acquainted with our company and team.

Is this the kid of stuff they will be asking? why do you want this job; what do you know about our company; how are you experienced to work for us; what is your background; tell us something you did that was really great.

What are some things I can do to improve my phone interview? I know when I interviewed people for an organization I am a part of, what really impressed me is when they asked ME questions.

I'm currently in my first semester of community college as a 21 year old (went to med school in India, wasn't for me) and I was wondering if anyone had any advice relating to my academic path. 

I really want to be a part of the rise in popularity of soccer in the united states and would love a job with an MLS team, preferably the Chicago Fire since I'm a Chicago native. 

I have yet to pick a major because I want to wait and see which one will be the most useful for a job with a sports team. 

Should I go marketing? Should I go computer science? Should I go administration/management? Finance/Econ? I would love to be a part of the team operations but I'm pretty sure its the hardest to join.

I looked at some of the available internships but I cant really apply until I have some relevant classes under my belt. So maybe I'll be ready in about a year?

Interest wise I can do marketing as its a strong suite. Computer Science is what I'm on the path for but my math skills aren't too good. Management I guess is good but if I fail to get into sports, I wont be left with many other options with a management major. 

I'm planning on asking the college's soccer team's coach if I could apply for an internship with him for more experience too."

I'm just bitter that PhDs aren't for learning, apparently you need training beforehand. The guy who's now doing my work has been trained by other people to do this stuff, apparently. He's doing way better than I am, but I'm guessing that working with experienced people in the field helped. He did an internship before coming here. I guess I should have done the same. Silly me, thinking I'd get training out of this."

fu0rw,12,2011-02-27,Need advice please (going to graduate soon w/ B.S. in EE w/ 0 experience and very concerned),TWSW,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/fu0rw/need_advice_please_going_to_graduate_soon_w_bs_in/,"I'm a senior EE student at Stanford struggling to see some positive light in the future. You can read a more complete background story in my SuicideWatch post if helpful: http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fq8u3/i_cant_see_anything_positive_in_the_near_future/

So, I'm trying to take it one step at a time, focusing on the more time-sensitive matter first (post-graduation plans). I'm about to graduate soon, but I don't have any prospects in the near future as far as careers are concerned. I have 0 research &amp; internship experience. I don't know any professors either, so I have nobody to write me any sort of letter of recommendation. My GPA is not low, but it's not exactly the highest either.

After graduation I really do not want to be forced to go home (due to no job) for a multitude of reasons. On the less personal side, home is 2 hours east, so far away from Silicon Valley and not convenient if I'm trying to get/interview for an EE job/internship (I also don't own a car).

The problem is that I don't see how in the world I will end up with a job/internship compared to my competitors. I know about the background of the people that are applying to the same jobs/internships I am (extensive research experience, previous internships, incredibly high/perfect GPAs...), and I can't hold a candle to them. 

I know it's hard to get an EE job with only a B.S. (I couldn't go for the Master's since I had 0 research/internship experience and wouldn't have 1 person to write me a letter of recommendation, let alone the 3 that I see universities requiring...), but it's made worse that I'm so under-qualified (and it seems like everybody is applying for the same jobs...).

I honestly can't see myself getting a full time job or internship over my competitors. When I think about the hiring process, it really does seem nearly impossible for me to get a job/internship considering my lack of experience (and considering the experience of those I'm competing against). I mean...it's hard enough to even get that first brief interview, let alone make it to the second round for that all-day interview...and then I STILL have to come out on top for that one to get the offer! 

It's such a long road with the odds stacked against me, that I feel like just saying screw it and killing myself (I mean, I still have to find a way to deal with the loneliness of not being close with family, having little friends, and never having had a girlfriend). I have considered alternatives like the Peace Corps to take some time off, but I also need letters of recommendation for that...

Any advice or suggestions would be immensely appreciated. "
